## Attack Tree Path: [Impersonate User via SASL Weakness](./attack_tree_paths/impersonate_user_via_sasl_weakness.md)

*   **Path:** `[Root] ---> [1. Impersonate User] ---> [1.1 SASL Weakness] ---> [1.1.1 Weak SASL Mechanism]`
*   **Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the authentication process. The attacker leverages a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) implementation to gain the credentials of a legitimate user.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **[1.1.1 Weak SASL Mechanism]:**
        *   The application or framework is configured to use a weak SASL mechanism (e.g., `PLAIN` without TLS, or a vulnerable custom mechanism).
        *   The attacker can potentially sniff credentials transmitted in plain text (if TLS is not enforced) or exploit known vulnerabilities in the chosen mechanism.
        *   Examples:
            *   If `PLAIN` is used without TLS, the attacker can use a network sniffer to capture the username and password.
            *   If a custom, flawed SASL mechanism is used, the attacker might exploit a cryptographic weakness or implementation bug.
*   **Criticality:** High. Successful impersonation grants the attacker full access to the compromised user's account, allowing them to send and receive messages, access contacts, and potentially perform other actions as that user.
* **Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce the use of strong SASL mechanisms (e.g., `SCRAM-SHA-256`, `SCRAM-SHA-1` with channel binding).
    *   Mandatory use of TLS encryption for all XMPP connections.
    *   Disable weak or custom SASL mechanisms.
    *   Regularly review and update the framework and its dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Connection Flood)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__connection_flood_.md)

*   **Path 1:** `[Root] ---> [2. Denial of Service] ---> [2.1 Resource Exhaustion] ---> [2.1.1 Connection Flood]`
*   **Description:** This attack aims to make the XMPP service unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming the server or client with connection requests.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **[2.1.1 Connection Flood]:**
        *   The attacker opens a large number of XMPP connections to the server (or client, if attacking a client-side component).
        *   This consumes server resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory, CPU) and prevents legitimate users from establishing connections.
        *   The framework might be vulnerable if it doesn't handle connection limits or timeouts properly.
*   **Criticality:** Medium to High. While not resulting in data breaches, DoS attacks can significantly disrupt service and cause reputational damage.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Implement connection rate limiting on both the client and server.
    * Configure appropriate connection timeouts.
    * Monitor server resource usage and set alerts for unusual activity.
    * Use a robust network infrastructure that can handle a large number of connections.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (CPU Exhaustion)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__cpu_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Path 2:** `[Root] ---> [2. Denial of Service] ---> [2.1 Resource Exhaustion] ---> [2.1.3 CPU Exhaustion (XML Parsing)]`
*   **Description:** This attack exploits vulnerabilities in the XML parsing process to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **[2.1.3 CPU Exhaustion (XML Parsing)]:**
        *   The attacker sends specially crafted XMPP stanzas containing large or deeply nested XML documents.
        *   The XML parser consumes excessive CPU resources while processing these malicious stanzas.
        *   This can slow down or completely halt the XMPP service.
*   **Criticality:** Medium to High. Similar to connection floods, this can disrupt service availability.
* **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a secure and robust XML parser that is resistant to XML bomb attacks and other parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement limits on the size and nesting depth of XML documents processed by the framework.
    *   Regularly update the XML parser library to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a non-recursive XML parser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Message Interception (TLS Stripping)](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_message_interception__tls_stripping_.md)

*   **Path:** `[Root] ---> [3. Information Disclosure] ---> [3.2 Message Interception] ---> [3.2.1 TLS Stripping]`
*   **Description:** This attack aims to intercept XMPP messages by downgrading the connection from secure TLS to unencrypted plaintext.
*   **Steps:**
    *   **[3.2.1 TLS Stripping]:**
        *   The attacker performs a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, positioning themselves between the client and the server.
        *   The attacker intercepts the initial connection negotiation and prevents the establishment of a secure TLS connection.
        *   The client and server then communicate in plaintext, allowing the attacker to read all transmitted messages.
*   **Criticality:** High. This attack compromises the confidentiality of all XMPP communications, exposing sensitive information.
* **Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce mandatory TLS encryption for all XMPP connections.
    *   The framework should refuse to connect without TLS.
    *   Implement strict server certificate validation. The framework should verify the certificate's validity, chain of trust, and hostname.
    *   Educate users about the importance of using secure networks and avoiding public Wi-Fi without a VPN.
    *   Consider using DNSSEC and DANE to further secure the TLS handshake.
