# BUSINESS POSTURE

The XMPPFramework is an Objective-C library for implementing the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). The primary business goal for projects utilizing XMPPFramework is to enable real-time communication and presence features within their applications. This can range from instant messaging and chat applications to real-time collaboration tools and Internet of Things (IoT) communication.

Business Priorities:
- Reliable and efficient real-time communication: Ensuring messages are delivered promptly and reliably is crucial for user experience and application functionality.
- Secure communication: Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of communication is paramount, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
- Scalability: The solution should be able to handle a growing number of users and messages without performance degradation.
- Interoperability: Adherence to the XMPP standard ensures compatibility with other XMPP-compliant systems and services.
- Ease of integration: The library should be easy to integrate into existing and new projects, reducing development time and effort.

Business Risks:
- Data breaches: Compromise of communication data due to vulnerabilities in the application or the library.
- Service disruption: Denial of service attacks or system failures that prevent real-time communication.
- Privacy violations: Improper handling of user data and communication metadata, leading to privacy breaches.
- Compliance issues: Failure to meet regulatory requirements related to data security and privacy, depending on the application's domain (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Reputation damage: Security incidents or privacy breaches can severely damage the reputation of the organization using the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

```

Build Process Description:
1. Developer makes code changes and commits them to the Version Control System (GitHub).
2. The CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes.
3. Build stage: The code is compiled and linked to create the library binary.
4. Static Analysis: SAST tools and linters are used to automatically scan the code for potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
5. Unit Tests: Automated unit tests are executed to ensure the code functions as expected and to catch regressions.
6. Artifact Creation: If all checks pass, the library binary artifact is created.
7. Artifact Storage: The build artifact (library binary) is stored in Artifact Storage (e.g., GitHub Releases, package registry).
8. Application Developer (Library Consumer) can then download and integrate the library into their applications.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Version Control (GitHub): Code changes are tracked and auditable, enabling traceability and rollback.
- security control: CI/CD System (GitHub Actions): Automates the build process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
- security control: Static Analysis (SAST, Linters): Automatically detects potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Unit Tests: Ensures code functionality and helps prevent regressions, improving overall code reliability and security.
- security control: Artifact Storage (GitHub Releases): Provides a secure and versioned repository for build artifacts.
- security control: Code Review: While not explicitly in the diagram, code review should be a part of the development process before code is merged and built, adding a manual security check.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Scan for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the library.
