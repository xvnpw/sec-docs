**Description:** Even after XMPPFramework processes incoming messages, the application code must still validate and sanitize the data before using it. Failure to do so can lead to application-level vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection.
*   **Exploitation of XMPPFramework:** While not directly exploiting the framework, this highlights a critical security aspect when *using* the framework. The framework delivers data, but the application is responsible for secure handling of that data.
*   **Potential Impact:** SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting (if data is used in web contexts), and other application-level vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always validate and sanitize all data received from XMPP messages at the application level before using it in any operations (database queries, system commands, etc.).**
    *   Apply input validation rules appropriate to the context of data usage.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Avoid directly executing system commands based on user-provided XMPP data.
