# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, cocoaasyncsocket, is an open-source asynchronous socket networking library for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It provides developers with a robust and efficient way to handle network communications in their applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reliable and performant networking library for Apple platforms.
  - Simplify asynchronous socket programming for developers.
  - Offer a feature-rich alternative to Apple's native networking APIs.
  - Maintain an active and supportive open-source community around the library.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities within the library that could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using it.
  - Risk of bugs or instability in the library leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.
  - Risk of lack of maintenance or updates, causing the library to become outdated or incompatible with newer platform versions.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks if dependencies are compromised or malicious code is introduced into the library's codebase or distribution channels.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub for review. Implemented: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub for reporting bugs and potential vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Issues.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security reviews and vulnerability identification.
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security audits or penetration testing.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Introduce dependency scanning to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response policy to handle reported security issues effectively.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate community security audits and code reviews.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: The library itself does not handle authentication directly, as it is a lower-level networking library. Applications using cocoaasyncsocket are responsible for implementing authentication mechanisms appropriate for their use cases on top of the socket connections.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Similar to authentication, authorization is the responsibility of the applications using cocoaasyncsocket. The library should provide mechanisms to facilitate secure communication channels that can be used for authorization processes implemented by applications.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library must perform robust input validation on all data received from network sockets to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, and other injection attacks. This includes validating data formats, lengths, and types.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: While cocoaasyncsocket itself might not implement high-level cryptographic protocols, it should provide support for secure socket layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) to enable applications to establish encrypted communication channels. The library should correctly handle SSL/TLS handshakes and certificate validation if it provides SSL/TLS functionality.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For cocoaasyncsocket as a library, the critical business process is providing reliable and secure networking functionality to applications that depend on it. The success of applications built using this library indirectly depends on the library's quality and security. If the library is compromised, applications using it and their users could be affected.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Data handled by cocoaasyncsocket is network traffic data. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the applications using the library. It could range from publicly accessible data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. Cocoaasyncsocket itself should be designed to handle all network data securely, regardless of its sensitivity, as it is a foundational component for network communication. The primary concern is ensuring the library does not introduce vulnerabilities that could expose data handled by applications using it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended scope of security responsibility for the cocoaasyncsocket project maintainers versus the developers using the library?
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that applications using cocoaasyncsocket might need to adhere to, and how does the library assist or impact these requirements?
  - Are there plans for formal security audits or penetration testing of cocoaasyncsocket in the future?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in cocoaasyncsocket?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and reliable open-source networking library for the Apple ecosystem. Security is a high priority to maintain trust and prevent harm to users of applications built with the library.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are primarily based on open-source community review and issue reporting. There is an opportunity to enhance security posture through automated security testing and a more formalized vulnerability management process.
  - DESIGN: The library is designed to be a modular and efficient networking component. Security considerations are incorporated into the design, particularly around input validation and support for secure communication protocols. The deployment model assumes distribution through common package managers and direct integration into application build processes. The build process is assumed to be automated using CI/CD, offering opportunities to integrate security checks.
