# Threat Model Analysis for robbiehanson/cocoaasyncsocket

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the client and server by positioning themselves on the network path. They can eavesdrop on the data being exchanged and potentially modify it before forwarding it to the intended recipient. This is possible if the application uses `GCDAsyncSocket` or `GCDAsyncUdpSocket` without implementing encryption using the provided `SecureSocket` functionality. The vulnerability lies in the lack of enforced encryption within the core socket components of `CocoaAsyncSocket`.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality (sensitive data is exposed), loss of integrity (data can be altered), potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption.

**Affected Component:** `GCDAsyncSocket`, `GCDAsyncUdpSocket` (when not using `SecureSocket`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement TLS/SSL encryption using the `SecureSocket` functionality provided by `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
* Ensure proper certificate validation (hostname verification, trust chain validation) is implemented when using `SecureSocket` to prevent impersonation.
* Consider using certificate pinning for enhanced security when using `SecureSocket`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of connections to the application using `GCDAsyncSocket`, overwhelming the server's resources (memory, CPU, file descriptors) and preventing legitimate users from connecting or using the service. This directly exploits the connection handling capabilities of `GCDAsyncSocket`.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, leading to service disruption.

**Affected Component:** `GCDAsyncSocket`'s connection accepting and management mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement connection limiting and rate limiting on the server-side, potentially using features of the operating system or network infrastructure in conjunction with how the application uses `GCDAsyncSocket`.
* Properly handle connection timeouts and resource management within the application's `GCDAsyncSocket` delegate methods to release resources from inactive or potentially malicious connections.
