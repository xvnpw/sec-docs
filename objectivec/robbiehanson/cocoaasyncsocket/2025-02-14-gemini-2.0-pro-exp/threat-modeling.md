## Threat: [TLS/SSL Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack via Certificate Validation Bypass](./threats/tlsssl_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_via_certificate_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the TLS/SSL handshake by presenting a forged certificate.  The attacker might use a self-signed certificate, a certificate signed by an untrusted CA, or a valid certificate for a different domain.  If the application's CocoaAsyncSocket implementation doesn't properly validate the certificate within the delegate methods, the attacker can decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt the traffic. This is a *direct misuse* of CocoaAsyncSocket's TLS features.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity of communication.  Sensitive data can be stolen or modified.  The attacker can inject malicious data.
*   **Affected Component:** `GCDAsyncSocket`'s `startTLS:` method and related delegate methods: `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:`, `socket:didConnectToHost:port:`.  Specifically, incorrect or missing implementation of certificate validation within these methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Certificate Validation:** Implement *correct and complete* certificate validation in the `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:` delegate method.  *Never* call the completion handler with `YES` without thorough validation using `SecTrustEvaluateWithError`.
    *   **Check Certificate Chain:** Verify the entire certificate chain up to a trusted root CA.
    *   **Hostname Verification:** Ensure the certificate's CN or SAN matches the expected hostname.
    *   **Certificate Pinning (Strongly Recommended):**  Store a hash of the expected server certificate (or public key) and compare it during the handshake.
    *   **Disable Weak Ciphers:** Configure `GCDAsyncSocket` (via the `sslSettings` dictionary in `startTLS:`) to use only strong cipher suites and TLS versions (TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3).
    *   **Use `kCFStreamSSLValidatesCertificateChain`:** Set to `true` in `sslSettings`.

## Threat: [Data Tampering in Transit (No TLS/SSL)](./threats/data_tampering_in_transit__no_tlsssl_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker on the network path intercepts and modifies data sent over a plain TCP or UDP connection. This occurs when the application *chooses not to use* CocoaAsyncSocket's TLS/DTLS capabilities. This is a direct result of *not* using a core security feature of the library.
*   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity.  The attacker can inject malicious data or corrupt existing data.
*   **Affected Component:** `GCDAsyncSocket` (when *not* using `startTLS:`) and `GCDAsyncUdpSocket` (when *not* using DTLS).  The absence of using the security features.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is transmitted), High (otherwise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use TLS/SSL (TCP):**  *Always* use `GCDAsyncSocket`'s `startTLS:` method with proper certificate validation for TCP connections.
    *   **Use DTLS (UDP):**  *Always* use `GCDAsyncUdpSocket`'s DTLS support for UDP connections when transmitting sensitive data.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Socket Flooding) - *Directly related to CocoaAsyncSocket usage*](./threats/resource_exhaustion__socket_flooding__-_directly_related_to_cocoaasyncsocket_usage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker opens many TCP connections or sends a flood of UDP packets. While resource exhaustion is a general concept, this threat is *directly* related to how the application uses CocoaAsyncSocket to *accept* connections or receive data.  The library provides the *mechanism* for connection/packet handling, and the application's use (or misuse) of this mechanism creates the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Affected Component:** `GCDAsyncSocket` (listening socket, specifically the `acceptOnInterface:port:error:` and related delegate methods) and `GCDAsyncUdpSocket` (receiving data). The core socket listening and receiving functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Limits:** Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections accepted by the `GCDAsyncSocket` listening socket.
    *   **Timeouts:** Use `GCDAsyncSocket`'s `readTimeout` and `writeTimeout` properties on accepted sockets.  Use appropriate timeouts for `GCDAsyncUdpSocket`'s receive operations.
    *   **Rate Limiting (UDP):** Implement rate limiting for incoming UDP packets *in conjunction with* `GCDAsyncUdpSocket`.

## Threat: [Slow Read/Write DoS Attack - *Directly related to CocoaAsyncSocket usage*](./threats/slow_readwrite_dos_attack_-_directly_related_to_cocoaasyncsocket_usage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker establishes a TCP connection but sends/receives data very slowly. This is a direct attack on how the application uses CocoaAsyncSocket's read/write APIs. The vulnerability exists because of how the application *handles* the asynchronous I/O provided by the library.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Affected Component:** `GCDAsyncSocket`'s read and write operations (specifically, the asynchronous delegate methods like `socket:didReadData:withTag:` and `socket:didWriteDataWithTag:`). The core asynchronous I/O handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Read and Write Timeouts:**  *Must* use `GCDAsyncSocket`'s `readTimeout` and `writeTimeout` properties with appropriate values. This is the *primary* defense and directly uses CocoaAsyncSocket's features.
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure all read/write operations are performed asynchronously using CocoaAsyncSocket's delegate methods.

## Threat: [CocoaAsyncSocket Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/cocoaasyncsocket_library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered *within* the CocoaAsyncSocket library itself (e.g., a buffer overflow in the parsing of TLS records). This is a direct threat to the library's code.
*   **Impact:** Varies; could range from DoS to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of `GCDAsyncSocket` or `GCDAsyncUdpSocket`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update CocoaAsyncSocket to the latest version. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Input Validation (Secondary):** While not a direct fix for a library vulnerability, robust input validation *in the application* can sometimes mitigate the impact.
