## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Delegate Method Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_delegate_method_implementation.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement All Delegates:** Ensure *every* delegate method provided by `GCDAsyncSocket` and `GCDAsyncUdpSocket` is implemented. This includes error-handling delegates.
2.  **Robust Error Handling:** Within each delegate method, especially error-related ones (e.g., `socketDidDisconnect:withError:`, `socket:didNotConnect:`, etc.), check for errors returned by `CocoaAsyncSocket`. Log these errors and take appropriate action based on the error (reconnect, close socket, inform user). *Never* silently ignore errors from `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
3.  **Input Re-Validation:** Inside data-receiving delegate methods (`socket:didReadData:withTag:`, `udpSocket:didReceiveData:fromAddress:withFilterContext:`), *re-validate* all data received *through* the `CocoaAsyncSocket` APIs. Assume the data is potentially malicious. Check length, type, and content.
4.  **Thread-Safe State (Related to CocoaAsyncSocket):** If delegate methods access shared resources that are also used in conjunction with `CocoaAsyncSocket` calls (e.g., checking a flag to see if a write should be performed), use synchronization mechanisms (locks, `@synchronized`, dispatch queues) to prevent race conditions.  Understand that `CocoaAsyncSocket` handles its internal threading, but *your* interaction with it and shared data needs to be thread-safe.
5.  **Non-Blocking Delegates:** Keep delegate methods short and fast. Avoid blocking operations. If a long operation is needed as a *result* of a `CocoaAsyncSocket` event, dispatch it to a background queue using GCD.
6.  **Tag Validation:** If using tags to identify asynchronous `CocoaAsyncSocket` operations, validate the tag within the delegate method to ensure it matches the expected tag. This prevents misinterpreting responses.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (Severity: Critical):** Improper input validation in delegate methods can allow attackers to inject malicious code *through* the socket.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Blocking operations in delegate methods can make the application unresponsive, especially the socket handling. Unhandled `CocoaAsyncSocket` errors can lead to resource leaks.
*   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Race conditions related to shared state used with `CocoaAsyncSocket` can corrupt data.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Exposing internal `CocoaAsyncSocket` error details can aid attackers.
*   **Logic Errors (Severity: Variable):** Incorrect state or tag handling related to `CocoaAsyncSocket` calls can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced by re-validating all input within delegate methods that receive data from `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
*   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced by avoiding blocking operations and handling `CocoaAsyncSocket` errors properly.
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk eliminated by using appropriate synchronization for shared state accessed in conjunction with `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced by logging `CocoaAsyncSocket` errors securely.
*   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced by careful state and tag management within `CocoaAsyncSocket` delegate methods.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic delegate methods are implemented.
*   Error logging is present but may not be comprehensive for all `CocoaAsyncSocket` errors.
*   Input validation is present but needs review for re-validation within `CocoaAsyncSocket` delegate methods.
*   Thread safety is partially implemented, but a full audit related to `CocoaAsyncSocket` interactions is needed.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive error handling for all `CocoaAsyncSocket` delegate methods.
*   Re-validation of input within `socket:didReadData:withTag:` and similar methods.
*   Thorough thread-safety audit of code interacting with `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
*   Consistent tag validation in all relevant `CocoaAsyncSocket` delegate methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust TLS/SSL Configuration and Verification (Using CocoaAsyncSocket APIs)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_tlsssl_configuration_and_verification__using_cocoaasyncsocket_apis_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable TLS:** Always use `startTLS:` to initiate a secure connection using `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
2.  **`kCFStreamSSLValidatesCertificateChain`:** In the dictionary passed to `startTLS:`, *ensure* `kCFStreamSSLValidatesCertificateChain` is set to `@YES`.
3.  **`kCFStreamSSLCertificates` (Optional):** If you have specific trusted root certificates, provide them using the `kCFStreamSSLCertificates` key in the `startTLS:` dictionary.
4.  **Implement `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:`:** Implement this *crucial* `CocoaAsyncSocket` delegate method for fine-grained control over certificate validation. This is *essential* for certificate pinning and handling self-signed certificates (if absolutely necessary and with extreme caution).  Within this method, you *must* evaluate the provided `SecTrustRef` and call the `completionHandler` with `YES` to trust the connection or `NO` to reject it.
5.  **Set Strong Cipher Suites:** Use `kCFStreamSSLCipherSuites` in the `startTLS:` dictionary to specify an array of *allowed* cipher suites. Prioritize strong, modern ciphers.
6.  **Enforce TLS Version:** Use `kCFStreamSSLMinimumProtocolVersion` and `kCFStreamSSLMaximumProtocolVersion` in the `startTLS:` dictionary to restrict the allowed TLS versions (at least TLS 1.2, ideally TLS 1.3).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Incorrect TLS configuration in `CocoaAsyncSocket` allows attackers to intercept communication.
*   **Eavesdropping (Severity: Critical):** Without `startTLS:`, communication is in plain text.
*   **Data Tampering (Severity: Critical):** Attackers can modify data in transit without proper TLS configuration in `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
*   **Impersonation (Severity: Critical):** Attackers can impersonate the server if certificate validation within `CocoaAsyncSocket` is weak.

**Impact:**
*   **MitM Attacks:** Risk virtually eliminated with proper certificate validation (including pinning) within the `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:` delegate method.
*   **Eavesdropping:** Risk eliminated by using `startTLS:`.
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk eliminated by using `startTLS:` with a secure configuration.
*   **Impersonation:** Risk significantly reduced by proper certificate validation within `CocoaAsyncSocket`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `startTLS:` is used.
*   `kCFStreamSSLValidatesCertificateChain` is set to `@YES`.
*   A basic implementation of `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:` exists but lacks certificate pinning.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Certificate pinning within `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:`.
*   Explicit strong cipher suite restrictions using `kCFStreamSSLCipherSuites`.
*   Explicit TLS version restrictions using `kCFStreamSSLMinimumProtocolVersion` and `kCFStreamSSLMaximumProtocolVersion`.
*   Enhanced checks (expiration, revocation) within `socket:didReceiveTrust:completionHandler:`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Data Handling and Buffer Management (Using CocoaAsyncSocket Reads)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_data_handling_and_buffer_management__using_cocoaasyncsocket_reads_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Bounded Buffers:** When reading data using `CocoaAsyncSocket` methods, use appropriately sized buffers.
2.  **Length Checks:** Always check the length of data received *from* `CocoaAsyncSocket` before processing.
3.  **Progressive Reading:** For potentially large data, use `CocoaAsyncSocket`'s `readDataToData:withTimeout:tag:` or `readDataToLength:withTimeout:tag:` methods to read data in chunks. Process each chunk as it arrives, rather than attempting to read everything at once using a single, large buffer. This is a direct use of `CocoaAsyncSocket`'s API for safer reading.
4.  **Data Framing (with CocoaAsyncSocket):** Implement a data framing protocol and use `CocoaAsyncSocket`'s read methods to enforce it. For example:
    *   **Length Prefixing:** Use `readDataToLength:withTimeout:tag:` to read the length prefix, then use `readDataToLength:withTimeout:tag:` again to read the message data.
    *   **Delimiters:** Use `readDataToData:withTimeout:tag:` to read until the delimiter is found.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Buffer Overflow (Severity: Critical):** Unbounded reads from `CocoaAsyncSocket` can overwrite memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Reading excessively large amounts of data from `CocoaAsyncSocket` can exhaust memory.
*   **Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Incorrectly handling partial reads or message boundaries from `CocoaAsyncSocket` can lead to data corruption.

**Impact:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Risk virtually eliminated by using bounded buffers and length checks with data read from `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
*   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced by using `CocoaAsyncSocket`'s progressive reading methods.
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced by implementing data framing using `CocoaAsyncSocket`'s read methods.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Fixed-size buffers are used in some places.
*   Basic length checks are present after reading from `CocoaAsyncSocket`.
*   A rudimentary delimiter-based framing protocol is used, but not robustly implemented with `CocoaAsyncSocket`'s methods.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of bounded buffers with all `CocoaAsyncSocket` reads.
*   Progressive reading using `readDataToData:` or `readDataToLength:` is *not* consistently implemented.
*   The data framing protocol needs to be redesigned and implemented using the appropriate `CocoaAsyncSocket` read methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Connection Management (Using CocoaAsyncSocket APIs)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_connection_management__using_cocoaasyncsocket_apis_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Connection Timeouts:** Use `connectToHost:onPort:withTimeout:error:` and specify a reasonable timeout.
2.  **Read/Write Timeouts:** In *all* `CocoaAsyncSocket` read and write operations (e.g., `readDataToData:withTimeout:tag:`, `writeData:withTimeout:tag:`), set appropriate timeouts.
3.  **Graceful Disconnection:** When a socket is no longer needed, call `CocoaAsyncSocket`'s `disconnect` method.
4.  **Handle Disconnections:** Implement the `socketDidDisconnect:withError:` delegate method to handle disconnections reported by `CocoaAsyncSocket`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Lack of timeouts in `CocoaAsyncSocket` calls can lead to the application hanging.
*   **Resource Leaks (Severity: Medium):** Failing to call `disconnect` on `CocoaAsyncSocket` can lead to leaks.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced by setting timeouts in all relevant `CocoaAsyncSocket` methods.
*   **Resource Leaks:** Risk eliminated by calling `disconnect` on `CocoaAsyncSocket`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Connection timeouts are used.
*   Read/write timeouts are *partially* implemented, but not consistently in all `CocoaAsyncSocket` calls.
*   `disconnect` is called in some cases.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of read/write timeouts in *all* `CocoaAsyncSocket` read/write operations.
*   Ensure `disconnect` is *always* called when a `CocoaAsyncSocket` instance is no longer needed.
*   Robust handling of disconnections in the `socketDidDisconnect:withError:` delegate method.
