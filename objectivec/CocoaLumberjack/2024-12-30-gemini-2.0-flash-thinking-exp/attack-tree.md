Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **High-Risk Path: Exploiting Format String Vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input containing format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`, `%s`) that is then used directly in a CocoaLumberjack logging statement without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially executing arbitrary code.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Exploit Format String Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability being exploited.
        * **Insufficient Sanitization of Logged Data:** The underlying weakness that allows the format string vulnerability to be exploitable.
        * **Remote Code Execution:** The ultimate goal achieved through this path.

* **High-Risk Path: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Log Formatters leading to Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses custom log formatters, vulnerabilities within this custom code can be exploited. This could involve format string vulnerabilities within the formatter itself, injection flaws if the formatter processes external data, or other logic errors that allow for code execution or access to sensitive information.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerability in Custom Log Formatters:** The core vulnerability being exploited within the custom code.
        * **Remote Code Execution:** A potential outcome if the formatter vulnerability allows for code execution.
        * **Information Disclosure:** A potential outcome if the formatter vulnerability allows access to sensitive data.

* **High-Risk Path: Log Injection for Information Gathering**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates input fields that are subsequently logged by the application. By crafting specific input, the attacker can inject sensitive information into the logs. If these logs are then accessed by the attacker (or an automated system they control), they can retrieve the injected information.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Log Injection for Information Gathering:** The overall attack strategy.
        * **Lack of Filtering of Sensitive Data Before Logging:** The underlying weakness that allows sensitive data to be logged in the first place.
        * **Information Disclosure:** The goal achieved through this path.

* **High-Risk Path: Denial of Service via Excessive Logging**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers the application to generate an extremely large volume of log messages. This can be achieved by exploiting application logic that leads to verbose logging or by sending malicious input specifically designed to trigger excessive logging. The resulting high volume of log writes can exhaust disk space, consume excessive CPU or I/O resources, and ultimately lead to a denial of service.
    * **Critical Nodes Involved:**
        * **Denial of Service via Excessive Logging:** The overall attack strategy.

**Critical Nodes Breakdown:**

* **Exploit Vulnerability in CocoaLumberjack:** This represents any exploitable flaw within the CocoaLumberjack library itself.
* **Leverage CocoaLumberjack's Functionality for Malicious Purposes:** This encompasses attacks that misuse the intended features of the logging framework.
* **Exploit Format String Vulnerability:** A specific type of vulnerability that allows for arbitrary memory access and potential code execution.
* **Insufficient Sanitization of Logged Data:** A fundamental security flaw where user-provided data is logged without proper cleaning, leading to various injection vulnerabilities.
* **Exploit Vulnerability in Custom Log Formatters:**  Vulnerabilities within application-specific logging code.
* **Log Injection for Information Gathering:** The act of inserting malicious content into logs to extract information.
* **Lack of Filtering of Sensitive Data Before Logging:** The failure to remove sensitive information before it is written to logs.
* **Remote Code Execution:** The ability for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server or application.
* **Information Disclosure:** The exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
