# Threat Model Analysis for ifttt/jazzhands

## Threat: [Malicious Feature Flag Modification via Insecure Configuration Storage](./threats/malicious_feature_flag_modification_via_insecure_configuration_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage mechanism where Jazzhands' feature flag configurations are held (e.g., configuration files, environment variables, a remote configuration service). They then modify flag values to enable malicious features, disable security controls, or disrupt application functionality.

**Impact:** Enabling malicious features could directly compromise application security or user data. Disabling security controls could expose vulnerabilities. Disrupting functionality can lead to denial of service or data integrity issues.

**Affected Jazzhands Component:** Configuration Loading Module

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong access controls on the feature flag configuration storage.
*   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit.
*   Use secure configuration management practices (e.g., version control, code reviews).
*   Regularly audit access to the configuration storage.

## Threat: [Logic Flaws in Feature Flag Evaluation Leading to Security Bypass](./threats/logic_flaws_in_feature_flag_evaluation_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

**Description:** Bugs or oversights in the logic used by Jazzhands to evaluate feature flags based on context (e.g., user attributes, environment) could lead to unintended flag assignments, allowing users to bypass intended security restrictions or access features they shouldn't.

**Impact:** This could result in unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, or the circumvention of security controls.

**Affected Jazzhands Component:** Context Evaluation Logic

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly test the feature flag evaluation logic with various input combinations and edge cases.
*   Conduct code reviews of the feature flag evaluation implementation.
*   Consider using a well-defined and tested strategy for context evaluation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Jazzhands Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_jazzhands_library_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software library, Jazzhands itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are exploited, attackers could potentially bypass feature flag controls or gain other unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Could lead to a wide range of security compromises depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Jazzhands Component:** Potentially any module within the Jazzhands library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the Jazzhands library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in Jazzhands.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application for potential vulnerabilities related to Jazzhands usage.

## Threat: [Insecure Integration with External Feature Flag Management Services](./threats/insecure_integration_with_external_feature_flag_management_services.md)

**Description:** If Jazzhands is configured to fetch feature flags from an external service, vulnerabilities in the communication or authentication with that service could allow attackers to intercept or manipulate feature flag data.

**Impact:** Could lead to the injection of malicious feature flags or the disabling of legitimate ones.

**Affected Jazzhands Component:** Modules responsible for fetching and synchronizing feature flags from external sources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for communication with external services.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing the external service.
*   Validate the integrity of feature flag data received from external sources.
