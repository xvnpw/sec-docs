**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced and detailed design overview of the JazzHands project, a headless Content Management System (CMS) developed by IFTTT. This document aims to provide a comprehensive and clear understanding of the system's architecture, components, and data flow, which will serve as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities. This revision includes more specific details and clarifies certain aspects of the initial design.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of JazzHands are to:

* Provide a flexible and scalable platform for managing structured content, enabling diverse content models.
* Offer a robust and well-documented API (likely RESTful) for accessing and delivering content to various front-end applications and services.
* Enable content creators to manage content independently of the presentation layer, fostering a decoupled architecture.
* Support a wide range of content types with customizable fields and validation rules, and manage complex relationships between them.
* Facilitate efficient content workflows, including draft states, review processes, and scheduled publishing.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

JazzHands employs a decoupled, headless CMS architecture, clearly separating the content repository and management from the content presentation. The core components interact via well-defined interfaces to manage and deliver content.

```mermaid

    subgraph "External Clients"
        A["'Web Applications'"]
        B["'Mobile Applications'"]
        C["'Other Services'"]
    end
    subgraph "JazzHands Core"
        D("API Gateway") --> E("Content Management Service");
        D --> F("Authentication & Authorization Service");
        E --> G("Database");
        E --> H("Search Index");
        E --> I("Webhook Service");
        I --> J["'External Services'"];
        E --> K("Cache Layer");
    end

    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
```

* **External Clients:** These are the diverse applications and services that consume content managed by JazzHands through its API.
    * Web Applications (e.g., websites, single-page applications)
    * Mobile Applications (iOS, Android)
    * Other Services (e.g., integrations with marketing automation platforms, internal systems)
* **JazzHands Core:** This encompasses the backend services and infrastructure responsible for the core content management and delivery functionalities.
    * **API Gateway:** The single entry point for all external API requests. It handles request routing, rate limiting, TLS termination, and potentially cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
    * **Authentication & Authorization Service:** Responsible for verifying the identity of users and applications attempting to access the API and ensuring they have the necessary permissions based on their roles and the requested resource. This likely involves token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
    * **Content Management Service:** The central component of JazzHands, responsible for:
        * Defining and managing content types (schemas) with various field types and validation rules.
        * Providing CRUD operations for content entries.
        * Managing relationships between content entries (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
        * Handling content versioning and audit trails.
        * Managing content workflows and publishing states (e.g., draft, pending review, published, archived).
    * **Database:**  Persistently stores all structured content, user accounts, roles, permissions, system configurations, and potentially webhook configurations.
    * **Search Index:** Provides efficient and scalable full-text search capabilities across the managed content. This allows clients to perform complex queries and filtering.
    * **Webhook Service:** Enables the configuration and triggering of HTTP callbacks to external services or applications when specific content lifecycle events occur (e.g., content created, updated, published, deleted).
    * **External Services:** These are the third-party systems or applications that JazzHands integrates with, often triggered by webhook events.
    * **Cache Layer:** An optional but highly recommended layer to improve API performance and reduce database load by caching frequently accessed content. This could be a distributed cache like Redis or Memcached.

## 4. Component Details

This section provides a more detailed description of each component within the JazzHands architecture, including potential technologies and security considerations.

    External-->>Webhook: Response (Success/Failure)
```

## 6. Security Considerations (Detailed)

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples and potential attack vectors.

* **Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Threats:** Brute-force attacks on login endpoints, credential stuffing, session hijacking, authorization bypass due to flawed role-based access control.
    * **Mitigations:** Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure storage of credentials (hashing and salting), proper implementation of OAuth 2.0 or other secure authentication protocols, regular security audits of authorization rules.
* **Input Validation:**
    * **Threats:** SQL injection, NoSQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, path traversal.
    * **Mitigations:**  Strict input validation on all user-provided data, using parameterized queries or prepared statements, encoding output data, employing input sanitization libraries, and implementing a robust Content Security Policy (CSP).
* **Data Protection:**
    * **Threats:** Data breaches due to unauthorized access to the database or backups, man-in-the-middle attacks intercepting sensitive data in transit.
    * **Mitigations:** Encryption of sensitive data at rest (database encryption) and in transit (HTTPS), secure key management practices, regular security assessments of data storage and transmission mechanisms.
* **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Threats:** Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, brute-force attacks.
    * **Mitigations:** Implementing rate limiting on API endpoints based on IP address or API key, using techniques like token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms, and monitoring API traffic for suspicious patterns.
* **Webhook Security:**
    * **Threats:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), insecure webhook delivery leading to information leakage, replay attacks.
    * **Mitigations:**  Strict validation of webhook URLs, using HTTPS for webhook delivery, implementing signature verification mechanisms (e.g., HMAC with a shared secret), and providing mechanisms for retrying failed webhook deliveries.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Threats:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks.
    * **Mitigations:** Regularly updating dependencies to the latest secure versions, using dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities, and having a process for patching vulnerabilities promptly.
* **Infrastructure Security:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized access to servers, misconfigured cloud resources, network vulnerabilities.
    * **Mitigations:** Following the principle of least privilege for access control, regularly patching operating systems and infrastructure components, using firewalls and network segmentation, and implementing robust security monitoring and logging.
* **Access Control:**
    * **Threats:** Unauthorized access to content or administrative functions due to overly permissive roles or misconfigured permissions.
    * **Mitigations:** Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions, regularly reviewing and auditing user roles and permissions, and adhering to the principle of least privilege.
* **Cache Security:**
    * **Threats:** Cache poisoning, serving stale data.
    * **Mitigations:** Implementing secure cache invalidation strategies, protecting the cache infrastructure from unauthorized access, and using appropriate cache headers to prevent unintended caching by clients.
