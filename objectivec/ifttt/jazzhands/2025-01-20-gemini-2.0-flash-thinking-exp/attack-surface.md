# Attack Surface Analysis for ifttt/jazzhands

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Flag Values](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_flag_values.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Default Flag Values
    *   **Description:** Default values for feature flags, if not carefully considered, can inadvertently enable sensitive features or bypass security controls when the application starts or before a proper configuration is loaded.
    *   **How JazzHands Contributes:** JazzHands relies on developers to define these default values. If developers don't prioritize security during this definition, vulnerabilities can be introduced.
    *   **Example:** A feature flag controlling access to administrative functionalities defaults to `true`. Before the intended configuration is loaded, an attacker could potentially exploit this window to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive features, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and set secure default values for all feature flags.
        *   Default to the most restrictive setting (e.g., feature disabled) unless there's a strong reason to do otherwise.
        *   Implement mechanisms to quickly load and apply the intended flag configuration at application startup.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Flag Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_flag_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Flag Configuration
    *   **Description:** The storage or transmission mechanism for feature flag configurations is insecure, allowing attackers to access and potentially modify flag definitions.
    *   **How JazzHands Contributes:** JazzHands needs a source for its flag configurations. If this source (e.g., configuration files, environment variables, remote APIs) is not properly secured, it becomes an attack vector directly impacting how JazzHands functions.
    *   **Example:** Flag configurations are stored in plain text files with overly permissive access rights. An attacker gains access to the server and reads these files, understanding which flags control which features, thus understanding how JazzHands is controlling the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can understand the application's internal logic as controlled by JazzHands, potentially enabling malicious features, disabling security controls, or planning targeted attacks based on feature availability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure storage mechanisms for flag configurations (e.g., encrypted files, secure vaults).
        *   Implement strict access controls on configuration files and data stores.
        *   If using remote configuration, ensure secure communication channels (HTTPS) and proper authentication/authorization for accessing the configuration source.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly within flag values if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Access Control for Flag Management](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_access_control_for_flag_management.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Lack of Access Control for Flag Management
    *   **Description:**  Insufficient or missing access controls for managing feature flags allow unauthorized users to modify flag states, directly impacting JazzHands' behavior.
    *   **How JazzHands Contributes:** The effectiveness of JazzHands in controlling features relies on the integrity of its flag states. If the management of these states is insecure, the core functionality of JazzHands is compromised.
    *   **Example:** An internal dashboard for toggling feature flags lacks proper authentication. An attacker gains access to the internal network and can enable or disable features managed by JazzHands at will.
    *   **Impact:**  Enabling malicious features controlled by JazzHands, disabling security controls managed by flags, disrupting application functionality based on flag states, potentially leading to data breaches or service outages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for any interface used to manage feature flags.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to flag management.
        *   Audit and log all changes made to feature flag configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Injection through Configuration Sources](./attack_surfaces/injection_through_configuration_sources.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Injection through Configuration Sources
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the external sources used to provide flag configurations allow attackers to inject malicious flag definitions that JazzHands will then interpret and act upon.
    *   **How JazzHands Contributes:** JazzHands directly consumes and acts upon the configuration data it receives. If this data is malicious, JazzHands becomes the vehicle for enacting the attack.
    *   **Example:** The application fetches flag configurations from a remote API that is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker injects malicious data that defines a new flag enabling administrative access for all users, which JazzHands then loads and enforces.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution (depending on how flags are used), enabling malicious features, disabling security controls, complete compromise of the application through manipulated JazzHands behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly secure all external sources used for flag configurations.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on data received from configuration sources *before* it is processed by JazzHands.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) when fetching remote configurations.
        *   Consider using signed configurations to ensure integrity before JazzHands loads them.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Remote Configuration Retrieval](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__on_remote_configuration_retrieval.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on Remote Configuration Retrieval
    *   **Description:** If fetching flag configurations from a remote source over an insecure connection (HTTP), attackers can intercept and modify the configuration data that JazzHands will subsequently use.
    *   **How JazzHands Contributes:** JazzHands' functionality is directly dependent on the configuration it receives. If this configuration is tampered with during transit, JazzHands will operate based on malicious data.
    *   **Example:** The application fetches flag configurations over HTTP. An attacker on the network intercepts the request and replaces the legitimate configuration with a malicious one that enables a backdoor, which JazzHands then enforces.
    *   **Impact:**  Loading malicious flag configurations into JazzHands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, enabling backdoors, or disabling security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use HTTPS** for fetching remote flag configurations to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data used by JazzHands.
        *   Verify the authenticity of the remote configuration source (e.g., using TLS certificate pinning) before JazzHands processes the data.

## Attack Surface: [Bugs in JazzHands Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/bugs_in_jazzhands_library_itself.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Bugs in JazzHands Library Itself
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist within the JazzHands library code itself.
    *   **How JazzHands Contributes:** Directly, as the vulnerability resides within the library being used to manage feature flags.
    *   **Example:** A parsing vulnerability in JazzHands allows an attacker to craft a malicious flag configuration that, when processed by JazzHands, leads to a buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior directly stemming from a flaw in JazzHands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the JazzHands library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to JazzHands.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application for potential vulnerabilities related to library usage.
