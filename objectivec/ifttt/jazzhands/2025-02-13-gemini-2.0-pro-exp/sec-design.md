Okay, let's create a design document for the JazzHands project, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

JazzHands is a tool developed by IFTTT, a company that focuses on connecting different services and devices.  This suggests a business model built around interoperability, automation, and user convenience.  Given IFTTT's position, the project likely aims to solve the following business priorities and goals:

*   **Priorities:**
    *   Streamline access management to AWS resources, reducing operational overhead.
    *   Improve security posture by enforcing least privilege and providing audit trails.
    *   Enhance developer productivity by simplifying access requests and approvals.
    *   Maintain compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.
    *   Reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

*   **Goals:**
    *   Provide a centralized, user-friendly interface for managing AWS IAM access.
    *   Automate the process of granting and revoking temporary AWS credentials.
    *   Integrate with existing identity providers (like Okta) for authentication.
    *   Offer robust logging and auditing capabilities for all access-related activities.
    *   Support a flexible and customizable workflow for access requests and approvals.

*   **Business Risks:**
    *   Compromise of JazzHands could lead to widespread unauthorized access to IFTTT's AWS infrastructure.
    *   Failure of JazzHands could disrupt developer workflows and impact service availability.
    *   Inadequate auditing or logging could hinder incident response and compliance efforts.
    *   Usability issues could lead to user errors and accidental misconfigurations.
    *   Vulnerabilities in dependencies (e.g., Python libraries, AWS SDK) could be exploited.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the GitHub repository and general best practices, here's an assessment of the security posture:

*   **Existing Security Controls:**
    *   security control: Authentication via Okta (SAML). This is described in the `README.md` and configuration files.
    *   security control: Authorization based on group membership and defined roles within JazzHands.  This is evident in the code and configuration examples.
    *   security control: Use of temporary AWS credentials (STS) to minimize the impact of credential compromise.  This is a core feature of the project.
    *   security control: Logging of access requests, approvals, and credential issuance.  Mentioned in the documentation and visible in the code.
    *   security control: Input validation (though the extent needs further review).  Present in parts of the code dealing with user input.
    *   security control: Use of HTTPS for communication between components. Implied by the use of AWS services and best practices.
    *   security control: Configuration via YAML files, allowing for version control and auditing of changes.

*   **Accepted Risks:**
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on the security of Okta as the primary identity provider. If Okta is compromised, JazzHands is also compromised.
    *   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration of JazzHands roles and permissions, leading to overly permissive access.
    *   accepted risk: Dependence on the availability and security of AWS services (IAM, STS, etc.).
    *   accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party Python libraries used by JazzHands.

*   **Recommended Security Controls:**
    *   Implement regular security audits and penetration testing of the JazzHands application and infrastructure.
    *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, especially administrators.
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
    *   Implement anomaly detection to identify unusual access patterns or suspicious activity.
    *   Implement static code analysis (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the build pipeline.
    *   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

*   **Security Requirements:**

    *   **Authentication:**
        *   All users must be authenticated via a trusted identity provider (Okta).
        *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be strongly encouraged or enforced.
        *   Session management should be secure, with appropriate timeouts and protection against session hijacking.

    *   **Authorization:**
        *   Access to resources should be granted based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   Roles and permissions should be clearly defined and regularly reviewed.
        *   A robust audit trail of all authorization decisions should be maintained.

    *   **Input Validation:**
        *   All user input should be validated against a strict whitelist of allowed characters and formats.
        *   Input validation should occur on the server-side, not just the client-side.
        *   Output encoding should be used to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

    *   **Cryptography:**
        *   All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) should be encrypted at rest and in transit.
        *   Strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and key lengths should be used.
        *   Cryptographic keys should be managed securely, with appropriate rotation and access controls.
        *   HTTPS should be enforced for all communication.

The build process for JazzHands likely involves the following steps:

1.  **Developer:** A developer writes code and commits it to the GitHub repository.
2.  **CI Trigger:** A commit triggers a build in a CI environment (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
3.  **Code Checkout:** The CI environment checks out the code from the repository.
4.  **Dependency Installation:** Python dependencies are installed (e.g., using `pip`).
5.  **Linting:** Code is checked for style and potential errors using a linter (e.g., `flake8`).
6.  **Static Analysis:** Static analysis tools (e.g., `bandit`, `SonarQube`) are run to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
7.  **Testing:** Unit tests and integration tests are executed.
8.  **Container Build:** A Docker image is built for the application.
9.  **Image Scanning:** The Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities using a container image scanner (e.g., `Trivy`, `Clair`).
10. **Image Push:** The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR).
