## Attack Tree Path: [***[Degrade User Experience / DoS]*** (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_degrade_user_experience__dos___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker. They aim to make the application unusable or significantly less enjoyable for legitimate users.
*   **Methods:** Achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities that lead to resource exhaustion or by providing invalid input that causes unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [***[Resource Exhaustion]*** (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_resource_exhaustion___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to consume excessive system resources (CPU or memory) to the point where the application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **[CPU Hogging]:**
        *   **Description:** Triggering a large number of complex animations simultaneously, or animations with very long durations, to overload the CPU.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (UI lag, unresponsiveness, potential app crash.)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **[Memory Leak]:**
        *   **Description:** Repeatedly starting and stopping animations, especially those involving large resources, without proper cleanup, leading to a gradual depletion of available memory.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Slow degradation, eventual crash.)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [***[Invalid Input]*** (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/_invalid_input___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides deliberately malformed or out-of-bounds input to the animation library, hoping to trigger unexpected behavior, crashes, or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **[Oversized Animations]:**
            *   **Description:** Attempting to create animations with extremely large dimensions or scales, exceeding the library's or device's capabilities.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Rendering issues, crashes.)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **[Negative Values]:**
            *   **Description:** Providing negative values for parameters that should only accept positive values (e.g., duration, delay).
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Unexpected behavior, crashes.)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
