# Attack Surface Analysis for ifttt/jazzhands

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Vault Permissions](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_vault_permissions.md)

**Description:** Vault policies are too permissive, granting access to secrets beyond what's necessary for the application's functionality.

**How JazzHands Contributes:** JazzHands is configured to access Vault and relies on the configured Vault policies. If these policies are too broad, JazzHands will retrieve more secrets than needed, increasing the potential impact of a compromise.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, lateral movement within the infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File System Permissions for File-Based Secrets](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_system_permissions_for_file-based_secrets.md)

**Description:** When using file-based secret storage, the files containing secrets have overly permissive file system permissions, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read them.

**How JazzHands Contributes:** If JazzHands is configured to read secrets from files with weak permissions, it becomes a pathway for accessing those secrets.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive secrets, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of API Keys/Tokens for Secret Backends](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_api_keystokens_for_secret_backends.md)

**Description:** The credentials (API keys, tokens) used by JazzHands to authenticate with secret backends (like a non-Vault secrets manager) are exposed or compromised.

**How JazzHands Contributes:** JazzHands needs these credentials to retrieve secrets. If these credentials are leaked or stored insecurely, an attacker can impersonate JazzHands and retrieve secrets directly.

**Impact:** Full access to secrets managed by the backend, potentially leading to widespread compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Vault Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_vault_communication.md)

**Description:** Communication between the application using JazzHands and the Vault server is not properly secured (e.g., using plain HTTP instead of HTTPS, or lacking proper certificate validation), allowing an attacker to intercept and potentially modify secret retrieval requests and responses.

**How JazzHands Contributes:** JazzHands initiates the communication with Vault. If this communication is insecure, JazzHands becomes a conduit for the attack.

**Impact:** Exposure of secrets, potential for injecting malicious configurations or secrets.

**Risk Severity:** High

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in JazzHands or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_jazzhands_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in the JazzHands library itself or in its dependencies.

**How JazzHands Contributes:** By using JazzHands, the application inherits any vulnerabilities present in the library or its dependencies.

**Impact:**  Depends on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration Leading to Default or Weak Settings](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_leading_to_default_or_weak_settings.md)

**Description:** JazzHands is not configured securely, using default or weak settings that expose vulnerabilities.

**How JazzHands Contributes:**  Incorrect configuration of JazzHands directly leads to a weaker security posture in how secrets are managed and accessed.

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific misconfiguration, potentially leading to unauthorized access or exposure of secrets.

**Risk Severity:** High
