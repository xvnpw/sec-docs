# Threat Model Analysis for ifttt/jazzhands

## Threat: [Malicious CSS Injection via Jazzhands Variable Processing](./threats/malicious_css_injection_via_jazzhands_variable_processing.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious CSS Injection via Jazzhands Variable Processing
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the server-side logic that provides data to Jazzhands. This allows them to inject malicious CSS code into the values of CSS variables that Jazzhands then processes and applies to the application's styles. The attacker leverages Jazzhands' functionality to deliver and activate the malicious CSS on the client-side.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Critical:** Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the injected CSS, through mechanisms like `url()` or `-moz-binding`, can be used to execute JavaScript or load malicious resources. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, or malware distribution.
        * **High:** Significant UI manipulation allowing for convincing phishing attacks, hiding crucial information, or defacing the application.
        * **High:** Client-side denial of service by injecting CSS that causes excessive resource consumption, leading to browser crashes or unresponsiveness.
    * **Affected Component:** Jazzhands' core functionality for processing and applying CSS variables (likely the `setProperties` function or similar).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Robust Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all data *before* it is passed to Jazzhands for variable creation. Implement allow-lists for allowed characters and patterns.
        * **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode CSS variable values appropriately before passing them to Jazzhands to prevent the interpretation of malicious characters as executable CSS code.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which stylesheets and other resources can be loaded, and to restrict inline styles. This can mitigate the impact of successful CSS injection.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities Within the Jazzhands Library](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within_the_jazzhands_library.md)

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities Within the Jazzhands Library
    * **Description:**  An attacker directly exploits security vulnerabilities present in the Jazzhands library code itself. This could involve vulnerabilities related to how Jazzhands parses, processes, or applies CSS variables.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or client.
        * **High:**  Information disclosure by exploiting vulnerabilities that allow access to sensitive data within the application's state or configuration.
        * **High:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exploiting vulnerabilities that cause Jazzhands to crash or consume excessive resources.
    * **Affected Component:** Any module or function within the Jazzhands library containing the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:**  Can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Jazzhands Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update to the latest version of Jazzhands to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to Jazzhands and its dependencies.
        * **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in the Jazzhands library.
        * **Consider Code Reviews:** If possible, conduct code reviews of the Jazzhands library code or rely on reputable sources for its security.
        * **Isolate Jazzhands:**  If feasible, run Jazzhands in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
