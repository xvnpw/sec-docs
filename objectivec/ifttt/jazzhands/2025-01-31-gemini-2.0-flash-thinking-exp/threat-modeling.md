# Threat Model Analysis for ifttt/jazzhands

## Threat: [Information Disclosure of Sensitive Attributes](./threats/information_disclosure_of_sensitive_attributes.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure of Sensitive Attributes
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Jazzhands' API or data storage to gain unauthorized access to user attributes. They might use SQL injection, API authentication bypass, or exploit misconfigurations to query or dump attribute data directly from Jazzhands.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy violation, potential for social engineering attacks, unauthorized access to resources if attributes reveal access levels or sensitive information.
    *   **Jazzhands Component Affected:** API endpoints (e.g., attribute retrieval APIs), Data Storage (database).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust API authentication and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys with proper scoping) within Jazzhands.
        *   Apply principle of least privilege for API access within Jazzhands configurations.
        *   Regularly audit and patch Jazzhands and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement input validation and output encoding within Jazzhands API to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Encrypt sensitive attributes at rest and in transit within Jazzhands data storage.
        *   Implement access controls on the database level of Jazzhands.

## Threat: [Tampering with Attribute Data via API](./threats/tampering_with_attribute_data_via_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Tampering with Attribute Data via API
    *   **Description:** An attacker, possibly with compromised credentials or by exploiting Jazzhands API vulnerabilities, modifies user attributes directly within Jazzhands. They might use API calls to change attribute values, add unauthorized attributes, or delete legitimate ones through Jazzhands APIs.
    *   **Impact:** Authorization bypass in applications relying on Jazzhands, privilege escalation, users gaining access they shouldn't have, or losing legitimate access across applications using Jazzhands.
    *   **Jazzhands Component Affected:** Attribute Management API (e.g., attribute update/set APIs) in Jazzhands, Authorization layer of Jazzhands API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for attribute management APIs in Jazzhands.
        *   Enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC) for attribute modification within Jazzhands.
        *   Implement audit logging for all attribute changes within Jazzhands, including who made the change and when.
        *   Use input validation within Jazzhands API to ensure attribute values are within expected ranges and formats.
        *   Consider implementing attribute change approval workflows within Jazzhands for sensitive attributes.

## Threat: [Policy Bypass due to Logic Errors in ABAC Policies](./threats/policy_bypass_due_to_logic_errors_in_abac_policies.md)

*   **Threat:** Policy Bypass due to Logic Errors in ABAC Policies
    *   **Description:**  Developers create overly permissive or incorrectly defined ABAC policies directly within Jazzhands. Attackers discover these logical flaws in Jazzhands policies and craft requests that bypass the intended authorization logic enforced by Jazzhands, gaining unauthorized access to applications protected by Jazzhands.
    *   **Impact:** Authorization bypass in applications using Jazzhands, access to sensitive resources protected by Jazzhands, potential data breaches in connected applications.
    *   **Jazzhands Component Affected:** Policy Engine within Jazzhands, Policy Definition Language/Interface in Jazzhands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement thorough testing of ABAC policies within Jazzhands, including negative testing and edge cases.
        *   Use a policy review process involving security experts to validate policy logic within Jazzhands.
        *   Employ policy analysis tools (if available for Jazzhands or ABAC policy languages) to detect potential policy conflicts or weaknesses.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining policies in Jazzhands.
        *   Document policies clearly and maintain version control for Jazzhands policies.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Jazzhands API](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_jazzhands_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) against Jazzhands API
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods Jazzhands API endpoints with requests, exhausting resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) of the Jazzhands service and making the authorization service unavailable for legitimate application requests.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability for all applications relying on Jazzhands, inability to perform authorization checks, effectively shutting down application functionality that depends on Jazzhands for authorization.
    *   **Jazzhands Component Affected:** API endpoints of Jazzhands, underlying infrastructure (server, network) hosting Jazzhands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on Jazzhands API endpoints.
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Jazzhands to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.
        *   Ensure Jazzhands infrastructure is scalable and resilient to handle traffic spikes.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for Jazzhands API performance and availability.
        *   Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to absorb some of the attack traffic directed at Jazzhands API.

## Threat: [Compromise of Jazzhands Administrative Interface](./threats/compromise_of_jazzhands_administrative_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Jazzhands Administrative Interface
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Jazzhands administrative interface (e.g., web UI, CLI). This could be through credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the admin interface of Jazzhands itself.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over Jazzhands, ability to modify attributes, policies, permissions, create/delete users within Jazzhands, leading to widespread authorization bypass, privilege escalation, and potential data breaches across all applications using Jazzhands.
    *   **Jazzhands Component Affected:** Administrative Interface (UI/CLI) of Jazzhands, Authentication and Authorization mechanisms for Jazzhands Admin Interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Jazzhands administrative accounts.
        *   Restrict access to the Jazzhands administrative interface to authorized personnel only (IP whitelisting, network segmentation).
        *   Regularly audit administrative access logs of Jazzhands.
        *   Disable or remove unnecessary administrative features or endpoints in Jazzhands.
        *   Keep the Jazzhands administrative interface software up-to-date with security patches.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Jazzhands Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_jazzhands_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Jazzhands Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Jazzhands relies on third-party libraries and components.  Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are discovered and exploited by attackers to compromise the Jazzhands service itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to information disclosure, denial of service, remote code execution, or other forms of compromise of Jazzhands and all applications relying on it.
    *   **Jazzhands Component Affected:** Dependencies (libraries, frameworks) used by Jazzhands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Jazzhands dependencies.
        *   Regularly scan Jazzhands dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
        *   Keep Jazzhands dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement a process for quickly patching or mitigating Jazzhands dependency vulnerabilities when they are discovered.
