# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, JazzHands, aims to provide a centralized and automated system for managing user accounts, permissions, and access control within an organization. It streamlines user lifecycle management, from onboarding to offboarding, and ensures consistent application of security policies across various systems and applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Centralized User Management: To consolidate user account management into a single system, reducing administrative overhead and improving consistency.
- Automated Provisioning and Deprovisioning: To automate user onboarding and offboarding processes, ensuring timely access and revocation of access, minimizing manual errors and security gaps.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): To implement RBAC to manage user permissions based on roles, simplifying access management and improving security posture.
- Auditability and Compliance: To provide comprehensive audit logs of user access and permission changes for compliance and security monitoring.
- Self-Service Capabilities: To empower users with self-service capabilities for password resets and profile updates, reducing help desk burden.

Business Risks:
- Data Breach: Unauthorized access to user account data, including credentials and permissions, could lead to a significant data breach.
- System Downtime: Failure or unavailability of JazzHands could disrupt user access to critical systems and applications, impacting business operations.
- Insider Threat: Malicious or negligent actions by internal users with privileged access to JazzHands could compromise the system and user data.
- Compliance Violations: Improper management of user access and permissions could lead to violations of regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Service Disruption: Issues with integration with other systems or dependencies could lead to service disruptions and impact user productivity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Authentication - JazzHands likely implements authentication mechanisms to verify user identities before granting access. (Implementation details need to be reviewed in the code)
- security control: Authorization - JazzHands implements role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to resources. (Implementation details need to be reviewed in the code)
- security control: Password Management - JazzHands likely includes features for password management, such as password reset and complexity requirements. (Implementation details need to be reviewed in the code)
- security control: Audit Logging - JazzHands likely logs user actions and system events for auditing and security monitoring. (Implementation details need to be reviewed in the code)
- security control: Secure Communication - Communication between components of JazzHands and external systems should be secured using protocols like HTTPS. (Assumed, needs verification)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Complexity of RBAC implementation - Managing complex roles and permissions can be challenging and may lead to misconfigurations if not properly managed.
- accepted risk: Integration vulnerabilities - Integrating JazzHands with various systems and applications may introduce vulnerabilities if integrations are not properly secured.
- accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities - JazzHands relies on various software dependencies, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could pose a risk.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code using a code editor on their workstation.
2. Developer commits code changes to a Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).
3. Code commit to the repository triggers a CI/CD pipeline in a CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions).
4. The CI/CD pipeline starts a Build Server.
5. Build Server pulls the latest code from the Code Repository.
6. Build Server executes a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanner to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
7. Build Server executes a Dependency Scanner to identify vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
8. Build Server compiles the code, builds container images, and creates other necessary build artifacts.
9. Build Server pushes the build artifacts, including container images, to a Container Registry.
10. Deployment process pulls artifacts from the Container Registry and deploys them to the Deployment Environment.

- User Personal Information (PII): Potentially sensitive data depending on regulatory requirements (e.g., name, email, department).
- User Roles and Permissions: Sensitive data that defines access levels and must be managed securely to prevent unauthorized access.
- Audit Logs: Sensitive data that can reveal security incidents and user activities, requiring secure storage and access control.
- System Configuration Data: Potentially sensitive data that could be exploited if exposed.
