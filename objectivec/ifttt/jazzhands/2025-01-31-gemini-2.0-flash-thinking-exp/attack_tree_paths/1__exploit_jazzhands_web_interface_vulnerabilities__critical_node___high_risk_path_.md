    ##### 1.2.2. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

    *   **Description:** Accessing objects directly by guessing or manipulating identifiers (e.g., database IDs, file paths) without proper authorization checks, assuming that knowing the identifier is sufficient for access.
    *   **Risk Level:** **MEDIUM to HIGH**.  Depends on the predictability of identifiers and sensitivity of objects.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data objects (user profiles, device configurations, etc.), potentially leading to data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Indirect Object References:** Use indirect object references (e.g., UUIDs, hashed IDs) instead of direct, predictable identifiers.
        *   **Authorization Checks for Object Access:** Implement mandatory authorization checks before granting access to any object based on its identifier.

        *   **Description:** Non-persistent XSS where the malicious script is injected through a URL parameter or form input and immediately reflected back to the user in the response.
        *   **Risk Level:** **MEDIUM to HIGH**. Reflected XSS requires social engineering to trick users into clicking malicious links.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Compromise of users who click on malicious links or submit malicious forms, session hijacking, and redirection to malicious sites.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Avoid Reflecting User Input:** Minimize or eliminate the practice of directly reflecting user input in responses.
            *   **Output Encoding (Context-Aware):** If reflection is unavoidable, ensure proper context-aware output encoding of reflected user input.

    ##### 1.4.1. Missing/Weak CSRF Protection

    *   **Description:** Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms or implementation of weak or easily bypassable CSRF protection in Jazzhands.
    *   **Risk Level:** **HIGH**. Missing or weak CSRF protection makes the application highly vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
    *   **Potential Impact:** CSRF attacks can be easily executed, leading to unauthorized actions across the application.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Robust CSRF Protection:** Implement a strong CSRF protection mechanism using synchronizer tokens as described in 1.4.
        *   **Enable CSRF Protection Framework Features:** If using a web framework, ensure that built-in CSRF protection features are enabled and correctly configured.
