# Threat Model Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a known security vulnerability within the `MBProgressHUD` library code itself. This could involve reverse engineering the library, analyzing public vulnerability databases, or using automated vulnerability scanning tools. Upon finding a vulnerability, the attacker crafts an exploit that targets applications using the vulnerable version of `MBProgressHUD`. The exploit could be triggered remotely if the application has network vulnerabilities, or locally if the attacker has gained access to the device.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, denial of service, or privilege escalation depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Core `MBProgressHUD` library code (modules related to rendering, animation, input handling, or memory management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update `MBProgressHUD`:**  Stay updated with the latest versions of the library to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor the library's repository and security advisories.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in used libraries, including `MBProgressHUD`.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews, especially when updating libraries, to identify potential integration issues or unexpected behavior.
