# Attack Surface Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Customization](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_excessive_customization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting the customization features of `mbprogresshud` to consume excessive resources, leading to application slowdown or crashes. This is achieved by providing maliciously crafted or excessively large input to customization options.
*   **mbprogresshud Contribution:** `mbprogresshud` allows developers to customize text, detail text, and images displayed in the HUD.  Lack of input validation in the application when using these customization features with user-controlled data directly leverages `mbprogresshud` to amplify the attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides extremely long text strings (e.g., megabytes of text) as input that the application then attempts to display in the `mbprogresshud`'s text or detail text fields. When `mbprogresshud` tries to render the HUD with this excessive text, it consumes significant memory and CPU, potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to service disruption and preventing users from accessing application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data that is used to populate `mbprogresshud` text fields (text and detail text) and image resources. Limit the maximum length of text and the size of images.
    *   **Resource Limits within Application:**  Implement application-level resource management to prevent excessive resource consumption by `mbprogresshud`. For example, truncate long text strings before displaying them in the HUD.
    *   **Defensive Coding Practices:** Avoid directly displaying user-provided or external data in `mbprogresshud` without thorough validation and sanitization.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Memory Leaks (Library Bugs)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_memory_leaks__library_bugs_.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs within the `mbprogresshud` library itself, specifically memory leaks, can lead to gradual resource depletion. Over time, this can exhaust device memory, resulting in application crashes and a denial of service.
*   **mbprogresshud Contribution:** As a software library, `mbprogresshud` may contain undiscovered bugs, including memory leaks in its object management during HUD display, animation, and dismissal. Repeatedly using `mbprogresshud` functionality can trigger and exacerbate these leaks.
*   **Example:**  A memory leak exists within `mbprogresshud`'s code related to animation handling. An attacker, or even normal application usage patterns that heavily rely on showing and hiding the HUD with animations, repeatedly triggers this leak.  Over time, the application's memory footprint grows until the operating system terminates the application due to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes due to out-of-memory errors after prolonged or repeated use of `mbprogresshud` features, leading to service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Library Updates:**  Keep `mbprogresshud` updated to the latest stable version. Library updates often include bug fixes, including patches for memory leaks.
    *   **Memory Profiling and Testing:**  Conduct thorough memory profiling of the application, especially during development and testing phases, focusing on scenarios that heavily utilize `mbprogresshud`. Identify and report any potential memory leaks to the library maintainers and address them in the application if possible (e.g., by limiting HUD usage patterns if a leak is suspected but not yet fixed in the library).
    *   **Library Version Monitoring and Selection:**  Monitor community reports and issue trackers for `mbprogresshud` to be aware of any reported memory leak issues in specific versions. Consider using well-vetted and stable versions of the library. If a leak is identified in a specific version, consider downgrading to a known stable version (if feasible and secure in other aspects) or patching the library locally if possible and appropriate.
