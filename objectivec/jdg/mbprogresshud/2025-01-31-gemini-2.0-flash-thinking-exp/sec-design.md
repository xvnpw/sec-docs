# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a reusable, customizable, and easy-to-integrate progress indicator for iOS applications.
  - Ensure the library is lightweight and performs well to avoid impacting application responsiveness.
  - Maintain compatibility with a wide range of iOS versions and devices.
  - Offer a visually appealing and user-friendly progress HUD to enhance user experience.

- Business Goals:
  - Increase developer productivity by providing a ready-made solution for displaying progress.
  - Improve the visual consistency of progress indicators across different iOS applications.
  - Reduce development time and effort associated with creating custom progress HUDs.
  - Establish the library as a popular and trusted choice for iOS developers.

- Business Risks:
  - Library defects leading to application crashes or unexpected UI behavior, negatively impacting user experience.
  - Security vulnerabilities within the library that could be exploited by malicious actors through applications using the library.
  - Performance issues in the library causing application slowdowns or battery drain.
  - Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates resulting in incompatibility with newer iOS versions or security vulnerabilities remaining unpatched.
  - Adoption risk if the library is perceived as too complex, poorly documented, or unreliable.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code: The library is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. This transparency can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Objective-C Language: The library is written in Objective-C, a mature language with well-established security best practices. Implemented in: Source code.
  - security control: Standard iOS SDK: The library likely relies on standard and well-vetted iOS SDK components, which are generally considered secure. Implemented in: Library dependencies.
  - security control: CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager: Distribution through package managers like CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager provides a degree of dependency management and version control. Implemented in: Project build and distribution configuration.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Community-Driven Security: Reliance on the open-source community for security audits and vulnerability reporting means there is no dedicated security team actively monitoring the library.
  - accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities: While unlikely for a UI library, there's a general risk of vulnerabilities in any third-party dependencies, however minimal.
  - accepted risk: Delayed Patching: Vulnerability patching relies on maintainer availability and community reporting, which might lead to delays in addressing discovered issues.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Implement SAST tools in the development process to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning: Although dependencies are minimal, perform dependency scanning to ensure no known vulnerable components are included.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits, potentially by external security experts, to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Secure Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices during development, including input validation and secure handling of any configuration data.
  - security control: Security Response Plan: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including patching and public disclosure.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. This library is a UI component and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. This library does not handle user authorization or access control.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all configuration parameters passed to the library to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
    - Requirement: Ensure that input validation handles various data types and edge cases correctly.
    - Requirement: Sanitize any input that is displayed to the user to prevent potential UI injection vulnerabilities (though unlikely in this context).
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. This library does not require cryptographic operations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Displaying progress to users in iOS applications to provide feedback and improve user experience. While not a core business process in itself, it is critical for the usability and perceived quality of applications that rely on it. Indirectly, it supports all business processes that rely on smooth user interaction within iOS applications.

- Data We Are Trying to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - The MBProgressHUD library itself does not directly handle sensitive data. However, applications using the library might be processing sensitive data while displaying progress.
  - Data sensitivity depends entirely on the context of the iOS application using the library. If the application processes Personal Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or health records, then any vulnerability in the application (including indirectly through a library) could potentially expose this sensitive data.
  - The primary concern is to ensure the library does not introduce vulnerabilities that could be exploited in applications to compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the specific context for this threat modeling exercise? Is there a particular application or use case in mind?
  - Are there any known security concerns or past incidents related to UI libraries or progress indicators in iOS applications?
  - What is the organization's risk appetite regarding the use of open-source UI libraries?
  - Are there specific compliance requirements that need to be considered for applications using this library (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?

- Assumptions:
  - Assumption: The primary goal of threat modeling is to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the MBProgressHUD library that could impact applications using it.
  - Assumption: The library is intended for use in a wide range of iOS applications, with varying levels of data sensitivity.
  - Assumption: Security vulnerabilities in the library are primarily a concern if they can be exploited to compromise the security of applications that integrate it.
  - Assumption: The organization using this design document is concerned about the overall security posture of their iOS applications and wants to ensure they are using libraries responsibly and securely.
