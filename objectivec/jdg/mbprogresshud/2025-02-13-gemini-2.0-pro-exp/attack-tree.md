## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Code Execution within the Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_code_execution_within_the_application__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the foundational step for almost all attacks. The attacker needs to find a way to execute arbitrary code within the context of the iOS application. This is *not* specific to `MBProgressHUD`; it's a general application security concern.
*   **How it's Exploited:**
    *   Exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in the application or a linked library.
    *   Exploiting a format string vulnerability.
    *   Exploiting an injection vulnerability (e.g., code injection, command injection).
    *   Exploiting a deserialization vulnerability.
    *   Leveraging a compromised third-party library.
    *   Exploiting a vulnerability in the iOS operating system itself (less likely, but possible).
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause HUD to Persist Indefinitely (Denial of Service - UI Blocking) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_hud_to_persist_indefinitely__denial_of_service_-_ui_blocking___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  After gaining code execution, the attacker manipulates the `MBProgressHUD` to remain visible indefinitely, blocking the user interface and preventing interaction with the application.
*   **How it's Exploited:**
    *   **Find a reference to the HUD object (1.3.2.1):**  The attacker needs to locate the `MBProgressHUD` instance in memory. This might involve traversing the view hierarchy or inspecting object references.
    *   **Prevent calls to `hideAnimated:` (1.3.2.2):** The core of the DoS attack. The attacker prevents the application from dismissing the HUD.
        *   **Continuously calling `showAnimated:` (1.3.2.2.2) [HIGH-RISK]:**  This is a simple and effective method.  The attacker repeatedly calls `showAnimated:`, ensuring the HUD remains visible.  They might also interfere with any completion blocks that would normally hide the HUD.
        *   **(Less likely) Swizzling `hideAnimated:` (1.3.2.2.1):** A more advanced technique where the attacker replaces the implementation of `hideAnimated:` (or related methods) with a no-op (a function that does nothing).
    *   **(Optional) Disable User Interaction (1.3.3):**  This makes the DoS more effective.
        *   **Ensure HUD is added to a high-level view (1.3.3.1):**  Adding the HUD to the main window or a top-level view ensures it covers the entire screen.
        *   **Set `userInteractionEnabled` to `YES` (1.3.3.2):** This prevents touches from passing through the HUD to the underlying views.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (overall path), High (for `showAnimated:` loop)
*   **Impact:** Medium (UI blocking, but not data compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on the specific method used)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Use-After-Free or Double-Free (1.5.2) [CRITICAL for this specific, unlikely attack]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_use-after-free_or_double-free__1_5_2___critical_for_this_specific__unlikely_attack_.md)

* **Description:** This is a *highly unlikely* scenario that would require a specific, undiscovered bug in `MBProgressHUD`'s memory management. The attacker would need to trigger a use-after-free or double-free vulnerability to potentially gain control of the application's execution flow.
* **How it's Exploited:**
    * **Requires a specific vulnerability (1.5.2.1) [CRITICAL]:** This is the fundamental requirement. There's no known vulnerability of this type in `MBProgressHUD`, so this is purely theoretical.
    * **Gain Code Execution (1.5.2.2) [CRITICAL]:** Precise control over memory allocation and deallocation is needed, typically requiring existing code execution.
* **Likelihood:** Very Low
* **Impact:** Very High
* **Effort:** Very High
* **Skill Level:** Expert
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [The application (or another compromised component) must be able to capture the user's input. (2.2.2) [CRITICAL for Phishing]](./attack_tree_paths/the_application__or_another_compromised_component__must_be_able_to_capture_the_user's_input___2_2_2__ce66dc80.md)

*   **Description:** This is the *essential* element for a successful phishing attack.  `MBProgressHUD` can *display* a deceptive prompt, but it *cannot* capture user input.  This step relies entirely on a *separate* vulnerability in the application or a compromised component.
*   **How it's Exploited:** This depends entirely on the *other* vulnerability.  It could involve:
    *   A compromised text field that sends input to the attacker.
    *   A malicious keyboard extension.
    *   A compromised web view that captures input.
    *   Any other mechanism that allows the attacker to intercept user input.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (depends on the presence of *another* vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** High (potential for credential theft, etc.)
*   **Effort:** High (requires exploiting a separate vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (depends on the specific input capture method)
