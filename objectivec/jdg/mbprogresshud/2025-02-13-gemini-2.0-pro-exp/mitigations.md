# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (for HUD Text)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__for_hud_text_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Centralized Control:** Create a single function or class method responsible for setting the text on *any* `MBProgressHUD` instance (e.g., `labelText`, `detailsLabelText`).  This function will be the *only* place where text is assigned to these properties.
2.  **Validation:** Within this centralized function, before setting the text on the `MBProgressHUD`, validate it:
    *   **Type Check:** Ensure the input is a string.
    *   **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum length restrictions.  Example: 256 characters for `labelText`, 512 for `detailsLabelText`. Adjust based on your UI.
    *   **Character Whitelisting/Blacklisting (Optional, but recommended):** If possible, define allowed characters (whitelist) or disallowed characters (blacklist).  Whitelist is preferred.  For example, you might disallow control characters.
3.  **Sanitization (If Necessary):** If you cannot strictly control the input (e.g., user-generated content), sanitize the text *within the centralized function*:
    *   **Escaping/Encoding:** While less critical for `MBProgressHUD`'s display (it's not a web view), consider escaping or encoding if the same text is used elsewhere in your app where it *could* be misinterpreted (e.g., HTML).
4.  **Direct `MBProgressHUD` API Use:**  Always use the `MBProgressHUD` API methods (e.g., `hud.labelText = ...`) to set the text.  Do *not* attempt to manipulate the underlying UI elements directly.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test this centralized function with various inputs, including edge cases and potentially problematic strings.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **UI Disruption/Corruption (Severity: Low):** Malicious or excessively long strings could cause the HUD to display incorrectly.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low):**  Unlikely with `MBProgressHUD` alone, but carefully crafted input *might* reveal some internal state if the text is derived from sensitive data.

**Impact:**
*   **UI Disruption/Corruption:** Significantly reduced.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Reduced (already low risk).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented in `NetworkManager.swift` in the `fetchData` function. Length limits are enforced, but character validation is missing.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Character validation is missing.  A truly centralized function for setting *all* HUD text is not yet implemented.  The `parseUserDetails` function in `User.swift` lacks validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Denial of Service (DoS) - UI Unresponsiveness (via HUD)](./mitigation_strategies/denial_of_service__dos__-_ui_unresponsiveness__via_hud_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Centralized HUD Manager:** Create a single class or utility (e.g., `HUDManager`) responsible for *all* `MBProgressHUD` showing and hiding.  This class should:
    *   Have a state variable (e.g., `isHUDVisible`) to track if a HUD is currently shown.
    *   Provide methods like `showLoadingHUD(withText:timeout:)` and `hideLoadingHUD()`.
    *   *Prevent* multiple simultaneous HUD displays by checking `isHUDVisible` before showing.
2.  **Timeout Enforcement:**  *Always* use `MBProgressHUD's` `hide:animated:afterDelay:` method within the `HUDManager` to set a timeout for *every* HUD display.  A reasonable timeout (e.g., 5-10 seconds) should be used, adjusted based on the expected task duration.
3.  **Asynchronous Operations (with HUD Handling):** Ensure that any long-running operation that triggers the HUD is on a background thread.  The `HUDManager` should handle showing the HUD *before* starting the background task and hiding it in the task's *completion handler* (both success and failure cases).  Use `DispatchQueue.global().async` or similar.
4.  **Direct API Use:** Only use `MBProgressHUD`'s methods (e.g., `showHUDAddedTo:animated:`, `hide:animated:`) within the `HUDManager`.  Do not manipulate the HUD directly from elsewhere in the code.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the `HUDManager`, including scenarios where operations take longer than the timeout, fail, or are cancelled.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **UI Unresponsiveness (Severity: Medium):** Prevents the HUD from being displayed indefinitely, blocking user interaction.

**Impact:**
*   **UI Unresponsiveness:** Significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Timeouts are implemented in *some* network requests (`NetworkManager.swift`), but not consistently.  A centralized `HUDHelper.swift` exists but is not fully utilized or robust.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `HUDHelper.swift` needs refactoring to be a true, robust, centralized manager used *everywhere* a HUD is shown.  Timeouts are missing in UI-related operations (e.g., `ImageProcessor.swift`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Custom View Usage (If Used)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_custom_view_usage__if_used_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoidance (Primary):**  *Do not use custom views with `MBProgressHUD` unless absolutely necessary.*  Use the built-in indicators and labels.
2.  **Justification (If Used):** If a custom view *must* be used, document the *precise* reason why the standard options are insufficient.
3.  **Code Review (If Used):** If a custom view is used, its code *must* undergo a thorough security review, focusing on potential vulnerabilities.
4.  **Minimal Functionality (If Used):** The custom view should be as simple as possible.  Avoid any complex logic or user interaction within the custom view.
5.  **Data Isolation (If Used):** Pass only the *absolute minimum* necessary data to the custom view.  Avoid giving it access to sensitive data or application functionality.
6.  **Direct API Use (If Used):**  Use `MBProgressHUD's` `customView` property correctly.  Do not attempt to add the custom view directly to the view hierarchy.
7.  **Testing (If Used):**  Extensively test the custom view, including security testing.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: High - if a vulnerability exists):** A vulnerability in a custom view could allow code execution.
*   **Data Leakage (Severity: Medium to High):**  Depends on the data the custom view accesses.
*   **UI Manipulation (Severity: Low to Medium):** A compromised custom view could alter the UI.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced by *avoiding* custom views or through rigorous review.
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced by minimizing data access.
*   **UI Manipulation:** Risk reduced by keeping the custom view simple.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No custom views are currently used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   N/A - No custom views are used.  If introduced, *all* these steps are mandatory.
