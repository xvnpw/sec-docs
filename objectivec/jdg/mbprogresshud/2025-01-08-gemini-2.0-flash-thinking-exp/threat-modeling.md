# Threat Model Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Disclosure via HUD Label](./threats/sensitive_information_disclosure_via_hud_label.md)

**Description:** An attacker, observing the device screen, could read sensitive information directly displayed within the `label` property of the `MBProgressHUD`. This occurs if the application developers mistakenly use the HUD's label to present sensitive data like temporary tokens or user IDs during processing.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive user or system information, potentially leading to account compromise or further malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** `label` property of the `MBProgressHUD` object.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly avoid displaying any sensitive information within the `label` property.
* Use generic and non-identifiable messages for progress updates.
* Implement secure logging mechanisms on the backend for sensitive information instead of displaying it on the client-side UI.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in MBProgressHUD](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_mbprogresshud.md)

**Description:** The `MBProgressHUD` library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection flaws, memory corruption issues) within its codebase. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the version of the library used by the application. This exploitation would directly target the `MBProgressHUD` library's functionality.

**Impact:** Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution within the application's context, information disclosure by bypassing security checks within the HUD, or denial of service by crashing the HUD or the application.

**Affected Component:** The entire `MBProgressHUD` library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, can be Critical or High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Critically important:** Regularly update the `MBProgressHUD` library to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to `MBProgressHUD`.
* Employ dependency scanning tools in the development pipeline to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in the library.
* Consider the security track record and community support of third-party libraries before integrating them into the project.
