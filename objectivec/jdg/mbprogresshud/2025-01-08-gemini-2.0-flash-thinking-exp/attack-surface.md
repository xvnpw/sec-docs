# Attack Surface Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

## Attack Surface: [UI Redressing / UI Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/ui_redressing__ui_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the content displayed within the `MBProgressHUD` to deceive the user into believing they are interacting with a legitimate part of the application or to trick them into performing unintended actions.

**How MBProgressHUD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `MBProgressHUD` allows developers to display custom text, images, and even custom views. This direct capability of the library enables the injection of malicious or misleading content.

**Example:** An attacker could trigger the display of a progress HUD that mimics a legitimate login prompt, capturing user credentials when they attempt to interact with the fake overlay.

**Impact:** Loss of user trust, potential for credential theft, unauthorized actions performed by the user believing they are interacting with the real application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Carefully control the content displayed:** Ensure that the text, images, and custom views displayed in the HUD are generated from trusted sources and are not influenced by untrusted input.
* **Avoid displaying sensitive input fields:** Do not use the HUD to display input fields where users might enter sensitive information.
* **Clearly indicate the HUD's purpose:** Ensure the text and visuals within the HUD clearly communicate its intended function and are consistent with the application's branding.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation and Sanitization Issues (Related to Displayed Content)](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_and_sanitization_issues__related_to_displayed_content_.md)

**Description:** If the application displays user-provided or external data within the `MBProgressHUD`'s text labels without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to minor injection issues or unexpected rendering.

**How MBProgressHUD Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `MBProgressHUD` provides the functionality to set text labels. If this text is derived from untrusted sources and not sanitized, the library directly facilitates the display of potentially harmful content.

**Example:** Displaying a username directly in the HUD without escaping special characters could lead to unexpected formatting or, in rare cases, minor UI disruptions.

**Impact:** Minor UI glitches, potential for confusion or misinterpretation of the displayed information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize or escape user-provided data:** Before displaying any data in the HUD's text labels, ensure it is properly sanitized or escaped to prevent unintended rendering or potential injection issues.
* **Use parameterized or templated strings:** If displaying dynamic content, use parameterized strings or templating mechanisms to avoid direct string concatenation of untrusted data.
