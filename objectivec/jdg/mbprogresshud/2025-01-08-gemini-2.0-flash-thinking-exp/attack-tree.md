# Attack Tree Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To mislead application users into performing actions beneficial to the attacker by manipulating the information displayed through `MBProgressHUD`.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Root: Compromise Application Using MBProgressHUD [CRITICAL]
    *   1. Exploit Displayed Content [CRITICAL]
        *   1.1. Inject Malicious/Misleading Text [CRITICAL]
            *   1.1.1. Display Phishing Attempts ***
            *   1.1.2. Display Fake Error/Success Messages ***
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application Using MBProgressHUD [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_using_mbprogresshud__critical_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within `MBProgressHUD` leads to the compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Displayed Content [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_displayed_content__critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  The application displays information within the `MBProgressHUD` that is sourced from potentially untrusted sources or is not properly sanitized before display. This allows an attacker to manipulate what the user sees.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Inject Malicious/Misleading Text [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__inject_maliciousmisleading_text__critical_.md)

Attack Vector:  Attackers find ways to inject arbitrary text into the `MBProgressHUD`'s message. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in data fetching, insecure handling of user input, or compromising backend systems that provide the text content.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Display Phishing Attempts ***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__display_phishing_attempts.md)

Attack Vector: The application fetches data from an untrusted source (e.g., a compromised server, user input without validation) and displays it as the `MBProgressHUD` message. An attacker crafts this message to resemble legitimate application prompts, tricking users into revealing sensitive information (credentials, personal data) or performing malicious actions (clicking on harmful links).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Display Fake Error/Success Messages ***](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__display_fake_errorsuccess_messages.md)

Attack Vector:  Attackers manipulate the application's state or the data used to generate the `MBProgressHUD` message. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in application logic, data validation, or by directly manipulating data if access is gained. The attacker crafts messages that mislead the user about the outcome of an action, potentially leading them to make incorrect decisions or take unintended steps.
