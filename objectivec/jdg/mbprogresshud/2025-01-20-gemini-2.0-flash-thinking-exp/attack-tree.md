## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR: **Exploit Displayed Content** **(CRITICAL)**
    *   AND: **Inject Malicious Content into HUD Message** **(CRITICAL, HIGH-RISK)**
        *   OR: Compromise Backend Data Source **(HIGH-RISK)**
        *   OR: Exploit Client-Side Input Handling **(HIGH-RISK)**
    *   AND: **Display Phishing/Social Engineering Content** **(HIGH-RISK)**
*   OR: **Disrupt User Experience** **(HIGH-RISK)**
    *   AND: **Cause Denial of Service (DoS) through HUD Abuse** **(HIGH-RISK)**
        *   OR: Rapidly Show and Hide HUD
        *   OR: Display an Indefinite HUD
```


## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Displayed Content (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_displayed_content__critical_.md)

This node is critical because it represents the fundamental ability of an attacker to manipulate what the user sees within the MBProgressHUD. Success here opens the door to significant attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Inject Malicious Content into HUD Message (CRITICAL, HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/2__inject_malicious_content_into_hud_message__critical__high-risk_.md)

This is a high-risk path and a critical node because it allows attackers to inject harmful content directly into the UI element users are likely to trust.
    *   **Attack Vector: Compromise Backend Data Source (HIGH-RISK)**
        *   Technique: Inject malicious scripts or misleading text into data fetched by the application and displayed in the HUD.
        *   Likelihood: Medium-High (if backend lacks proper output encoding)
        *   Impact: High (XSS, data manipulation, redirection)
        *   Effort: Medium (requires backend access or injection vulnerability)
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires monitoring backend responses and frontend behavior)
    *   **Attack Vector: Exploit Client-Side Input Handling (HIGH-RISK)**
        *   Technique: If the application allows user input to be reflected in the HUD message without proper sanitization, inject malicious scripts or misleading text.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (if application uses user input in HUD messages unsafely)
        *   Impact: High (XSS, data manipulation, redirection)
        *   Effort: Low (requires crafting malicious input)
        *   Skill Level: Low-Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires monitoring user input and frontend behavior)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Display Phishing/Social Engineering Content (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/3__display_phishingsocial_engineering_content__high-risk_.md)

This path is high-risk because it directly targets user trust by displaying deceptive content within a seemingly legitimate UI element.
    *   Attack Vector: Craft misleading messages within the HUD to trick users into performing actions (e.g., entering credentials, clicking malicious links).
    *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on application's control over HUD content)
    *   Impact: High (credential theft, malware installation, unauthorized actions)
    *   Effort: Low (requires crafting convincing messages)
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires content analysis and user behavior monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Disrupt User Experience (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/4__disrupt_user_experience__high-risk_.md)

This node represents a category of attacks that aim to degrade the user experience, potentially leading to frustration or making the application unusable.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) through HUD Abuse (HIGH-RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/5__cause_denial_of_service__dos__through_hud_abuse__high-risk_.md)

This path is high-risk because it can make the application temporarily unusable, impacting business operations and user satisfaction.
    *   **Attack Vector: Rapidly Show and Hide HUD**
        *   Technique: Trigger the rapid and repeated display and dismissal of the HUD, potentially overwhelming the UI thread and making the application unresponsive.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (if no rate limiting on HUD display)
        *   Impact: Medium (temporary UI unresponsiveness)
        *   Effort: Low (requires repeatedly triggering HUD display)
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (performance monitoring, UI responsiveness checks)
    *   **Attack Vector: Display an Indefinite HUD**
        *   Technique: Exploit logic flaws to display a HUD that never dismisses, effectively blocking user interaction.
        *   Likelihood: Medium (if logic for dismissing HUD is flawed)
        *   Impact: Medium (application unusable until refresh/restart)
        *   Effort: Low (requires exploiting the dismissal flaw)
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (user reports, UI monitoring)
