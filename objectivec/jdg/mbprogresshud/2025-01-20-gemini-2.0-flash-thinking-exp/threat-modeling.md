# Threat Model Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Disclosure via Progress Message](./threats/sensitive_information_disclosure_via_progress_message.md)

**Description:** An attacker could observe the progress HUD displayed on the user's screen and gain access to sensitive information inadvertently included in the progress message or details. This happens because the application developers use the `MBProgressHUD` API to display sensitive data.

**Impact:** Confidential data could be exposed to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or further attacks based on the revealed information.

**Affected Component:** `label.text`, `detailsLabel.text` properties of the `MBProgressHUD` instance.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review all text displayed by `MBProgressHUD` before deployment.
* Avoid displaying any potentially sensitive information in the progress messages.
* Use generic and non-revealing progress messages.
* Implement code reviews to catch instances of sensitive data being used in HUD messages.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in MBProgressHUD Library](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_mbprogresshud_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `MBProgressHUD` library itself. This could potentially allow them to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, cause crashes, or gain unauthorized access to resources.

**Impact:**  The impact could range from application crashes and instability to complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's device, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** The entire `MBProgressHUD` library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if a severe vulnerability exists)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `MBProgressHUD` to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to `MBProgressHUD`.
* Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* If a critical vulnerability is discovered and cannot be patched immediately, consider alternative libraries or implementing custom progress indicators as a temporary workaround.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Custom View](./threats/code_injection_via_custom_view.md)

**Description:** If the application uses the `customView` feature of `MBProgressHUD` and dynamically loads or generates this view based on untrusted input, an attacker could inject malicious code. For example, if a `UIWebView` is used as a custom view and its content is derived from user input without proper sanitization, it could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This directly involves how the application utilizes the `customView` functionality of `MBProgressHUD`.

**Impact:**  Successful code injection could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application, potentially stealing user credentials, manipulating the UI, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**Affected Component:** The `customView` property of the `MBProgressHUD` instance and the code responsible for creating and populating the custom view.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user-provided input directly when creating custom views for `MBProgressHUD`.
* Sanitize and validate any external data used to generate custom view content.
* If using web views within custom views, implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Consider using safer alternatives to `UIWebView` if possible, such as `WKWebView` with appropriate security settings.
