# Attack Surface Analysis for jdg/mbprogresshud

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via HUD Messages](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_hud_messages.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Information Disclosure via HUD Messages
    *   **Description:** Sensitive or revealing information is displayed within the `MBProgressHUD`'s text message.
    *   **How MBProgressHUD Contributes:** `MBProgressHUD` provides a mechanism to display text to the user. If the application developers use this to show internal state, error details, or user-specific information, it becomes visible on the screen.
    *   **Example:** An error message displayed in the HUD might reveal the database query being executed, internal server names, or specific user identifiers that should not be publicly visible.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to privacy violations, provide attackers with insights into the application's architecture, and potentially aid in further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the sensitivity of the information disclosed).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly review all text displayed in `MBProgressHUD`. Avoid displaying sensitive data, internal implementation details, or verbose error messages. Use generic, user-friendly messages. Implement proper logging mechanisms for detailed error tracking instead of displaying them in the UI.
