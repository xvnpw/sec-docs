Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving MBProgressHUD with High or Critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Custom View Injection with Malicious Intent
    *   **Description:** The `customView` property allows developers to embed arbitrary `UIView` (iOS) or `NSView` (macOS) instances within the HUD, which could be exploited to inject malicious UI elements.
    *   **How MBProgressHUD Contributes:** MBProgressHUD offers the functionality to display these custom views without any inherent restrictions on their content or behavior.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could potentially influence the application (e.g., through a vulnerability in another part of the app) to set a malicious `customView` that mimics a legitimate input field to steal user credentials or inject interactive elements that trigger unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially Critical if the injected view can capture sensitive data (keylogging), manipulate the UI to perform unauthorized actions, or even lead to code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control the source and content of any `UIView` or `NSView` used as the `customView`.
        *   Only use custom views from trusted and well-vetted sources.
        *   Implement security checks and validation on the properties and behavior of any custom view before setting it as the HUD's `customView`.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege â€“ avoid using `customView` if the standard HUD elements suffice.
