# Attack Surface Analysis for sparkle-project/sparkle

## Attack Surface: [1. Appcast File Manipulation (Network-Based)](./attack_surfaces/1__appcast_file_manipulation__network-based_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify the appcast file to control the update process, directing users to malicious updates.
*   **How Sparkle Contributes:** Sparkle relies entirely on the appcast file as the definitive source for update information (URLs, versions, signatures).  Its integrity is the foundation of Sparkle's security.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to intercept the HTTPS connection to the appcast server and inject a modified appcast pointing to a malicious update.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise; attacker-controlled code execution on user machines.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   *Enforce HTTPS with Strict Validation:*  Use HTTPS *exclusively* for appcast delivery.  Implement strict certificate validation, ensuring it cannot be bypassed.  Consider certificate pinning (with careful planning for key rotation).
        *   *Secure Appcast Server:*  Protect the server hosting the appcast with robust security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention, regular security audits, and prompt patching).
        *   *Appcast Integrity Monitoring:* Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) on the appcast server to detect any unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [2. Signature Verification Bypass](./attack_surfaces/2__signature_verification_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass the digital signature verification of the downloaded update, allowing them to install malicious code.
*   **How Sparkle Contributes:** Sparkle's primary security mechanism is the verification of the update's digital signature against the developer's embedded public key.  This is *the* critical check.
*   **Example:** An attacker obtains the developer's private signing key (through theft, social engineering, or a server breach) and uses it to sign a malicious update that will pass Sparkle's verification.
*   **Impact:** Complete application compromise; attacker-controlled code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   *Secure Private Key (HSM):*  Protect the private signing key with the utmost care.  Use a Hardware Security Module (HSM) if at all possible.  Never store the private key in source control or on easily accessible systems.
        *   *Strong Signature Algorithm (Ed25519):*  Ensure Sparkle is configured to use a strong, modern signature algorithm like Ed25519.  Avoid older, weaker algorithms.
        *   *Keep Sparkle Updated:*  Regularly update to the latest stable release of Sparkle to benefit from any security patches that address potential verification logic flaws.
        *   *Code Review (Custom Delegates):*  Thoroughly review any custom `SUUpdaterDelegate` implementations to ensure they do *not* interfere with or weaken Sparkle's signature verification process.

## Attack Surface: [3. Downgrade Attacks](./attack_surfaces/3__downgrade_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers force the application to install an older, vulnerable version, reintroducing known security flaws that were previously patched.
*   **How Sparkle Contributes:** Sparkle, by default, does *not* prevent the installation of older versions.  This is a configuration choice left to the developer.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies the appcast to point to an older version of the application that contains a known, exploitable vulnerability. Sparkle, without downgrade protection, will install this older version.
*   **Impact:** Re-introduction of known vulnerabilities; potential for exploitation and compromise, potentially leading to full control.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   *Implement Downgrade Prevention:*  This is *essential*.  Use the `minimumSystemVersion` attribute in the appcast, or implement a custom `SUUpdaterDelegate` method, to *explicitly* prevent the installation of any version older than the currently installed one.
        *   *Monotonic Versioning:* Use a strictly increasing version numbering scheme (e.g., semantic versioning) to make downgrade detection straightforward and reliable.
