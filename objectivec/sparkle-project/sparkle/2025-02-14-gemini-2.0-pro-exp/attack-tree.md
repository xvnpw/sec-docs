## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Update Delivery Mechanism [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_update_delivery_mechanism__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching strategy of manipulating the update process to deliver malicious code. It's the most likely avenue of attack.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Update Channel](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_update_channel.md)

*   **Description:** Intercepting and modifying the communication between the application and the update server.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Intercept and Modify Appcast XML [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__intercept_and_modify_appcast_xml__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker intercepts the appcast XML file and changes its contents.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Change Update URL to Malicious Server [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__change_update_url_to_malicious_server__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker modifies the URL in the appcast to point to a server they control. This is a *critical* step because it redirects the entire update process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if HTTPS is used, but CA compromise or user tricked) / High (if HTTP is used)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2. Modify Update Package Hash (DSA/EdDSA/SHA256) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2__modify_update_package_hash__dsaeddsasha256___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker changes the cryptographic hash of the update package in the appcast. This allows them to provide a malicious package that Sparkle will accept (because the hash matches the modified appcast).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Intercept and Replace Update Package [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__intercept_and_replace_update_package__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  Instead of modifying the appcast, the attacker directly intercepts and replaces the downloaded update package with a malicious one. This requires bypassing or manipulating the hash check.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Compromise Appcast Hosting Server [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__compromise_appcast_hosting_server__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining control of the server that hosts the appcast XML file.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Gain Unauthorized Access (e.g., weak credentials, server vulnerability) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__gain_unauthorized_access__e_g___weak_credentials__server_vulnerability___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker exploits a vulnerability or uses weak credentials to gain access to the server. This is a *critical* first step.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Modify Appcast XML (as in 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__modify_appcast_xml__as_in_1_1_1_1__1_1_1_2___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Once the server is compromised, the attacker modifies the appcast file to point to a malicious update or change the hash.  This is *critical* for controlling the update process.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if 1.2.1 is successful)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3. Replace Legitimate Update Package with Malicious One [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3__replace_legitimate_update_package_with_malicious_one__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker replaces the legitimate update package on the server with a malicious one. This is a *critical* step to deliver the malicious payload.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if 1.2.1 is successful)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Compromise Developer's Code Signing Key [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__compromise_developer's_code_signing_key__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Obtaining the private key used to sign updates. This allows the attacker to sign malicious updates that Sparkle will trust.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Theft of Private Key (e.g., phishing, malware on developer machine) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__theft_of_private_key__e_g___phishing__malware_on_developer_machine___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker steals the private key through various means, such as phishing, malware, or physical theft. This is a *critical* step.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2. Compromise of Key Storage (e.g., insecure cloud storage, weak password) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2__compromise_of_key_storage__e_g___insecure_cloud_storage__weak_password___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the location where the private key is stored, even if they don't directly steal the key file. This is a *critical* step.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Social Engineering of the User](./attack_tree_paths/3__social_engineering_of_the_user.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing technical controls by manipulating the user.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Phishing Attack to Distribute a Modified Application [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__phishing_attack_to_distribute_a_modified_application__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Tricking the user into downloading and installing a modified version of the application that contains a compromised Sparkle configuration or a malicious update.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Convince user to download and install a "special" version with a compromised Sparkle configuration. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__convince_user_to_download_and_install_a_special_version_with_a_compromised_sparkle_configurat_ffa3a303.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques to persuade the user to install a malicious version of the application. This is a *critical* step.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
