# Threat Model Analysis for sparkle-project/sparkle

## Threat: [Update Feed Compromise (Spoofing)](./threats/update_feed_compromise__spoofing_.md)

Description: An attacker compromises the server hosting the `appcast.xml` update feed. They modify the feed to point to a malicious DMG or ZIP file, or to an older, vulnerable version of the application. This manipulates Sparkle into offering a compromised update.
Impact: Users downloading updates will receive malware, backdoors, or vulnerable application versions, leading to system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
Sparkle Component Affected: Update Feed parsing within Sparkle, directing the update process.
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Strong Server Security:** Secure the update server with access controls, audits, and patching.
*   **HTTPS for Feed URL:** Serve `appcast.xml` over HTTPS to prevent tampering in transit.
*   **Consider Feed Signing (Custom Implementation):** Implement a custom mechanism to sign the feed and verify in the application.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Update Feed Retrieval](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_update_feed_retrieval.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts network traffic when Sparkle retrieves the `appcast.xml`. They replace the legitimate feed with a malicious one, causing Sparkle to download a compromised update package.
Impact: Users downloading updates will receive malware, backdoors, or vulnerable application versions, leading to system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
Sparkle Component Affected: Update Feed Retrieval (network communication initiated by Sparkle).
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Enforce HTTPS for Feed URL:**  **Mandatory**. Use HTTPS for `SUFeedURL` in the application's Info.plist.
*   **HSTS on Server:** Configure the update server with HSTS headers to enforce HTTPS.
*   **Certificate Pinning (Advanced):** Implement certificate pinning in the application for stricter server certificate validation.

## Threat: [Update Package Download Compromise (Tampering)](./threats/update_package_download_compromise__tampering_.md)

Description: Even with a secure feed, an attacker intercepts the download of the DMG or ZIP update package pointed to by the feed. They replace the legitimate package with a malicious one, which Sparkle will then attempt to install.
Impact: Users installing the update will execute malware, backdoors, or corrupted application updates, leading to system compromise, data theft, or application instability.
Sparkle Component Affected: Update Package Download (network communication initiated by Sparkle), Update Installation process managed by Sparkle.
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Enforce HTTPS for Package URLs:** **Mandatory**. Ensure `url` tags in `appcast.xml` use HTTPS.
*   **Code Signing Verification (Sparkle Feature):**  **Crucial**. Rely on Sparkle's built-in code signature verification. Ensure proper code signing practices.
*   **Checksum Verification (Consider Implementation):** Add stronger checksum verification (e.g., SHA256 in feed) and verify before installation.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Code Signing Verification](./threats/weak_or_missing_code_signing_verification.md)

Description: If code signing is improperly implemented by the developer, or if Sparkle's signature verification is disabled or bypassed (due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in Sparkle), attackers can deliver unsigned or maliciously signed updates that Sparkle might accept.
Impact: Users may install malware disguised as legitimate updates through Sparkle, leading to system compromise, data theft, or backdoors.
Sparkle Component Affected: Code Signature Verification module within Sparkle.
Risk Severity: **Critical**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Robust Code Signing Practices:** Use a valid Developer ID certificate and secure key management.
*   **Enable and Verify Sparkle Signature Checking:** Ensure Sparkle's signature verification is enabled and functioning correctly.
*   **Regularly Update Sparkle:** Keep Sparkle updated for security patches and signature verification improvements.
*   **Test Update Process Regularly:** Verify the entire update process, including signature verification.

## Threat: [Downgrade Attacks](./threats/downgrade_attacks.md)

Description: An attacker manipulates the `appcast.xml` to offer an older, vulnerable application version as an "update." By modifying version numbers in the feed, they trick Sparkle into offering a downgrade.
Impact: Users are forced to downgrade to vulnerable versions through Sparkle, exposing them to known exploits and security risks.
Sparkle Component Affected: Update Feed parsing and version comparison logic within Sparkle.
Risk Severity: **High**
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Careful Version Management in Feed:**  Strictly control versions in `appcast.xml` to offer only newer, secure versions.
*   **Review Version Comparison Logic:** Understand Sparkle's version comparison to prevent unintended downgrades.
*   **Rollback Protection (Advanced):** Consider mechanisms to detect and prevent malicious downgrade attempts beyond Sparkle's defaults.
*   **Regularly Audit Update Feed Content:** Review `appcast.xml` to ensure correct version numbers and prevent downgrades.
