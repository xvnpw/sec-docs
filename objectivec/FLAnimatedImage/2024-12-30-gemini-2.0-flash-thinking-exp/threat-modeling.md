*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Large GIF Processing
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large GIF file to the application. When `FLAnimatedImage` attempts to decode and render this GIF, it could consume excessive CPU, memory, and potentially battery resources on the user's device.
    *   **Impact:** The application may become unresponsive, freeze, or crash. This can lead to a denial of service for the user, data loss if the application doesn't save state, and a negative user experience. On mobile devices, it could also lead to significant battery drain.
    *   **Affected Component:** `FLAnimatedImage`'s `initWithAnimatedGIFData:` or similar initialization methods, and the internal decoding and rendering pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement checks to limit the maximum file size of GIFs accepted by the application.
        *   Set timeouts for GIF decoding and rendering operations.
        *   Consider offloading GIF processing to a background thread to prevent blocking the main UI thread.
        *   Monitor resource usage during GIF processing and implement safeguards if thresholds are exceeded.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex GIF Structure
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a GIF with a complex internal structure (e.g., a very large number of frames, large frame dimensions, or intricate disposal methods) that requires significant processing power to decode and render.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to the large GIF threat, this can lead to excessive resource consumption, application slowdowns, freezes, and crashes, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `FLAnimatedImage`'s internal GIF decoding logic, particularly the frame processing and rendering components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement checks to limit the maximum number of frames allowed in a GIF.
        *   Implement checks to limit the maximum dimensions of individual frames within a GIF.
        *   Consider using a more robust and potentially resource-intensive decoding strategy for GIFs from untrusted sources, but with appropriate safeguards.

*   **Threat:** Memory Exhaustion due to Memory Leaks
    *   **Description:** A bug within `FLAnimatedImage`'s code could cause memory to be allocated but not properly released during GIF decoding or rendering. Repeatedly processing GIFs, especially those triggering the bug, can lead to a gradual increase in memory usage until the application exhausts available memory.
    *   **Impact:** The application will eventually crash due to out-of-memory errors. This can lead to data loss and a severe disruption of the user experience.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various parts of `FLAnimatedImage`'s memory management, potentially within the decoder, frame cache, or rendering components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update to the latest version of `FLAnimatedImage` to benefit from bug fixes and memory leak patches.
        *   Perform thorough testing, including memory leak detection tools, when integrating or updating `FLAnimatedImage`.
        *   Monitor the application's memory usage over time, especially when displaying animated GIFs.

*   **Threat:** Out-of-Bounds Read/Write during Decoding
    *   **Description:** A maliciously crafted GIF could exploit vulnerabilities in `FLAnimatedImage`'s decoding logic, causing it to attempt to read or write data outside of allocated memory buffers. This can be triggered by malformed header information, incorrect frame sizes, or other inconsistencies in the GIF data.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to application crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code (though this is less likely in the context of a pure image decoding library).
    *   **Affected Component:** The GIF decoding module within `FLAnimatedImage`, specifically the parts responsible for parsing the GIF structure and extracting frame data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use the latest stable version of `FLAnimatedImage` as it will contain fixes for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider implementing a secondary validation step for GIF data before passing it to `FLAnimatedImage`, although this can be complex.

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow in Size Calculations
    *   **Description:** A crafted GIF could contain values in its header or frame descriptors that, when used in size calculations within `FLAnimatedImage`, lead to integer overflows. This can result in incorrect memory allocation sizes or buffer boundaries.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads/writes, and application crashes. In some scenarios, it could potentially be exploited for code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** The GIF decoding module within `FLAnimatedImage`, specifically the parts responsible for parsing size information and allocating memory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure you are using a version of `FLAnimatedImage` that has addressed known integer overflow vulnerabilities.
        *   While difficult to implement externally, the library itself should ideally perform checks for potential integer overflows during size calculations.
