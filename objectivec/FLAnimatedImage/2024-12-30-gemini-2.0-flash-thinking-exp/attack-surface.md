Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `FLAnimatedImage` with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Malformed GIF File Processing**
    *   **Description:** The library parses and decodes GIF files. Maliciously crafted GIFs with invalid headers, frame data, or control structures can trigger errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   **How FLAnimatedImage Contributes:** The library's core functionality involves parsing and interpreting the complex GIF format, making it susceptible to issues arising from malformed input.
    *   **Example:** A GIF with an invalid logical screen descriptor could cause the library to read beyond allocated memory.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption leading to arbitrary code execution (though less likely in managed memory environments, still a concern in native code or through vulnerabilities in underlying libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on GIF data *before* passing it to `FLAnimatedImage`.
        *   Consider using a more secure GIF parsing library or sandboxing the GIF decoding process if feasible.
        *   Ensure the `FLAnimatedImage` library is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.

*   **Attack Surface: Integer Overflows/Underflows in Dimensions or Frame Counts**
    *   **Description:**  GIF headers contain information about image dimensions and the number of frames. Extremely large or negative values could lead to integer overflows or underflows during calculations *within the library*.
    *   **How FLAnimatedImage Contributes:** The library uses these values to allocate memory and manage the animation process. Incorrect calculations due to overflows can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues *within the library's memory space*.
    *   **Example:** A GIF with an excessively large width and height could cause an integer overflow when calculating the total memory needed for the image buffer, leading to a heap overflow when the library attempts to allocate insufficient memory.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement checks to ensure that image dimensions and frame counts are within reasonable and expected limits *before* processing the GIF with `FLAnimatedImage`.
        *   Review the `FLAnimatedImage` source code for potential integer overflow vulnerabilities and consider contributing fixes if found.

*   **Attack Surface: Infinite Loops in Decoding Logic**
    *   **Description:** A maliciously crafted GIF could potentially trigger an infinite loop within the library's decoding or rendering logic.
    *   **How FLAnimatedImage Contributes:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities in the decoding algorithms *within `FLAnimatedImage`* could be exploited by specific GIF structures to cause the library to enter an infinite loop.
    *   **Example:** A GIF with a specific sequence of control blocks could cause the decoding algorithm to get stuck in a loop, consuming CPU indefinitely.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application freeze.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test the application with a wide range of potentially malicious GIFs, including those designed to trigger edge cases in the decoding logic of `FLAnimatedImage`.
        *   Keep the `FLAnimatedImage` library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource monitoring to detect and handle potential infinite loops.
