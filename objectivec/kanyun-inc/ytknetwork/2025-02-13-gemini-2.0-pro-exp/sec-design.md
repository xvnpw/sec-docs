Okay, let's create a detailed design document for the `ytknetwork` project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a secure and reliable overlay network for Kubernetes clusters.
*   Simplify network management for applications deployed across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
*   Enable secure communication between services in different clusters, potentially spanning different cloud providers or on-premise environments.
*   Offer a solution that integrates well with existing Kubernetes tooling and workflows.
*   Minimize operational overhead and complexity.
*   Provide network observability.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Unauthorized access to services and data within the overlay network.
*   Compromise of the network control plane, leading to network disruption or data breaches.
*   Data leakage or interception during inter-cluster communication.
*   Denial-of-service attacks targeting the network infrastructure.
*   Misconfiguration leading to network vulnerabilities or connectivity issues.
*   Supply chain attacks targeting the project's dependencies or build process.
*   Lack of visibility into network traffic, hindering incident response and troubleshooting.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Network policies enforced by Cilium CNI. (Described in the GitHub repository's documentation and implementation).
*   security control: Mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-cluster communication using SPIRE. (Described in the GitHub repository and SPIRE integration).
*   security control: Use of Kubernetes Secrets for storing sensitive information (e.g., SPIRE trust bundles). (Implicit in Kubernetes best practices and likely used in the project's deployment configurations).
*   security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Kubernetes to manage access to network resources. (Standard Kubernetes practice, assumed to be in place).
*   security control: Network segmentation provided by Kubernetes namespaces and Cilium network policies. (Described in the GitHub repository and Cilium documentation).
*   security control: Use of signed container images. (Described in the GitHub repository).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying Kubernetes clusters and their infrastructure. The project assumes that the underlying Kubernetes clusters are properly secured.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration of Cilium network policies or SPIRE settings, leading to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The complexity of managing SPIRE and its integration with Cilium may introduce operational challenges and potential security risks if not handled correctly.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement regular vulnerability scanning of container images and dependencies.
*   security control: Integrate a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized logging and threat detection.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of the deployed network infrastructure.
*   security control: Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
*   security control: Enforce strict least privilege access control for all components of the system.
*   security control: Implement a robust incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively.
*   security control: Provide comprehensive documentation and training on secure configuration and operation of the system.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All inter-cluster communication must be authenticated using mTLS.
    *   Access to the network control plane must be authenticated using strong authentication mechanisms.
    *   All components must authenticate with each other using SPIFFE IDs provided by SPIRE.

*   Authorization:
    *   RBAC must be used to control access to network resources and management functions.
    *   Network policies must be implemented to restrict network traffic to the minimum necessary for application functionality (least privilege).
    *   Access to sensitive data (e.g., SPIRE trust bundles) must be restricted to authorized components and users.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input to the system's APIs and control plane must be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Configuration parameters must be validated to ensure they are within acceptable ranges and formats.

*   Cryptography:
    *   mTLS must use strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.
    *   All sensitive data stored at rest must be encrypted.
    *   Cryptographic keys must be managed securely, following best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  **Multi-Cluster Kubernetes with Shared Control Plane (Less Likely):**  All Kubernetes clusters share a single control plane. This is less common and has significant security implications.
2.  **Multi-Cluster Kubernetes with Separate Control Planes (Most Likely):** Each Kubernetes cluster has its own independent control plane. This is the standard and more secure approach.
3.  **Hybrid Cloud Deployment:** Clusters span across different cloud providers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and/or on-premise environments.

Chosen Solution (for detailed description): **Multi-Cluster Kubernetes with Separate Control Planes (Option 2)**

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Secure inter-cluster communication.
*   Network connectivity for applications.
*   Management and configuration of the overlay network.

Data to Protect:

*   **Application Data (High Sensitivity):** Data transmitted between services in different clusters. This data's sensitivity depends on the specific applications using the network.
*   **SPIFFE IDs and Trust Bundles (High Sensitivity):** Used for mTLS authentication. Compromise could lead to impersonation and unauthorized access.
*   **Network Configuration (Medium Sensitivity):** Configuration settings for Cilium and SPIRE. Misconfiguration could lead to network vulnerabilities.
*   **Logs (Medium Sensitivity):** Audit logs and network traffic logs. Can contain sensitive information about network activity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific cloud providers or on-premise environments are targeted for deployment?
*   What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that the system must adhere to?
*   What is the expected scale of the deployment (number of clusters, nodes, services)?
*   What are the existing monitoring and logging solutions in place?
*   What is the process for managing and rotating cryptographic keys?
*   Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints?
*   What level of network observability is required?  Are there existing tools that need to be integrated?
*   What is the expected frequency of updates and deployments?
*   Is there a dedicated security team responsible for reviewing and approving changes?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization has a moderate risk appetite, balancing security with operational efficiency.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The underlying Kubernetes clusters are properly secured and maintained.  Existing Kubernetes RBAC is correctly configured.
*   DESIGN: The deployment will use separate Kubernetes control planes for each cluster.  GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD.  Container images are stored in a secure registry.
