## Attack Tree Path: [[1. Bypass Request Validation]](./attack_tree_paths/_1__bypass_request_validation_.md)

*   **[1a. Override Base URL] (HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the base URL used by `ytknetwork` to send requests, redirecting them to a malicious server controlled by the attacker. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in how the application handles user input or configuration settings related to the base URL.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on how base URLs are handled; if user input is involved without proper sanitization, likelihood increases significantly.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can redirect requests to a malicious server, leading to complete data compromise (credentials, sensitive data) or phishing attacks.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Finding the vulnerability might be easy (e.g., exposed configuration setting); exploiting it depends on the attacker's server setup.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of HTTP requests and how URLs are constructed and used.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Traffic analysis might reveal unusual redirects, but it could be obfuscated (e.g., using URL shorteners, compromised legitimate servers).

*   **[1b. Bypass Argument Validation] (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker provides crafted input to API request parameters that bypasses `ytknetwork`'s validation (if any), allowing malicious data to be passed to the backend server. This is a classic injection vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - Very common vulnerability if input validation is weak or missing.  Many applications fail to properly sanitize all inputs.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Can lead to SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other severe exploits, potentially giving full control of the application or database.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Many automated tools (e.g., SQLmap) exist for finding and exploiting these vulnerabilities. Manual exploitation is also possible with basic knowledge.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate - Basic SQL injection or command injection knowledge is often sufficient. More sophisticated attacks require more skill.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Can be difficult to detect without proper logging, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and web application firewalls (WAFs).  Attackers can obfuscate their payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2. Inject Malicious Payload]](./attack_tree_paths/_2__inject_malicious_payload_.md)

*   **[2a. Craft Malicious JSON/XML] (HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends a specially crafted JSON or XML payload that exploits vulnerabilities in the server-side parsing logic. This could lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or data leakage.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - If the server doesn't properly validate or sanitize JSON/XML input, and uses a vulnerable parser.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to data breaches, code execution, or denial of service.  Severity depends on the server-side vulnerability.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of JSON/XML parsing vulnerabilities and how to craft exploits.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires knowledge of common XML/JSON vulnerabilities (e.g., XXE, billion laughs attack).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Requires deep inspection of request payloads and server-side behavior.  May require specialized security tools.

*   **[2b. Inject SQL/Code into Arguments] (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious SQL or code (e.g., shell commands, JavaScript) into API request parameters. If the server-side code doesn't properly sanitize these parameters, the injected code will be executed.
    *   **Likelihood:** High - If the server uses unsanitized input in SQL queries or code execution, this is a very common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Very High - Complete database compromise (read, modify, delete data), server takeover, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Automated tools and well-known techniques (e.g., SQL injection cheat sheets) exist.
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate - Basic SQL injection can be learned quickly.  More advanced techniques require more skill.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Requires database monitoring, intrusion detection, and careful analysis of SQL queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3. Tamper with Request Parameters]](./attack_tree_paths/_3__tamper_with_request_parameters_.md)

*   **[3a. Modify Headers] (HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates HTTP headers sent by `ytknetwork`. This could involve modifying authentication tokens, content types, or other headers to bypass security controls or cause unexpected behavior.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on how headers are handled and whether they are exposed to modification by the client or during transit.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can bypass authentication, authorization, inject malicious directives (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting protection bypass), or cause application errors.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Requires understanding of HTTP headers and their purpose. Tools like Burp Suite can be used to intercept and modify requests.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires knowledge of HTTP and web application security concepts.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring of HTTP headers for anomalies and unexpected values.

## Attack Tree Path: [[4. Intercept & Modify Cached Responses]](./attack_tree_paths/_4__intercept_&_modify_cached_responses_.md)

*   **[4b. Poison Cache with Modified Responses] (HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker manages to inject malicious data into the cache used by `ytknetwork`.  Subsequent requests will then receive the attacker's modified response, potentially leading to XSS, data leakage, or other attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the cache's vulnerability to injection attacks.  Requires the attacker to be able to influence the cache content.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can serve malicious content to users for an extended period, affecting multiple users.  The impact depends on the content being cached.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires finding a way to inject malicious responses into the cache, which may involve exploiting other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of caching mechanisms and potential injection points.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Requires monitoring cache content and comparing it to expected values.  May require analyzing server logs and network traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[5. Inject Malicious Payload (Response)]](./attack_tree_paths/_5__inject_malicious_payload__response__.md)

*   **[5b. Inject XSS Payload] (HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious response that includes JavaScript code. If `ytknetwork` or the application using it doesn't properly sanitize the response before displaying it in a web browser, the attacker's code will execute in the context of the user's browser.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High - If the response data is rendered in a web browser without proper sanitization or output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to session hijacking (stealing user cookies), data theft, defacement of the web page, and redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Many XSS payloads are readily available online.  Crafting a targeted payload may require more effort.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and how browsers handle untrusted content.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires web application security testing (e.g., using a web vulnerability scanner) and monitoring for unusual client-side behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[6. Tamper with Response Data]](./attack_tree_paths/_6__tamper_with_response_data_.md)

*   **[6b. Modify Response Body] (HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts and modifies the response body returned by the server. This could involve injecting malicious code, altering data, or removing critical information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the ability to intercept and modify responses (e.g., through a MITM attack).  HTTPS makes this more difficult.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can alter the data displayed to the user, inject malicious content (e.g., XSS, malware), or disrupt application functionality.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires intercepting and modifying the response in transit, which can be challenging with HTTPS.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires knowledge of network protocols and potentially tools for intercepting and modifying network traffic.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires traffic analysis, content validation, and integrity checks (e.g., comparing checksums).

## Attack Tree Path: [[7. Denial of Service via Response Handling]](./attack_tree_paths/_7__denial_of_service_via_response_handling_.md)

*   **[7b. Trigger Excessive Retries] (HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts responses that intentionally trigger `ytknetwork`'s retry mechanism. By repeatedly causing failures that lead to retries, the attacker can exhaust server resources and cause a denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the retry logic and error handling implemented in `ytknetwork` and the application.  If retries are not properly limited, the likelihood is higher.
    *   **Impact:** High - Can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and cause denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Requires understanding the retry mechanism and crafting responses that trigger retries.
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of network protocols and application logic.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Requires monitoring retry rates, server resource usage, and application performance.  Unusually high retry rates would be a strong indicator.
