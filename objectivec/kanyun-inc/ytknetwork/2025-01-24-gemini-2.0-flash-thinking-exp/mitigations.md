    4.  **Review and Remediate `ytknetwork` Vulnerabilities:** Establish a process to review vulnerability reports generated by the SCA tool, focusing on vulnerabilities identified in `ytknetwork` and its dependencies. Prioritize and remediate these vulnerabilities based on severity.
    5.  **Maintain Updated Vulnerability Database:** Ensure the SCA tool uses an up-to-date vulnerability database to accurately detect the latest known vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` and its dependencies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` Library Itself (Known or Zero-Day) (Severity: High)
    *   Vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` Library's Dependencies (Severity: Medium)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` Library Itself (Known or Zero-Day) (Impact: High)
    *   Vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` Library's Dependencies (Impact: Medium)
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Dependency vulnerability scanning, specifically targeting `ytknetwork` and its dependencies, is not currently implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Integrate an SCA tool into the CI/CD pipeline and configure it to scan for vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` and its dependencies. Establish a workflow for reviewing and addressing identified vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS/TLS Configuration in `ytknetwork`](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_httpstls_configuration_in__ytknetwork_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `ytknetwork` for HTTPS Only:**  Explicitly configure `ytknetwork` to use HTTPS for all network communication. If possible, disable any options that allow for insecure HTTP connections.
    2.  **Verify TLS/SSL Settings:** Review the configuration options provided by `ytknetwork` related to TLS/SSL. Ensure that strong TLS/SSL settings are enabled and weak or insecure options are avoided.
    3.  **Check for Certificate Validation:** Confirm that `ytknetwork` is configured to properly validate server certificates during TLS/SSL handshakes. Ensure that certificate validation is not disabled or weakened.
    4.  **Test HTTPS Enforcement with `ytknetwork`:**  Conduct tests to verify that all network requests initiated by `ytknetwork` are indeed using HTTPS and that attempts to use HTTP are rejected or automatically upgraded to HTTPS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Caching Mechanisms Related to `ytknetwork` (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_caching_mechanisms_related_to__ytknetwork___if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Investigate `ytknetwork` Caching Features:** Determine if `ytknetwork` library itself provides any built-in caching mechanisms for network responses. Review the library's documentation and code.
    2.  **Assess Security of `ytknetwork` Cache (If Present):** If `ytknetwork` has caching features, investigate how it stores cached data. Determine if sensitive data is cached and if the caching mechanism provides any security features like encryption or access control.
    3.  **Implement Secure Caching Practices (If Needed):** If `ytknetwork`'s caching is used for sensitive data and lacks sufficient security, implement additional security measures. This might involve:
        *   Disabling caching of sensitive data within `ytknetwork` if possible.
        *   Encrypting the cache storage used by `ytknetwork` at rest.
        *   Implementing secure access controls to the cache storage location.
    4.  **If Application-Level Caching with `ytknetwork` Data:** If the application implements its own caching of data fetched using `ytknetwork`, apply secure caching practices to this application-level cache, including encryption and access controls for sensitive data.
    5.  **Regularly Review Caching Configuration:** Periodically review the caching configuration related to `ytknetwork` and the application to ensure that security measures remain effective and are aligned with data sensitivity.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Insecure Data Handling by `ytknetwork` or Misuse Leading to Data Exposure (Severity: Medium) - specifically related to cached data if `ytknetwork` or application caching is insecure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Insecure Data Handling by `ytknetwork` or Misuse Leading to Data Exposure (Impact: Medium) - reduced by securing caching mechanisms.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General secure data storage practices are in place, but specific investigation and security measures for caching mechanisms potentially used by or with `ytknetwork` are not fully addressed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to investigate `ytknetwork`'s caching capabilities and assess the security of any caching mechanisms used by the library or the application in conjunction with `ytknetwork`. Implement secure caching practices if sensitive data is cached.
