# BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Business Priorities and Goals:
    *   Provide a reusable, cross-platform C++ network library (`ytknetwork`) to simplify network programming for internal projects.
    *   Enhance development efficiency by offering a robust and feature-rich networking component, reducing the need to develop network functionalities from scratch for each project.
    *   Potentially offer `ytknetwork` as a product or service to external users in the future, expanding the company's offerings.
    *   Ensure the library is performant, reliable, and secure to meet the demands of various applications.
*   Most Important Business Risks:
    *   Security vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` could be exploited in applications that depend on it, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and reputational damage.
    *   Poor performance or instability of the library could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications using it, affecting user experience and business operations.
    *   Lack of maintainability or inadequate documentation could increase development costs and risks associated with long-term usage and updates.
    *   If intended for external use, failing to meet security and quality expectations could harm the company's reputation and hinder market adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: TLS/SSL support for encrypted communication. Implemented within the library's networking functionalities, enabling secure data transmission over networks. Described in the library's documentation and examples related to secure sockets and protocols.
*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (e.g., OpenSSL) used by `ytknetwork`. Mitigation relies on timely updates of dependencies and monitoring security advisories.
    *   accepted risk: Undiscovered vulnerabilities in the `ytknetwork` codebase itself. Mitigation relies on ongoing code reviews, testing, and community feedback if open-sourced or used externally.
*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) tools in the build pipeline to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    *   security control: Integrate dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by `ytknetwork` and ensure timely updates.
    *   security control: Conduct regular dynamic application security testing (DAST) or penetration testing on applications that utilize `ytknetwork` to identify runtime security issues.
    *   security control: Implement fuzz testing to discover input validation vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior when handling malformed network data.
    *   security control: Establish a security incident response plan to effectively handle any security vulnerabilities discovered in `ytknetwork` or applications using it.
    *   security control: Implement security logging and monitoring within applications using `ytknetwork` to detect and respond to potential security incidents in runtime.
    *   security control: Provide security training for developers contributing to `ytknetwork` to promote secure coding practices and awareness of common network security vulnerabilities.
*   Security Requirements:
    *   Authentication:
        *   `ytknetwork` itself does not handle application-level authentication.
        *   Requirement: Ensure applications using `ytknetwork` implement appropriate authentication mechanisms when required.
        *   Requirement: `ytknetwork` should support secure transport protocols like TLS, which can provide mutual authentication at the transport layer if configured.
    *   Authorization:
        *   `ytknetwork` itself does not enforce application-level authorization.
        *   Requirement: Applications using `ytknetwork` must implement their own authorization logic to control access to resources and functionalities.
        *   Requirement: `ytknetwork` should not bypass or interfere with any authorization mechanisms implemented by applications.
    *   Input Validation:
        *   Requirement: `ytknetwork` must rigorously validate all network inputs to prevent vulnerabilities such as injection attacks (e.g., command injection, format string bugs), buffer overflows, and denial-of-service attacks.
        *   Requirement: Input validation should be performed at multiple layers, including protocol parsing, data deserialization, and handling of user-provided data within network messages.
    *   Cryptography:
        *   Requirement: When using cryptography (e.g., for TLS/SSL), `ytknetwork` must use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries (like OpenSSL).
        *   Requirement: Proper key management practices should be followed if `ytknetwork` is involved in key handling (though less likely for a general network library).
        *   Requirement: Ensure that cryptographic operations are implemented correctly to avoid common pitfalls like side-channel attacks or misuse of APIs.

```

*   Build Process Description:
    *   Developers commit code changes to a Source Code Control system (e.g., Git/GitHub).
    *   A Build System (CI/CD pipeline, e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered upon code changes.

        *   Dependency scanning is performed to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   The Build System compiles the C++ code using a compiler.
    *   Build Artifacts (libraries, headers) are generated.
    *   Build Artifacts are published to an Artifact Repository (e.g., NuGet feed, internal repository) for consumption by other projects and applications.

*   Build Process Security Controls:

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   The critical business processes that `ytknetwork` supports are dependent on the applications that utilize it. If applications built with `ytknetwork` are involved in core business operations such as:
        *   Customer communication and data exchange.
        *   Internal system communication and data flow.
        *   Potentially, if offered externally, applications of external customers.
    *   Disruption or compromise of these processes due to vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` could significantly impact business continuity, data security, and customer trust.
*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   The sensitivity of data handled by `ytknetwork` also depends on the applications using it. Given that it's a network library, it could potentially handle:
        *   Sensitive user data (PII - Personally Identifiable Information) if applications transmit user data over the network.
        *   Authentication credentials if applications implement authentication mechanisms over network connections.
        *   Confidential business data if used for internal communications.
        *   Financial data if applications are involved in financial transactions.
    *   The sensitivity level can range from low to high depending on the specific application context. For threat modeling purposes, it's prudent to assume that `ytknetwork` might handle sensitive data and design security controls accordingly.
