## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning of `ytknetwork` Code](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_of__ytknetwork__code.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize Static Analysis Tools:** Employ Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools capable of analyzing Objective-C code. These tools can scan the source code of `ytknetwork` for potential security weaknesses.
2.  **Scan `ytknetwork` Source Code:** Configure the SAST tool to specifically analyze the `ytknetwork` library's source code, especially if you have included the source directly in your project or are using a forked version.
3.  **Review SAST Findings:** Examine the reports generated by the SAST tool. Prioritize findings that indicate potential vulnerabilities within `ytknetwork` itself.
4.  **Investigate and Report Issues:** If vulnerabilities are identified in `ytknetwork` by the SAST tool, investigate them thoroughly. If confirmed, consider reporting them to the `ytknetwork` maintainers (if appropriate) and implement workarounds or patches in your application if necessary.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` Code (Medium to High Severity):**  SAST can detect coding errors, insecure function usage, or logic flaws within `ytknetwork`'s implementation that could be exploited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `ytknetwork` Code:** **Moderate to Significant** risk reduction, depending on the effectiveness of the SAST tool and the nature of identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Unlikely to be a standard practice unless the project already uses SAST tools for general code quality and security).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Absence of automated or regular SAST scanning specifically targeting the `ytknetwork` library's source code within the development process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS via `ytknetwork` Configuration (If Available)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_via__ytknetwork__configuration__if_available_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Check `ytknetwork` API/Configuration:** Review the `ytknetwork` documentation and API to determine if it provides any configuration options to enforce the use of HTTPS for all network requests.
2.  **Configure HTTPS Preference (If Possible):** If `ytknetwork` offers such settings, configure it to default to HTTPS and, ideally, to reject or warn against making HTTP requests unless explicitly allowed and justified.
3.  **Verify HTTPS Usage:**  Use network inspection tools (like Charles Proxy or similar) during development and testing to confirm that all network requests initiated by your application through `ytknetwork` are indeed using the HTTPS protocol.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):**  Ensuring HTTPS usage via `ytknetwork`'s configuration (if possible) helps prevent accidental or unintentional use of insecure HTTP connections, mitigating MITM attacks.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** HTTPS encryption protects data in transit from eavesdropping, which is enforced by ensuring `ytknetwork` uses HTTPS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** **Moderate to Significant** risk reduction, depending on how effectively `ytknetwork`'s configuration can enforce HTTPS.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** **Moderate to Significant** risk reduction by ensuring encrypted communication via HTTPS through `ytknetwork`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Likely depends on whether `ytknetwork` provides explicit HTTPS enforcement configuration options, which needs to be verified).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing configuration within `ytknetwork` (if available) to strictly enforce HTTPS usage for all requests made through the library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/SSL Configuration via `ytknetwork` (If Available)](./mitigation_strategies/tlsssl_configuration_via__ytknetwork___if_available_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Examine `ytknetwork` TLS/SSL Options:** Investigate if `ytknetwork` exposes any API or configuration settings to customize TLS/SSL behavior for network connections. This might include options to specify minimum TLS versions, cipher suites, or certificate validation policies.
2.  **Harden TLS/SSL Settings (If Configurable):** If `ytknetwork` allows TLS/SSL configuration, use it to:
    *   Disable support for outdated protocols like SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1.
    *   Prioritize strong and modern cipher suites.
    *   Ensure strict certificate validation is enabled (and potentially configure pinning if supported).
3.  **Test TLS/SSL Configuration:** Use network security testing tools or libraries to verify that the TLS/SSL configuration applied through `ytknetwork` is effective and secure.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Downgrade Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** By configuring `ytknetwork` to disallow weak TLS/SSL protocols, you reduce the risk of downgrade attacks that force the use of less secure protocols.
    *   **Cipher Suite Weaknesses (Medium Severity):**  Configuring `ytknetwork` to prefer strong cipher suites mitigates risks associated with weak encryption algorithms.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Downgrade Attacks:** **Moderate** risk reduction, depending on the level of TLS/SSL configuration control offered by `ytknetwork`.
    *   **Cipher Suite Weaknesses:** **Moderate** risk reduction by ensuring stronger encryption is used for `ytknetwork` connections.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Dependent on `ytknetwork`'s TLS/SSL configuration capabilities, which need to be assessed).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing configuration of TLS/SSL settings within `ytknetwork` to enhance connection security, if such configuration is possible through the library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Certificate Validation Verification in `ytknetwork`](./mitigation_strategies/certificate_validation_verification_in__ytknetwork_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Check `ytknetwork` Certificate Handling:** Review `ytknetwork`'s documentation and code to understand how it handles server certificates during HTTPS connections. Determine if it provides any mechanisms to:
    *   Verify that certificate validation is enabled by default.
    *   Customize certificate validation behavior (e.g., custom trust stores, pinning).
    *   Handle certificate validation errors and provide callbacks or error codes.
2.  **Implement Certificate Validation Error Handling:** Ensure your application code that uses `ytknetwork` properly handles any certificate validation errors reported by `ytknetwork`. Do not bypass or ignore these errors silently. Log errors and inform the user appropriately if a secure connection cannot be established due to certificate issues.
3.  **Consider Certificate Pinning (If `ytknetwork` Supports):** If `ytknetwork` offers certificate pinning capabilities, implement pinning for critical APIs to further enhance security against MITM attacks, especially those involving compromised Certificate Authorities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **MITM Attacks via Certificate Spoofing (High Severity):** Verifying and properly handling certificate validation within `ytknetwork` helps prevent MITM attacks where attackers present fraudulent certificates.
    *   **Compromised Certificate Authorities (Medium to High Severity):** Certificate pinning (if supported by `ytknetwork`) provides an additional layer of defense against attacks involving compromised CAs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks via Certificate Spoofing:** **Moderate to Significant** risk reduction, depending on the robustness of `ytknetwork`'s certificate validation and your error handling.
    *   **Compromised Certificate Authorities:** **Moderate to Significant** risk reduction if certificate pinning is implemented via `ytknetwork`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially (Default certificate validation might be handled by underlying libraries, but explicit verification and error handling within the application's `ytknetwork` usage might be missing).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing explicit verification of certificate validation settings in `ytknetwork`, robust error handling for certificate validation failures in application code, and implementation of certificate pinning if supported by `ytknetwork`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Caching Configuration in `ytknetwork` (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_caching_configuration_in__ytknetwork___if_applicable_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Assess `ytknetwork` Caching Features:** Determine if `ytknetwork provides built-in caching mechanisms for network responses. Review its documentation and API to understand how caching is implemented, where cached data is stored, and if any security-related configuration options are available.
2.  **Configure Secure Caching Options (If Available):** If `ytknetwork` offers configuration for caching, prioritize secure options such as:
    *   Disabling caching for sensitive data types.
    *   Enabling encryption for cached data at rest.
    *   Setting appropriate cache expiration policies.
    *   Restricting access to the cache storage location.
3.  **Minimize Sensitive Data Caching via `ytknetwork`:** Even with secure caching options, minimize the caching of sensitive data through `ytknetwork` whenever possible. Re-fetch sensitive data when needed rather than relying on cached copies for extended periods.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Cached Sensitive Data (Medium to High Severity):** If `ytknetwork` caches sensitive data insecurely (unencrypted, accessible storage), attackers gaining access to the device or application's storage could retrieve this data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Cached Sensitive Data:** **Moderate to Significant** risk reduction, depending on the security features offered by `ytknetwork`'s caching configuration and how effectively they are utilized.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Likely depends on whether `ytknetwork` has built-in caching features and configurable security options for caching, which needs to be investigated).
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Potentially missing configuration of secure caching options within `ytknetwork` (if caching is used and configurable), and potentially over-reliance on caching sensitive data through `ytknetwork` without proper security measures.
