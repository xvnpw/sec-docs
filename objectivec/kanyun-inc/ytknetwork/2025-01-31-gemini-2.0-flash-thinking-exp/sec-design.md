# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `ytknetwork`, is a Kotlin Multiplatform library designed to simplify and standardize network operations across different platforms. The primary business priority is to provide developers with a reusable, efficient, and reliable networking solution that reduces development time and effort when building applications that require network communication on multiple platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, JVM, JavaScript).

Business goals include:
- Enhancing developer productivity by providing a consistent and easy-to-use networking API.
- Promoting code reusability across different platforms, reducing development costs and time.
- Ensuring the reliability and performance of network communication in applications built using the library.
- Potentially establishing `kanyun-inc` as a provider of high-quality, cross-platform libraries.

Most important business risks to address:
- Risk of defects or vulnerabilities in the library that could negatively impact applications using it, leading to application instability, data breaches, or service disruptions.
- Risk of poor performance or inefficiency in the library, which could degrade the performance of applications using it.
- Risk of low adoption if the library is not user-friendly, lacks necessary features, or is not well-documented.
- Risk of compatibility issues with different platforms or changes in platform APIs that could break the library's functionality.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Standard software development practices are assumed, including version control (Git), code reviews (potentially), and testing. Location: GitHub repository history and project structure.
- security control: Dependency management using Gradle and Kotlin Multiplatform mechanisms. Location: `build.gradle.kts` files.
- accepted risk: Initial versions of the library might not have undergone extensive security audits or penetration testing.
- accepted risk: Security features might be implemented incrementally, focusing on core functionality first.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Conduct regular security code reviews by experienced security engineers.
- security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security advisory policy.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a networking library itself, as authentication is typically handled by the applications using the library or the backend services they communicate with. However, the library should support secure communication protocols (like HTTPS) that often involve authentication.
- Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is primarily the responsibility of the applications and backend services. The library should not enforce authorization but should provide mechanisms to transmit and handle authorization tokens or credentials securely if needed by the application.
- Input validation: security requirement: Implement robust input validation within the library to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks. This is crucial when handling network requests and responses, especially when parsing data from external sources. Validation should be applied to all data received from the network before processing it.
- Cryptography: security requirement: Utilize secure cryptographic practices when implementing features that require encryption or decryption. Prefer established and well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms. Ensure proper key management if the library handles any cryptographic keys (though unlikely for a general networking library). For secure communication, the library should support and encourage the use of TLS/SSL.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code for the `ytknetwork` library and commit changes to a Version Control System (VCS), assumed to be GitHub in this case, given the repository URL.
2. Version Control System (GitHub): GitHub hosts the source code and triggers the CI/CD pipeline upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
3. CI/CD System (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used as the CI/CD system to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. It is triggered by events in the VCS.
4. Build Environment: A controlled and isolated environment is set up by the CI/CD system to build the library. This environment includes necessary dependencies (JDK, Android SDK, etc.) and build tools (Gradle).
5. Code Analysis Tools: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools and linters are integrated into the build process to automatically analyze the code for potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
6. Artifact Repository (Maven Central/GitHub Packages): After successful build and tests, and passing code analysis checks, the library artifacts (JAR files, AAR files, etc.) are packaged, signed, and published to an artifact repository. This could be Maven Central for public releases or GitHub Packages for internal or pre-releases.
7. Application Build Process: Applications that depend on the `ytknetwork` library will fetch the artifacts from the artifact repository as a dependency during their own build process.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process: Providing reliable and secure network communication for applications built using the `ytknetwork` library. If the library fails or has security vulnerabilities, it directly impacts all applications relying on it, potentially disrupting their functionality and compromising their security.

Data we are trying to protect:
- Source code of the `ytknetwork` library: Confidentiality and integrity of the source code are important to prevent unauthorized modifications and intellectual property theft. Sensitivity: High.
- Build artifacts (JARs, AARs): Integrity and authenticity of the build artifacts are crucial to ensure that applications are using a genuine and untampered version of the library. Sensitivity: High.
- Network traffic handled by applications using the library: The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the applications themselves. The library should be designed to facilitate secure communication (e.g., HTTPS) to protect sensitive data in transit. Sensitivity: Variable, depends on application.
