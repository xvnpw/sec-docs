Here's an updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the `UITableView-FDTemplateLayoutCell` library:

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker could provide a large volume of data or data with extreme complexity that, when used by `UITableView-FDTemplateLayoutCell` to calculate cell heights via the template layout mechanism, overwhelms the device's resources. This directly exploits the library's function of performing layout calculations on template cells.
    *   **Impact:** The application could become unresponsive, freeze, or crash due to excessive CPU or memory usage caused by the library's layout calculations. This would disrupt the user experience and potentially render the application unusable.
    *   **Affected Component:** Layout Calculation Logic (within `UITableView-FDTemplateLayoutCell`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement pagination or data loading strategies to limit the amount of data processed by the table view at any given time.
        *   Set reasonable limits on the complexity and size of data that influences cell height calculations performed by the library.
        *   Perform data processing and filtering on a background thread *before* providing data to the table view, reducing the load on the library during layout calculations.
        *   Monitor application performance and resource usage to identify potential bottlenecks related to the library's layout calculations.

*   **Threat:** Memory Pressure from Excessive Template Cell Creation
    *   **Description:** `UITableView-FDTemplateLayoutCell` might aggressively create and cache template cells. An attacker could potentially trigger the creation of a large number of unique template cells (e.g., by providing data that results in many distinct cell configurations), directly impacting the library's internal caching mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Excessive template cell creation by the library can lead to increased memory usage, potentially causing memory warnings, performance degradation, and ultimately application crashes due to out-of-memory errors.
    *   **Affected Component:** Template Cell Caching/Management (within `UITableView-FDTemplateLayoutCell`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor the application's memory usage, especially when using `UITableView-FDTemplateLayoutCell` with dynamic content.
        *   Investigate if the library's caching behavior can be configured or limited to prevent excessive template cell retention.
        *   Optimize cell reuse strategies within the `UITableView` to minimize the need for the library to create new template cells.
        *   Avoid creating an excessive number of distinct data patterns that would force the library to generate numerous unique template cells.
