## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Incorrect Height Calculation (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_incorrect_height_calculation__high_risk_path_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker aims to manipulate the data provided to the table view in a way that causes the `uitableview-fdtemplatelayoutcell` library to calculate incorrect cell heights. This can lead to various UI issues and, more critically, performance problems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Provide Data Leading to Infinite/Excessive Calculation Loops (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__provide_data_leading_to_infiniteexcessive_calculation_loops__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** By carefully crafting specific data inputs, an attacker can trigger flaws in the library's height calculation algorithms. This can result in the library entering an infinite loop or performing an excessive number of calculations when trying to determine the height of a cell.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, where the application becomes unresponsive or freezes due to excessive CPU usage. The user experience is severely impacted, and the application may become unusable.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Caching Mechanism (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_caching_mechanism__high_risk_path_.md)

This category focuses on exploiting the caching mechanism used by the library to store calculated cell heights for performance optimization. Attackers aim to manipulate or overwhelm this cache to cause negative consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Cache Exhaustion (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__cache_exhaustion__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a large number of unique data items to be displayed in the table view. This forces the `uitableview-fdtemplatelayoutcell` library to calculate and cache the height for each unique item.
*   **Impact:**  If the number of unique items is sufficiently large, it can lead to excessive memory consumption as the cache grows uncontrollably. This can result in memory exhaustion, leading to application crashes or significant performance degradation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Data-Driven Exploits (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__data-driven_exploits__high_risk_path_.md)

This represents a more sophisticated class of attacks where the attacker leverages specific data inputs to exploit underlying assumptions or vulnerabilities within the library's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Data That Exploits Assumptions in the Library's Calculation Process (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_data_that_exploits_assumptions_in_the_library's_calculation_process__hig_be3ac065.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The attacker crafts specific data payloads designed to exploit implicit assumptions or weaknesses in the library's height calculation logic. This might involve providing data that circumvents expected checks or triggers unexpected behavior in the calculation algorithms.
*   **Impact:** The impact of this attack vector can be varied and potentially severe. It could lead to incorrect UI rendering, information disclosure if the calculation logic inadvertently exposes sensitive data, or even potentially create conditions for further exploitation if the unexpected behavior can be chained with other vulnerabilities. The ability to circumvent security checks or input validation further amplifies the risk.
