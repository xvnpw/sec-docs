# Attack Surface Analysis for forkingdog/uitableview-fdtemplatelayoutcell

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/template_injection.md)

**Description:**  The library utilizes template strings to define the layout of table view cells. If an attacker can influence or control these template strings, they could inject malicious code or markup.

**How `uitableview-fdtemplatelayoutcell` Contributes:** The library's core functionality revolves around using template strings for layout, making it directly susceptible if these templates are not handled securely.

**Example:** An attacker might be able to manipulate data fetched from a server that is then used to construct a template string, injecting code that could potentially execute when the cell is rendered. For instance, if the template uses a simple string formatting mechanism and an attacker injects a format specifier that leads to out-of-bounds access or unexpected behavior.

**Impact:**  Potentially information disclosure, denial of service (if injected code causes crashes or excessive resource usage), or in less likely scenarios, remote code execution depending on the underlying templating mechanism (if any) and the application's overall security posture.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid Dynamic Template Generation: Prefer defining templates statically within the application code rather than constructing them dynamically based on external input.
* Input Sanitization: If dynamic template generation is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize any external input used to build the templates. Escape or remove potentially harmful characters or code snippets.
* Use Secure Templating Engines (If Applicable): If the library utilizes an underlying templating engine, ensure it is a secure one and kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Binding](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_binding.md)

**Description:** The library binds data to the template to populate the cell content. If the application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the data being bound, attackers could inject malicious data.

**How `uitableview-fdtemplatelayoutcell` Contributes:** The library's purpose is to facilitate data binding to templates, making it a pathway for malicious data to influence cell rendering.

**Example:** An attacker could provide excessively long strings for a text field in the template, potentially leading to buffer overflows or denial of service due to excessive memory allocation during layout calculations. Alternatively, injecting special characters might cause unexpected rendering issues or trigger vulnerabilities in the underlying UI framework.

**Impact:** Denial of service (due to resource exhaustion), UI rendering issues, potential crashes, and in some cases, information disclosure if the malicious data can bypass security checks and be displayed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Input Validation: Implement strict validation on all data before binding it to the template. Check data types, lengths, and formats.
* Data Sanitization: Sanitize data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or sequences before binding.
* Resource Limits: Implement limits on the size or complexity of data that can be bound to the template to prevent resource exhaustion.
