# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project provides an open-source iOS library, `UITableView+FDTemplateLayoutCell`, designed to simplify the process of calculating dynamic heights for `UITableViewCell` instances based on Auto Layout constraints.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - To enhance the efficiency of iOS application development by providing a reusable component for dynamic cell layout.
  - To improve the performance and responsiveness of user interfaces in iOS applications that utilize table views with variable cell heights.
  - To reduce development time and complexity associated with implementing dynamic cell sizing in iOS table views.
  - To foster a community-driven approach to solving a common iOS development challenge, encouraging collaboration and improvement of the library.

- Business Risks:
  - Dependency risk: Relying on an external, open-source library introduces a dependency that needs to be managed and maintained.
  - Quality risk: Potential defects or limitations in the library could impact the stability and functionality of applications that depend on it.
  - Security risk: Although less likely for a UI library, vulnerabilities in the library or its dependencies could pose a security risk to applications using it.
  - Maintenance risk: The library's continued maintenance and support depend on the open-source community and the original developers.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community review of the code. (Implemented: Open-source model)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community-maintained open-source library for security updates and vulnerability patching.
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing and auditing of the library.
  - accepted risk: Potential for supply chain vulnerabilities if dependencies are not properly managed.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies.
  - security control: Encourage and facilitate community security audits and vulnerability reporting.
  - security control: Establish a process for reviewing and addressing reported security vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable to this library as it is a client-side UI component and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable to this library as it does not manage access control or authorization.
  - Input Validation: The library should be robust in handling various inputs related to cell content and layout constraints to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. While not directly validating user input, it should handle data provided by the application gracefully.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a direct requirement for this UI layout library. However, applications using this library might handle sensitive data and should implement appropriate encryption measures at the application level, independent of this library.

  - 4. Build artifacts, including the static library and potentially an example application, are generated.
  - 5. The library can be distributed through various channels like GitHub Releases, CocoaPods, or Carthage for integration into other iOS projects.

- Build Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review during development and pull requests to GitHub. (Implemented: Developer workflow, GitHub)
  - security control: Use of version control (Git/GitHub) to track changes and maintain code integrity. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Potential integration of static analysis security testing (SAST) tools in the CI pipeline to scan for code vulnerabilities. (Recommended: CI Pipeline)
  - security control: Dependency management using tools like CocoaPods or Carthage, which can help manage and update library dependencies. (Implemented: Project setup, potentially CocoaPods/Carthage)
  - security control: Signing of build artifacts (relevant for distributing example app, less so for static library itself). (Implemented: Xcode build process)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For the library itself, the critical process is maintaining the quality and availability of the library for the iOS developer community.
  - For applications using the library, the critical processes are those that rely on the correct and efficient display of information in table views, which could be core functionalities of the application.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The library itself does not directly handle sensitive data.
  - However, applications using this library might display sensitive data in table views. The library's correct functioning is important to ensure data is displayed as intended and to prevent UI-related issues that could indirectly expose data or create security vulnerabilities (e.g., information disclosure through layout errors). The sensitivity of data depends entirely on the applications that integrate this library.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the intended use cases and types of applications that will utilize this library? (e.g., e-commerce, social media, enterprise apps)
  - Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards that applications using this library must adhere to?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the library?
  - Is there a dedicated team or individual responsible for maintaining and updating the library, including security patches?

- Assumptions:
  - The library is intended for general-purpose iOS application development and is not specifically targeted for highly sensitive or regulated industries.
  - Security responsibility for applications using this library primarily lies with the application developers.
  - The open-source community will contribute to the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the library, including addressing potential security concerns.
  - The primary distribution method for the library is through open-source package managers and GitHub, rather than a formal commercial distribution channel.
