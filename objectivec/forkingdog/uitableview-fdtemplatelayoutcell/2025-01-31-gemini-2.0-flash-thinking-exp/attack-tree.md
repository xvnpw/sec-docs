**Attack Vector Name:** DoS via Layout Calculation

**Description:** By providing data that forces the `uitableview-fdtemplatelayoutcell` library to perform extremely complex or time-consuming layout calculations, the attacker aims to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, rendering the application unresponsive or significantly slow.

**Likelihood:** Medium - Relatively easy to inject large or complex data sets.

**Attack Vector Name:** Long String/Complex Data Injection

**Description:** The attacker specifically injects extremely long strings or highly complex data structures as input. When this data is used to configure template cells, it forces the layout engine to perform excessive calculations, leading to CPU overload and DoS.

**Likelihood:** Medium - Easy to inject long strings or complex data through various input channels.

**Impact:** Medium - Application slowdown, UI unresponsiveness, potentially temporary unavailability.

**Effort:** Low - Simple data manipulation, readily available tools.
