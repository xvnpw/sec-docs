## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 AFPropertyListResponseSerializer (Historically Vulnerable) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_afpropertylistresponseserializer__historically_vulnerable___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how AFNetworking handles property list (plist) responses.  Older versions of `AFPropertyListResponseSerializer` were known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks, particularly if the application didn't properly validate the contents of the plist.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (due to mitigations in newer OS versions and AFNetworking updates, but higher if older versions are used or if the application explicitly disables security features).
*   **Impact:** High (potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) or significant data exfiltration).
*   **Effort:** Medium (requires crafting a malicious plist payload).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (requires understanding of plist structure and deserialization vulnerabilities).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring for unusual process behavior or network traffic; obfuscation can make detection harder).
*   **Sub-Steps:**
    *   **1.1.1 Craft Malicious Property List (plist) Payload:** The attacker creates a specially crafted plist file.
    *   **1.1.1.1 Use `NSKeyedUnarchiver` within plist (if allowed by app) [CRITICAL]:**  The most dangerous scenario.  If the application uses `NSKeyedUnarchiver` to deserialize the plist and doesn't properly restrict allowed classes, the attacker can include objects that trigger arbitrary code execution when deserialized.
        *   **1.1.1.1.1 Trigger RCE via known `NSKeyedUnarchiver` gadgets:**  The attacker leverages known "gadget chains" within commonly used classes to achieve RCE.
    *   **1.1.2 Send crafted plist to endpoint expecting plist response:** The attacker sends the malicious plist to a vulnerable endpoint.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Custom Response Serializers (Highest Risk if Implemented Incorrectly) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_custom_response_serializers__highest_risk_if_implemented_incorrectly___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application uses a custom response serializer (instead of the built-in ones), there's a high risk of introducing vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully.  This is the *most dangerous* area because it's entirely dependent on the developer's code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends entirely on whether a custom serializer is used and how it's implemented).
*   **Impact:** Very High (potential for RCE if insecure deserialization is used).
*   **Effort:** Medium (depends on the complexity of the custom serializer).
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced (requires understanding of secure coding practices and deserialization vulnerabilities).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires code review and potentially dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities).
*   **Sub-Steps:**
    *   **1.3.1 Insecure Deserialization in Custom Logic [CRITICAL]:** The custom serializer uses unsafe methods to deserialize data.
        *   **1.3.1.1 Use of unsafe deserialization methods (e.g., `NSKeyedUnarchiver` without validation):**  This is the most common and dangerous mistake.  Using `NSKeyedUnarchiver` without proper class whitelisting is a major security risk.
            *   **1.3.1.1.1 Trigger RCE via known gadgets:**  Similar to 1.1.1.1.1, the attacker exploits known gadget chains.
        *   **1.3.1.2 Lack of input validation before deserialization:** Even if a "safer" deserialization method is used, failing to validate the input *before* deserialization can still lead to vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Bypass SSL Pinning (if implemented incorrectly) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_bypass_ssl_pinning__if_implemented_incorrectly___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  SSL pinning is a security mechanism to prevent MitM attacks.  If it's misconfigured, an attacker can bypass it and intercept traffic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (many applications implement SSL pinning incorrectly).
*   **Impact:** High (allows for complete interception and modification of network traffic, leading to data exfiltration).
*   **Effort:** Very Low (if misconfigured, it's trivial to bypass).
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie (tools and readily available instructions exist).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if proper monitoring is in place, invalid certificates or unexpected certificate changes will be detected).
*   **Sub-Steps:**
    *   **2.1.1 Exploit Weaknesses in `AFSecurityPolicy` Configuration [CRITICAL]:**  The attacker targets common misconfigurations.
        *   **2.1.1.1 `allowInvalidCertificates = YES`:**  This completely disables certificate validation, making MitM trivial.
        *   **2.1.1.2 `validateDomainName = NO`:**  The certificate's hostname is not checked, allowing an attacker to use a valid certificate for a different domain.
        *   **2.1.1.3 Incorrectly Configured `pinnedCertificates`:**  Various errors in the pinning configuration.
        *   **2.1.1.4 Using `AFSSLPinningModeNone`:**  SSL pinning is explicitly disabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Intercept Traffic Without SSL Pinning](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_intercept_traffic_without_ssl_pinning.md)

* **Description:** If SSL pinning is not implemented, or is bypassed, the attacker can use various techniques to intercept traffic.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Beginner
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Sub-Steps:**
    * **2.2.2 Use a Proxy Server (e.g., in a compromised Wi-Fi network)**
        * **2.2.2.1 Redirect traffic to attacker-controlled server:** The attacker sets up a proxy server and tricks the victim's device into using it (e.g., by offering a free Wi-Fi hotspot).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Tamper with `NSURLRequest` (if exposed to attacker control) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_tamper_with__nsurlrequest___if_exposed_to_attacker_control___critical_.md)

* **Description:** If the application allows user input to directly influence the `NSURLRequest` object (e.g., constructing URLs from user-provided strings without proper sanitization), an attacker can manipulate the request to access unauthorized resources or inject malicious data.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on application design; common in poorly written apps).
* **Impact:** Medium (can lead to data exfiltration or potentially other vulnerabilities depending on the server-side handling).
* **Effort:** Low (simple string manipulation).
* **Skill Level:** Beginner (basic understanding of HTTP requests).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires careful input validation and monitoring of outgoing requests).

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1 AFNetworking does not limit response size by default. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1_afnetworking_does_not_limit_response_size_by_default___critical_.md)

* **Description:** AFNetworking, by default, does not impose any limits on the size of the responses it processes. This can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium (service disruption).
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Beginner
* **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (monitoring of network traffic and application performance).
* **Sub-Steps:**
    * **4.1.1.1 Send crafted request that will result in large response:** The attacker sends a request that they know, or suspect, will cause the server to return a very large response. This could be a request for a large file, a query that returns a large dataset, or a specially crafted request designed to trigger excessive processing on the server.
