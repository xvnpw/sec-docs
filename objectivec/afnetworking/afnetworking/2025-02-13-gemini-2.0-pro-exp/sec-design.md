# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and reliable networking library for iOS and macOS developers.
*   Simplify common networking tasks, such as making HTTP requests and handling responses.
*   Offer a clean and easy-to-use API.
*   Maintain high performance and efficiency.
*   Ensure compatibility with the latest Apple platforms and technologies.
*   Foster a strong community and ecosystem around the library.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could expose applications using it to attacks.
*   Performance issues or bugs could negatively impact the user experience of applications.
*   Lack of compatibility with new OS versions or technologies could limit adoption.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could hinder developer adoption.
*   Competition from other networking libraries could reduce market share.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The library uses Apple's `NSURLSession` and `CFNetwork` APIs, which provide built-in security features like TLS/SSL. (Described in Apple's documentation and AFNetworking's source code).
*   security control: The library supports various authentication methods, including Basic, Digest, and NTLM. (Described in AFNetworking's documentation and source code).
*   security control: The library provides mechanisms for validating server certificates. (Described in AFNetworking's documentation and source code).
*   security control: The library includes features for handling cookies securely. (Described in AFNetworking's documentation and source code).
*   security control: The library has a history of addressing reported security vulnerabilities. (Refer to the project's GitHub issues and commit history).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on the underlying security of Apple's networking frameworks. Any vulnerabilities in those frameworks could impact AFNetworking.
*   accepted risk: Developers using the library are responsible for implementing appropriate security practices in their own applications, such as input validation and data sanitization.
*   accepted risk: The library's default settings may not be suitable for all security contexts. Developers may need to customize the configuration for specific needs.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement automated security scanning of the codebase (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   security control: Provide clear and comprehensive security documentation for developers.
*   security control: Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) if the library is used in a web context.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for standard authentication protocols (Basic, Digest, OAuth 2.0, API Keys).
    *   Secure storage of credentials (e.g., using Keychain on iOS/macOS).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
*   Authorization:
    *   Mechanism for verifying user permissions to access resources.
    *   Support for role-based access control (RBAC) if applicable.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validation of all input data from external sources (e.g., server responses).
    *   Protection against common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (e.g., TLS 1.3 for secure communication).
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection against known cryptographic attacks.

2.  The commit triggers a CI build on a CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3.  The CI server runs a build script.
4.  The build process fetches dependencies (e.g., using CocoaPods).
5.  The build process compiles the code using a compiler (e.g., Xcodebuild).
6.  The compiler generates a build artifact (e.g., an app binary).
7.  The CI server runs tests (unit tests and UI tests).
8.  The CI server runs a SAST scanner to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
9.  The SAST scanner reports any found vulnerabilities.
