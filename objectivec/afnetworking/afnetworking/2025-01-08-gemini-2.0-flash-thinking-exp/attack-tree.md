# Attack Tree Analysis for afnetworking/afnetworking

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to application data, manipulate application behavior, or cause denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application utilizes AFNetworking.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Attack: Compromise Application via AFNetworking **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * AND **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Insecure Communication Exploitation **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * OR Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Exploit Lack of Certificate Pinning **(CRITICAL NODE)**
                * Intercept and Decrypt HTTPS Traffic **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * AND **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Misconfiguration and Improper Usage Exploitation
        * OR **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Improper Credential Management **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * **HIGH-RISK PATH:** Hardcoded API Keys or Secrets **(CRITICAL NODE)**
                * Extract Credentials from Application Binary **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Insecure Storage of Authentication Tokens **(CRITICAL NODE)**
                * Access Stored Tokens and Impersonate User
```
