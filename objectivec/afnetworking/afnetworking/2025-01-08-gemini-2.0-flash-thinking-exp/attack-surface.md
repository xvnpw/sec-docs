# Attack Surface Analysis for afnetworking/afnetworking

## Attack Surface: [Insecure HTTP Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_http_communication.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure HTTP Communication**
    *   **Description:** The application might establish connections over unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS, exposing data in transit.
    *   **How AFNetworking Contributes:** AFNetworking, if not explicitly configured, can be used to make requests over HTTP. The library provides the mechanism for establishing these connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic and reads sensitive data being transmitted over an HTTP connection initiated by AFNetworking.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data interception, potential for data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Explicitly configure AFNetworking to enforce HTTPS using `AFSecurityPolicy` and ensure `validatesDomainName` is set to `YES`. Avoid using `baseURL` with `http://` scheme when possible.

## Attack Surface: [Disabled or Improper Certificate Validation](./attack_surfaces/disabled_or_improper_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Disabled or Improper Certificate Validation**
    *   **Description:** The application might disable SSL certificate validation or implement it incorrectly, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **How AFNetworking Contributes:** AFNetworking provides the `AFSecurityPolicy` class, which controls how SSL certificates are validated. Misconfiguration of this class directly leads to weakened security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts an HTTPS connection, presenting a fraudulent certificate that the application accepts due to a misconfigured `AFSecurityPolicy` (e.g., `allowInvalidCertificates = YES`), allowing the attacker to eavesdrop or modify data.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality and integrity breach, potential for data injection or redirection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use `AFSecurityPolicy` with appropriate settings. Implement certificate pinning by providing the expected server certificate(s) or public key(s) to `AFSecurityPolicy`. Avoid using `allowInvalidCertificates = YES` in production.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in AFNetworking Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_afnetworking_library_itself.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in AFNetworking Library Itself**
    *   **Description:** Security flaws might exist within the AFNetworking library code.
    *   **How AFNetworking Contributes:** By directly incorporating and using the AFNetworking library, the application becomes susceptible to any vulnerabilities present within its code.
    *   **Example:** A discovered vulnerability in AFNetworking allows for remote code execution if a specially crafted response is received and processed by the library.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep the AFNetworking library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches. Monitor security advisories related to AFNetworking. Replace the library if critical unpatched vulnerabilities are discovered and alternatives are available.
