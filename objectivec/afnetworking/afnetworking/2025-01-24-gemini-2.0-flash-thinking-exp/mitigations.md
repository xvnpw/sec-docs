# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for afnetworking/afnetworking

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update AFNetworking](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_afnetworking.md)

### Description:
1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the official AFNetworking GitHub repository (https://github.com/afnetworking/afnetworking) for new releases and security advisories.
2.  **Utilize Dependency Manager:** Use a dependency manager like CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager to manage your AFNetworking dependency. This simplifies the update process.
3.  **Update Dependency:** When a new version is available, update your project's dependency file (e.g., `Podfile`, `Cartfile`, `Package.swift`) to the latest stable version of AFNetworking.
4.  **Run Dependency Update Command:** Execute the dependency manager's update command (e.g., `pod update AFNetworking`, `carthage update AFNetworking`, `swift package update`) to fetch and integrate the updated library version into your project.
5.  **Test After Update:** Thoroughly test your application after updating AFNetworking to ensure compatibility and that no regressions have been introduced.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated versions of AFNetworking may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
### Impact:
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Directly addresses and eliminates known vulnerabilities patched in newer AFNetworking versions.
### Currently Implemented:
*   **Partially Implemented:** We use CocoaPods to manage AFNetworking, but updates are not performed regularly on a schedule.
*   **Location:** `Podfile` specifies AFNetworking dependency.
### Missing Implementation:
*   **Scheduled Updates:** No regular schedule or process for checking and applying AFNetworking updates.
*   **Proactive Monitoring:** No system in place to proactively monitor for AFNetworking security advisories or new releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Certificate Pinning using `AFSecurityPolicy`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_certificate_pinning_using__afsecuritypolicy_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Obtain Server Certificate or Public Key:** Acquire the correct server certificate (in `.cer` format) or its public key for the target server(s) your application communicates with via AFNetworking.
2.  **Create `AFSecurityPolicy` Instance:** Instantiate an `AFSecurityPolicy` object in your code.
3.  **Set Pinning Mode:** Configure the `AFSecurityPolicy`'s `pinningMode` property to either `AFSSLPinningModeCertificate` (pin the entire certificate) or `AFSSLPinningModePublicKey` (pin the public key). `AFSSLPinningModePublicKey` is generally recommended for better certificate rotation flexibility.
4.  **Set Pinned Certificates:** Use the `pinnedCertificates` property of `AFSecurityPolicy` to provide an array containing the server certificate(s) you obtained in step 1. AFNetworking will compare the server's certificate against these pinned certificates during the TLS handshake.
5.  **Apply Security Policy to `AFHTTPSessionManager`:**  Set the `securityPolicy` property of your `AFHTTPSessionManager` instance to the configured `AFSecurityPolicy`. This ensures that all requests made using this manager will enforce certificate pinning.
6.  **Handle Pinning Failures:** Implement error handling to gracefully manage situations where certificate pinning fails (e.g., the server certificate doesn't match the pinned certificate). Decide on an appropriate action, such as displaying an error message to the user or preventing the network request.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Certificate pinning significantly reduces the risk of MITM attacks by ensuring that your application only trusts connections to servers presenting the explicitly pinned certificate, even if a Certificate Authority is compromised or an attacker obtains a fraudulent certificate.
### Impact:
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High Risk Reduction - Provides a strong defense against MITM attacks by bypassing reliance on Certificate Authorities and directly verifying server identity.
### Currently Implemented:
*   **Not Implemented:** Certificate pinning using `AFSecurityPolicy` is not currently implemented in the project.
*   **Location:** N/A
### Missing Implementation:
*   **All Critical Connections:** Certificate pinning should be considered for all connections to backend servers that handle sensitive data or critical application functionality.
*   **Pin Management Strategy:**  A strategy for managing and updating pinned certificates when server certificates are rotated needs to be defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Secure Response Serializers Provided by AFNetworking](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_secure_response_serializers_provided_by_afnetworking.md)

### Description:
1.  **Use Standard Serializers:** When configuring your `AFHTTPSessionManager`, use the built-in response serializers provided by AFNetworking, such as `AFJSONResponseSerializer`, `AFXMLParserResponseSerializer`, `AFPropertyListResponseSerializer`, and `AFImageResponseSerializer`. These serializers are designed to handle common data formats securely.
2.  **Avoid Custom Serializers (Unless Necessary and Securely Implemented):**  Refrain from creating custom response serializers unless absolutely necessary for handling very specific or unusual data formats. If custom serializers are required, ensure they are implemented with security in mind, carefully handling data parsing and avoiding potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection flaws.
3.  **Configure Serializer Acceptable Content Types (If Needed):**  For serializers like `AFJSONResponseSerializer` and `AFXMLParserResponseSerializer`, you can configure the `acceptableContentTypes` property to restrict the accepted MIME types. This can help prevent unexpected data formats from being processed and potentially triggering parsing errors or vulnerabilities.
4.  **Handle Serializer Errors:** Implement proper error handling for response serialization. Check for errors returned by the serializers and handle them gracefully, preventing application crashes and avoiding exposing sensitive error information to users.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Data (Medium Severity):** Using well-tested and robust serializers reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by sending malformed or excessively large data that could crash or overload custom parsing logic.
*   **Parsing Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Custom parsing implementations can be more prone to vulnerabilities compared to using established and vetted serializers provided by a library like AFNetworking.
### Impact:
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Data:** Medium Risk Reduction - Using robust serializers improves resilience to malformed data attacks.
*   **Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the likelihood of introducing parsing-related vulnerabilities by relying on well-established serializers.
### Currently Implemented:
*   **Largely Implemented:** We primarily use `AFJSONResponseSerializer` for JSON responses and rely on AFNetworking's provided serializers for common data formats.
*   **Location:** `AFHTTPSessionManager` configuration where `responseSerializer` is set.
### Missing Implementation:
*   **Formal Review of Serializer Usage:** No formal review process to ensure that only standard AFNetworking serializers are used and that custom serializers are avoided unless absolutely necessary and securely implemented.
*   **Content Type Restriction:**  `acceptableContentTypes` are not consistently configured for response serializers to further restrict accepted data formats.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Request Construction using AFNetworking APIs](./mitigation_strategies/secure_request_construction_using_afnetworking_apis.md)

### Description:
1.  **Utilize Parameter Encoding:** Use AFNetworking's built-in parameter encoding features when constructing requests. For example, use `parameters` dictionary with `GET` and `POST` requests, and let AFNetworking handle URL encoding for GET requests and request body encoding (e.g., JSON, form-urlencoded) for POST requests. Avoid manually constructing URLs with parameters or manually formatting request bodies.
2.  **Set Secure Headers:** Use AFNetworking's request header setting methods to add necessary security headers to your requests, such as `Authorization` headers for bearer tokens or API keys. Ensure sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed in headers that are not intended for security purposes.
3.  **Use HTTPS Scheme:**  Always ensure that the base URLs and request URLs used with AFNetworking are using the `https://` scheme for secure communication, especially when transmitting sensitive data.
4.  **Review Request Methods:** Choose appropriate HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the action being performed. Use POST requests for sending sensitive data in the request body instead of exposing it in URLs via GET requests.
5.  **Avoid Embedding Sensitive Data in URLs:**  Minimize embedding sensitive data directly in URLs, especially in GET requests, as URLs can be logged, cached, and potentially exposed in browser history or server logs. Prefer sending sensitive data in the request body of POST requests.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Using HTTP instead of HTTPS exposes data to eavesdropping during transmission.
*   **Parameter Tampering (Medium Severity):** Improper URL encoding or manual parameter construction can introduce vulnerabilities to parameter tampering attacks.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs/History (Medium Severity):** Embedding sensitive data in URLs can lead to unintentional exposure in logs and browser history.
### Impact:
*   **Data Eavesdropping:** High Risk Reduction - Enforcing HTTPS ensures encrypted communication.
*   **Parameter Tampering:** Medium Risk Reduction - Using AFNetworking's parameter encoding reduces the risk of manual encoding errors and tampering vulnerabilities.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs/History:** Medium Risk Reduction - Avoiding sensitive data in URLs minimizes exposure in logs and history.
### Currently Implemented:
*   **Largely Implemented:** We generally use AFNetworking's parameter encoding and header setting methods. HTTPS is primarily used.
*   **Location:** Network request construction code throughout the application.
### Missing Implementation:
*   **Consistent HTTPS Enforcement:** Need to ensure HTTPS is consistently used for all AFNetworking requests across the application.
*   **Code Review for Secure Request Construction:** Implement code review practices to specifically check for secure request construction patterns and adherence to best practices when using AFNetworking.
