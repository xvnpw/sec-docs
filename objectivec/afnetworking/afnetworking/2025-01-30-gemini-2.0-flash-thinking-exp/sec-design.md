# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, AFNetworking, is a foundational networking library for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Its primary business goal is to provide a robust, reliable, and easy-to-use networking solution for Apple platform developers. By simplifying complex networking tasks, AFNetworking aims to increase developer productivity and reduce the time and effort required to build network-enabled applications.

The key business priorities are:
- Maintainability: Ensuring the library is easy to update, debug, and extend to meet evolving networking needs and platform changes.
- Reliability: Providing a stable and dependable networking layer that minimizes bugs and unexpected behavior in applications using the library.
- Performance: Optimizing network operations for speed and efficiency to deliver a smooth user experience in applications.
- Community Support: Fostering a strong community around the library to encourage contributions, provide support, and ensure its continued relevance.

The most important business risks associated with AFNetworking are:
- Security Vulnerabilities: If vulnerabilities are discovered in AFNetworking, applications using the library could become susceptible to attacks, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or reputational damage for both the library and its users.
- Library Instability: Bugs or regressions in the library could cause crashes or unexpected behavior in applications, negatively impacting user experience and developer trust.
- Lack of Maintenance: If the library is not actively maintained and updated to support new platform features and security best practices, it could become outdated and less secure, leading developers to seek alternative solutions.
- Supply Chain Risks: Compromises in the build or distribution process of the library could introduce malicious code, affecting all applications that depend on it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the AFNetworking project are primarily those inherent in open-source development on GitHub:

- security control: Code Review - Pull requests are reviewed by maintainers before being merged into the main branch. (Implemented via GitHub Pull Request process)
- security control: Issue Tracking - Security issues can be reported via GitHub issues. (Implemented via GitHub Issues)
- security control: Publicly Available Code - The source code is open and auditable by the community. (Implemented via GitHub Repository)

Accepted risks for the project include:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community Contributions - Security vulnerabilities might be introduced by community contributions if not thoroughly reviewed.
- accepted risk: Open Source Visibility - Public knowledge of vulnerabilities before patches are available could increase exploitation risk.
- accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies could affect AFNetworking.

Recommended security controls to implement:
- recommended security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by AFNetworking.
- recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential security flaws in the code.
- recommended security control: Security Testing - Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses.
- recommended security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
- recommended security control: Security Policy - Publish a clear security policy outlining how security vulnerabilities are handled, reported, and disclosed.
- recommended security control: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) - Generate and maintain an SBOM for each release to track dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management for users.

Security requirements for AFNetworking:

- Authentication:
  - Requirement: AFNetworking itself does not handle user authentication. It should provide mechanisms to easily integrate with various authentication schemes (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys) implemented by the consuming application.
  - Implementation: The library provides request authorization headers and delegate methods to allow users to implement custom authentication logic.

- Authorization:
  - Requirement: AFNetworking does not enforce authorization policies. It should facilitate the transmission of authorization tokens or credentials provided by the consuming application to backend services.
  - Implementation: Similar to authentication, the library allows users to set custom headers and handle server responses related to authorization.

- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: AFNetworking should perform input validation on data received from network requests to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks and data corruption. This includes validating response status codes, content types, and data formats.
  - Implementation: The library includes response serializers that perform basic validation of response types and status codes. Further validation of data content is typically handled by the consuming application.

- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: AFNetworking should support secure communication protocols like HTTPS by default to protect data in transit. It should also provide APIs for applications to implement end-to-end encryption if required.
  - Implementation: AFNetworking leverages the underlying operating system's networking APIs (URLSession), which handle HTTPS encryption. The library also supports custom security policies and certificate pinning for enhanced security.

3. CI/CD System: A CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
4. Build & Test: The CI/CD system automatically builds the library, runs unit tests, and potentially performs static analysis and security scans.
5. Build Artifacts: The build process produces build artifacts, typically a framework or static library for iOS/macOS.
6. Distribution Channels: The build artifacts are published to distribution channels like CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift Package Manager, and GitHub Releases, making the library available to developers.

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Automated Build Process - Using CI/CD systems ensures a consistent and repeatable build process, reducing the risk of manual errors or malicious modifications. (Implemented via GitHub Actions or similar)

- security control: Build Environment Security - Harden the build environment to prevent unauthorized access or modification. (Implemented via secure configuration of CI/CD agents)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Process: Secure and reliable network communication in applications built by developers using AFNetworking. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted by these applications is paramount.

Data to Protect: AFNetworking itself does not store or process application data directly. However, it facilitates the transmission of data, which can include sensitive information depending on the application using the library.

Data Sensitivity: The sensitivity of data transmitted via AFNetworking depends entirely on the applications using it. It can range from publicly available data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The library must be designed and maintained to ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of this data.
