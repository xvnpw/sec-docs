# Threat Model Analysis for afnetworking/afnetworking

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack due to Insufficient Certificate Validation](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_due_to_insufficient_certificate_validation.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the server. By exploiting the application's failure to properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate *as configured through AFNetworking*, the attacker can impersonate the legitimate server. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communication, steal sensitive data, and potentially inject malicious data.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted. Potential compromise of user accounts and sensitive information.

**Affected AFNetworking Component:** `AFSecurityPolicy` (specifically the certificate validation logic).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict certificate validation using `AFSecurityPolicy`.
* Utilize certificate pinning for connections to known and trusted servers.
* Regularly review and update the certificate pinning implementation.
* Ensure the `validatesDomainName` property of `AFSecurityPolicy` is set appropriately.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Transit due to Accidental HTTP Usage](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_transit_due_to_accidental_http_usage.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently configure *AFNetworking* to make requests to sensitive endpoints over unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS. This exposes the data transmitted in these requests to eavesdropping by attackers on the network.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of sensitive data transmitted over HTTP. Potential compromise of credentials, personal information, or other confidential data.

**Affected AFNetworking Component:** `AFHTTPSessionManager` or `AFURLSessionManager` (depending on how requests are created and the URL scheme used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce HTTPS for all communication with sensitive endpoints.
* Utilize `AFHTTPSessionManager` for HTTPS requests by default.
* Implement checks or code review processes to prevent accidental use of HTTP for sensitive data when configuring AFNetworking requests.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Response Handling](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_response_handling.md)

**Description:** If the application uses *AFNetworking* to receive data in formats like JSON or XML and doesn't properly sanitize or validate the data before deserialization *using AFNetworking's response serializers*, an attacker could send maliciously crafted data that, when deserialized, leads to code execution or other unintended consequences within the application.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution within the application, leading to complete compromise of the application and potentially the device.

**Affected AFNetworking Component:** `responseSerializer` property of `AFURLSessionManager` or `AFHTTPSessionManager`, specifically the `AFJSONResponseSerializer` or `AFXMLParserResponseSerializer`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data received through AFNetworking before deserialization.
* Avoid directly deserializing untrusted data without proper checks within the response handling logic.
* Consider using safer data formats or libraries that offer better protection against deserialization attacks.
* If using custom deserialization logic with AFNetworking, ensure it is implemented securely.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults or Misconfiguration of Security Policy](./threats/insecure_defaults_or_misconfiguration_of_security_policy.md)

**Description:** Developers might unknowingly use *AFNetworking* with insecure default settings for `AFSecurityPolicy` or misconfigure it in a way that weakens security (e.g., disabling certificate validation for convenience during development and forgetting to re-enable it).

**Impact:** Increased vulnerability to MitM attacks and other security breaches due to weakened security measures configured within AFNetworking.

**Affected AFNetworking Component:** `AFSecurityPolicy`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Provide clear guidelines and best practices for configuring `AFSecurityPolicy` securely within the development team.
* Conduct code reviews to identify potential misconfigurations of `AFSecurityPolicy`.
* Utilize static analysis tools to detect insecure usage patterns of `AFSecurityPolicy`.
* Ensure secure defaults are used in production builds when initializing `AFSecurityPolicy`.

## Threat: [Using Outdated Versions of AFNetworking with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated_versions_of_afnetworking_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Failing to update *AFNetworking* to the latest version can leave the application vulnerable to known security flaws that have been patched in newer releases of the library. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Exposure to known security vulnerabilities within AFNetworking, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution, or other forms of compromise.

**Affected AFNetworking Component:** The entire library.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the known vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies, including AFNetworking.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for AFNetworking to identify and address potential vulnerabilities promptly.
* Use dependency management tools to track and update library versions.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Authentication Credentials with AFNetworking](./threats/improper_handling_of_authentication_credentials_with_afnetworking.md)

**Description:** If the application uses *AFNetworking* to handle authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) in request headers or bodies, improper configuration within AFNetworking could lead to their compromise. This could involve inadvertently logging requests containing credentials or transmitting them insecurely due to misconfiguration.

**Impact:** Compromise of authentication credentials, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users or gain unauthorized access to resources.

**Affected AFNetworking Component:** Configuration of request headers or bodies within `AFURLSessionManager` or `AFHTTPSessionManager`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices for handling authentication credentials when configuring AFNetworking requests.
* Store credentials securely (e.g., using the Keychain on iOS).
* Avoid hardcoding credentials in the application.
* Ensure credentials are only transmitted over HTTPS when using AFNetworking.
* Avoid logging requests or responses that contain sensitive authentication information when using AFNetworking's logging features.
