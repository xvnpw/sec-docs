## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using AFNetworking [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_afnetworking__critical_.md)

**1. Compromise Application Using AFNetworking [CRITICAL]:**

* This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of the underlying vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the context of AFNetworking leads to the compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in AFNetworking Library [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_afnetworking_library__critical_.md)

**2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in AFNetworking Library [CRITICAL]:**

* This attack vector focuses on leveraging inherent weaknesses within the AFNetworking library itself.
    * **Leverage Known Vulnerabilities:**
        * Attackers actively seek out and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of AFNetworking. This often involves using readily available exploit code or developing custom exploits based on vulnerability details. Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the device running the application or the server it communicates with, or data breaches by gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks Targeting AFNetworking Communication [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_targeting_afnetworking_communication__critical_.md)

**3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks Targeting AFNetworking Communication [CRITICAL]:**

* This attack vector involves intercepting and potentially manipulating network traffic between the application and the server it communicates with through AFNetworking.
    * **Intercept and Modify Requests:**
        * An attacker positions themselves between the application and the server, intercepting requests sent by the application via AFNetworking. They can then alter parameters within the request URL, modify headers (e.g., adding malicious headers), or change the request body before forwarding it to the server. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user, data manipulation, or bypassing security checks on the server.
    * **Intercept and Modify Responses:**
        * Similarly, the attacker intercepts responses sent by the server back to the application through AFNetworking. They can modify the response body (e.g., injecting malicious data or code) or alter response headers before the application processes them. This can lead to data injection within the application, application malfunction, or even client-side code execution if the application blindly trusts the modified response.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure Configuration or Usage of AFNetworking [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_configuration_or_usage_of_afnetworking__critical_.md)

**4. Exploiting Insecure Configuration or Usage of AFNetworking [CRITICAL]:**

* This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how developers configure and use the AFNetworking library, rather than inherent flaws in the library itself.
    * **Bypassing Certificate Validation:**
        * Developers might intentionally disable certificate validation for testing purposes and forget to re-enable it in production, or they might implement it incorrectly. This allows an attacker performing a MitM attack to present a fraudulent certificate without the application raising any warnings or errors. This effectively negates the security provided by HTTPS, making all communication vulnerable to interception and manipulation.
    * **Insecure Credential Handling:**
        * Developers might make mistakes in how they handle sensitive credentials like API keys or authentication tokens when using AFNetworking. This could involve storing credentials directly in the application code, including them in request URLs (making them visible in logs and browser history), or transmitting them without proper encryption. Attackers can intercept these credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or backend systems.
