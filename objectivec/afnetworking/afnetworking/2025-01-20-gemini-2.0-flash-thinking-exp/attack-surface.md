# Attack Surface Analysis for afnetworking/afnetworking

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks due to Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_due_to_insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between the application and the server, potentially eavesdropping or manipulating data.
*   **How AFNetworking Contributes:** AFNetworking handles the network requests and responses. If developers don't properly configure TLS/SSL settings (like certificate pinning or enforcing strong protocols), AFNetworking will facilitate communication over insecure connections, making the application vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An application using AFNetworking makes an API call over HTTPS, but certificate pinning is not implemented. An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network uses a tool like `mitmproxy` to intercept the traffic, presenting a forged certificate that the application trusts.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data (login credentials, personal information, etc.) can be exposed or modified.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement Certificate Pinning using AFNetworking's features.
    *   Enforce strong TLS/SSL protocols within AFNetworking's configuration.
    *   Ensure options allowing invalid certificates are disabled.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of Server Trust Evaluation](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_server_trust_evaluation.md)

*   **Description:** Developers implement custom server trust evaluation logic that is overly permissive or contains vulnerabilities, bypassing security checks.
*   **How AFNetworking Contributes:** AFNetworking provides mechanisms for custom server trust evaluation. If developers implement this incorrectly (e.g., always returning `YES` or not properly validating certificate chains), AFNetworking will trust any server, including malicious ones.
*   **Example:** A developer implements a custom `AFSecurityPolicy` that always returns `YES` in the `evaluateServerTrust:forDomain:` method, effectively disabling certificate validation.
*   **Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to MitM attacks, as it will trust any certificate presented by the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Prefer using AFNetworking's default security policy.
    *   Implement custom trust evaluation with extreme caution, ensuring proper certificate chain validation.
    *   Avoid logic that unconditionally trusts any server.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in AFNetworking Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_afnetworking_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws or bugs exist within the AFNetworking library code.
*   **How AFNetworking Contributes:** If the application uses a vulnerable version of AFNetworking, any exploitable flaws within the library become part of the application's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of AFNetworking allows for remote code execution if a specially crafted server response is received.
*   **Impact:** Can range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep AFNetworking updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to AFNetworking.
