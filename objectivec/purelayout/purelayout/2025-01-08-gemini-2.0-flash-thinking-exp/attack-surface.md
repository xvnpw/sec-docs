# Attack Surface Analysis for purelayout/purelayout

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Constraint Creation](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_excessive_constraint_creation.md)

* **Description:** A malicious actor or compromised code causes the application to create an extremely large number of layout constraints.
    * **How PureLayout Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PureLayout's API provides convenient ways to programmatically create and add constraints. This ease of use, if not controlled, can be abused to create an overwhelming number of constraints.
    * **Example:**  A bug in a data processing module, when combined with PureLayout's constraint creation, could lead to a loop that continuously adds new constraints to a view based on corrupted or malicious data.
    * **Impact:**  Excessive constraint creation consumes significant memory and CPU resources, leading to application slowdown, unresponsiveness, and potentially crashing the application on the user's device.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement checks and limits on the number of constraints created, especially in dynamic UI scenarios or when processing external data. Use constraint priorities effectively to avoid conflicts that might lead to excessive constraint solving. Profile application performance to identify potential bottlenecks related to constraint management.
