# Threat Model Analysis for purelayout/purelayout

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Repository](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_compromised_repository.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the PureLayout GitHub repository and injects malicious code into the library's source code. Developers unknowingly include this compromised version in their applications.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of applications using the infected PureLayout version. Attackers could steal sensitive data, execute arbitrary code on user devices, or disrupt application functionality.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire PureLayout library codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or signatures provided by the official repository.
    *   Monitor the PureLayout repository's commit history and activity for suspicious or unauthorized changes.
    *   Utilize dependency management tools that offer security scanning and vulnerability analysis to detect known issues or anomalies.
    *   Consider using a forked and internally vetted version of PureLayout for highly sensitive applications.

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities in PureLayout](./threats/unpatched_vulnerabilities_in_purelayout.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered in PureLayout's code but remain unpatched by the maintainers for a significant period. Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities in applications using the outdated version of the library.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or cause denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific component within PureLayout containing the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay informed about security advisories and updates for PureLayout by monitoring the project's GitHub repository, release notes, and security mailing lists (if any).
    *   Regularly update to the latest stable version of PureLayout to incorporate security patches.
    *   Consider using automated dependency update tools to streamline the update process.
