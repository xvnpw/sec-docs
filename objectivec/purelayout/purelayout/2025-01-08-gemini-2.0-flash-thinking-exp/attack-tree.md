# Attack Tree Analysis for purelayout/purelayout

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To cause unintended behavior or gain unauthorized access/information within an application by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses stemming from the use of the PureLayout library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Resource Exhaustion via Layout](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_resource_exhaustion_via_layout.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to overwhelm the device's resources (CPU or memory) through malicious manipulation of the application's layout using PureLayout.

    *   **Cause Excessive CPU Usage:**
        *   **Programmatically add a very large number of constraints (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker could, through application vulnerabilities that allow control over UI elements or layout, programmatically add an extremely large number of constraints to a view. This would force PureLayout's constraint solver to perform an immense amount of calculations, potentially freezing the UI or draining device battery.

    *   **Cause Excessive Memory Usage (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Create and retain a massive number of layout views/constraints (CRITICAL NODE):** Creating and holding onto a huge number of views and their associated constraints can lead to memory exhaustion, potentially crashing the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors or Bugs within PureLayout (if exploitable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_or_bugs_within_purelayout__if_exploitable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers seek to identify and exploit inherent flaws or edge cases within the PureLayout library itself to cause crashes or unexpected behavior.

    *   **Trigger crashes or unexpected behavior due to specific constraint combinations:**
        *   **Identify and exploit edge cases in PureLayout's constraint solving algorithm (CRITICAL NODE - if exploitable):** Like any software, PureLayout might have edge cases or bugs in its constraint solving logic. An attacker who can identify specific combinations of constraints that trigger these bugs could cause crashes or unpredictable behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization in Layout Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validationsanitization_in_layout_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage insufficient input validation when the application uses external data to define layout parameters, injecting malicious values to cause harm.

    *   **Inject malicious data into layout-related properties (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **If layout parameters are derived from external input, inject values leading to resource exhaustion or UI issues:** If the application dynamically generates constraints or layout parameters based on user input or external data without proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious values that lead to resource exhaustion or unexpected UI behavior. This is less about PureLayout's inherent vulnerabilities and more about how the application *uses* PureLayout.
