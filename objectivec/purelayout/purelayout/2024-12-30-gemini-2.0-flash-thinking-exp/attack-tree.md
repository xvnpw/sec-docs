**Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes Exploiting PureLayout**

**Attacker Goal:** Cause unintended application behavior, information disclosure, or denial of service by leveraging vulnerabilities in how the application uses PureLayout (focused on high-risk areas).

**Sub-Tree of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Exploit PureLayout Constraint Manipulation
    *   Supply Malicious Constraint Data
        *   Manipulate Data from Backend Services **CRITICAL NODE** **HIGH RISK PATH**
    *   Exploit Side Effects of Constraint Application **HIGH RISK PATH**
        *   Cause UI Element Overlap Leading to Information Obscuration **HIGH RISK PATH**
        *   Cause UI Element to Render Off-Screen **HIGH RISK PATH**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Manipulate Data from Backend Services (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   **Compromise Backend API Endpoints:** Exploit vulnerabilities in the backend API endpoints that provide layout data or parameters used by the application to generate PureLayout constraints. This could involve techniques like SQL injection, command injection, or exploiting authentication/authorization flaws.
        *   **Compromise Backend Servers:** Gain unauthorized access to the backend servers themselves through methods like exploiting server software vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials, or social engineering.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** Intercept and modify the communication between the application and the backend service to inject malicious layout data.
        *   **Compromise Backend Databases:** Gain unauthorized access to the backend databases storing layout configurations and directly modify the data.
    *   **Consequences:** Successful manipulation of backend data can lead to the application rendering malicious layouts, potentially obscuring critical information, displaying misleading content, or denying access to functionality. This can also be a stepping stone for further attacks if the UI is used to control application logic.

*   **Exploit Side Effects of Constraint Application (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   **Cause UI Element Overlap Leading to Information Obscuration (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Inject Malicious Constraint Data (via compromised backend or configuration):** Provide constraint values that force UI elements to overlap, hiding sensitive information or controls behind other elements.
            *   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Constraint Resolution:**  Craft specific constraint scenarios that exploit weaknesses in PureLayout's logic, causing unintended overlaps.
    *   **Consequences:**  Users might be misled by the obscured information, potentially making incorrect decisions or missing critical details. Sensitive data could be hidden from view.

    *   **Cause UI Element to Render Off-Screen (HIGH RISK PATH):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Inject Malicious Constraint Data (via compromised backend or configuration):** Provide constraint values that position UI elements completely outside the visible screen bounds.
            *   **Exploit Logic Flaws in Constraint Resolution:** Craft specific constraint scenarios that exploit weaknesses in PureLayout's logic, causing elements to be positioned off-screen.
    *   **Consequences:** Users are denied access to the functionality or information contained within the off-screen elements. This can lead to a denial of service for specific features or make the application unusable.
