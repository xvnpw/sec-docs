# Threat Model Analysis for purelayout/purelayout

## Threat: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive or Complex Constraints](./threats/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_or_complex_constraints.md)

**Description:**
*   Attacker might attempt to cause a Denial of Service on the client-side by manipulating inputs that lead to the creation of an extremely large number of constraints or highly complex constraint configurations by PureLayout.
*   This could be achieved by providing maliciously crafted data through APIs, user inputs, or other data sources that influence the application's UI layout logic.
*   The application, using PureLayout, would then attempt to resolve these constraints, leading to excessive CPU and memory usage, UI freezes, battery drain, and potentially application crashes.

**Impact:**
*   Application becomes unresponsive or extremely slow.
*   UI freezes, making the application unusable.
*   Excessive resource consumption on the client device.
*   Battery drain on mobile devices.
*   Potential application crashes, leading to data loss or user frustration.

**PureLayout Component Affected:**
*   Primarily affects PureLayout's constraint resolution engine and constraint creation methods. Specifically, functions like `-[UIView autoSetDimensionsToSize:]`, `-[UIView autoPinEdgesToSuperviewEdgesWithInsets:]`, `-[UIView autoPinEdge:toEdge:ofView:withOffset:]`, and all other constraint creation and management APIs. The core layout calculation process is overloaded.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Input Validation and Sanitization: Rigorously validate and sanitize any external data or user input that influences UI layout and constraint generation. Implement limits on the number of UI elements or constraints that can be dynamically created based on external data.
*   Constraint Complexity Limits: Implement application-level limits on the complexity of constraint relationships and the total number of constraints. Avoid deeply nested or overly complex constraint configurations, especially if dynamically generated.
*   Performance Testing and Monitoring: Conduct regular performance testing under various UI layout scenarios, including edge cases and scenarios with potentially large or complex layouts. Monitor client-side resource usage (CPU, memory) during layout operations.
*   Code Review: Carefully review code sections responsible for creating and managing constraints, especially when constraints are dynamically generated or influenced by external data. Look for potential vulnerabilities that could lead to excessive constraint creation.
*   Lazy Loading/On-Demand Layout: Implement lazy loading or on-demand UI element creation and layout to avoid creating all constraints upfront. Only create and layout elements as they become necessary or visible.
