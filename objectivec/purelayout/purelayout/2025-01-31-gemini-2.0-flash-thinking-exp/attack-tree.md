## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Create Conflicting or Unsatisfiable Constraints](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_create_conflicting_or_unsatisfiable_constraints.md)

* **Breakdown:**
                * **1.1.2.a Manipulate Input to Force Conflicting Constraint Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]**
                    * **Attack Vector:** Providing input that forces the application to create logically conflicting constraints, leading to layout engine thrashing and potential DoS.
