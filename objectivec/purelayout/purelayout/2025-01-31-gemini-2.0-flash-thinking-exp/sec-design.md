# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a flexible and intuitive Auto Layout library for iOS and macOS developers.
  - Simplify and enhance the process of creating user interfaces programmatically.
  - Encourage adoption and widespread use within the Apple development community.
  - Maintain stability, performance, and ease of integration.
- Business Risks:
  - Code defects leading to incorrect layout behavior in applications using PureLayout.
  - Security vulnerabilities within PureLayout that could be exploited in dependent applications.
  - Lack of community support or maintenance leading to stagnation and reduced adoption.
  - Compatibility issues with new versions of Xcode, Swift, or Apple operating systems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Version Control - Git is used for version control, providing history and traceability of changes. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - accepted risk: No Formal Security Audits -  There is no indication of formal security audits being conducted on the project.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Review - Security relies on the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used during development or testing.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security flaws.
  - security control: Contribution Security Guidelines - Establish clear guidelines for contributors regarding secure coding practices and vulnerability reporting.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable - PureLayout is a client-side library and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable - PureLayout does not manage access control or authorization.
  - Input Validation: Limited relevance - PureLayout primarily deals with layout constraints and calculations. Input validation is generally handled by the applications using the library when providing data to be displayed. However, ensure that internal calculations are robust and prevent unexpected behavior from extreme or invalid inputs.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable - PureLayout does not require cryptographic operations.

  - Releases/Build Artifacts: Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity is crucial to ensure developers are using a safe and unmodified library.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any plans to implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, dependency scanning) for PureLayout?
  - Is there a process for handling and disclosing security vulnerabilities reported by the community?
  - Are there any specific security requirements or concerns from the project maintainers or community?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and widely adopted open-source layout library. Security is important for maintaining trust and preventing negative impact on users.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security relies on open-source community review. There are no dedicated security resources or formal security processes in place.
  - DESIGN: The project is designed as a client-side library distributed through standard package managers. Deployment is handled by developers integrating the library into their applications. Build process is likely developer-driven with potential for optional CI for testing and release preparation.
