# Threat Model Analysis for purelayout/purelayout

## Threat: [Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion via Complex Layout Calculations](./threats/client-side_denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion_via_complex_layout_calculations.md)

**Description:**
* **Attacker Action:** An attacker could craft or manipulate data that, when processed by the application, leads to an extremely large number of complex and inefficient layout calculations performed by PureLayout.
* **How:** By providing input that results in deeply nested view hierarchies or highly conflicting and computationally expensive constraint sets, the attacker can force PureLayout to consume excessive CPU and memory resources on the client device.

**Impact:**
* **Description:** The application becomes unresponsive or extremely slow, effectively denying service to the user. This can lead to application crashes, battery drain, and a severely degraded user experience. In critical applications, this could lead to missed deadlines or failures.

**Affected PureLayout Component:**
* **Description:** Primarily affects the core **Layout Engine Integration** and **Constraint Resolution Logic** within PureLayout. This includes the methods and algorithms responsible for calculating and applying layout changes based on the defined constraints.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement safeguards to limit the complexity of dynamically generated UI layouts.
* Profile application performance regularly to identify and optimize computationally expensive layout scenarios.
* Avoid creating excessively deep view hierarchies or highly complex constraint relationships.
* Consider using techniques like view recycling or lazy loading for complex layouts to reduce the number of active constraints.
* Implement timeouts or resource limits for layout calculations to prevent indefinite blocking.

## Threat: [Critical UI Misrepresentation Leading to User Deception](./threats/critical_ui_misrepresentation_leading_to_user_deception.md)

**Description:**
* **Attacker Action:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in PureLayout's constraint resolution to force the UI to render in a way that critically misrepresents information or hides crucial details from the user.
* **How:** By manipulating data or application state to trigger specific edge cases or bugs in PureLayout, the attacker could cause elements to overlap in a misleading way, obscure important warnings or confirmations, or present false information through manipulated layout.

**Impact:**
* **Description:** This could lead to users making incorrect decisions based on the misrepresented UI, potentially resulting in financial loss, security breaches (e.g., approving malicious transactions), or other significant negative consequences. The user is actively deceived by the application's presentation.

**Affected PureLayout Component:**
* **Description:** Primarily affects the **Constraint Resolution Logic** and **View Positioning** mechanisms within PureLayout. This includes the functions responsible for calculating the final position and size of views based on the applied constraints.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rigorous UI testing, specifically focusing on edge cases and scenarios where layout manipulation could lead to misrepresentation.
* Conduct thorough code reviews of UI layout logic, paying close attention to how constraints are defined and modified.
* Avoid relying solely on layout for conveying critical security information or confirmations. Implement additional safeguards and visual cues.
* Keep PureLayout updated to benefit from bug fixes that may address potential layout vulnerabilities.
* Consider using UI snapshot testing to detect unintended layout changes.
