# Attack Surface Analysis for purelayout/purelayout

## Attack Surface: [No High or Critical Severity Attack Surfaces Directly Involving PureLayout Identified](./attack_surfaces/no_high_or_critical_severity_attack_surfaces_directly_involving_purelayout_identified.md)

* **[No High or Critical Severity Attack Surfaces Directly Involving PureLayout Were Identified in the Previous Analysis]**

Based on the previous analysis, the attack surfaces directly involving PureLayout were categorized as Medium or Low severity. While PureLayout contributes to the *possibility* of certain vulnerabilities, the direct exploits and high/critical severity impacts were generally tied to broader application logic or dependency issues.

To illustrate, let's re-examine why the previous items didn't qualify:

* **Logic Errors in Dynamic Constraint Definitions:** While directly involving PureLayout, the impact was primarily UI inconsistencies or potential minor information disclosure, leading to a "Medium" severity. To reach "High" or "Critical," these errors would need to directly enable significant data breaches or remote code execution, which is less likely to be solely attributable to PureLayout's constraint logic.
* **Performance Degradation due to Excessive or Complex Constraints:** This directly involves PureLayout, but the impact is primarily denial of service (usability), leading to a "Medium" severity.
* **Integer Overflow/Underflow in Constraint Calculations (Theoretical):**  Directly involves PureLayout, but the likelihood and impact were considered "Low."

Therefore, based on the previous assessment, there are no attack surfaces with High or Critical severity that *directly* stem from vulnerabilities within the PureLayout library itself. The risks are primarily related to how developers *use* the library, leading to lower severity impacts.
