### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

#### 2.1. C4 Context Diagram Components

*   **gcdwebserver (Software System):**
    *   **Security Implications:** As the core component, vulnerabilities in `gcdwebserver` directly expose the system to risks.  Lack of built-in security features (HTTPS, authentication, authorization) places a significant security burden on the embedding application developer.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Vulnerabilities in core C code:** Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free), logic errors in request parsing or file handling, leading to crashes, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution if exploited.
        *   **Path Traversal:** If file path handling is not carefully implemented, attackers could potentially access files outside the intended static content directory.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Resource exhaustion due to excessive requests, slowloris attacks, or inefficient resource management within `gcdwebserver` itself.
        *   **Misconfiguration by Users:**  Users might incorrectly configure the server, exposing sensitive files or enabling insecure access.
*   **Web Browser User (Person):**
    *   **Security Implications:** Users are the targets of attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the web server. Their browsers rely on the server's security to protect them from malicious content or attacks.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Exposure to vulnerable web server:** If `gcdwebserver` is vulnerable, users could be exposed to attacks like information disclosure or DoS.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** If HTTPS is not properly implemented by the embedding application, user data transmitted to the server could be intercepted.
*   **DNS Server (External System):**
    *   **Security Implications:** DNS resolution is critical for accessing the web server. DNS vulnerabilities can lead to users being redirected to malicious sites.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning:**  Attackers could manipulate DNS records to redirect users to a malicious server instead of the intended `gcdwebserver` instance. This is primarily a DNS infrastructure concern, but impacts the overall security of accessing the web server.
*   **Load Balancer (Infrastructure Component):**
    *   **Security Implications:** The load balancer is a critical entry point. Its security is essential for protecting backend `gcdwebserver` instances.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Load Balancer Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the load balancer itself could be exploited to compromise the entire web server infrastructure.
        *   **Misconfiguration of Load Balancer:**  Incorrectly configured load balancer rules could expose backend servers directly or create security loopholes.
        *   **DDoS Attacks Targeting Load Balancer:**  Overwhelming the load balancer with traffic can lead to service disruption.

#### 2.2. C4 Container Diagram Components

*   **Web Server Process (Process):**
    *   **Security Implications:** This is the core execution unit. Vulnerabilities here are critical.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Memory Safety Vulnerabilities:** Buffer overflows, use-after-free in C code, leading to crashes or potential code execution.
        *   **Path Traversal:**  Improper handling of file paths in requests could allow access to unauthorized files.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Inefficient handling of requests or connections could lead to DoS.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Errors in response handling or logging could inadvertently leak sensitive information.
        *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  If `gcdwebserver` itself doesn't perform basic input validation (even though it's user's responsibility), it might be more susceptible to attacks.
*   **File System (Data Store):**
    *   **Security Implications:**  Static content is stored here. Unauthorized access or modification is a risk.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Unauthorized File Access:**  Path traversal vulnerabilities in the Web Server Process could allow attackers to read or write files outside the intended static content directory.
        *   **Data Tampering:**  If file system permissions are misconfigured, attackers could potentially modify or replace static content files.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Directory Listing):**  If directory listing is enabled (either by default or misconfiguration in embedding application), attackers could enumerate files and potentially discover sensitive information or vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Interface (Infrastructure Component):**
    *   **Security Implications:**  Entry and exit point for network traffic. Security controls here are crucial for network-level protection.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Unprotected Network Access:**  If firewall rules are not properly configured, the web server port might be exposed to unauthorized networks or the public internet without necessary protection.
        *   **Network-based DoS Attacks:**  Attacks targeting the network interface (e.g., SYN floods) can overwhelm the server.

#### 2.3. C4 Deployment Diagram Components

*   **Web Server Instance (Compute Instance):**

    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Compromised Instance:**  If an instance is compromised (e.g., through OS vulnerabilities or misconfiguration), it could be used to attack other instances or the wider network.
        *   **Lack of Security Hardening:**  Instances not properly hardened (e.g., default credentials, unnecessary services running) are more vulnerable.
        *   **Outdated Software:**  Running outdated operating systems or software on instances exposes them to known vulnerabilities.
*   **Load Balancer (Network Load Balancer):** (Already covered in Context Diagram)
*   **Availability Zone (Cloud Infrastructure Zone):**
    *   **Security Implications:**  Availability Zones provide redundancy, but security misconfigurations within an AZ can impact all instances within it.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **AZ-level Security Breach:**  Although less likely, a security breach at the Availability Zone level could compromise multiple instances.
        *   **Shared Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the underlying shared infrastructure of the Availability Zone could potentially be exploited.
*   **Internet (Public Network):**
    *   **Security Implications:**  Untrusted network. All traffic from the internet should be treated as potentially malicious.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Internet-borne Attacks:**  Web servers exposed to the internet are constantly targeted by various attacks (DoS, vulnerability scanning, exploitation attempts).

    *   **Security Implications:**  Process of creating executable code. Secure compiler settings are important.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Compiler Vulnerabilities:**  Although less common, vulnerabilities in the compiler itself could be exploited.
        *   **Insecure Compiler Flags:**  Using insecure compiler flags (or not using security-enhancing flags) can increase vulnerability risks.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  If `gcdwebserver` depends on external libraries (even standard C libraries), vulnerabilities in those dependencies could be a risk.
*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) (Security Check):**
    *   **Security Implications:**  Automated vulnerability detection. Effectiveness depends on tool quality and usage.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **SAST Tool Limitations:**  SAST tools might not detect all types of vulnerabilities (false negatives).
        *   **Misconfigured SAST:**  Incorrectly configured or outdated SAST tools might be less effective.
        *   **Ignoring SAST Findings:**  If developers ignore or dismiss SAST findings without proper investigation and remediation, vulnerabilities will remain.
*   **Build Artifacts (Software Package):**
    *   **Security Implications:**  Output of the build process. Integrity is crucial for secure deployment.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Artifact Tampering:**  If build artifacts are not properly secured, attackers could tamper with them after the build process but before deployment.
        *   **Vulnerable Artifacts:**  If vulnerabilities are not identified and fixed during the build process, vulnerable artifacts will be deployed.
*   **Artifact Repository (Storage System):**
    *   **Security Implications:**  Storage for build artifacts. Access control and integrity are important.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Artifacts:**  If access controls are weak, unauthorized individuals could access or download build artifacts, potentially including sensitive information or vulnerable code.
