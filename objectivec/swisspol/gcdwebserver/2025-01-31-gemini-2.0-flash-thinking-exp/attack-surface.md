# Attack Surface Analysis for swisspol/gcdwebserver

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (File Serving)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__file_serving_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can access files and directories outside the intended web root by manipulating URL paths, typically using ".." sequences.
*   **gcdwebserver Contribution:** If `gcdwebserver` is used to serve static files and its path handling logic is flawed, it directly enables path traversal attacks. The library's responsibility is to securely handle file paths.
*   **Example:** An attacker requests `http://example.com/../../../../etc/passwd` hoping to access the system's password file if `gcdwebserver` fails to properly sanitize the path and restricts file access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration files, source code, or even system files, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer/User:**
        *   **Restrict Served Directory:**  Configure `gcdwebserver` to serve files only from a tightly controlled, specific directory. Avoid serving broad directories or the entire filesystem.
        *   **Thorough Testing:**  Thoroughly test file serving functionality with various path manipulation attempts to ensure path traversal is not possible.
    *   **gcdwebserver (Library Improvement):**
        *   **Robust Path Sanitization:** Implement mandatory and robust path sanitization within `gcdwebserver`. This should normalize paths, remove ".." sequences, and strictly validate that accessed paths remain within the designated web root.
        *   **Secure API Design:** Design the file serving API to inherently prevent path traversal by abstracting away direct file path manipulation from the user and enforcing path restrictions internally.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed HTTP Request Handling (Remote Code Execution Potential)](./attack_surfaces/malformed_http_request_handling__remote_code_execution_potential_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in parsing malformed HTTP requests, especially in lower-level languages like C (which GCDWebServer likely uses under the hood via GCD), can lead to memory corruption issues like buffer overflows. If exploitable, these can result in remote code execution.
*   **gcdwebserver Contribution:** `gcdwebserver` is responsible for parsing all incoming HTTP requests. If its parsing implementation contains vulnerabilities, it directly creates an attack vector for remote code execution.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with an excessively long header or a malformed request line that triggers a buffer overflow in `gcdwebserver`'s parsing code. This overflow is then exploited to inject and execute malicious code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) - complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to take full control, steal data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer/User:**
        *   **Stay Updated:** Keep `gcdwebserver` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        *   **Security Audits (if possible):** If deploying in a high-security environment, consider security audits of applications using `gcdwebserver` and potentially the library itself.
    *   **gcdwebserver (Library Improvement):**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Employ secure coding practices in HTTP request parsing implementation, focusing on memory safety and preventing buffer overflows.
        *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:**  Implement rigorous fuzzing and security testing of the HTTP parsing logic to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Use Safe Parsing Libraries:**  Consider leveraging well-vetted and secure HTTP parsing libraries instead of implementing parsing logic from scratch, if feasible within the GCD framework.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement input validation and sanitization at the parsing level to handle malformed requests gracefully and prevent exploitation of parsing flaws.
