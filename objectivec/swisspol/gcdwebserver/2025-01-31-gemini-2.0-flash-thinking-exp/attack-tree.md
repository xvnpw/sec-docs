## Attack Tree Path: [1. Path Traversal Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__path_traversal_vulnerability__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Manipulate URLs by inserting sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended web root directory.
    *   Attempt to access sensitive files such as configuration files, source code, or data files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Read sensitive application files:** Exposure of confidential information, including database credentials, API keys, and application secrets.
    *   **Execute arbitrary code (if application logic is vulnerable):** If the application processes files accessed via path traversal (e.g., includes or executes them), it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing complete system compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided input used to construct file paths.
    *   Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the programming language.
    *   Never directly concatenate user input into file paths.
    *   Consider using a whitelist approach for allowed file paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Directory Listing Vulnerability (if enabled) [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__directory_listing_vulnerability__if_enabled___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Access directories without index files when directory listing is enabled in gcdwebserver.
    *   Enumerate the application structure and files exposed by the directory listing.
    *   Identify sensitive files and endpoints based on the revealed file names and directory structure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Leakage of application structure, file names, and potentially sensitive files. This information can be used to plan further attacks and identify vulnerable endpoints.
    *   **Reveal application logic, dependencies, or sensitive data:** Exposed files might contain configuration details, code snippets, or other sensitive information.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable directory listing in gcdwebserver configuration.
    *   Ensure that index files (e.g., `index.html`) are present in directories that should be accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Requests:** Send a large volume of requests to the server to overwhelm its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
    *   **Overload server resources (CPU, Memory, Network):**  Cause the server to become unresponsive due to resource depletion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application unavailability:** The server becomes unresponsive, making the application inaccessible to legitimate users.
    *   **Service disruption:**  Disruption of business operations and user experience.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement rate limiting at the application level or using a reverse proxy.
    *   Configure resource limits for the server (e.g., connection limits, timeouts).
    *   Review gcdwebserver's code for potential resource-intensive operations and optimize them or implement safeguards.
    *   Consider using a more robust web server or a CDN for production deployments.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Information Disclosure via Error Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__information_disclosure_via_error_messages__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Trigger errors in the web server by sending malformed requests or requests that cause exceptions.
    *   Analyze verbose error messages returned by the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reveal internal paths, configurations, or software versions:** Verbose error messages can expose sensitive information like internal file paths, software versions, configuration details, or even snippets of source code.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** This information can aid attackers in understanding the system's internals and planning further, more targeted attacks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Configure gcdwebserver to log errors appropriately but avoid displaying verbose error messages to end-users in production.
    *   Implement custom error pages that provide minimal information to the user while logging detailed errors for administrators.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__insecure_default_configuration__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Exploit insecure default settings of gcdwebserver if they are not changed by the application deployer.
    *   Rely on default configurations that are vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Default web root accessible to sensitive files:** If the default web root is set to a directory containing sensitive application files, it makes Path Traversal attacks easier and more impactful.
    *   **Directory listing enabled by default:** Leads to Information Disclosure as described in point 2.
    *   **Verbose error logging enabled by default:** Leads to Information Disclosure as described in point 4.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Review gcdwebserver's default configuration and change any insecure defaults before deploying the application.
    *   Specifically, ensure directory listing is disabled, the web root is correctly set to the intended public directory, and error logging is configured securely for production.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Lack of authentication/authorization for sensitive endpoints [HIGH RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__lack_of_authenticationauthorization_for_sensitive_endpoints__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Access sensitive application endpoints or functionalities that lack proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Bypass intended access controls due to missing or insufficient security measures.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized access to application functionalities:** Gain access to restricted features, administrative panels, or sensitive operations without proper credentials.
    *   **Unauthorized access to application data:** Access and potentially manipulate sensitive data that should be protected by authentication and authorization.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization at the application level.
    *   Ensure that all sensitive endpoints and functionalities require proper authentication and authorization checks before access is granted.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing and implementing access controls.
