# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for swisspol/gcdwebserver

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization at gcdwebserver Entry Points](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_at_gcdwebserver_entry_points.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization at gcdwebserver Entry Points
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify gcdwebserver input points:** Recognize that `gcdwebserver` acts as the entry point for all HTTP requests. Focus on validating inputs *received by* `gcdwebserver` before they are processed by your application logic. This includes URL paths, query parameters, and request headers that `gcdwebserver` parses and makes available to your handlers.
    2.  **Implement validation in request handlers:** Within your `gcdwebserver` request handlers (blocks or methods handling specific routes), implement input validation logic. Access request parameters and headers provided by `gcdwebserver`'s request object.
    3.  **Validate URL paths and parameters:**  Use string manipulation or regular expressions within your handlers to validate URL paths and query parameters extracted by `gcdwebserver`. Ensure they conform to expected formats, data types, and allowed characters.
    4.  **Validate request headers:**  Access and validate relevant request headers (e.g., `Content-Type`, custom headers) provided by `gcdwebserver`. Check for expected values and formats before processing the request.
    5.  **Reject invalid requests early:** If validation fails at any point within your `gcdwebserver` handler, immediately return an error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) directly from the handler, preventing further processing of invalid input by your application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Path Traversal (High Severity) - By validating URL paths handled by `gcdwebserver`, you prevent malicious path manipulation.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity - if application logic processes and reflects input in responses) - Validating input early at the `gcdwebserver` entry point reduces the chance of XSS if your application later reflects this input.
    *   Injection Attacks (General) (Medium Severity - depending on application logic) - Early validation at `gcdwebserver` helps prevent various injection attacks by ensuring only valid data reaches your application logic.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity - related to malformed input causing errors) - Rejecting malformed requests at `gcdwebserver` prevents potential crashes or resource exhaustion due to unexpected input.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Path Traversal: High Risk Reduction
    *   XSS: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Injection Attacks (General): Medium Risk Reduction
    *   DoS: Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in some API endpoint handlers. Validation is inconsistent and not always applied at the earliest point within `gcdwebserver` handlers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and comprehensive validation logic needs to be implemented within all relevant `gcdwebserver` request handlers.
    *   Validation should be performed at the beginning of each handler to reject invalid requests as early as possible.
    *   Centralized validation functions reusable across different `gcdwebserver` handlers should be created.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced Authentication and Authorization Beyond gcdwebserver Basic Auth](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_authentication_and_authorization_beyond_gcdwebserver_basic_auth.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enhanced Authentication and Authorization Beyond gcdwebserver Basic Auth
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Evaluate gcdwebserver basic auth limitations:** Recognize that `gcdwebserver`'s built-in basic authentication is very basic and might not be suitable for complex applications requiring fine-grained access control or advanced authentication methods.
    2.  **Implement custom authentication middleware/handlers:** Develop custom authentication logic within your application that integrates with `gcdwebserver`. This can be implemented as middleware that intercepts requests *before* they reach your main handlers, or as part of your request handlers themselves.
    3.  **Utilize gcdwebserver routing for authorization:** Leverage `gcdwebserver`'s routing capabilities to define different handlers for various URL paths. Implement authorization checks *within* these handlers to control access based on user roles or permissions.
    4.  **Integrate with external authentication providers (optional):** If needed, integrate your application's authentication with external providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT issuers). Your `gcdwebserver` handlers would then verify tokens or session information provided by these providers.
    5.  **Securely manage credentials (if using basic auth):** If you choose to use `gcdwebserver`'s basic authentication for specific endpoints (e.g., admin panel), ensure that credentials are stored securely (not hardcoded, use environment variables or secure configuration) and transmitted over HTTPS.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - By implementing robust authentication and authorization within your application logic interacting with `gcdwebserver`, you prevent unauthorized access.
    *   Data Breaches (High Severity) - Controlling access via `gcdwebserver` handlers reduces the risk of data breaches.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity) - Fine-grained authorization within `gcdwebserver` handlers prevents privilege escalation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Breaches: High Risk Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic authentication is used for a limited set of administrative endpoints using `gcdwebserver`'s built-in feature. No robust application-level authentication or authorization is implemented for general user access interacting through `gcdwebserver`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Development of custom authentication middleware or handlers that integrate with `gcdwebserver` request processing.
    *   Implementation of authorization checks within `gcdwebserver` request handlers for all protected endpoints.
    *   Potentially replacing `gcdwebserver`'s basic auth with a more robust application-level authentication mechanism.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Error Responses and Directory Listing Configuration in gcdwebserver](./mitigation_strategies/custom_error_responses_and_directory_listing_configuration_in_gcdwebserver.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Custom Error Responses and Directory Listing Configuration in gcdwebserver
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement custom error handling in gcdwebserver handlers:** Within your `gcdwebserver` request handlers, implement error handling to catch exceptions or errors that occur during request processing.
    2.  **Return generic error responses from handlers:** In your error handling logic within `gcdwebserver` handlers, construct and return generic HTTP error responses (e.g., HTTP 500 Internal Server Error with a simple message) instead of allowing `gcdwebserver` to generate default error pages that might reveal internal details.
    3.  **Configure directory listing in gcdwebserver:** If serving static files using `gcdwebserver`, explicitly configure directory listing to be *disabled*. This is typically a configuration setting within `gcdwebserver` or your application's file serving logic.
    4.  **Secure error logging (separate from responses):** Implement secure logging to record detailed error information (stack traces, debugging details) for internal use, but ensure this logging is separate from the error responses sent to clients via `gcdwebserver`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Custom error responses from `gcdwebserver` handlers prevent leakage of sensitive information in error pages.
    *   Path Traversal (Low Severity - related to directory listing) - Disabling directory listing in `gcdwebserver` prevents attackers from browsing directory structures.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Path Traversal: Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic error handling might be present in some handlers, but likely relies on default `gcdwebserver` error responses in many cases. Directory listing is potentially enabled for static file directories served by `gcdwebserver`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent implementation of custom error handling within all `gcdwebserver` request handlers to return generic error responses.
    *   Explicit configuration within `gcdwebserver` or application logic to disable directory listing for static file serving.

    *   Integrate `gcdwebserver` updates into the application's build and deployment pipeline for faster patching.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS Configuration for gcdwebserver](./mitigation_strategies/https_configuration_for_gcdwebserver.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** HTTPS Configuration for gcdwebserver
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure TLS/SSL in gcdwebserver:** Utilize `gcdwebserver`'s configuration options to enable HTTPS. This typically involves providing paths to your TLS/SSL certificate file and private key file to `gcdwebserver` during initialization.
    2.  **Enforce HTTPS redirection in gcdwebserver or application:** Configure `gcdwebserver` (if it provides redirection options) or implement redirection logic in your application handlers to automatically redirect all HTTP requests to their HTTPS equivalents.
    3.  **Enable HSTS (if possible with gcdwebserver setup):** If your deployment environment and `gcdwebserver` setup allow, enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to instruct browsers to always connect via HTTPS. This might involve setting appropriate headers in `gcdwebserver` responses.
    4.  **Regular certificate management:** Implement a process for managing TLS/SSL certificates, including automated renewal and monitoring of certificate expiration to ensure continuous HTTPS availability for `gcdwebserver`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity) - Configuring HTTPS in `gcdwebserver` prevents MitM attacks by encrypting communication.
    *   Data Interception (High Severity) - HTTPS in `gcdwebserver` protects data in transit from interception.
    *   Session Hijacking (Medium Severity) - HTTPS reduces the risk of session hijacking by encrypting session data transmitted via `gcdwebserver`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: High Risk Reduction
    *   Data Interception: High Risk Reduction
    *   Session Hijacking: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** HTTPS is configured for production environments using certificates. HTTP to HTTPS redirection is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   HSTS might not be enabled. Verify if `gcdwebserver` setup and deployment allow for HSTS configuration.
    *   Automated certificate renewal process needs to be robustly implemented and monitored for `gcdwebserver`'s HTTPS configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden gcdwebserver Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_gcdwebserver_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Review and Harden gcdwebserver Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review gcdwebserver configuration options:** Thoroughly review all available configuration options for `gcdwebserver` as documented in its README or documentation. Understand the security implications of each option.
    2.  **Minimize exposed features:** Disable or avoid using any `gcdwebserver` features or modules that are not strictly necessary for your application's functionality. Reducing the attack surface minimizes potential vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Restrict allowed HTTP methods (if configurable):** If `gcdwebserver` allows configuration of allowed HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), restrict them to only those required by your application. Disable methods that are not used to limit potential attack vectors.
    4.  **Set appropriate timeouts:** Configure timeouts for connections and request processing in `gcdwebserver` to prevent long-running requests from consuming excessive resources and potentially leading to DoS conditions.
    5.  **Run gcdwebserver with least privileges:** Ensure that the process running `gcdwebserver` operates with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running it as root or administrator unless absolutely required and after careful security consideration.
