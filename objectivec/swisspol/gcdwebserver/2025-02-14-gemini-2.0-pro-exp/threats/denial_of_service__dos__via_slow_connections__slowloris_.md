# Deep Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) via Slow Connections (Slowloris) in GCDWebServer

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of a Slowloris attack and how it specifically exploits GCDWebServer.
*   Identify the precise GCDWebServer configurations and code components that are vulnerable.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate the threat *within* GCDWebServer's configuration, recognizing that this is a first line of defense, and application-level mitigations are still strongly recommended.
*   Establish clear testing procedures to verify the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the Slowloris attack vector as it pertains to GCDWebServer.  It does *not* cover:

*   Other types of DoS attacks (e.g., SYN floods, HTTP floods, amplification attacks).
*   Application-level vulnerabilities *unless* they directly interact with GCDWebServer's connection handling.  We acknowledge that application-level defenses are crucial, but this analysis is GCDWebServer-centric.
*   Network-level mitigations (e.g., firewalls, load balancers, intrusion detection/prevention systems).  These are outside the scope of GCDWebServer's configuration.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Understanding:**  Detailed explanation of the Slowloris attack.
2.  **GCDWebServer Vulnerability Analysis:**  Pinpointing the relevant GCDWebServer components and configuration parameters.
3.  **Code Review (Conceptual):**  Illustrating how GCDWebServer handles connections and timeouts (without access to the full, proprietary codebase, we'll use conceptual examples based on the public documentation and common server design patterns).
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Specific, actionable steps for developers.
5.  **Testing and Validation:**  Describing how to test for vulnerability and verify mitigation effectiveness.
6.  **False Positive/Negative Analysis:** Discussing potential issues with overly aggressive or lenient timeout settings.

## 2. Threat Understanding: Slowloris Explained

A Slowloris attack is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that exploits the way web servers handle concurrent connections.  It's characterized by:

*   **Low Bandwidth:**  Unlike traditional DoS attacks that flood the server with traffic, Slowloris uses minimal bandwidth.
*   **Many Connections:**  The attacker opens numerous connections to the target web server.
*   **Slow Data Transmission:**  The attacker sends HTTP headers (or parts of the request body) very, very slowly.  Each connection sends just enough data to keep the connection alive, but never completes the request.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The web server, expecting complete requests, keeps these connections open, waiting for more data.  Eventually, the server's connection pool (or other resources like threads or memory) is exhausted, preventing legitimate users from connecting.

**Why it works:**  Many web servers are designed to be patient with slow clients (e.g., users on dial-up or poor mobile connections).  Slowloris abuses this patience.  The server waits for the full request, holding the connection open, and the attacker never sends it.

## 3. GCDWebServer Vulnerability Analysis

GCDWebServer, like any web server, is potentially vulnerable to Slowloris if its timeout settings are not configured appropriately.  The key components and configurations are:

*   **`GCDWebServerConnection`:** This class represents an individual client connection.  It's responsible for reading incoming data and writing outgoing data.
*   **`GCDWebServer` (Main Server Class):**  This class manages the overall server lifecycle, including accepting new connections and dispatching them to `GCDWebServerConnection` instances.
*   **Timeout Properties:**
    *   **`connectedTimeout`:**  The maximum time allowed for a client to establish a connection.  If the connection isn't fully established within this time, it's closed.  This is *less* critical for Slowloris itself (which establishes connections quickly), but still important for general DoS resilience.
    *   **`readTimeout`:**  The maximum time the server will wait for *any* data to be received on an established connection.  This is *crucial* for mitigating Slowloris.  If the attacker sends data too slowly (below the threshold implied by this timeout), the connection will be closed.
    *   **`writeTimeout`:** The maximum time the server will wait to send data to the client. While less directly related to Slowloris *attacks*, an overly long `writeTimeout` can exacerbate resource exhaustion if the server is struggling to send responses due to other resource constraints.

**Vulnerability Scenario:**

If `readTimeout` is set too high (e.g., several minutes or, worse, disabled), an attacker can open many connections and send data extremely slowly, keeping those connections alive and consuming server resources.  GCDWebServer will wait patiently for the complete request, which never arrives.

## 4. Code Review (Conceptual)

While we don't have the GCDWebServer source code, we can illustrate the vulnerable logic conceptually:

```objectivec
// Conceptual illustration of GCDWebServerConnection's readData method
- (void)readData {
    // ... (setup code) ...

    // Set a timer based on readTimeout
    [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:self.readTimeout
                                     target:self
                                   selector:@selector(handleReadTimeout)
                                   userInfo:nil
                                    repeats:NO];

    // Start reading data from the socket
    while (/* data is available and request is not complete */) {
        // Read a small chunk of data
        NSData* data = [self.socket readDataWithTimeout:self.readTimeout]; //Another timeout can be here

        if (data == nil) {
            // No data received within the timeout
            [self handleReadTimeout];
            return;
        }

        // Process the received data (e.g., append to request buffer)
        [self.requestBuffer appendData:data];

        // Check if the request is complete
        if ([self isRequestComplete]) {
            // ... (process the complete request) ...
            [timer invalidate]; // Cancel the timeout timer
            return;
        }
    }
}

- (void)handleReadTimeout {
    // Close the connection
    [self.socket disconnect];
    NSLog(@"Connection closed due to read timeout.");
}
```

**Key Points:**

*   The `readTimeout` value directly controls how long the server waits for data.
*   If `readTimeout` is too large, the `while` loop can continue for a very long time, even if the client is sending data extremely slowly.
*   The `handleReadTimeout` method is crucial for closing the connection when the timeout is reached.

## 5. Mitigation Recommendations

The primary mitigation strategy within GCDWebServer is to configure the timeout values appropriately:

1.  **Set `readTimeout` to a Short, Reasonable Value:** This is the *most important* setting.  The specific value depends on your application's requirements, but a good starting point is **5-10 seconds**.  You may need to adjust this based on testing and real-world usage patterns.  Err on the side of being *too short* rather than too long.  A slightly shorter timeout that occasionally drops legitimate slow connections is preferable to a long timeout that allows a Slowloris attack to succeed.

2.  **Set `connectedTimeout` Appropriately:**  While less critical for Slowloris specifically, a reasonable `connectedTimeout` (e.g., **2-5 seconds**) helps prevent other types of connection-based DoS attacks.

3.  **Consider `writeTimeout`:**  While not directly related to Slowloris *prevention*, a reasonable `writeTimeout` (e.g., **5-10 seconds**) can prevent the server from getting stuck trying to send data to a slow or unresponsive client, which can help under heavy load.

4.  **Monitor Connection Statistics:**  Implement monitoring to track the number of active connections, the average connection duration, and the number of connections closed due to timeouts.  This will help you identify potential attacks and fine-tune your timeout settings.  GCDWebServer likely provides some built-in statistics; leverage these and supplement them with your own application-level monitoring if needed.

5. **Review GCDWebServer documentation:** Always use latest stable version of GCDWebServer and review documentation for any updates or changes in timeout configurations.

## 6. Testing and Validation

Thorough testing is essential to verify the effectiveness of your mitigations:

1.  **Slowloris Simulation Tools:**  Use a Slowloris testing tool (e.g., `slowhttptest`, available on GitHub and other sources) to simulate a Slowloris attack against your application.

2.  **Controlled Environment:**  Perform testing in a controlled environment (e.g., a local development machine or a dedicated testing server) that is isolated from your production environment.

3.  **Vary Timeout Settings:**  Test with different `readTimeout` values to determine the optimal setting for your application.  Start with a very short timeout (e.g., 1 second) and gradually increase it until you find a balance between preventing Slowloris attacks and allowing legitimate slow connections.

4.  **Monitor Server Resources:**  During testing, monitor server resources (CPU usage, memory usage, number of open connections) to ensure that the server is not being overwhelmed by the simulated attack.

5.  **Test with Legitimate Slow Connections:**  In addition to simulated attacks, test with legitimate slow connections (e.g., by throttling your network connection) to ensure that your timeout settings are not too aggressive.

6.  **Automated Regression Tests:**  Incorporate Slowloris tests into your automated testing suite to ensure that your mitigations remain effective as your application evolves.

## 7. False Positive/Negative Analysis

*   **False Positives (Legitimate Connections Dropped):**  If your `readTimeout` is too short, you may inadvertently drop legitimate connections from users with slow or unreliable network connections.  This can lead to a poor user experience.  Careful testing and monitoring are crucial to find the right balance.

*   **False Negatives (Slowloris Attack Successful):**  If your `readTimeout` is too long, a Slowloris attack may still be able to succeed, even with the timeout in place.  The attacker can simply send data just frequently enough to avoid triggering the timeout.  This highlights the importance of using a Slowloris testing tool and monitoring server resources.

**Mitigation of False Positives/Negatives:**

*   **Adaptive Timeouts (Advanced):**  Consider implementing adaptive timeouts, where the timeout value is dynamically adjusted based on network conditions or server load.  This is a more complex solution but can provide better protection against both false positives and false negatives.  This would likely require custom code *outside* of GCDWebServer's built-in mechanisms.
*   **Application-Level Defenses:**  As emphasized throughout, this analysis focuses on GCDWebServer's configuration.  Robust application-level defenses (e.g., limiting the number of connections per IP address, using CAPTCHAs, analyzing request patterns) are *essential* for comprehensive Slowloris protection.  These application-level defenses can help mitigate the risks of both false positives and false negatives.

## Conclusion

The Slowloris attack is a serious threat, but it can be effectively mitigated within GCDWebServer by configuring the `connectedTimeout`, `readTimeout`, and `writeTimeout` properties to reasonably short values.  Thorough testing and monitoring are essential to ensure that your mitigations are effective and do not negatively impact legitimate users.  Remember that GCDWebServer's timeout settings are a *first line of defense*; application-level mitigations are still strongly recommended for comprehensive protection.
