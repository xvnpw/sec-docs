# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for swisspol/gcdwebserver

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection and Request Limits (GCDWebServer-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_and_request_limits__gcdwebserver-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Connection Limit (GCDWebServer API):** While GCDWebServer doesn't have a direct API for *total* connection limits, leverage GCD constructs *in conjunction with* GCDWebServer's connection handling. Use a `DispatchSemaphore` within the `GCDWebServer` delegate methods (if you're using a delegate) or within your connection handling logic.  Before calling `GCDWebServerConnection`'s `open` or similar methods, `semaphore.wait()`.  After closing the connection, `semaphore.signal()`.  This controls the concurrency *managed by* GCDWebServer.
    2.  **Configure Timeouts (GCDWebServer API):**  Use GCDWebServer's configuration options:
        *   `GCDWebServerOption_ConnectedStateCoalescingInterval`:  Set this to a reasonable value (e.g., 0.5 seconds) to control how often the server checks for connection timeouts.  This is a *direct* GCDWebServer setting.
        *   `readTimeout` (on `GCDWebServerRequest` or in your connection handling): Set a maximum time to wait for a client to send a request. This is often handled *within* a `GCDWebServerConnection` subclass or a request handler.
        *   `writeTimeout` (on `GCDWebServerResponse` or in your connection handling): Set a maximum time to wait for a client to receive a response.  Again, this is typically handled within the connection or response logic.
    3.  **Request Throttling (Within GCDWebServer Handlers):** Implement request throttling logic *inside* your `GCDWebServer` request handlers (the blocks you provide to `addHandlerWithMatchBlock:` or similar methods).  This is *indirectly* related to GCDWebServer, as it's within the context of its request processing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive connections:** (Severity: High) - Prevents GCDWebServer from being overwhelmed by connections.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to rapid requests:** (Severity: High) - Limits requests per client within GCDWebServer's processing.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (general, GCDWebServer-related):** (Severity: Medium) - Timeouts prevent GCDWebServer from holding resources for slow clients.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (excessive connections):** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **DoS (rapid requests):** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic request timeout configuration is present in `WebServerConfig.swift` (using GCDWebServer's options).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `DispatchSemaphore` for connection limiting within GCDWebServer's connection handling is not implemented.
    *   Request throttling within GCDWebServer handlers is not implemented.
    *   Fine-tuning of `GCDWebServerOption_ConnectedStateCoalescingInterval` is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control `GCDWebServerFileResponse` and `GCDWebServerDataResponse` Usage (GCDWebServer API)](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control__gcdwebserverfileresponse__and__gcdwebserverdataresponse__usage__gcdwebserver_api_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Usage:** Locate all uses of `GCDWebServerFileResponse` and `GCDWebServerDataResponse` within your GCDWebServer handlers.
    2.  **Whitelist (Files):**  *Directly* related to how you use `GCDWebServerFileResponse`.  Before creating the response, verify the requested file path against a predefined, hardcoded list of allowed paths.  Do *not* construct the file path directly from user input.
    3.  **Sanitization (Files - Last Resort):** If a whitelist is *absolutely* impossible (strongly discouraged), sanitize user input *before* passing it to `GCDWebServerFileResponse`.  This sanitization must happen *before* the GCDWebServer API is used.
    4.  **Data Source Validation (Data):**  *Directly* related to how you use `GCDWebServerDataResponse`.  Ensure the data you pass to `GCDWebServerDataResponse` is from a trusted source and is not constructed directly from unvalidated user input.
    5.  **Read-Only Directory (GCDWebServer Configuration):** When setting up GCDWebServer, configure it to serve static files from a directory with read-only permissions for the user running the web server process. This is a configuration aspect of GCDWebServer.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** (Severity: High) - Prevents using `GCDWebServerFileResponse` to access unauthorized files.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: High) - Prevents leaking sensitive data via `GCDWebServerFileResponse` or `GCDWebServerDataResponse`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk significantly reduced (eliminated with a proper whitelist).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Static files are served from a dedicated `static_files` directory with read-only permissions (GCDWebServer configuration).
    *   `GCDWebServerFileResponse` is used in `StaticFileHandler.swift`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A strict whitelist for allowed files used with `GCDWebServerFileResponse` is *not* implemented.
    *   `GCDWebServerDataResponse` usage in `APIHandler.swift` needs review to ensure data sources are trusted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep GCDWebServer Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_gcdwebserver_updated.md)

*   **Description:** This is *directly* related to the security of the GCDWebServer library itself.
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager.
    2.  **Regular Checks:** Check for GCDWebServer updates.
    3.  **Review Release Notes:** Examine release notes for security fixes related to GCDWebServer.
    4.  **Update Dependency:** Update the GCDWebServer version.
    5.  **Test:** Test after updating GCDWebServer.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in GCDWebServer:** (Severity: Variable) - Addresses vulnerabilities specific to the GCDWebServer library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   GCDWebServer is managed using Swift Package Manager.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Regular update checks are not scheduled.
    *   The project is using an outdated version of GCDWebServer.
