## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal (in Handler) `[HIGH RISK]`](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal__in_handler____high_risk__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits occur when a handler uses unsanitized user input (like a filename from a URL) to access files. Attackers can craft requests (e.g., `/files/../../etc/passwd`) to read or potentially write to arbitrary files on the server.  `GCDWebServer` doesn't inherently prevent this; the handler's logic is responsible.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Rigorously sanitize all user-supplied input used in file paths.
    *   Use functions that explicitly prevent path traversal (resolve relative paths, check against whitelists).
    *   *Never* directly concatenate user input into file paths.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews.
    *   Example (Vulnerable): Handler uses filename from URL directly in `[NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:]`.
    *   Example (Mitigated): Handler uses a whitelist of filenames or resolves to an absolute, sandboxed path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass (in Handler) `[HIGH RISK]`](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass__in_handler____high_risk__.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the authentication logic *within a handler* allow attackers to bypass protection.  `GCDWebServer` provides basic authentication, but custom implementations are common and prone to errors.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Review authentication logic in *every* protected handler.
    *   Perform authentication checks *before* sensitive operations.
    *   Consider using established authentication libraries (e.g., JWT).
    *   Test with invalid/malformed authentication tokens.
    *   Example (Vulnerable): Handler checks for a cookie but doesn't validate its signature/expiration.
    *   Example (Mitigated): Handler uses a well-vetted library and validates tokens thoroughly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Issues (in Handler) `[HIGH RISK]`](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_issues__in_handler____high_risk__.md)

*   **Description:** A broad category encompassing vulnerabilities where handlers don't properly sanitize data used in various operations (database queries, command execution, etc.). `GCDWebServer` delivers the potentially malicious input; the handler's responsibility is to validate it.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Variable (Low to Very High - e.g., SQL injection is Very High)
*   **Effort:** Low to High
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (Medium to Hard)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict input validation in *all* handlers.
    *   Use whitelists where possible.
    *   Validate data types, lengths, and formats.
    *   Consider using a validation library.
    *   Perform fuzz testing.
    *   Example (Vulnerable): Handler inserts user-provided string directly into a SQL query.
    *   Example (Mitigated): Handler uses parameterized queries or an ORM.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption (in GCDWebServer itself) `{CRITICAL}`](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption__in_gcdwebserver_itself___{critical}_.md)

*   **Description:** Buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory corruption vulnerabilities *within the GCDWebServer code* could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This is a critical vulnerability due to its potential impact.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High to Very High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update to the latest version of `GCDWebServer`.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to the library.
    *   Use memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer) during development/testing.
    *   Employ static analysis tools.
    *   Example: Buffer overflow in handling a large HTTP header.
