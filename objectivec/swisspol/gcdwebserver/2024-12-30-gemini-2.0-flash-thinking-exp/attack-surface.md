Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving GCDWebServer, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Malformed HTTP Requests**
    *   **Description:** GCDWebServer's parsing of HTTP requests might be vulnerable to malformed or unexpected request structures.
    *   **How GCDWebServer Contributes:** GCDWebServer is responsible for parsing and interpreting incoming HTTP requests. Flaws in its parsing logic can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Sending a request with an excessively long header line that exploits a buffer overflow in GCDWebServer's parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the server or consuming excessive resources, potentially bypassing security checks within GCDWebServer itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure GCDWebServer is updated to the latest version, which may include fixes for known parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a reverse proxy or web application firewall (WAF) that can normalize and validate incoming requests *before* they reach GCDWebServer.

*   **Attack Surface: Path Traversal via File Serving**
    *   **Description:** GCDWebServer's file serving functionality might allow access to files outside the intended directory structure by manipulating file paths in the request.
    *   **How GCDWebServer Contributes:** GCDWebServer provides the mechanism to serve files from specified directories. If it doesn't properly sanitize requested file paths, attackers can exploit this.
    *   **Example:** Requesting a file using a path like `/../../../../etc/passwd` when GCDWebServer is configured to serve files from a specific webroot.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure by gaining access to sensitive files on the server's filesystem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly control the root directory** from which GCDWebServer serves files.
        *   **Never directly use user-provided input** to construct file paths passed to GCDWebServer's file serving functions.
        *   Ensure GCDWebServer's internal path handling logic is secure and prevents traversal.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Custom Request Handlers (Enabled by GCDWebServer)**
    *   **Description:** While the vulnerabilities reside in the custom code, GCDWebServer provides the framework for these handlers, making it a direct component of this attack surface.
    *   **How GCDWebServer Contributes:** GCDWebServer allows developers to register and execute custom request handlers. Flaws in these handlers, while not in GCDWebServer's core code, are part of the attack surface enabled by its functionality.
    *   **Example:** A custom handler registered with GCDWebServer that executes shell commands based on unsanitized user input, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the custom handler, including remote code execution, data manipulation, and unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom handler).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Follow secure coding practices** when developing custom handlers integrated with GCDWebServer.
        *   **Regularly review and audit** custom handler code for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sanitize and validate all user-provided input** within custom handlers before processing.

*   **Attack Surface: Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion**
    *   **Description:** GCDWebServer's handling of incoming requests might be susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **How GCDWebServer Contributes:** GCDWebServer manages the processing of requests. If it doesn't have proper resource management or is vulnerable to resource-intensive requests, it can be exploited for DoS.
    *   **Example:** Sending a flood of requests to GCDWebServer or sending requests with excessively large bodies that consume significant memory.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement rate limiting** at the application level or using a reverse proxy to restrict the number of requests.
        *   **Configure appropriate timeouts** for connections and request processing within GCDWebServer's settings if available.
        *   Optimize any resource-intensive operations performed by the application or GCDWebServer.
