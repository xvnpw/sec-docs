## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Access Control Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_access_control_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This represents the broad category of attacks that bypass intended access restrictions. Success here often leads directly to sensitive information or system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__path_traversal.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate file paths in URLs (e.g., using `../`) to access files and directories outside the intended webroot.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Access Sensitive Files Outside Webroot](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_sensitive_files_outside_webroot.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successful path traversal allows attackers to read files they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if Path Traversal is successful)
    *   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Read Application Configuration Files (e.g., .env, config.ini)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__read_application_configuration_files__e_g____env__config_ini_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use path traversal to read configuration files that often contain sensitive information.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on specific file locations and permissions)
    *   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Obtain Credentials or API Keys](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__obtain_credentials_or_api_keys.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sensitive credentials and API keys are extracted from configuration files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if configuration file reading is successful)
    *   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application Accounts or External Services](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_accounts_or_external_services.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Stolen credentials and API keys are used to gain unauthorized access to the application or connected external services.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if credential theft is successful)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Read Application Source Code](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__read_application_source_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use path traversal to access and read the application's source code files.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if Path Traversal is successful)
    *   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Identify Further Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__identify_further_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** By analyzing the source code, attackers can identify logic flaws, security weaknesses, and potential entry points for further attacks.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (dependent on the complexity and security of the code)
    *   **Impact:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Write Arbitrary Files (if write access is enabled/misconfigured)](./attack_tree_paths/write_arbitrary_files__if_write_access_is_enabledmisconfigured_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If write access is inadvertently enabled, attackers could leverage path traversal or other vulnerabilities to write files to the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (write access is typically not enabled)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_application_files.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious files are written over existing application files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (dependent on write access)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious code (e.g., scripts, backdoors) is injected into application files.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (dependent on successful file overwriting)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Achieve Remote Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__achieve_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully injecting malicious code and triggering its execution allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_code_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This represents attacks that directly aim to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Vulnerabilities in gcdwebserver](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__remote_code_execution__rce__via_vulnerabilities_in_gcdwebserver.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting specific vulnerabilities within gcdwebserver's code to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires specific vulnerabilities)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Bugs in Request Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_bugs_in_request_handling.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted requests that exploit flaws in how gcdwebserver parses HTTP requests.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires specific parsing vulnerabilities)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious commands are injected within the crafted requests.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (dependent on successful exploitation of parsing bugs)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successful exploitation of parsing bugs allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in File Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_file_handling.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in how gcdwebserver handles files, potentially during upload or processing (if such features exist in the application using gcdwebserver).
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (gcdwebserver is primarily a static file server)
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Execution of Malicious Files (if upload/processing exists)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_execution_of_malicious_files__if_uploadprocessing_exists_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious files are uploaded and the server is tricked into executing them.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
    *   **Impact:** Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Shell Access](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_shell_access.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successful RCE allows the attacker to obtain a shell on the server, providing direct command-line access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
    *   **Impact:** Critical
