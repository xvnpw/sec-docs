# Threat Model Analysis for swisspol/gcdwebserver

## Threat: [Path Traversal](./threats/path_traversal.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing ".." sequences or other path manipulation characters to access files and directories outside the intended web root. The attacker might attempt to access sensitive configuration files, application source code, or even system files served by `gcdwebserver`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information served by `gcdwebserver`, potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker gains access to executable files within the served directory.

**Affected Component:** File serving logic within `gcdwebserver`, specifically the path resolution mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization of requested file paths *within the application or a layer in front of `gcdwebserver`*.
* Configure `gcdwebserver` to serve files from a specific, restricted directory and avoid using user-provided paths directly.
* Regularly audit the application's usage of `gcdwebserver` for potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Many Requests](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_many_requests.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests directly to the `gcdwebserver` instance in a short period, aiming to overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can lead to the `gcdwebserver` instance becoming unresponsive or crashing, denying service to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), making the application or specific functionalities relying on `gcdwebserver` unavailable.

**Affected Component:** Request handling logic within `gcdwebserver`, potentially the core server loop or connection management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting *in a layer in front of `gcdwebserver`* (e.g., a reverse proxy).
* Configure connection limits *at the operating system level or in a reverse proxy*.
* Monitor `gcdwebserver` resource usage and implement alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Large File Request Exhaustion](./threats/large_file_request_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker requests the download of extremely large files served by `gcdwebserver`. This can consume significant bandwidth and server resources managed by the `gcdwebserver` process, potentially impacting performance for other users or even leading to server instability.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or degraded performance for legitimate users accessing content served by `gcdwebserver`.

**Affected Component:** File serving logic within `gcdwebserver`, specifically how it handles large file transfers.

**Risk Severity:** Medium *(While listed as medium previously, if uncontrolled, it can escalate to high impact)*

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the size of files that can be served *at the application level or using a reverse proxy*.
* Monitor bandwidth usage of the `gcdwebserver` process.

## Threat: [Slowloris Attacks](./threats/slowloris_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends slow, incomplete HTTP requests directly to `gcdwebserver`, keeping connections open for extended periods without fully sending the request. This can tie up `gcdwebserver`'s connection resources and prevent it from handling legitimate requests.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the availability of resources served by `gcdwebserver`.

**Affected Component:** Connection management and request processing logic within `gcdwebserver`.

**Risk Severity:** Medium *(While listed as medium previously, if left unmitigated, impact can be high)*

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for incomplete requests *at a layer in front of `gcdwebserver`* (e.g., a reverse proxy).
* Limit the number of connections from a single IP address *using firewall rules or a reverse proxy*.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Settings](./threats/insecure_default_settings.md)

**Description:** `gcdwebserver` might have default configurations that are not secure, such as enabling directory listing by default. Developers who rely on these defaults without proper configuration could inadvertently expose vulnerabilities in how `gcdwebserver` serves content.

**Impact:** Increased attack surface, potentially leading to information disclosure if directory listing is enabled unintentionally.

**Affected Component:** Default configuration settings within `gcdwebserver`.

**Risk Severity:** Medium *(Can be High if it directly leads to significant information disclosure)*

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review the default configuration settings of `gcdwebserver`.
* Explicitly configure `gcdwebserver` with secure settings, specifically disabling directory listing if not required.
