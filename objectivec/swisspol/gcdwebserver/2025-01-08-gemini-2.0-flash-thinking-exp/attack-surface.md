# Attack Surface Analysis for swisspol/gcdwebserver

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths in requests to access files and directories outside the intended web root.

**How gcdwebserver Contributes:** `gcdwebserver` serves files based on the requested path. If it doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input path, attackers can use sequences like `../` to navigate the file system. This is a direct consequence of how `gcdwebserver` handles and resolves file paths.

**Example:** A request like `/../../../../etc/passwd` could potentially expose the system's password file if the server has sufficient permissions and path traversal is not prevented by the application or through server configuration.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, application source code, configuration files, or even system files, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation:**  The integrating application must implement thorough validation and sanitization of all user-supplied input that contributes to file paths *before* passing it to `gcdwebserver`.
* **Canonicalization:**  The integrating application should convert file paths to their canonical form and compare them against the allowed base directory before using them with `gcdwebserver`.
* **Chroot Environment:** Running the `gcdwebserver` process in a chroot environment limits its file system access, mitigating the impact of successful path traversal. This is a deployment-level mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Built-in Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_built-in_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**Description:** `gcdwebserver` itself doesn't provide mechanisms to control who can access specific resources.

**How gcdwebserver Contributes:**  As a basic file server, `gcdwebserver` serves files without inherently verifying the identity or permissions of the requester. Its core functionality focuses on serving files, not managing access control.

**Example:** Without additional implementation in the integrating application, any user who knows the URL of a file served by `gcdwebserver` can access it.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, and potential manipulation of data.

**Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is served)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement Authentication and Authorization in the Integrating Application:** The application using `gcdwebserver` *must* implement its own mechanisms to verify user identity and permissions before serving files using `gcdwebserver`. This is a critical responsibility of the application developer.
* **Token-Based Authentication:** The application can use tokens or session management to control access, validating these before allowing `gcdwebserver` to serve the requested resource.
* **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** The application can implement ACLs at its own level to determine access rights before invoking `gcdwebserver`.

## Attack Surface: [Reliance on Integrating Application for Security (Specifically Regarding Direct File Serving Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/reliance_on_integrating_application_for_security__specifically_regarding_direct_file_serving_vulnera_42d12f0e.md)

**Description:**  `gcdwebserver`'s simplicity means it lacks built-in defenses against certain vulnerabilities that arise from directly serving files.

**How gcdwebserver Contributes:** By directly serving files without inherent security measures like content security policies or automatic header injection for security, `gcdwebserver` relies entirely on the integrating application to implement these. This direct file serving can expose vulnerabilities if the application is not careful.

**Example:** If the application allows users to upload HTML files and serves them directly using `gcdwebserver` without setting appropriate `Content-Type` or security headers, it becomes vulnerable to XSS attacks. The vulnerability isn't *in* `gcdwebserver`'s code, but its direct file serving makes the application vulnerable.

**Impact:** Vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can be introduced if the integrating application doesn't implement proper security measures when using `gcdwebserver` to serve potentially malicious content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement Proper Content Security Policies (CSP):** The integrating application needs to ensure that appropriate CSP headers are set when serving content via `gcdwebserver`. This might involve using middleware or wrapping `gcdwebserver`'s response handling.
* **Set Correct `Content-Type` Headers:** The application must ensure that the correct `Content-Type` headers are set based on the file being served to prevent browsers from misinterpreting content (e.g., serving a text file as executable).
* **Input Sanitization for Uploaded Files:** If the application allows file uploads served by `gcdwebserver`, rigorous sanitization of the content is crucial to prevent the serving of malicious files.
