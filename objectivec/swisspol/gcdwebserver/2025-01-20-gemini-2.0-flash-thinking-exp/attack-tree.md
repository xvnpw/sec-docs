## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit File Serving Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_file_serving_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This represents a high-risk area because it directly targets the core functionality of gcdwebserver â€“ serving files. Vulnerabilities in this area can lead to immediate and significant compromise.

    * **Path Traversal [CRITICAL]**
        * This is a critical node as it's the primary technique attackers use to bypass intended directory restrictions.
        * **Attack Vector:**
            * **Identify Served Directory Root:** The attacker first needs to understand the base directory being served by gcdwebserver. This can be inferred through various means, including observing URL patterns or through information disclosure vulnerabilities.
            * **Craft Malicious URL with "..", "%2e%2e", etc.:**  The attacker crafts URLs containing sequences like `../` or URL-encoded equivalents (`%2e%2e%2f`) to navigate up the directory structure and access files outside the intended web root.
                * ***** Access Sensitive Application Files (e.g., configuration, database credentials) [CRITICAL] ***:**
                    * This is a critical node and the primary goal of path traversal attacks in this context.
                    * **Attack Vector:** By successfully traversing the directory structure, the attacker aims to access sensitive files such as:
                        * **Configuration Files:** These files often contain database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive settings.
                        * **Database Credentials:** Direct access to database credentials allows the attacker to access and manipulate the application's database.
                        * **Other Sensitive Application Data:** This could include internal logs, temporary files, or other data not intended for public access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Lack of Security Features [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_lack_of_security_features__critical_.md)

This branch highlights the inherent risk associated with using a simple file server like gcdwebserver for serving potentially sensitive content without implementing additional security measures.

    * **Lack of Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]**
        * This is a critical node because gcdwebserver, by design, likely lacks built-in mechanisms to verify the identity of users or control their access to files.
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits the absence of any access controls to directly request and retrieve files.

            * ***** Access Any Served File Without Credentials [CRITICAL] ***:**
                * This is a critical node and a direct consequence of the lack of authentication.
                * **Attack Vector:** The attacker simply sends a standard HTTP request for the desired file without needing to provide any login credentials or authorization tokens.

                * ***** Access Sensitive Application Data [CRITICAL] ***:**
                    * This is the ultimate goal of exploiting the lack of authentication.
                    * **Attack Vector:** If sensitive data files are placed within the directory served by gcdwebserver without any additional access controls, the attacker can directly access them. This could include:
                        * **User Data:** Personally identifiable information, user credentials, etc.
                        * **Business Data:** Proprietary information, financial records, etc.
                        * **Any other data that should not be publicly accessible.**
