# Threat Model Analysis for swisspol/gcdwebserver

## Threat: [Path Traversal](./threats/path_traversal.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request containing sequences like `../` or URL-encoded variations within the requested path. The `gcdwebserver`'s file serving mechanism doesn't properly sanitize or validate the path, allowing the attacker to navigate outside the designated web root directory and access arbitrary files on the server's file system.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files such as configuration files, application source code, database credentials, or user data. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.
    * **Affected Component:** File Serving Module, specifically the path resolution logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strictly define and enforce the web root directory.
        * Implement robust path sanitization and validation: Remove or reject requests containing `../` or similar path traversal sequences within `gcdwebserver`'s code if possible, or ensure the application using it does.
        * Avoid relying on client-side validation for path restrictions.
