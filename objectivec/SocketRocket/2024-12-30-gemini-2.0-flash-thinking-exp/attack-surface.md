Here's the updated list of high and critical attack surfaces directly involving SocketRocket:

*   **Attack Surface:** **Malformed WebSocket Frames**
    *   **Description:** A malicious server sends WebSocket frames that are intentionally malformed or violate the WebSocket protocol specification.
    *   **How SocketRocket Contributes:** SocketRocket is responsible for parsing and processing incoming WebSocket frames. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially memory corruption if specially crafted malformed frames are not handled correctly by the library itself.
    *   **Example:** A malicious server sends a frame with an invalid opcode or an incorrect payload length. If SocketRocket's parsing logic has a flaw, this could cause the application to crash or potentially lead to exploitable memory errors within the SocketRocket library.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) of the application, potential for exploitation leading to remote code execution if memory corruption occurs within SocketRocket's parsing routines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SocketRocket Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of SocketRocket to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities within the library.

*   **Attack Surface:** **Memory Management Issues within SocketRocket**
    *   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within SocketRocket's own code related to memory allocation and deallocation.
    *   **How SocketRocket Contributes:** As a library, any memory management flaws within its implementation can be exploited by a malicious server sending specific sequences of data or control frames that trigger these flaws *within SocketRocket's internal memory management*.
    *   **Example:** A malicious server sends a series of fragmented messages that, due to a bug in SocketRocket's reassembly logic, leads to a memory leak or buffer overflow *within the SocketRocket library's memory space*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, potential for remote code execution if a buffer overflow within SocketRocket can be exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SocketRocket Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of SocketRocket, as these updates often include fixes for memory management issues within the library.
        *   **Monitor for Unusual Behavior:** While not a direct mitigation for the library itself, monitoring the application for unusual memory consumption or crashes related to WebSocket communication can help detect potential issues.

*   **Attack Surface:** **Concurrency Issues (Race Conditions) within SocketRocket**
    *   **Description:** Bugs within SocketRocket's code related to the handling of concurrent operations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   **How SocketRocket Contributes:** As an asynchronous library, SocketRocket manages multiple operations concurrently. If internal synchronization mechanisms are flawed, race conditions can occur *within SocketRocket's own execution*.
    *   **Example:** A race condition in handling connection state changes within SocketRocket could lead to the library attempting to perform operations in an invalid state, causing crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable application behavior, potential crashes directly caused by SocketRocket's internal state issues, or in some cases, exploitable vulnerabilities within the library's logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SocketRocket Updated:** Updates often include fixes for concurrency-related bugs within the library.
        *   **Avoid Direct Manipulation of Internal State:**  Do not attempt to directly manipulate SocketRocket's internal state or rely on undocumented behavior, as this can increase the risk of interacting with potential concurrency issues within the library.
