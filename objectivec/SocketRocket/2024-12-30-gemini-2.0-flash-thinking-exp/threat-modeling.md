Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the SocketRocket library:

* **Threat:** Unencrypted Communication / Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the client application and the WebSocket server. They can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially reading sensitive data being transmitted. They might also attempt to inject malicious messages or modify data in transit. This is possible if TLS/SSL is not enabled or properly configured for the WebSocket connection *by SocketRocket or the underlying OS it utilizes*.
    * **Impact:** Confidential information could be exposed to unauthorized parties. Integrity of data can be compromised if attackers modify messages. The application's functionality could be disrupted by injected malicious messages.
    * **Affected SocketRocket Component:** `SRWebSocket` (responsible for establishing and managing the connection, including the TLS handshake).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always enforce TLS/SSL for WebSocket connections (using `wss://` scheme). This is a configuration that SocketRocket facilitates.**
        * **Ensure proper certificate validation and hostname verification are implemented. SocketRocket relies on the underlying OS for this, but proper usage is crucial.**
        * **Consider implementing certificate pinning to further restrict trusted certificates. This can be implemented in the application using SocketRocket's APIs.**
        * **Regularly review TLS/SSL configuration to ensure strong protocols and cipher suites are used. While the OS handles the negotiation, understanding the implications for SocketRocket is important.**

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Malformed Messages
    * **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, malformed WebSocket messages to the client application. These messages could exploit vulnerabilities in SocketRocket's parsing or processing logic, causing the application to crash, become unresponsive, or consume excessive resources.
    * **Impact:** The client application becomes unavailable to the user. Repeated attacks could lead to prolonged service disruption.
    * **Affected SocketRocket Component:** `SRWebSocket` (specifically the message parsing and handling logic within the library).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep SocketRocket updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for parsing vulnerabilities.**
        * **Implement error handling within the application to gracefully handle unexpected message formats and prevent crashes. This acts as a secondary defense.**

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in SocketRocket
    * **Description:** Older versions of SocketRocket might contain known security vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application is using an outdated version of the library.
    * **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution in the worst case.
    * **Affected SocketRocket Component:** Any component affected by the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use the latest stable version of SocketRocket.**
        * **Regularly check for security advisories and release notes for SocketRocket.**
        * **Implement a process for promptly updating dependencies when security vulnerabilities are discovered.**
