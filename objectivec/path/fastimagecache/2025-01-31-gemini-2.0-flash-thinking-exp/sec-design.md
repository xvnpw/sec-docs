# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Serving images to application users quickly and reliably.
 - Maintaining cache availability and integrity.
 - Efficiently managing cache storage and resources.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Cached images: Sensitivity depends on the application using the cache. Assuming publicly available images, sensitivity is low in terms of confidentiality, but high in terms of availability and integrity (serving correct images).
 - Cache metadata: Low sensitivity.
 - Logs and monitoring data: Low to medium sensitivity, depending on the information logged.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the expected scale of image requests and cache size?
 - What are the performance requirements (latency, throughput)?
 - What type of images will be cached (public, private, sensitive)?
 - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
 - What is the budget for security controls and infrastructure?
 - What is the expected lifespan of the project?

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - The primary business goal is to improve application performance.
  - The application serves publicly accessible images.
  - Cost-effectiveness is a consideration.
 - SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Basic security controls like code reviews and testing are in place.
  - The system will be deployed in a cloud environment.
  - Security is important but should be balanced with performance and cost.
 - DESIGN:
  - A standard web server (Nginx/Apache) will be used.
  - A distributed cache storage (Redis/Memcached/Disk) will be used.
  - Deployment will be in a typical cloud environment with load balancers and auto-scaling.
  - CI/CD pipeline will be used for build and deployment automation.
