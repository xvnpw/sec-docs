# Threat Model Analysis for path/fastimagecache

## Threat: [Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Cache Key Manipulation](./threats/path_traversallocal_file_inclusion__lfi__via_cache_key_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal/Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Cache Key Manipulation
*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate user-provided input used to generate cache keys by injecting path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). This forces `fastimagecache` to construct file paths that escape the intended cache directory, allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by requesting cached versions of these files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Confidentiality breach: Access to sensitive files like configuration files, application code, or user data.
    *   Potential for further exploitation: Reading application code might reveal vulnerabilities for other attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Cache Key Generation, File Path Construction, File System Access
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used for cache key generation.
    *   **Path Canonicalization:**  Canonicalize file paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before accessing the file system.
    *   **Path Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**  Implement whitelisting or blacklisting of allowed characters and path components in user input.
    *   **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Ensure the application user has minimal necessary permissions on the file system, limiting access outside the cache directory.

## Threat: [Image Processing Exploits (If FastImageCache performs image processing)](./threats/image_processing_exploits__if_fastimagecache_performs_image_processing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Image Processing Exploits (e.g., Buffer Overflows, Code Execution) via Malicious Images
*   **Description:** If `fastimagecache` uses underlying image processing libraries to perform operations like resizing or format conversion, vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by processing specially crafted malicious images. An attacker could upload or request such images, potentially triggering buffer overflows, memory corruption, or even arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Confidentiality breach: Potential access to sensitive data on the server.
    *   Integrity compromise: Modification of system files or application data.
    *   Availability impact: Denial of service or system crash.
    *   Code execution:  Possibility of gaining full control of the server.
*   **Affected Component:** Image Processing Module, Underlying Image Processing Libraries
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible), High (if DoS or memory corruption is possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Image Processing Libraries:**  Use secure and up-to-date image processing libraries. Regularly update these libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Image Data):**  Implement thorough input validation and sanitization for image data before processing.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:**  Consider using sandboxed or isolated environments (e.g., containers, virtual machines) for image processing operations to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable any unnecessary or insecure features of image processing libraries.
