# Attack Surface Analysis for path/fastimagecache

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning (Source-Side)](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning__source-side_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the image source (URL, filename, etc.) to inject a malicious image into the cache, replacing a legitimate image.
    *   **`fastimagecache` Contribution:** The library's core function is to cache images based on a source identifier.  If this identifier is user-controllable and the library doesn't perform sufficient validation *itself*, it directly enables this attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL parameter `?image=http://attacker.com/evil.svg` which, when cached by `fastimagecache`, replaces the legitimate `logo.png`. Subsequent users requesting `logo.png` receive the malicious SVG.
    *   **Impact:** XSS, defacement, malware distribution, data exfiltration (via XSS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if XSS is possible) or High (if limited to defacement).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`fastimagecache` Internal Validation:** The library *should* internally validate and sanitize the image source *before* fetching or caching it. This includes checking for allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http://`, `https://`), validating domain names against a whitelist (if applicable), and rejecting suspicious characters or patterns.  This is the *primary* mitigation that should be implemented within the library itself.
        *   **Image Type Verification (Within `fastimagecache`):** The library *must* verify the `Content-Type` header *and* the file's magic bytes to ensure it's a valid image of an expected type *before* caching.  This prevents caching malicious files disguised as images.
        *   **Application-Level Mitigations (Secondary):** While the library should handle the core validation, the application using it *should also* implement:
            *   Strict Source Whitelisting (at the application level).
            *   Input Validation and Sanitization (at the application level).
            *   Content Security Policy (CSP).
            *   Subresource Integrity (SRI) - if applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (Storage-Side)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__storage-side_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the file path used to *store* cached images, allowing them to write files outside the intended cache directory.
    *   **`fastimagecache` Contribution:** The library is directly responsible for writing cached images to the storage location.  If it constructs file paths insecurely using user-provided data, it's directly vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an image name like `../../../etc/passwd`. If `fastimagecache` doesn't sanitize this, it might overwrite a critical system file.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file overwrite, code execution (if a critical system file or application file is overwritten), denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible) or High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`fastimagecache` Internal Path Handling:** The library *must* use absolute, hardcoded paths for the cache directory *or* a strictly controlled, sanitized relative path.  It *must not* directly incorporate user input into the path construction without thorough sanitization and validation.  This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Safe Filename Generation (Within `fastimagecache`):** The library should generate safe filenames for cached images, regardless of the original filename.  This could involve using a hash of the image content or a unique identifier.  This prevents attackers from controlling the filename at all.
        *   **Application-Level Mitigations (Secondary):**
            *   Least Privilege (for the application process).
            *   Chroot Jail (advanced, for the application process).
            *   Strict File System Permissions (for the cache directory).

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL that causes the server (via `fastimagecache`) to make requests to internal or sensitive resources.
    *   **`fastimagecache` Contribution:** If the library fetches images from remote URLs based on user input, and it doesn't have built-in SSRF protections, it acts as a vulnerable proxy.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides `?image=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`. `fastimagecache` fetches this, exposing AWS metadata.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, access to internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High or Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`fastimagecache` Internal URL Validation:** The library *must* internally validate URLs *before* making any requests. This should include:
            *   **Strict Scheme Validation:** Only allow specific schemes (e.g., `https://`).
            *   **Whitelist of Allowed Domains (Ideally):** If possible, the library should have a configurable whitelist of allowed domains.
            *   **IP Address Restrictions:** The library should *not* allow requests to private IP address ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.1/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`).  This is *crucial*.
            *   **DNS Resolution Control (Advanced):** The library could resolve hostnames to IP addresses *internally* and then check the IP against allowed/blocked lists *before* making the request. This prevents DNS rebinding.
        *   **Application-Level Mitigations (Secondary):**
            *   Strict URL Whitelisting (at the application level).
            *   Network Segmentation.
            *   Disable Internal Network Access.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Disk Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__-_disk_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the cache with images, consuming all disk space.
    *   **`fastimagecache` Contribution:** The library's core function is to store images. Without internal limits, it's directly responsible for this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Repeated requests for many different, non-existent images.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`fastimagecache` Internal Limits:** The library *must* implement:
            *   **Maximum Cache Size:** A configurable limit on the total size of the cache.
            *   **Maximum Image Size:** A configurable limit on the size of individual images that can be cached.
            *   **Cache Eviction Policy:** An automatic eviction policy (e.g., LRU) to remove old images when the cache is full.
        *   **Application-Level Mitigations (Secondary):**
            *   Rate Limiting.
            *   Monitoring (disk space usage).
            * Input Validation (Size) - if source image size is known beforehand.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities (e.g., ImageTragick)](./attack_surfaces/image_processing_vulnerabilities__e_g___imagetragick_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits in underlying image processing libraries used by `fastimagecache`.
    *   **`fastimagecache` Contribution:** If the library performs *any* image processing (resizing, format conversion), it directly exposes vulnerabilities in those libraries.
    *   **Example:** A crafted image triggers a buffer overflow in `libjpeg` (used by `fastimagecache`).
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical or High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`fastimagecache` Dependency Management:** The library *must* use up-to-date and patched versions of all image processing libraries.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **`fastimagecache` Input Validation (Format):** The library *should* perform strict validation of the image format and structure *before* passing it to any processing library.
        *   **`fastimagecache` Sandboxing (Ideally):** If possible, the library should perform image processing in a sandboxed or isolated environment. This is a *significant* architectural change but provides strong protection.
        *   **Application-Level Mitigations (Secondary):**
            *   Disable Unnecessary Processing (if possible, at the application level).
            *   WAF (Web Application Firewall).
            * Least Privilege (for the process doing image processing).
