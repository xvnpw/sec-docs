# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for path/fastimagecache

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong, Unpredictable Cache Keys (within `fastimagecache`)](./mitigation_strategies/strong__unpredictable_cache_keys__within__fastimagecache__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Modify `fastimagecache` Key Generation:** Directly alter the library's code responsible for generating cache keys.
    2.  **Content Hashing (Inside Library):** Integrate the calculation of a SHA-256 hash of the *original* image's raw byte data *within* the `fastimagecache` library, before any processing. This should be a core part of the key generation process.
    3.  **Parameter Hashing (Inside Library):**  Modify `fastimagecache` to concatenate all relevant image processing parameters (after validation â€“ see separate strategy) into a consistent string representation. Hash this string using SHA-256.
    4.  **Combined Hashing (Inside Library):** Implement the combined hashing approach: `final_key = sha256(sha256(parameter_string) + image_content_hash)` *within* the library's key generation logic.
    5.  **Expose Configuration (Optional):**  Consider exposing configuration options to allow users to choose the hashing algorithm (though SHA-256 should be the default and strongly recommended).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Cache Tampering:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Information Disclosure (Limited):** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Significantly reduced, as the attacker needs the original image content and parameters.
    *   **Cache Tampering:** Reduced (best with integrity checks).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Partially reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Needs project-specific details)
    *   `fastimagecache` currently uses a simple hash of the URL.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hashing of original image content within the library.
    *   Parameter hashing within the library.
    *   Combined hashing logic within the library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (within `fastimagecache`)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__within__fastimagecache__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integrate Validation:** Modify `fastimagecache` to perform strict input validation *before* processing any image or generating cache keys.
    2.  **Allow-Lists (Within Library):**  Embed allow-lists for all image processing parameters (width, height, quality, format, etc.) *directly within* the `fastimagecache` code.
    3.  **Reject Invalid Input (Within Library):**  Modify `fastimagecache` to immediately reject any requests with parameters that don't match the allow-lists.  Throw an exception or return an error code that can be handled by the calling application.
    4.  **Type Checking (Within Library):** Ensure that `fastimagecache` performs type checking on all input parameters.
    5. **Configuration (Optional):** Consider allowing users to *configure* the allow-lists through a configuration file or API, but provide secure defaults.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Denial of Service (Cache Exhaustion):** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Image Processing Libraries:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Significantly reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Helps mitigate.
    *   **Image Processing Vulnerabilities:** Reduces likelihood.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   `fastimagecache` has minimal input validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive allow-lists for all parameters within the library.
    *   Early and strict validation within the library's request handling.
    *   Robust error handling for invalid input within the library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Digital Signatures / Integrity Checks (within `fastimagecache`)](./mitigation_strategies/digital_signatures__integrity_checks__within__fastimagecache__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hashing on Cache (Inside Library):** Modify `fastimagecache` to calculate a SHA-256 hash of the *original* image data *before* storing it in the cache.
    2.  **Store Hash (Library Managed):**  Modify `fastimagecache` to store this hash *alongside* the cached image data.  The library should manage the storage and retrieval of this hash.
    3.  **Hashing on Retrieval (Inside Library):**  Modify `fastimagecache` to, upon retrieval, calculate the SHA-256 hash of the *retrieved* cached image data.
    4.  **Compare and Handle (Inside Library):**  Modify `fastimagecache` to compare the calculated hash with the stored hash.  If they don't match, the library should:
        *   Discard the cached image.
        *   Log the event (using a logging mechanism within `fastimagecache`).
        *   Optionally, automatically re-fetch and re-cache the original image (and re-calculate the hash).
        *   Return an error or throw an exception to indicate the cache miss/tampering.
    5. **Digital Signatures (Optional, Inside Library):** Implement digital signature generation and verification within `fastimagecache` as a more robust alternative to simple hashing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Tampering:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Cache Poisoning (Partial):** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Tampering:** Effectively eliminates.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Fail-safe mechanism.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   Not implemented within `fastimagecache`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The entire process of hash calculation, storage, retrieval, and comparison within `fastimagecache`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cache Size Limits and Eviction Policy (within `fastimagecache`)](./mitigation_strategies/cache_size_limits_and_eviction_policy__within__fastimagecache__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configurable Limit:**  Modify `fastimagecache` to allow users to configure a maximum cache size (e.g., in bytes or number of entries).  Provide a sensible default.
    2.  **Eviction Policy Implementation:**  Implement one or more cache eviction policies (LRU, LFU, TTL) *directly within* `fastimagecache`.
    3.  **Policy Selection:** Allow users to choose the eviction policy through configuration.
    4.  **Automatic Eviction:**  Modify `fastimagecache` to automatically evict entries based on the chosen policy when the cache reaches its size limit.
    5.  **Internal Monitoring:**  Add internal monitoring within `fastimagecache` to track cache size, hit rate, and eviction rate.  Expose this data through logging or a dedicated API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Cache Exhaustion):** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   `fastimagecache` has a hardcoded TTL.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configurable maximum cache size.
    *   Choice of eviction policies (LRU, LFU).
    *   Internal monitoring of cache statistics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Normalization (within `fastimagecache`)](./mitigation_strategies/request_normalization__within__fastimagecache__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Normalization Rules:**  Embed normalization rules for image processing parameters *directly within* the `fastimagecache` code.
    2.  **Apply Before Key Generation:** Modify `fastimagecache` to apply these rules *before* generating the cache key.  This should happen *after* input validation.
    3.  **Examples:**
        *   Round width/height to the nearest multiple of 10.
        *   Clamp quality values to a specific range.
        *   Convert format strings to lowercase.
    4. **Configuration (Optional):** Consider allowing users to configure the normalization rules, but provide secure defaults.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Cache Exhaustion):** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Helps mitigate.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example)
    *   Not implemented within `fastimagecache`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The entire process of defining and applying normalization rules within `fastimagecache`.
