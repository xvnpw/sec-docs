# Threat Model Analysis for path/fastimagecache

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/cache_poisoning__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning (Resource Exhaustion)
    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a series of specially crafted image requests (e.g., extremely large dimensions, complex image formats requiring intensive processing, or "image bombs") designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) during image processing and caching. The attacker might use automated tools to flood the server with these requests. This directly targets the caching mechanism's handling of processed images.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) for legitimate users. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion. The cache fills up, preventing new images from being cached. This directly impacts the availability of the service relying on `fastimagecache`.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ImageProcessor` (hypothetical module responsible for resizing, transforming, and preparing images for caching), `CacheStorage` (hypothetical module managing disk storage for cached images).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of all image-related input parameters (dimensions, file size, format) *before* passing them to `fastimagecache`. Reject excessively large or complex images.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce resource limits (CPU time, memory usage, disk space) on the `ImageProcessor` and `CacheStorage` components *within* `fastimagecache`. Use operating system-level resource limits or containerization to isolate the image processing done by the library.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of image processing requests that `fastimagecache` handles per user/IP address within a given time window.
        *   **Robust Image Library:** If `fastimagecache` uses an internal image processing library, ensure it's a well-vetted one (e.g., ImageMagick, libvips) resistant to image-based attacks. If it allows external libraries, recommend secure options to users.
        *   **Cache Size Monitoring:** Monitor the cache size and growth rate managed by `fastimagecache`. Alert on unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning (Malicious Content)](./threats/cache_poisoning__malicious_content_.md)

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning (Malicious Content)
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a weakness in the cache key generation algorithm *within fastimagecache*. They craft a request that generates the same cache key as a legitimate request but provides malicious image data (e.g., an image containing hidden JavaScript or a visually offensive image). The attacker relies on predictable cache key generation or a collision in the hashing algorithm *implemented by fastimagecache*.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can replace a legitimate cached image with a malicious one *within the cache managed by fastimagecache*. Users requesting the legitimate image will receive the malicious content, potentially leading to XSS (if MIME type handling is flawed), defacement, or user annoyance.
    *   **Affected Component:** `CacheKeyGenerator` (hypothetical module within `fastimagecache` responsible for generating unique keys for cached images).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Hashing:** `fastimagecache` *must* use a cryptographically secure hash function (e.g., SHA-256). Include *all* relevant input parameters (image data, dimensions, processing options, user ID, a salt) in the hash calculation.
        *   **Collision Resistance:** Ensure the hashing algorithm and implementation *within fastimagecache* are resistant to collisions.
        *   **Cache Integrity Checks:** `fastimagecache` could optionally include a mechanism to periodically verify the integrity of cached images (e.g., by comparing their hashes against expected values).
        *   **Documentation:** Clearly document the cache key generation process and any security considerations for users of the library.

## Threat: [Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Cache Path Manipulation](./threats/local_file_inclusion__lfi__via_cache_path_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Cache Path Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that manipulates the file path used *by fastimagecache* to store or retrieve cached images. This allows them to access arbitrary files on the server. The attacker might use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in input that is *incorrectly handled by fastimagecache*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker can read sensitive data, potentially execute arbitrary code, and gain full control of the server. This is a direct result of how `fastimagecache` handles file paths.
    *   **Affected Component:** `CacheStorage` (hypothetical module within `fastimagecache` - specifically, the function that constructs the file path for cached images).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Direct Path Construction:** `fastimagecache` *must never* construct file paths directly from user-supplied input. Use a predefined base directory and generate filenames using a secure hash of the image data and parameters.
        *   **Internal Input Sanitization:** Even if the application using `fastimagecache` performs input validation, `fastimagecache` *must* also implement strict input validation and sanitization to ensure that any data used to construct file paths cannot contain path traversal characters. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Recommend (in documentation) that the application using `fastimagecache` runs with the least privilege necessary.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the `CacheStorage` component's code to ensure it's not vulnerable to LFI.
