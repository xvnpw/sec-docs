# Attack Surface Analysis for path/fastimagecache

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the server running the application to make requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external systems.

**How fastimagecache Contributes:** If the application directly uses user-provided URLs as input for `fastimagecache` to fetch and cache images, the library becomes the mechanism for making these potentially malicious requests.

**Example:** A user provides the URL `http://internal.server/admin/delete_all_data` as an image URL. `fastimagecache` attempts to fetch this URL, potentially triggering unintended actions on the internal server.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service against internal systems, potential for further exploitation of internal vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided URLs before passing them to `fastimagecache`. Use allowlists of acceptable domains or protocols.
* **URL Rewriting/Proxying:** Instead of directly using user-provided URLs, rewrite them or use a proxy service to fetch images, limiting the destinations `fastimagecache` can access.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Image URLs](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_image_urls.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths to access files or directories outside of the intended webroot or image storage location.

**How fastimagecache Contributes:** If `fastimagecache` doesn't properly sanitize or validate image URLs, an attacker might be able to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../sensitive_file.txt`) in the URL, potentially leading to the caching of unintended local files.

**Example:** A user provides the URL `http://example.com/../../../../etc/passwd` as an image URL. If not properly handled, `fastimagecache` might attempt to fetch and cache the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, access to sensitive files, potential for further system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict URL Validation:** Implement robust validation to ensure URLs conform to expected patterns and do not contain path traversal sequences.
* **Canonicalization:** Canonicalize URLs before processing to remove any relative path components.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Permissions on Cache Directory](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_permissions_on_cache_directory.md)

**Description:** The directory where `fastimagecache` stores cached images has overly permissive permissions, allowing unauthorized access.

**How fastimagecache Contributes:** `fastimagecache` manages the storage of cached images. If the application doesn't properly configure the permissions of the cache directory, it can become a point of vulnerability.

**Example:** The cache directory is world-writable. An attacker could directly place malicious files in the cache, which would then be served by the application.

**Impact:** Serving of malicious content, data breaches (if sensitive information is inadvertently cached), potential for further system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the cache directory has the most restrictive permissions possible, allowing only the necessary user and group to read and write.
