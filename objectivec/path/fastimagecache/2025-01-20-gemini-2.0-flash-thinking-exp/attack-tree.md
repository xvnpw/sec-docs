## Attack Tree Path: [Serve Malicious Content via Cache Poisoning [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/serve_malicious_content_via_cache_poisoning__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents the overarching goal of injecting malicious content into the application's cache. Success here allows the attacker to serve harmful content to users believing it originates from the legitimate application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure URL Handling [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_url_handling__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents vulnerabilities in how the `fastimagecache` library processes and handles URLs provided to it for caching. Weaknesses here can be exploited in multiple ways to inject malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Redirect URL [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_redirect_url__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a URL to `fastimagecache` that initially points to a legitimate resource. However, the server hosting this resource then redirects the request to a URL hosting malicious content. If `fastimagecache` doesn't carefully handle redirects and validate the final destination, it might cache the malicious content under the key associated with the initial, seemingly legitimate URL.

**Example:** The application requests caching of `legitimate.com/image.jpg`. The server at `legitimate.com` responds with a redirect to `attacker.com/malicious.jpg`. `fastimagecache` caches the content from `attacker.com/malicious.jpg`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply URL Leading to Malicious Content (e.g., different content type) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_url_leading_to_malicious_content__e_g___different_content_type___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker directly provides a URL pointing to a file that is not a valid image or contains malicious code disguised as an image. This could be a specially crafted SVG containing embedded JavaScript, an HTML file, or any other type of content that could be harmful when served by the application. If `fastimagecache` doesn't perform thorough content validation based on the actual content rather than just the URL extension or `Content-Type` header, it might cache this malicious content.

**Example:** The application requests caching of `attacker.com/malicious.svg` which contains embedded JavaScript that could execute in a user's browser when the cached image is served.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Filename Generation/Storage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_filename_generationstorage__critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights vulnerabilities in how `fastimagecache` generates and stores the cached image files on the file system. Weaknesses here can allow attackers to manipulate the storage location and potentially overwrite critical files or place malicious files in accessible areas.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Manipulated Filename [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_manipulated_filename__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If `fastimagecache` uses parts of the provided URL to generate filenames without proper sanitization, an attacker can craft a URL containing path traversal characters like `../`. This can trick the library into writing the cached file to a location outside the intended cache directory.

**Example:** The application requests caching of `legitimate.com/../../../../var/www/html/malicious.php`. If filename generation is flawed, `malicious.php` could be written to the web server's root directory, making it directly accessible and executable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS): Cache Overflow [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__cache_overflow__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker floods the application with requests that force `fastimagecache` to download and store a large number of images. This can be achieved by requesting a large number of unique images or by repeatedly requesting very large images. If the cache doesn't have proper size limits or eviction policies, this can lead to the exhaustion of disk space, memory, or other resources, causing the application to slow down, become unresponsive, or crash.

**Example:** An attacker repeatedly requests caching of thousands of unique, albeit small, images, filling up the disk space allocated for the cache. Alternatively, they could repeatedly request caching of a few extremely large image files, consuming significant bandwidth and storage.
