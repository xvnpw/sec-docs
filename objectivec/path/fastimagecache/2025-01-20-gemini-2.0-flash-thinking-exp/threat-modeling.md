# Threat Model Analysis for path/fastimagecache

## Threat: [Malicious Image Served from Cache (Cache Poisoning)](./threats/malicious_image_served_from_cache__cache_poisoning_.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises an upstream image source that the application relies on. The attacker replaces a legitimate image with a malicious one (e.g., containing XSS payload or malware). When `fastimagecache` fetches and caches this malicious image, subsequent requests from users will serve this malicious content *directly from the `fastimagecache` cache*.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious sites. Serving malware to users. Defacement of the application's visual elements.

**Affected Component:** Cache Retrieval Logic, Image Download Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust validation of image sources and their integrity *before* caching by `fastimagecache`.
* Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.
* Regularly monitor upstream image sources for unexpected changes.
* Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) if the upstream source supports it.
* Implement server-side checks on downloaded images (e.g., basic format validation, size limits) *before* caching.

## Threat: [Local File System Manipulation via Directory Traversal](./threats/local_file_system_manipulation_via_directory_traversal.md)

**Description:** If `fastimagecache`'s internal logic for generating cache paths or filenames is flawed and doesn't properly sanitize input derived from external sources (e.g., image URLs), an attacker could craft malicious URLs that, when processed by `fastimagecache`, lead to writing cached files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to remote code execution if the attacker can overwrite critical system files or web application files. Information disclosure if the attacker can write files to accessible locations.

**Affected Component:** Cache Storage Mechanism, File System Interaction.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Review `fastimagecache`'s source code for vulnerabilities related to path construction and sanitization.
* Configure `fastimagecache` to use a fixed, secure cache directory.
* Avoid using any user-provided data directly in cache path generation.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Cache Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_through_cache_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker repeatedly requests a large number of unique images, exploiting `fastimagecache`'s functionality to download and store these images. This can rapidly consume server resources (disk space, bandwidth, CPU for processing), potentially leading to a denial of service for legitimate users *due to `fastimagecache`'s resource consumption*.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** Cache Storage Mechanism, Image Download Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on image requests *before* they reach `fastimagecache`.
* Configure appropriate cache size limits and eviction policies within `fastimagecache` if available.
* Monitor server resource usage (disk space, CPU, memory) related to `fastimagecache`'s processes.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `fastimagecache` relies on underlying image processing libraries. If these libraries have vulnerabilities (e.g., related to handling malformed images), an attacker could provide specially crafted images that, when processed *by `fastimagecache`*, consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, performance degradation.

**Affected Component:** Image Processing Module, potentially underlying image decoding libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `fastimagecache` and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities in image processing libraries.
* Implement timeouts and resource limits for image processing operations *within the application using `fastimagecache`*.
* Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the image processing environment.
