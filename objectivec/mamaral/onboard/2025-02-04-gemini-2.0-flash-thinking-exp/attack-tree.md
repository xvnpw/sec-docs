## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication - Credential Stuffing/Brute Force Path](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_-_credential_stuffingbrute_force_path.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Credential Stuffing/Brute Force (Leveraging Weak Application Integration)
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Lack of Rate Limiting on Login Attempts [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** The application fails to limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user account within a specific timeframe.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can use automated tools to try numerous username/password combinations until they find a valid one.
            *   **Impact:** Account compromise, potential data breach, system overload (DoS).
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust rate limiting on login attempts.
        *   **Weak Password Policy Enforcement [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** The application does not enforce strong password requirements (length, complexity, character types).
            *   **Exploitation:** Users are allowed to create easily guessable passwords, making brute-force and dictionary attacks more effective.
            *   **Impact:** Easier credential compromise via brute-force/dictionary attacks.
            *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication - Session Hijacking - Insecure Session Cookie Handling Path](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_-_session_hijacking_-_insecure_session_cookie_handling_path.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Insecure Session Cookie Handling by Onboard or Application
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Lack of HttpOnly/Secure Flags on Session Cookies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Session cookies are not configured with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
            *   **Exploitation:**
                *   `HttpOnly` flag missing: JavaScript code (e.g., via XSS) can access the session cookie, allowing attackers to steal it.
                *   `Secure` flag missing: Session cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
            *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover.
            *   **Mitigation:** Ensure `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are set for session cookies in both Onboard's configuration and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication - Session Hijacking - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation Path](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_-_session_hijacking_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__exploitation_path.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Session Hijacking (After Legitimate Login)
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation:**
            *   **Description:** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by users.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers inject JavaScript that steals session cookies and sends them to the attacker's server.
            *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, defacement.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust XSS prevention measures in the application (input validation, output encoding, Content Security Policy).

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication - Session Hijacking - Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack Path](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication_-_session_hijacking_-_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_path.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Session Hijacking (After Legitimate Login)
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**
            *   **Description:** Communication between the user's browser and the application server is not fully encrypted using HTTPS.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers intercept network traffic and steal session cookies transmitted over unencrypted connections.
            *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data interception.
            *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS throughout the application (including redirects from HTTP to HTTPS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authorization - Authorization Bypass due to Logic Errors in Application's Use of Onboard - Incorrect Middleware Placement Path](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authorization_-_authorization_bypass_due_to_logic_errors_in_application's_use_of_onboard_-_in_0fdbddc2.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Authorization Bypass due to Logic Errors in Application's Use of Onboard
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Incorrect Middleware Placement in Express.js Route Handlers [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** The application incorrectly places Onboard's authorization middleware in the Express.js route handling chain.
            *   **Exploitation:** Authorization middleware is not applied to all protected routes, leaving some routes accessible without proper authorization checks.
            *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of authorization for unprotected routes, unauthorized access to resources.
            *   **Mitigation:** Carefully review Express.js route handler middleware placement to ensure authorization middleware is correctly applied to all protected routes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Excessive Authentication Attempts Path](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_excessive_authentication_attempts_path.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Excessive Authentication Attempts (Rate Limiting is Key)
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Brute-Force Login Attempts Exhausting Server Resources [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers flood the application with login requests.
            *   **Exploitation:** Without rate limiting, the server becomes overwhelmed processing login attempts, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service for legitimate users.
            *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure - Verbose Error Messages Path](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_-_verbose_error_messages_path.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Verbose Error Messages from Onboard
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Stack Traces or Internal Paths Revealed in Error Responses [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** The application or Onboard is configured to display detailed error messages in production, including stack traces, internal file paths, and other debugging information.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers can analyze error messages to gain insights into the application's internal workings, technology stack, and potential vulnerabilities.
            *   **Impact:** Information leakage, aids in further attacks.
            *   **Mitigation:** Configure Onboard and the application to provide generic error messages in production and detailed logs only for debugging in secure environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Path](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities_path.md)

*   **Critical Node:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Onboard's Dependencies
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies Used by Onboard [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   **Description:** Onboard relies on third-party libraries (dependencies) that may contain known security vulnerabilities. If these dependencies are not regularly updated, the application becomes vulnerable.
            *   **Exploitation:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies to compromise the application. Vulnerabilities can range from Cross-Site Scripting to Remote Code Execution.
            *   **Impact:** High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability. Can lead to Remote Code Execution, data breach, Denial of Service.
            *   **Mitigation:** Regularly audit and update Onboard's dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`. Monitor security advisories for dependencies and apply updates promptly.
