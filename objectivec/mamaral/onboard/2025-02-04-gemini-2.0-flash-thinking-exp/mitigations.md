# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update `onboard`](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update__onboard_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the `onboard` GitHub repository (or your package manager's registry) for new releases and security advisories. Subscribe to release notifications if available.
    2.  **Review Release Notes:** When a new version is released, carefully review the release notes to understand what changes are included, especially bug fixes and security patches related to `onboard` itself.
    3.  **Update Dependency:** Use your package manager (e.g., `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`) to update the `onboard` dependency in your project to the latest version. For example, using `npm update onboard` or `yarn upgrade onboard`.
    4.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure the update hasn't introduced any regressions or compatibility issues, specifically in areas where you use `onboard` functionality.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `onboard` Library (High Severity):**  Outdated versions may contain known security vulnerabilities within the `onboard` library itself that could be exploited.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks targeting outdated `onboard` (Medium Severity):** While less direct, using an outdated and vulnerable version of `onboard` could be a target in a supply chain attack.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `onboard` Library:** High risk reduction.  Applying security patches in `onboard` is the most direct way to eliminate known vulnerabilities within the library.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface by ensuring `onboard` itself is up-to-date.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Typically not proactively implemented in many projects unless using automated dependency update tools).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Development Workflow
    *   CI/CD Pipeline (Consider adding automated dependency update checks or reminders specifically for `onboard`)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning (for `onboard`)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning__for__onboard__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Scanning Tool:** Select a dependency scanning tool that can specifically scan your project's dependencies, including `onboard`. Options include `npm audit`, `yarn audit` (for Node.js projects), or more comprehensive security scanning tools.
    2.  **Integrate into Development Workflow:** Integrate the chosen scanning tool into your development workflow, ideally within your CI/CD pipeline.
    3.  **Run Scans Regularly:** Configure the tool to run dependency scans automatically on a regular basis (e.g., with each build, commit, or scheduled). Ensure it scans for vulnerabilities in `onboard` specifically.
    4.  **Review Scan Results:** Regularly review the scan results to identify any reported vulnerabilities specifically in `onboard` or its direct dependencies.
    5.  **Remediate Vulnerabilities:**  Prioritize and remediate identified vulnerabilities in `onboard` by updating to patched versions or exploring alternative solutions if necessary.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `onboard` Library (High Severity):** Proactively identifies known vulnerabilities within the `onboard` library before they are exploited.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `onboard`'s Direct Dependencies (Medium Severity):**  Identifies vulnerabilities in libraries that `onboard` directly depends on, which could indirectly affect your application through `onboard`.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Early detection of compromised or vulnerable versions of `onboard` in the supply chain.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `onboard` Library:** High risk reduction.  Provides early warning and allows for timely patching of `onboard` itself.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `onboard`'s Dependencies:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk from indirect vulnerabilities coming through `onboard`'s dependencies.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. Increases visibility into the security of the `onboard` dependency.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Dependency scanning focused on `onboard` specifically might not be implemented, even if general scanning is present).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CI/CD Pipeline (Specific configuration to focus on `onboard` if needed)
    *   Development Workflow (as a regular practice, specifically for `onboard` updates)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review `track` Function Customizations (Data Sensitivity via `onboard`)](./mitigation_strategies/review__track__function_customizations__data_sensitivity_via__onboard__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit `track` Calls:**  Carefully review all instances in your codebase where you use the `onboard.track()` function.
    2.  **Examine Event Properties:** For each `track` call, meticulously examine the properties you are including in the event data *that are passed through `onboard`*.
    3.  **Identify Sensitive Data:**  Determine if any of the properties being tracked *via `onboard`* inadvertently contain sensitive user data (PII, personal data, confidential information) that should not be tracked or sent to your analytics endpoint through this library.
    4.  **Remove or Anonymize Sensitive Data:** If sensitive data is found being tracked via `onboard`, either remove it from the tracked properties or implement anonymization techniques *before passing it to the `track` function*. Ensure data minimization principles are followed in the context of `onboard` usage.
    5.  **Document Data Tracking (via `onboard`):** Maintain clear documentation of what data is being tracked by `onboard`, including the purpose and justification for each tracked event and property *that are configured through `onboard`*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Data Leakage via `onboard` (Medium to High Severity):**  Unintentionally tracking and exposing sensitive user data through analytics *due to how `onboard` is configured and used*.
    *   **Privacy Violations (Medium to High Severity):**  Collecting and processing user data *via `onboard`* in a way that violates privacy regulations or user expectations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Data Leakage via `onboard`:** High risk reduction. Directly prevents the unintentional tracking of sensitive information *through the `onboard` library*.
    *   **Privacy Violations:** High risk reduction. Ensures data collection *via `onboard`* aligns with privacy principles and regulations.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Often overlooked or not systematically reviewed after initial implementation, specifically regarding data passed to `onboard`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Development Workflow (Code review process, specifically for `onboard` usage)
    *   Data Governance Policies (Documentation and review of data tracked *via `onboard`*)
