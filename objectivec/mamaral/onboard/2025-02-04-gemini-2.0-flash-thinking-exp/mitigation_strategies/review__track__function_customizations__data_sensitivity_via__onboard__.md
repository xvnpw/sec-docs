**2. Examine Event Properties:** "For each `track` call, meticulously examine the properties you are including in the event data *that are passed through `onboard`*."

*   **Analysis:** This step focuses on the *data itself* being sent via `onboard`. It's critical to understand what information is being captured and transmitted. The emphasis on "passed through `onboard`" is important, highlighting the specific data flow under scrutiny.
    *   **Strengths:** Directly targets the data being tracked, enabling identification of sensitive information.
    *   **Potential Challenges:** Requires understanding the context of each `track` call and the source of the properties being passed. Developers need to understand data sensitivity and privacy principles to effectively perform this examination.
    *   **Recommendations:**  Encourage developers to document the purpose and source of each property being tracked. Provide training on data privacy and sensitivity to development teams.

**3. Identify Sensitive Data:** "Determine if any of the properties being tracked *via `onboard`* inadvertently contain sensitive user data (PII, personal data, confidential information) that should not be tracked or sent to your analytics endpoint through this library."

*   **Analysis:** This is the core of the mitigation strategy â€“ identifying sensitive data. It requires a clear definition of "sensitive data" within the organization's context and relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
    *   **Strengths:** Directly addresses the risk of data leakage and privacy violations by focusing on sensitive information.
    *   **Potential Challenges:** Subjectivity in defining "sensitive data." Requires a strong understanding of privacy regulations and organizational data governance policies. False positives and false negatives are possible if not carefully considered.
    *   **Recommendations:** Establish clear guidelines and definitions for sensitive data within the organization. Provide examples and training to developers. Involve privacy or compliance teams in defining sensitive data categories.

**4. Remove or Anonymize Sensitive Data:** "If sensitive data is found being tracked via `onboard`, either remove it from the tracked properties or implement anonymization techniques *before passing it to the `track` function*. Ensure data minimization principles are followed in the context of `onboard` usage."

*   **Analysis:** This step provides concrete actions to remediate identified issues.  Prioritizing removal over anonymization is a good principle, aligning with data minimization. Anonymization, if necessary, must be done correctly to be effective.
    *   **Strengths:** Offers practical solutions for handling sensitive data. Emphasizes data minimization.
    *   **Potential Challenges:** Anonymization can be complex and may not always be fully effective. Removal might impact the intended analytics insights if not carefully considered. Requires technical expertise in anonymization techniques if chosen.
    *   **Recommendations:**  Prioritize data removal whenever possible. If anonymization is necessary, use established and validated techniques (e.g., hashing, pseudonymization, generalization). Document the anonymization methods used.

**5. Document Data Tracking (via `onboard`):** "Maintain clear documentation of what data is being tracked by `onboard`, including the purpose and justification for each tracked event and property *that are configured through `onboard`*."

*   **Analysis:** Documentation is crucial for long-term maintainability, compliance, and transparency. It ensures that data tracking practices are understood and can be reviewed and updated as needed. Focusing on "configured through `onboard`" keeps the documentation scope relevant to this specific library.
