# Attack Surface Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force Attacks on Login Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_login_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different username/password combinations against the `/login` endpoint.
*   **Onboard Contribution:** Onboard *directly* provides the `/login` endpoint as the core authentication mechanism. Lack of built-in rate limiting or account lockout within Onboard itself makes it vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker scripts thousands of login attempts against Onboard's `/login`, bypassing weak or non-existent rate limiting and successfully guessing user credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, data breaches, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting *within Onboard*:** Developers using Onboard *must* implement rate limiting on the `/login` endpoint, ideally as part of Onboard's configuration or middleware.
    *   **Implement Account Lockout *within Onboard*:**  Onboard should provide or facilitate account lockout mechanisms after failed login attempts.
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Configure Onboard to enforce strong password policies.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Integrate MFA with Onboard to significantly increase login security.

## Attack Surface: [Credential Stuffing Attacks](./attack_surfaces/credential_stuffing_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use lists of leaked usernames and passwords from other breaches to attempt logins on Onboard.
*   **Onboard Contribution:** While not directly *caused* by Onboard's code, Onboard's role as the authentication service makes it a *direct* target for credential stuffing.  If Onboard doesn't offer mitigations, it contributes to the risk.
*   **Example:** Attackers use leaked credentials against Onboard's `/login`. If users reuse passwords, attackers gain access to Onboard-protected accounts.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, data breaches, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Password Breach Monitoring (Integration with Onboard):**  Consider integrating password breach monitoring services with Onboard to warn users about compromised passwords.
    *   **Rate Limiting (as above):**  Onboard's rate limiting helps slow down stuffing attempts.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA with Onboard is a strong defense against credential stuffing.
    *   **Educate Users (Best Practice encouraged by Onboard documentation):** Onboard documentation should strongly encourage users to use unique passwords.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Logical flaws or coding errors *within Onboard's code* allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
*   **Onboard Contribution:**  *Directly caused* by vulnerabilities in Onboard's authentication logic, code flaws in handling authentication checks, session management, or token validation within Onboard itself.
*   **Example:** A coding error in Onboard's token verification allows manipulation of tokens to bypass authentication checks, granting access without valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of authentication, unauthorized access to all protected resources, data breaches, system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Code Review *of Onboard Code*:**  Thorough security code reviews of Onboard's authentication logic are crucial.
    *   **Penetration Testing *of Onboard*:**  Dedicated penetration testing focusing on Onboard's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Input Validation *within Onboard*:** Robust input validation in Onboard's code to prevent manipulation of authentication parameters.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Design Onboard with Least Privilege):** Onboard's design should adhere to least privilege to minimize impact of bypasses.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in *Onboard's authorization logic* allow users to access resources or actions they shouldn't, even after authentication.
*   **Onboard Contribution:** *Directly caused* by vulnerabilities in how Onboard manages and enforces authorization rules, permissions, or policies.
*   **Example:**  A flaw in Onboard's role-checking mechanism allows a user with a limited role to access resources intended for administrators.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, privilege escalation, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Code Review *of Onboard's Authorization Logic*:**  Specifically review Onboard's authorization code for flaws.
    *   **Penetration Testing *of Onboard's Authorization*:** Test Onboard's authorization mechanisms for bypasses and privilege escalation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Enforced by Onboard):** Onboard should be designed to enforce strict access control based on least privilege.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) *Implemented by Onboard*:** Onboard should implement and enforce well-defined RBAC or ABAC models.
    *   **Regularly Audit Permissions *Configured within Onboard*:**  Regularly audit and review roles and permissions configured and managed by Onboard.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Session Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_session_management.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in *how Onboard manages sessions* lead to session hijacking, fixation, or related attacks.
*   **Onboard Contribution:** *Directly caused* by insecure session handling within Onboard's code â€“ how it creates, stores, validates, and invalidates sessions.
*   **Example:** Onboard uses predictable session IDs, or session cookies lack `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags *due to Onboard's implementation*, making sessions vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Generate Strong Session IDs *within Onboard*:** Onboard *must* generate cryptographically secure session IDs.
    *   **Use HTTP-Only and Secure Flags *in Onboard's Session Handling*:** Onboard *must* set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
    *   **Session Timeout *Configurable in Onboard*:** Onboard should allow configuration of session timeouts.
    *   **Session Invalidation on Logout *Implemented by Onboard*:** Onboard *must* properly invalidate sessions on logout.
    *   **Secure Session Storage *within Onboard*:** Onboard's session storage mechanism must be secure.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of configuration files or environment variables containing sensitive secrets *required by Onboard*.
*   **Onboard Contribution:** Onboard *requires* configuration, including sensitive secrets. If Onboard's documentation or default setup encourages insecure configuration practices, it *contributes* to this risk.
*   **Example:** Onboard's documentation suggests storing database credentials in a plain text configuration file that is then accidentally exposed.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Onboard and potentially the application, data breaches, system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables for Secrets (Best Practice *emphasized by Onboard documentation*):** Onboard documentation should strongly recommend using environment variables for sensitive secrets.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management (Guidance from Onboard):** Onboard documentation should provide guidance on secure configuration management practices.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files (Deployment Best Practice *related to Onboard*):**  Deployment guides for Onboard should emphasize restricting access to configuration files.
    *   **Avoid Committing Secrets to Version Control (General Best Practice *relevant to Onboard deployment*):**  Deployment guides should warn against committing secrets to version control.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Onboard relies on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these *Onboard dependencies* can be exploited.
*   **Onboard Contribution:** *Directly dependent* on the security of its chosen dependencies. If Onboard doesn't manage dependencies well or uses vulnerable libraries, it's directly affected.
