## Attack Tree Path: [1. Bypass Authentication/Authorization [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__bypass_authenticationauthorization__high_risk_.md)

This is the primary attack path, aiming to circumvent the authentication mechanisms provided by `onboard`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit `onboard`'s Token Handling [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit__onboard_'s_token_handling__high_risk_.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities related to how `onboard` generates, handles, and validates tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Predictable Token Generation](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_predictable_token_generation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Weak Randomness in Token Secret [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_weak_randomness_in_token_secret__critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker exploits a weak or predictable method used to generate the secret key for signing tokens. This allows them to forge valid tokens.
                **Likelihood:** Low (if best practices are followed)
                **Impact:** Very High (full account compromise)
                **Effort:** Low (if the secret is easily guessable) to High (if brute-forcing a strong secret)
                **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Expert
                **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Token Replay Attack](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_token_replay_attack.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.2 Insufficient Validation of Expiration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_2_insufficient_validation_of_expiration__critical_.md)

**Description:** The application fails to properly validate the expiration time of a token, allowing an attacker to reuse an intercepted token even after it should have expired.
                **Likelihood:** Low (application-level error)
                **Impact:** High
                **Effort:** Low
                **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Token Tampering [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_token_tampering__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3.1 Weak or No Signature Verification [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_1_weak_or_no_signature_verification__critical_.md)

**Description:** The application fails to properly verify the digital signature of the JWT, allowing an attacker to modify the token's payload (e.g., change the user ID) without detection.
                **Likelihood:** Very Low (core functionality of JWT)
                **Impact:** Very High
                **Effort:** Medium
                **Skill Level:** Advanced
                **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 Token Leakage [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_token_leakage__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.1 Insecure Storage [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_1_insecure_storage__critical_.md)

**Description:** Tokens are stored in an insecure location (e.g., client-side JavaScript, browser local storage, easily accessible logs) where an attacker can easily obtain them.
                **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on application implementation)
                **Impact:** High
                **Effort:** Low
                **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
                **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit `onboard`'s User Management](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit__onboard_'s_user_management.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities in user management features, such as password reset and account creation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Weak Password Reset Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_weak_password_reset_functionality.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.2 Lack of Rate Limiting on Reset Requests [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_2_lack_of_rate_limiting_on_reset_requests__critical_.md)

**Description:** The application doesn't limit the number of password reset requests an attacker can make, allowing them to brute-force reset tokens or flood the system.
                **Likelihood:** Medium (common oversight)
                **Impact:** Medium (DoS or potential for brute-forcing reset tokens)
                **Effort:** Low
                **Skill Level:** Novice
                **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Account Enumeration](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_account_enumeration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1 Different Responses for Existing/Non-Existing Users [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1_different_responses_for_existingnon-existing_users__critical_.md)

**Description:** The application provides different responses (error messages, timing differences) when a user tries to register or reset a password for an existing vs. non-existing account. This allows an attacker to determine which usernames or email addresses are valid.
                **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability)
                **Impact:** Low (information disclosure)
                **Effort:** Low
                **Skill Level:** Novice
                **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) against `onboard` [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos__against__onboard___high_risk_.md)

This attack path aims to make the application unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_resource_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

This involves overwhelming the server with requests, consuming resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Flood of Authentication Requests [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_flood_of_authentication_requests__critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker sends a large number of authentication requests to the server, overwhelming the authentication endpoints and potentially causing the service to become unavailable.
            **Likelihood:** Medium (if rate limiting is not implemented)
            **Impact:** Medium
            **Effort:** Low
            **Skill Level:** Novice
            **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

This focuses on leveraging known vulnerabilities in the libraries that `onboard` depends on.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Known Vulnerabilities in `jsonwebtoken` or other dependencies [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_known_vulnerabilities_in__jsonwebtoken__or_other_dependencies__critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency of `onboard`, such as `jsonwebtoken`.  This could lead to various consequences, depending on the specific vulnerability.
            **Likelihood:** Low (if dependencies are kept up-to-date)
            **Impact:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
            **Effort:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
            **Skill Level:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
            **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
