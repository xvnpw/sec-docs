# Attack Surface Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Attack Surface: [1. Client-Side State Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__client-side_state_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers tamper with the client-side state (cookies, local storage, etc.) that `onboard` uses to track onboarding progress.
*   **How `onboard` Contributes:** `onboard` *directly* relies on client-side state to manage the flow; this is a core part of its design.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a cookie value named `onboarding_step` from "2" to "5" to skip steps 3 and 4, which might involve setting a strong password or configuring security settings.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of security measures, unauthorized access to features, potential account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if server-side validation is lacking) / **High** (if some server-side validation exists but is incomplete).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation (Essential):**  The server *must* independently verify the user's onboarding status on *every* action that depends on onboarding completion.  Do *not* rely solely on client-side state.
    *   **Signed/Encrypted Client-Side State:** If sensitive data *must* be stored client-side, use signed or encrypted cookies/storage to prevent tampering and eavesdropping.  Use strong cryptographic keys and algorithms.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Treat any data derived from client-side state as untrusted input.  Validate it rigorously before using it in any server-side logic.
    *   **Short-Lived State:** Minimize the lifespan of client-side state. Expire cookies/storage entries as soon as they are no longer needed.

## Attack Surface: [2. Configuration Tampering](./attack_surfaces/2__configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers modify the `onboard` configuration (e.g., JSON file defining steps) to alter the onboarding flow.
*   **How `onboard` Contributes:** The library's behavior is *directly* driven by its configuration; the configuration *is* the definition of the onboarding process.
*   **Example:** An attacker changes the configuration to remove a step that requires email verification, allowing them to create accounts with unverified email addresses.  Or, they add a step that redirects the user to a phishing site.
*   **Impact:**  Bypass of security measures, introduction of malicious steps, data theft, account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store the configuration file in a secure location with restricted access.  Avoid storing it in publicly accessible directories.
    *   **Integrity Checks:**  Use checksums (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures to verify the integrity of the configuration file.  Detect and prevent unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Use a secure configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage and distribute the configuration securely.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review any changes to the configuration file before deployment.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application has only the necessary permissions to *read* the configuration file, not *write* to it.

## Attack Surface: [3. Callback Function Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/3__callback_function_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the callback functions that `onboard` triggers within the main application.
*   **How `onboard` Contributes:** `onboard` *directly* uses callbacks to integrate with the application; these callbacks are the mechanism by which `onboard` interacts with the rest of the system.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious input during onboarding that, when processed by a callback function, triggers an SQL injection vulnerability in the application's database.  Or, a callback designed to grant "basic" user privileges is manipulated to grant "admin" privileges.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution, data breaches, privilege escalation, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** / **High** (depending on the functionality exposed by the callbacks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Treat all data passed to callback functions as untrusted input.  Validate and sanitize it rigorously.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization:**  If callbacks perform sensitive actions, authenticate the request (if applicable) and authorize the action based on the user's role and onboarding status.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Apply secure coding principles (e.g., parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, output encoding to prevent XSS) within callback functions.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that callback functions have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review callback functions for security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [4. Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/4__dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in `onboard`'s dependencies are exploited to compromise the application.
*   **How `onboard` Contributes:** `onboard` *directly* introduces these dependencies into the application's dependency tree.
*   **Example:** A dependency of `onboard` has a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the application server.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** / **High** (depending on the vulnerability in the dependency).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, yarn) to track dependencies and their versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update `onboard` and its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    *   **Pin Dependencies:** Pin dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities or break compatibility. However, balance this with the need to apply security updates.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Periodically audit dependencies to understand their security posture and potential risks.
