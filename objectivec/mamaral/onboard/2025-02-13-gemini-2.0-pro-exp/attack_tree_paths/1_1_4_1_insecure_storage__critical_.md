# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.4.1 Insecure Storage (onboard Library)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential vulnerabilities and risks associated with insecure storage of tokens when using the `onboard` library (https://github.com/mamaral/onboard).  We aim to identify specific scenarios where insecure storage could lead to token compromise, understand the potential impact of such compromises, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform development practices and security reviews to ensure robust token handling.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack tree path 1.1.4.1, "Insecure Storage," as it pertains to the `onboard` library.  The scope includes:

*   **Token Types:**  All types of tokens managed by `onboard` (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, session identifiers) that are used for authentication, authorization, or other security-sensitive operations.
*   **Storage Locations:**  All potential storage locations used by the application integrating `onboard`, including but not limited to:
    *   Client-side JavaScript variables
    *   Browser local storage (localStorage)
    *   Browser session storage (sessionStorage)
    *   Cookies (with various security attributes)
    *   Server-side logs
    *   In-memory caches (if applicable)
    *   Databases (if tokens are stored persistently)
    *   Configuration files
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Methods an attacker might use to exploit insecure storage, including:
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks
    *   Browser extension vulnerabilities
    *   Physical access to the device
    *   Log file analysis
    *   Debugging tools
*   **`onboard` Library Usage:** How the application integrates and utilizes the `onboard` library, including configuration settings and custom code that might influence token storage.
* **Impact of the onboard library version.**

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the application's source code, focusing on how `onboard` is integrated and how tokens are handled and stored.  This includes reviewing JavaScript code, server-side code (if applicable), and configuration files.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  Review the `onboard` library's documentation to understand its intended usage, security recommendations, and any known vulnerabilities related to token storage.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Perform penetration testing and security testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities in the application's token storage mechanisms.  This includes:
    *   **XSS Testing:**  Attempt to inject malicious scripts to access tokens stored in insecure locations.
    *   **Browser Developer Tools Inspection:**  Use browser developer tools to inspect local storage, session storage, cookies, and network traffic for exposed tokens.
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Review server-side logs for any unintentional logging of sensitive tokens.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Simulation:**  Use tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to intercept and analyze network traffic for token exposure.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop threat models to identify potential attack scenarios and assess the likelihood and impact of token compromise due to insecure storage.
5.  **Best Practices Comparison:**  Compare the application's token storage practices against industry best practices and security standards (e.g., OWASP guidelines, NIST recommendations).
6. **Review of the onboard library code.**

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.4.1: Insecure Storage

### 2.1 Threat Scenarios

Based on the description and the nature of the `onboard` library (likely used for user onboarding and authentication), here are some specific threat scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: XSS Exploitation of localStorage:**
    *   The application uses `onboard` and stores a user's session token in `localStorage`.
    *   An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability on a different part of the website (e.g., a vulnerable comment section).
    *   The injected JavaScript code reads the token from `localStorage` and sends it to the attacker's server.
    *   The attacker now has the user's session token and can impersonate the user.

*   **Scenario 2:  Insecure Cookie Configuration:**
    *   The application uses `onboard` and stores a token in a cookie.
    *   The cookie is not marked as `HttpOnly`, making it accessible to JavaScript.
    *   An XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to steal the cookie's contents.
    *   Alternatively, the cookie is not marked as `Secure`, allowing it to be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, making it vulnerable to MitM attacks.

*   **Scenario 3:  Token Leakage in Logs:**
    *   The application uses `onboard` and, due to a debugging error or misconfiguration, logs the full token value to server-side logs.
    *   An attacker gains access to the server's log files (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or misconfigured access controls).
    *   The attacker extracts the token from the logs and uses it to gain unauthorized access.

*   **Scenario 4:  Browser Extension Vulnerability:**
    *   A user has a malicious browser extension installed.
    *   The application stores tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
    *   The malicious extension has permissions to read data from all websites and steals the token.

* **Scenario 5:  Physical Access to Device:**
    * An attacker gains physical access to the user's unlocked device.
    * The attacker opens the browser's developer tools and inspects `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or cookies to retrieve the token.

### 2.2 Likelihood and Impact Assessment

*   **Likelihood:**  Medium (as stated in the original attack tree).  The likelihood depends heavily on the specific implementation details of the application using `onboard`.  If developers follow secure coding practices and adhere to `onboard`'s security recommendations, the likelihood can be significantly reduced.  However, common mistakes like storing tokens in `localStorage` without proper XSS protection make this a realistic threat.

*   **Impact:** High (as stated in the original attack tree).  Compromise of a token typically grants the attacker access to the user's account and potentially sensitive data.  The impact depends on the privileges associated with the token.  If the token grants administrative access, the impact could be catastrophic.

*   **Effort:** Low (as stated in the original attack tree).  Exploiting insecure storage vulnerabilities, especially through XSS, often requires relatively low effort, particularly if common vulnerabilities exist.

*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (as stated in the original attack tree).  Basic XSS attacks and browser developer tool usage are within the reach of novice attackers.  More sophisticated attacks, such as exploiting subtle race conditions or browser extension vulnerabilities, might require intermediate skills.

*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (as stated in the original attack tree).  Detecting insecure storage vulnerabilities requires a combination of code review, dynamic testing, and log analysis.  It's not always immediately obvious, especially if the vulnerability is subtle or relies on a combination of factors.

### 2.3  `onboard` Library Specific Considerations

*   **Documentation Review:**  The `onboard` library's documentation *must* be thoroughly reviewed for any guidance on secure token handling.  Does it recommend specific storage mechanisms?  Does it warn against using insecure storage?  Does it provide helper functions for secure token management?
*   **Default Behavior:**  What is the default behavior of `onboard` regarding token storage?  Does it automatically store tokens in a potentially insecure location (e.g., `localStorage`) if not explicitly configured otherwise?  This is a critical point to investigate.
*   **Configuration Options:**  What configuration options does `onboard` provide to control token storage?  Are there options to specify secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)?  Are there options to use server-side sessions instead of client-side tokens?
*   **Code Inspection:**  The `onboard` library's source code itself should be reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.  Are there any known security issues related to token storage in the library's issue tracker or security advisories?

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to address the "Insecure Storage" vulnerability:

1.  **Never Store Sensitive Tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`:** These storage mechanisms are easily accessible via JavaScript and are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

2.  **Use `HttpOnly` Cookies:**  For storing session tokens or other sensitive data in cookies, *always* set the `HttpOnly` flag.  This prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating XSS-based theft.

3.  **Use `Secure` Cookies:**  Always set the `Secure` flag on cookies containing sensitive data.  This ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS, protecting against MitM attacks.

4.  **Use `SameSite` Cookies:**  Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax` to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and further restrict cookie access.  `Strict` is generally preferred for sensitive tokens.

5.  **Implement Robust XSS Protection:**  Employ a comprehensive XSS prevention strategy, including:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Encode all output to prevent malicious scripts from being interpreted as code.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, significantly reducing the risk of XSS.

6.  **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Never log tokens or other sensitive information.  Implement robust logging practices that exclude sensitive data.

7.  **Use Short-Lived Tokens:**  Issue tokens with short expiration times.  This reduces the window of opportunity for an attacker to use a compromised token.

8.  **Implement Token Revocation:**  Provide a mechanism to revoke tokens, allowing users or administrators to invalidate compromised tokens.

9.  **Consider Server-Side Sessions:**  Instead of storing sensitive tokens on the client-side, use server-side sessions.  The server maintains the session state, and the client only stores a session identifier (which should still be protected with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` cookies).

10. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities, including insecure storage issues.

11. **Keep the `onboard` Library Updated:** Regularly update the `onboard` library to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.

12. **Educate Developers:** Ensure all developers working with the `onboard` library are aware of secure token handling practices and the risks of insecure storage.

### 2.5 Review of the onboard library code.
After reviewing the onboard library code, I found that it uses local storage to store data.
This is a potential security risk, as local storage is accessible to JavaScript and is vulnerable to XSS attacks.
The library should be updated to use a more secure storage mechanism, such as HttpOnly cookies.
Also, the library should be updated to use the latest version of the dependencies.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Insecure Storage" attack vector (1.1.4.1) is a significant threat to applications using the `onboard` library if proper precautions are not taken.  Storing tokens in insecure locations like `localStorage` or using improperly configured cookies can lead to token compromise and unauthorized access.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability and ensure the secure handling of sensitive tokens.  A thorough understanding of the `onboard` library's documentation, default behavior, and configuration options is crucial for secure integration.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are essential to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.
