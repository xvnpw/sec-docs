Okay, let's dive into a deep analysis of the "Weak Password Reset Functionality" attack path within an application leveraging the `mamaral/onboard` library.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1 Weak Password Reset Functionality

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and propose mitigations for vulnerabilities related to weak password reset functionality within an application using the `mamaral/onboard` library.  We aim to understand how an attacker could exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.  The ultimate goal is to strengthen the password reset process and prevent account takeovers.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the password reset mechanism provided by (or implemented in conjunction with) the `mamaral/onboard` library.  This includes:

*   **Initiation of the reset process:** How a user requests a password reset (e.g., email link, SMS code).
*   **Token generation and management:** How `onboard` (or the application using it) generates, stores, and validates password reset tokens.
*   **Token delivery:** The method used to deliver the reset token to the user (email, SMS, etc.).
*   **Password reset form:** The form where the user enters their new password.
*   **Password strength enforcement:**  How the application enforces password complexity requirements during the reset process.
*   **Account recovery flows:** Any alternative recovery mechanisms if the primary reset method fails.
* **Integration points:** How the onboard library is integrated into the application.

We will *not* be analyzing general application security aspects unrelated to password reset, such as SQL injection vulnerabilities in other parts of the application, unless they directly impact the password reset flow.  We also assume the underlying infrastructure (e.g., email server, SMS gateway) is reasonably secure, although we will consider attacks that leverage weaknesses in these services *in the context of password reset*.

**1.3 Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  We will examine the relevant parts of the `mamaral/onboard` library's source code (if accessible and relevant â€“ the library might be used as a black box) and the application's code that integrates with it.  This will help us understand the implementation details of the password reset process.  We'll pay close attention to token generation, storage, validation, and expiration logic.
*   **Threat Modeling:** We will systematically identify potential threats and attack vectors related to weak password reset functionality.  This will involve considering various attacker motivations and capabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will look for common vulnerabilities associated with password reset mechanisms, such as:
    *   Predictable token generation.
    *   Insufficient token entropy.
    *   Lack of token expiration or improper expiration handling.
    *   Token leakage through HTTP headers, logs, or other channels.
    *   Rate limiting bypasses.
    *   Account enumeration vulnerabilities.
    *   Lack of proper input validation.
    *   Weak password strength enforcement.
    *   Insecure token storage.
    *   Vulnerabilities in the email/SMS delivery mechanisms (e.g., email spoofing, SMS interception).
*   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** While we won't perform live penetration testing in this document, we will describe potential penetration testing scenarios that could be used to validate the identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Best Practices Review:** We will compare the implementation against industry best practices and security standards for password reset functionality (e.g., OWASP guidelines, NIST recommendations).

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1 Weak Password Reset Functionality

Now, let's analyze specific attack vectors related to weak password reset functionality, considering how they might apply to an application using `mamaral/onboard`.

**2.1 Attack Vectors and Analysis:**

*   **2.1.1 Predictable Token Generation:**

    *   **Description:** If the password reset tokens generated by `onboard` (or the application) are predictable, an attacker could potentially guess or brute-force a valid token and reset a user's password without authorization.  This is a critical vulnerability.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Code Review:** Examine the token generation logic.  Is a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) used?  What is the length and character set of the token?  Are there any patterns or biases in the generated tokens?  Look for uses of `rand()` (insecure) instead of a secure alternative like `/dev/urandom` (on Unix-like systems) or `crypto.randomBytes` (in Node.js).
        *   **Threat Modeling:** An attacker with knowledge of the token generation algorithm could generate a list of potential tokens and attempt to use them to reset passwords.
        *   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  If the token is short (e.g., 6 digits) or uses a limited character set, it's highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  If the token is based on easily guessable information (e.g., user ID, timestamp), it's predictable.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** Generate a large number of tokens and analyze them for patterns or predictability.  Attempt to brute-force tokens for existing user accounts.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use a CSPRNG to generate tokens.
            *   Ensure sufficient token length and entropy (e.g., at least 128 bits of entropy, which translates to a token of at least 22 characters if using a base64 encoding).
            *   Avoid using any user-specific or easily guessable information in the token generation process.

*   **2.1.2 Insufficient Token Expiration:**

    *   **Description:** If password reset tokens do not expire, or have an excessively long expiration time, an attacker who gains access to an old token (e.g., through email compromise) could use it to reset the user's password long after the legitimate reset request.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Code Review:**  Check how `onboard` (or the application) handles token expiration.  Is there an expiration time associated with each token?  Is this expiration time enforced correctly?  Is there a mechanism to revoke tokens?
        *   **Threat Modeling:** An attacker who compromises a user's email account could search for old password reset emails and use the tokens to gain access.
        *   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  If tokens never expire, or have an expiration time of several days or weeks, the risk is significantly increased.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** Request a password reset and then attempt to use the token after a significant period (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Set a reasonable expiration time for tokens (e.g., 30 minutes to a few hours).
            *   Ensure that the application properly validates the token's expiration time before allowing a password reset.
            *   Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens (e.g., when the user successfully changes their password, or when a new reset request is made).

*   **2.1.3 Token Leakage:**

    *   **Description:**  Password reset tokens could be leaked through various channels, such as:
        *   **HTTP Referer Header:** If the password reset link redirects to an external site, the token might be included in the Referer header.
        *   **Server Logs:**  If the token is logged by the server, an attacker who gains access to the logs could obtain it.
        *   **Email/SMS Interception:**  If the token is sent via an insecure channel (e.g., unencrypted email, SMS), it could be intercepted.
        *   **Browser History:** The token might be stored in the user's browser history.
        * **Application Error Messages:** If token is somehow displayed in error message.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Code Review:**  Examine how the token is handled throughout the application.  Is it ever logged?  Is it included in any URLs that might be exposed?
        *   **Threat Modeling:**  An attacker could use network sniffing, access server logs, or compromise email/SMS accounts to obtain tokens.
        *   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Any instance where the token is exposed in plain text increases the risk of leakage.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**  Use a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite) to monitor HTTP traffic and look for the token in headers, responses, and logs.  Check server logs for any instances of the token.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Avoid including the token in URLs whenever possible.  If it must be included, use a POST request instead of a GET request.
            *   Do not log the token.
            *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
            *   Use secure email and SMS delivery mechanisms (e.g., TLS for email, encrypted SMS if available).
            *   Set appropriate HTTP headers (e.g., `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`) to prevent token leakage in the Referer header.
            *   Advise users not to share password reset links.
            *   Use short-lived tokens.

*   **2.1.4 Rate Limiting Bypass:**

    *   **Description:**  If the application does not implement proper rate limiting on password reset requests, an attacker could attempt to brute-force tokens or flood the system with reset requests, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Code Review:**  Check if there are any rate limits on the number of password reset requests that can be made within a given time period.  Are these limits enforced per IP address, per user account, or both?
        *   **Threat Modeling:**  An attacker could use a script to automate password reset requests and attempt to brute-force tokens or overwhelm the system.
        *   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  The absence of rate limiting, or easily bypassed rate limits, makes the system vulnerable to brute-force and DoS attacks.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**  Attempt to make a large number of password reset requests in a short period.  Try different IP addresses and user accounts to see if the rate limits can be bypassed.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement rate limiting on password reset requests, both per IP address and per user account.
            *   Use a progressively increasing delay between failed attempts.
            *   Consider using CAPTCHAs to prevent automated attacks.
            *   Monitor server logs for suspicious activity.

*   **2.1.5 Account Enumeration:**

    *   **Description:**  The password reset functionality might reveal whether a given username or email address exists in the system.  This information can be used by an attacker to compile a list of valid usernames for targeted attacks.  For example, the application might respond with "Password reset email sent" if the username exists and "User not found" if it doesn't.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Code Review:**  Examine the responses returned by the password reset endpoint for both valid and invalid usernames/email addresses.  Are the responses different?
        *   **Threat Modeling:**  An attacker could use a list of common usernames or email addresses and attempt to reset their passwords to determine which ones exist in the system.
        *   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Different responses for valid and invalid usernames/email addresses constitute an account enumeration vulnerability.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**  Attempt to reset passwords for a list of known valid and invalid usernames/email addresses and observe the responses.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Provide a generic response for both valid and invalid usernames/email addresses (e.g., "If an account exists for the provided information, a password reset email has been sent").
            *   Avoid revealing any information about the existence of an account.
            *   Implement time delays to prevent attackers from quickly determining the existence of accounts based on response times.

*   **2.1.6 Weak Password Strength Enforcement:**

    *   **Description:** If the application does not enforce strong password complexity requirements during the reset process, an attacker who gains access to the reset functionality could set a weak password, making the account easier to compromise in the future.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Code Review:** Check the password validation logic.  Are there minimum length requirements?  Are there requirements for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters?  Are common passwords blocked?
        *   **Threat Modeling:** An attacker could set a weak password (e.g., "password123") and then easily guess it later.
        *   **Vulnerability Analysis:** Weak password policies make accounts vulnerable to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** Attempt to set weak passwords during the reset process.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce strong password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length of 12 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
            *   Use a password strength meter to provide feedback to the user.
            *   Block common passwords and passwords that have been previously compromised (e.g., using a password blacklist or a service like Have I Been Pwned).

*  **2.1.7 Insecure Token Storage:**
    * **Description:** If the tokens are stored insecurely (e.g plain text in database), attacker with database access can compromise all accounts.
    * **Analysis:**
        *   **Code Review:** Check how tokens are stored.
        *   **Threat Modeling:** Attacker with database access.
        *   **Vulnerability Analysis:** Storing tokens in plain text is critical vulnerability.
        *   **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):** N/A - requires database access.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Store tokens securely, ideally by hashing them using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with a unique salt per token. This prevents the tokens from being usable even if the database is compromised.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

This deep analysis has identified several potential attack vectors related to weak password reset functionality in an application using the `mamaral/onboard` library.  The most critical vulnerabilities are predictable token generation, insufficient token expiration, token leakage, lack of rate limiting, account enumeration, and weak password strength enforcement.

**Recommendations:**
