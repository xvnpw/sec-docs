# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 Exploit `onboard`'s User Management

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and propose mitigations for potential vulnerabilities within the `onboard` library's user management functionalities that could be exploited by an attacker.  We aim to understand how an attacker might compromise user accounts or gain unauthorized access through weaknesses in these features.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of applications using `onboard`.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the user management features provided by the `onboard` library (https://github.com/mamaral/onboard).  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Account Creation:**  The process of registering new users.
*   **Password Reset:**  The mechanism for users to regain access to their accounts if they forget their password.
*   **Account Recovery:** Broader mechanisms for regaining access, potentially including email verification, security questions, or other methods.
*   **User Profile Management:**  Features allowing users to modify their profile information (e.g., email address, username).
*   **Authentication:** While the broader authentication process is important, this analysis will focus on how user management vulnerabilities *impact* authentication (e.g., bypassing authentication through a compromised password reset).
*   **Session Management:** How user sessions are created and maintained *after* successful authentication, particularly in relation to user management actions.

This analysis *excludes* other aspects of the `onboard` library, such as its core validation or form handling capabilities, *except* where those directly interact with user management features.  For example, if a general form validation weakness allows for a user management vulnerability, it will be considered in scope.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the `onboard` library's source code, focusing on the identified user management features.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying all entry points related to user management (e.g., API endpoints, function calls).
    *   Tracing the flow of data and control through these entry points.
    *   Analyzing the logic for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., improper input validation, insecure storage of sensitive data, flawed logic in password reset flows).
    *   Examining dependencies used by `onboard` for user management and assessing their security.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Performing black-box and gray-box testing against a test instance of an application using `onboard`. This will involve:
    *   **Black-box testing:**  Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities without prior knowledge of the codebase.  This simulates an external attacker.
    *   **Gray-box testing:**  Using partial knowledge of the codebase (gained from the code review) to guide testing efforts.
    *   Using automated vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to identify common web application vulnerabilities.
    *   Manually crafting malicious inputs and requests to test specific hypotheses about potential vulnerabilities.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Applying threat modeling principles to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios.  This will involve:
    *   Considering the attacker's perspective and motivations.
    *   Identifying potential assets at risk (e.g., user accounts, sensitive data).
    *   Developing attack scenarios based on the identified vulnerabilities.

4.  **Best Practices Review:**  Comparing the `onboard` library's implementation against established security best practices for user management, such as those outlined by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2 Exploit `onboard`'s User Management

This section details the specific vulnerabilities that could be present within the `onboard` library's user management features, along with potential attack scenarios and mitigation strategies.

### 2.1 Account Creation Vulnerabilities

*   **2.1.1 Weak Password Policies:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  `onboard` might not enforce strong password policies by default (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements, character sets).  It might rely solely on the application developer to implement these policies.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker uses a dictionary attack or brute-force attack to guess weak user passwords.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   `onboard` should provide built-in, configurable strong password policies (length, complexity, character sets, common password blacklists).
        *   Provide clear documentation and examples for developers on how to configure and customize these policies.
        *   Consider integrating with password strength estimation libraries (e.g., zxcvbn).
        *   Enforce rate limiting on account creation attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

*   **2.1.2 Username Enumeration:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The account creation process might reveal whether a username already exists.  This can be done through error messages, response times, or other subtle differences in the application's response.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker uses a list of common usernames to determine which ones exist on the system.  This information can be used for targeted phishing attacks or password guessing attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Return generic error messages that do not reveal whether a username exists (e.g., "Invalid username or password").
        *   Ensure consistent response times regardless of whether the username exists.
        *   Consider using CAPTCHAs or other anti-automation measures to prevent automated username enumeration.

*   **2.1.3 Mass Account Creation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  `onboard` might not have mechanisms to prevent an attacker from creating a large number of accounts.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker creates thousands of fake accounts to spam the system, launch denial-of-service attacks, or bypass rate limits on other features.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on account creation attempts (e.g., limit the number of accounts that can be created from a single IP address within a given time period).
        *   Require email verification or other forms of identity verification during account creation.
        *   Use CAPTCHAs or other anti-automation measures.

*   **2.1.4 Lack of Input Validation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient validation of user-provided data during account creation (e.g., email address, username, other profile fields).
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker injects malicious code (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS)) into user profile fields.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data.  Use whitelisting (allowing only specific characters or patterns) rather than blacklisting (blocking specific characters).
        *   Sanitize and encode user input before displaying it on the website or storing it in the database.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

### 2.2 Password Reset Vulnerabilities

*   **2.2.1 Weak Password Reset Tokens:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  `onboard` might generate predictable or easily guessable password reset tokens.  This could be due to using a weak random number generator, a short token length, or a predictable token format.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker intercepts a password reset email or guesses the reset token, allowing them to reset a user's password and gain access to their account.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate reset tokens.
        *   Generate long, random tokens (e.g., at least 128 bits of entropy).
        *   Store reset tokens securely (e.g., hashed and salted) in the database.
        *   Set a short expiration time for reset tokens (e.g., 30 minutes).

*   **2.2.2 Token Leakage:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Reset tokens might be leaked through various channels, such as HTTP headers, URL parameters, or error messages.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker intercepts network traffic or gains access to server logs, revealing a user's reset token.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Never include reset tokens in URL parameters.
        *   Transmit reset tokens only over HTTPS.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive information, including reset tokens.
        *   Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS connections.

*   **2.2.3 Lack of Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  `onboard` might not limit the number of password reset requests that can be made for a given account.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker floods the system with password reset requests for a target user, potentially locking them out of their account or causing a denial-of-service.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on password reset requests (e.g., limit the number of requests per user per hour).
        *   Consider temporarily locking the account after multiple failed password reset attempts.

*   **2.2.4 Insecure Password Reset Questions:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** If `onboard` supports security questions, the questions might be easily guessable or publicly available.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker uses publicly available information (e.g., social media profiles) to answer a user's security questions and reset their password.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Avoid using easily guessable security questions.
        *   Allow users to create their own custom security questions.
        *   Require strong answers to security questions (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
        *   Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a more secure alternative to security questions.  Better yet, avoid security questions entirely.

*   **2.2.5 Improper Handling of Email Verification:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The email verification process might be flawed, allowing an attacker to bypass it.  For example, the verification link might be predictable, or the application might not properly validate the verification token.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker intercepts a verification email or guesses the verification link, allowing them to verify an email address they do not control.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use cryptographically secure random tokens for email verification links.
        *   Set a short expiration time for verification links.
        *   Ensure that the application properly validates the verification token before marking the email address as verified.
        *   Consider using a double opt-in process, where the user must click a link in a second email to confirm their email address.

### 2.3 Account Recovery Vulnerabilities

Account recovery often overlaps with password reset, but may include additional methods.  The vulnerabilities listed above for password reset often apply here as well.  Additional considerations include:

*   **2.3.1 Weaknesses in Alternative Recovery Methods:** If `onboard` supports alternative recovery methods (e.g., SMS codes, backup codes), these methods might have their own vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker intercepts an SMS code or gains access to a user's backup codes, allowing them to bypass other security measures.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use strong authentication methods for alternative recovery (e.g., time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) instead of SMS codes).
        *   Store backup codes securely (e.g., encrypted).
        *   Educate users about the risks of using weak recovery methods.

### 2.4 User Profile Management Vulnerabilities

*   **2.4.1 Email Address Change Without Verification:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  `onboard` might allow users to change their email address without verifying the new address.
    *   **Attack Scenario:**  An attacker gains access to a user's account (e.g., through a weak password) and changes the email address to one they control.  They can then use the password reset feature to gain full control of the account.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Require email verification for all email address changes.
        *   Send a notification to the *old* email address when the email address is changed.
        *   Consider requiring the user to re-enter their password before changing their email address.

*   **2.4.2 Lack of Input Validation on Profile Fields:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Similar to account creation, insufficient validation of user-provided data when updating profile information.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker injects malicious code (XSS, SQLi) into profile fields.
    *   **Mitigation:** Same as 2.1.4.

### 2.5 Authentication and Session Management (Related to User Management)

*   **2.5.1 Session Fixation:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** `onboard` might not properly regenerate session IDs after a user logs in or changes their password.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker sets a user's session ID to a known value (e.g., through a malicious link) and then waits for the user to log in.  The attacker can then use the known session ID to hijack the user's session.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regenerate session IDs after successful authentication and after any significant user management action (e.g., password change, email change).
        *   Use a secure session management library.

*   **2.5.2 Insufficient Session Expiration:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Sessions might not expire after a period of inactivity, or the expiration time might be too long.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker gains access to a user's computer or device and uses their active session to access their account.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement session timeouts (e.g., expire sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity).
        *   Provide a "remember me" option that uses a persistent, but securely generated and stored, token.
