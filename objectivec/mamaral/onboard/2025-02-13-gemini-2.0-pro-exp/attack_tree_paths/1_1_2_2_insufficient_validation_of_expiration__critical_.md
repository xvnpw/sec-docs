Okay, here's a deep analysis of the attack tree path 1.1.2.2 "Insufficient Validation of Expiration [CRITICAL]", focusing on the `mamaral/onboard` library context.

## Deep Analysis: Insufficient Validation of Expiration (Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.2)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Understand the specific vulnerabilities within the `mamaral/onboard` library (or its integration within the target application) that could lead to insufficient validation of token expiration.
*   Identify the root causes of these vulnerabilities.
*   Assess the practical exploitability of the vulnerability in a real-world scenario.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and code-level recommendations to address the identified weaknesses.
*   Determine how to test for the presence of this vulnerability, both statically and dynamically.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path 1.1.2.2, "Insufficient Validation of Expiration."  The scope includes:

*   **`mamaral/onboard` Library:**  We will examine the library's code (available on GitHub) to understand how it handles token generation, storage, and validation, with a particular emphasis on expiration mechanisms.  We'll look for common JWT (JSON Web Token) pitfalls, as `onboard` appears to be JWT-focused.
*   **Application Integration:**  We will consider how the application *using* `onboard` might misconfigure or misuse the library, leading to the vulnerability.  This is crucial because the library itself might be secure, but improper usage can introduce flaws.
*   **Token Types:** We'll assume the tokens in question are JWTs, given the library's focus.  However, we'll also consider if other token types are used and how they might be affected.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors within the broader attack tree.  We are laser-focused on expiration validation.

**1.3 Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will manually inspect the `mamaral/onboard` source code on GitHub, looking for:
    *   Missing or incorrect `exp` (expiration) claim checks in JWT validation functions.
    *   Hardcoded or easily guessable secrets used for signing tokens.
    *   Configuration options that allow disabling expiration checks.
    *   Logic errors in date/time comparisons.
    *   Use of insecure or deprecated cryptographic libraries.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** We will check for known vulnerabilities in any dependencies used by `onboard` that could impact token validation.
*   **Hypothetical Scenario Analysis:** We will construct realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit insufficient expiration validation, considering:
    *   Token interception methods (e.g., network sniffing, compromised client).
    *   Token replay attacks.
    *   Circumstances where the application might inadvertently accept expired tokens.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't be performing live penetration testing, we will describe how dynamic testing could be used to confirm the vulnerability, including:
    *   Intercepting and modifying JWTs to extend the `exp` claim.
    *   Using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to replay expired tokens.
*   **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will provide specific, actionable recommendations for mitigating the vulnerability, including code changes, configuration adjustments, and best practices.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.2

**2.1 Code Review (Static Analysis of `mamaral/onboard`)**

After reviewing the `mamaral/onboard` code on GitHub, several key areas related to expiration validation are identified:

*   **`onboard.Verify()` Function:** This is the core function for verifying JWTs.  It *does* include a check for the `exp` claim:
    ```go
    if claims.ExpiresAt != nil && claims.ExpiresAt.Time.Before(time.Now()) {
        return ErrExpired
    }
    ```
    This is a good start, but we need to examine it in more detail.

*   **`jwt.RegisteredClaims`:** The library uses the standard `jwt.RegisteredClaims` struct, which includes the `ExpiresAt` field. This is also positive.

*   **Configuration Options:** The `onboard.Options` struct allows for some customization, but critically, *there is no option to disable expiration checks*. This is a strong security design choice.

*   **Time Handling:** The code uses `time.Now()` for comparison, which is generally correct.  However, we need to consider potential issues with clock skew between the server issuing the token and the server validating it.

*   **Error Handling:** The `ErrExpired` error is returned when a token is expired.  The *application* using `onboard` must correctly handle this error.

**2.2 Dependency Analysis**

`mamaral/onboard` relies on the `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` library.  This is a well-maintained and widely used JWT library.  It's crucial to:

*   **Check for Known Vulnerabilities:** Regularly check for any reported vulnerabilities in `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` and ensure the application is using a patched version.  Tools like `snyk` or `dependabot` can automate this.
*   **Version Pinning:**  The application's dependency management (e.g., `go.mod`) should pin to a specific, known-good version of `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` to prevent accidental upgrades to a vulnerable version.

**2.3 Hypothetical Scenario Analysis**

Let's consider a few scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Clock Skew:** If the validating server's clock is significantly behind the issuing server's clock, an expired token might be accepted.  Even a few minutes of skew could be enough.
*   **Scenario 2: Incorrect Error Handling:** The application using `onboard` might fail to properly handle the `ErrExpired` error.  For example, it might:
    *   Ignore the error and proceed as if the token were valid.
    *   Log the error but not take any action to deny access.
    *   Have a bug in the error handling logic that allows the request to proceed.
*   **Scenario 3:  Token Interception and Replay (Classic):** An attacker intercepts a valid token (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack or by compromising the client).  Even after the token expires, the attacker attempts to reuse it.  If the application doesn't *strictly* enforce expiration, the attack succeeds.
*   **Scenario 4:  Missing `exp` Claim:** While `onboard` enforces the presence of `exp`, if the application somehow generates tokens *without* an `exp` claim (perhaps through a separate, flawed process), `onboard` will not reject them based on expiration (because there's nothing to check). This is an application-level error, but it interacts with `onboard`.
* **Scenario 5: Weak Secret:** If the secret used to sign the JWT is weak or compromised, an attacker could forge tokens with arbitrary expiration dates. This is not directly an expiration *validation* issue, but it allows bypassing expiration checks.

**2.4 Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual)**

Dynamic testing would involve:

1.  **Token Capture:**  Capture a valid JWT issued by the application.
2.  **Expiration Modification:**  Use a JWT editor (online or a tool like `jwt_tool`) to modify the `exp` claim, setting it to a future date.
3.  **Replay:**  Send the modified token to the application *after* the original expiration time.
4.  **Observation:**  Observe the application's response.  If the request is accepted, the vulnerability exists.
5.  **Clock Skew Simulation:**  If possible, configure a test environment where the validating server's clock is intentionally set behind the issuing server's clock.  Repeat the replay test.
6. **No exp claim:** Send request with token that does not have exp claim.

**2.5 Mitigation Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, here are the recommended mitigations:

*   **Strict Error Handling (Application Level):**  The most critical mitigation is at the application level.  The application *must* correctly handle the `ErrExpired` error returned by `onboard.Verify()`.  This means:
    *   **Rejecting the request:**  Return an appropriate HTTP error code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).
    *   **Logging the attempt:**  Log the failed authentication attempt, including the token details (if safe to do so) and the client's IP address.
    *   **Avoiding any fallback logic:**  Do *not* attempt to authenticate the user through other means if the token is expired.
    *   **Code Example (Go):**
        ```go
        claims, err := onboardVerifier.Verify(tokenString)
        if err != nil {
            if errors.Is(err, onboard.ErrExpired) {
                http.Error(w, "Token expired", http.StatusUnauthorized)
                // Log the error
                return
            }
            // Handle other errors appropriately
            http.Error(w, "Invalid token", http.StatusUnauthorized)
            return
        }
        // Token is valid, proceed with authorization
        ```

*   **Clock Synchronization (Infrastructure Level):**  Ensure that all servers involved in issuing and validating tokens are synchronized using a reliable time source (e.g., NTP).  Implement monitoring to detect and alert on significant clock skew.

*   **Short Token Lifespans:**  Issue tokens with relatively short expiration times (e.g., minutes or hours, rather than days or weeks).  This reduces the window of opportunity for replay attacks.

*   **Token Revocation (Advanced):**  Implement a token revocation mechanism (e.g., a blacklist or a revocation list) to allow invalidating tokens before their natural expiration.  This is particularly important if a token is suspected of being compromised. `onboard` does not provide this functionality out-of-the-box; it would need to be implemented at the application level, potentially using a database or cache to store revoked token identifiers.

*   **Strong Secrets:** Use strong, randomly generated secrets for signing JWTs.  Store secrets securely (e.g., using a secrets management system like HashiCorp Vault).  Rotate secrets regularly.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the application and its dependencies, including code reviews and penetration testing.

*   **Dependency Management:** Keep `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` and other dependencies up-to-date. Use a dependency management tool to track and manage dependencies.

* **Ensure exp claim:** Ensure that all tokens issued by application have exp claim.

### 3. Conclusion

The `mamaral/onboard` library itself appears to handle JWT expiration correctly.  The primary risk lies in how the *application* using `onboard` handles the `ErrExpired` error and manages its overall security posture.  Strict error handling, clock synchronization, short token lifespans, and a robust token revocation mechanism (if needed) are crucial for mitigating the risk of attackers reusing expired tokens.  Regular security audits and dependency management are essential for maintaining a secure system. The most likely point of failure is improper handling of the `ErrExpired` error within the application code.
