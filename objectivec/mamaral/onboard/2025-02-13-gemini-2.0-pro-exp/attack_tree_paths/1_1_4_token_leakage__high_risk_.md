Okay, let's dive into a deep analysis of the "Token Leakage" attack path within the context of an application using the `mamaral/onboard` library.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.4 Token Leakage

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to token leakage within an application leveraging the `mamaral/onboard` library.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of token compromise.  The ultimate goal is to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data managed by the application.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Token Leakage" attack path (1.1.4) and its implications for applications using `mamaral/onboard`.  The scope includes:

*   **`mamaral/onboard` Library:**  We will examine the library's code (as available on GitHub) and documentation to understand how it handles tokens, specifically focusing on generation, storage, transmission, and validation.  We'll look for potential weaknesses in these processes.
*   **Application Integration:**  We will consider how a typical application might integrate with `mamaral/onboard` and identify potential points where token leakage could occur due to improper implementation or configuration.  This includes the application's server-side code, client-side code (if applicable), and any third-party services involved.
*   **Token Types:** We will consider the types of tokens used by `mamaral/onboard` (e.g., JWTs, session tokens, API keys) and the specific risks associated with each.
*   **Common Attack Vectors:** We will analyze common attack vectors that could lead to token leakage, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), insecure storage, logging vulnerabilities, and network sniffing.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** For each identified vulnerability, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a static code analysis of the `mamaral/onboard` library, focusing on token-related functionality.  This will involve examining the source code for potential vulnerabilities, such as insecure storage mechanisms, improper error handling, and lack of input validation.
2.  **Documentation Review:**  We will thoroughly review the official documentation for `mamaral/onboard` to understand the intended usage and security best practices.  We will look for any gaps or ambiguities that could lead to insecure implementations.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios that could lead to token leakage.  This will involve considering the attacker's perspective and identifying potential entry points and weaknesses.
4.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to token management in general and, if available, specifically related to `mamaral/onboard` or similar libraries.
5.  **Best Practices Analysis:**  We will compare the library's implementation and recommended usage against industry best practices for secure token management.
6.  **Hypothetical Scenario Analysis:** We will construct hypothetical scenarios to illustrate how specific vulnerabilities could be exploited in a real-world attack.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.4 Token Leakage

Now, let's analyze the specific attack path, "Token Leakage," breaking it down into potential sub-paths and vulnerabilities.

**2.1. Sub-Paths and Vulnerabilities**

We can further decompose "Token Leakage" into several more specific sub-paths:

*   **1.1.4.1 Client-Side Leakage:**  Tokens exposed in the client-side code or environment.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.1.1:  XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the application, which then steals the token from the user's browser (e.g., from local storage, cookies, or the DOM).  `mamaral/onboard` itself might not be directly vulnerable, but the *application* using it could be.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.1.2:  Insecure Storage (Client-Side):**  The application stores the token in an insecure location, such as `localStorage` without proper encryption or in a cookie without the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.1.3:  Exposure in JavaScript Variables:**  The token is accidentally exposed in a globally accessible JavaScript variable, making it accessible to any script running on the page.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.1.4:  Debugging Information:**  The token is inadvertently included in debugging logs or error messages that are accessible to the client.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.1.5: Browser Extensions:** Malicious or compromised browser extensions could access and steal tokens stored in the browser.

*   **1.1.4.2 Server-Side Leakage:**  Tokens exposed on the server-side.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.2.1:  Logging:**  The application logs the token in plain text to server logs, which could be accessed by unauthorized individuals or attackers who gain access to the server.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.2.2:  Error Messages:**  The token is included in error messages returned to the client, potentially exposing it to attackers.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.2.3:  Insecure Configuration:**  The server is misconfigured, exposing sensitive files or directories containing tokens (e.g., configuration files, environment variables).
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.2.4:  Source Code Repository:**  The token is accidentally committed to a public source code repository (e.g., GitHub).
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.2.5:  Database Leak:**  If tokens are stored in a database, a database breach (e.g., SQL injection) could expose them.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.2.6:  Third-Party Service Compromise:** If `mamaral/onboard` relies on a third-party service for token management, a compromise of that service could lead to token leakage.

*   **1.1.4.3 Network-Based Leakage:**  Tokens intercepted during transmission.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.3.1:  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**  An attacker intercepts the communication between the client and the server, capturing the token in transit.  This is particularly relevant if HTTPS is not properly implemented or if there are vulnerabilities in the TLS/SSL configuration.
    *   **Vulnerability 1.1.4.3.2:  Packet Sniffing:**  On an insecure network (e.g., public Wi-Fi), an attacker can use packet sniffing tools to capture unencrypted traffic containing the token.

**2.2.  `mamaral/onboard` Specific Considerations**

Since we are focusing on `mamaral/onboard`, let's consider how its specific features might relate to these vulnerabilities.  *Without access to the full application context*, we can make some educated guesses based on the library's purpose (user onboarding):

*   **Token Purpose:**  `mamaral/onboard` likely uses tokens to manage the onboarding process.  These might be short-lived tokens used to verify email addresses, track progress through onboarding steps, or grant temporary access before full account creation.  The sensitivity of these tokens depends on what actions they authorize.
*   **Token Storage:**  The library *might* provide guidance or helper functions for storing tokens.  If it recommends storing tokens in `localStorage` without emphasizing encryption, this is a potential vulnerability (1.1.4.1.2).  If it uses cookies, it *should* strongly recommend using the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
*   **Token Transmission:**  The library likely handles the transmission of tokens between the client and server during the onboarding process.  It *should* enforce the use of HTTPS.  If it doesn't, this is a major vulnerability (1.1.4.3.1).
*   **Token Validation:**  The library likely includes functions for validating tokens.  It's crucial that these validation checks are robust and prevent common attacks like token forgery or replay attacks.  Weak validation could lead to unauthorized access even if the token isn't directly leaked.
* **Token Generation:** The library should use cryptographically secure random number generator for token generation.

**2.3. Mitigation Strategies**

For each identified vulnerability, we propose the following mitigation strategies:

| Vulnerability                               | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
