Okay, let's dive deep into analyzing the "Token Replay Attack" path (1.1.2) within an attack tree for an application utilizing the `mamaral/onboard` library.  This library appears to be focused on device onboarding and provisioning, which makes token security absolutely critical.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2 Token Replay Attack

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and effective mitigation strategies related to a token replay attack against an application using the `mamaral/onboard` library.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses in how the application *might* handle tokens generated or used during the onboarding process, and to provide concrete recommendations to the development team.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Token Types:**  Identifying all types of tokens used by `mamaral/onboard` and the application during the onboarding process. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Initial registration tokens
    *   Session tokens
    *   Refresh tokens
    *   Device provisioning tokens
    *   API access tokens (if used post-onboarding)
*   **Token Handling:** Examining how the application and the library:
    *   Generate tokens
    *   Store tokens (client-side and server-side)
    *   Transmit tokens
    *   Validate tokens
    *   Invalidate/Revoke tokens
*   **`mamaral/onboard` Integration:**  Understanding how the application integrates with the library and whether any custom code or configurations introduce vulnerabilities.  We'll assume the application uses the library as intended, but also consider potential misconfigurations.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover broader attacks that don't directly involve replaying a captured token.  For example, we won't deeply analyze brute-force attacks against token generation (though we'll touch on it in relation to replay mitigation).

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the `mamaral/onboard` library's source code on GitHub.  Pay close attention to:
        *   Token generation logic (randomness, uniqueness, format).
        *   Token validation mechanisms (expiry checks, signature verification, etc.).
        *   Any built-in replay protection mechanisms (e.g., nonces, timestamps).
    *   Review the *application's* source code, focusing on:
        *   How it calls `mamaral/onboard` functions related to token handling.
        *   Any custom token handling logic implemented outside the library.
        *   Storage and transmission of tokens.
2.  **Documentation Review:**
    *   Thoroughly read the `mamaral/onboard` documentation (README, any available guides, API docs).
    *   Look for best practices, security recommendations, and warnings related to token security.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Identify potential attack scenarios where a token replay could be successful.
    *   Consider different attacker capabilities (e.g., network eavesdropper, compromised client device).
4.  **Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical):**
    *   *Without* a running instance of the application, we'll hypothesize about potential dynamic behaviors based on the static analysis.  This will involve:
        *   "Thinking like an attacker" to identify potential weaknesses in the token lifecycle.
        *   Considering how different communication channels (HTTPS, potentially others) might be exploited.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Based on the identified vulnerabilities, propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.
    *   Prioritize recommendations based on their effectiveness and feasibility.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2 Token Replay Attack

Now, let's analyze the attack path itself, applying the methodology.

**4.1 Code Review (Hypothetical - `mamaral/onboard` and Application)**

Since I don't have the application code, I'll make some educated assumptions based on common onboarding patterns and the likely purpose of `mamaral/onboard`.

*   **`mamaral/onboard` (Hypothetical):**
    *   **Token Generation:**  The library *likely* uses a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate tokens.  The format might be a UUID, a JWT (JSON Web Token), or a custom format.  *Crucially*, if it's a JWT, it *should* include an expiration time (`exp`) and potentially a "not before" time (`nbf`).  It *might* also include a unique identifier (`jti`) to prevent replay.
    *   **Token Validation:** The library *should* validate the token's signature (if it's a JWT or has a signature) and check the expiration time.  If a `jti` is used, it *should* have a mechanism to track used `jti` values and reject duplicates.
    *   **Replay Protection:**  The library *might* implement nonce-based replay protection, requiring the client to include a unique, server-provided nonce in each request.  This is less common in onboarding scenarios but possible.  Timestamp-based checks are more likely.
    *   **Potential Weaknesses:**
        *   **Insufficient Randomness:** If the CSPRNG is not properly seeded or is predictable, tokens could be guessed.
        *   **Missing Expiration:** If tokens don't expire, a captured token could be used indefinitely.
        *   **Missing `jti` or Poor `jti` Tracking:**  Without a unique identifier and a mechanism to track it, replay is easier.
        *   **Wide Time Window:**  If the allowed time window for token validity is too large, the replay window is also large.
        *   **No Revocation Mechanism:**  If a token is compromised, there might be no way to invalidate it before it expires.

*   **Application Code (Hypothetical):**
    *   **Token Storage (Client):** The application might store tokens in:
        *   **Cookies:**  If so, are they `HttpOnly` and `Secure`?
        *   **Local Storage/Session Storage:**  Vulnerable to XSS attacks.
        *   **Device Secure Storage:**  More secure, but implementation-dependent.
    *   **Token Transmission:**  The application *should* use HTTPS for all communication involving tokens.  Any use of HTTP would be a critical vulnerability.
    *   **Token Validation (Beyond Library):**  The application *might* perform additional validation, such as checking against a database of valid tokens.  This is good practice.
    *   **Potential Weaknesses:**
        *   **Insecure Storage:**  Storing tokens in insecure locations makes them vulnerable to theft.
        *   **HTTP Usage:**  Transmitting tokens over HTTP allows for easy interception.
        *   **Ignoring Library Recommendations:**  The application might not follow best practices outlined in the `mamaral/onboard` documentation.
        *   **Custom Token Handling Errors:**  Any custom code that manipulates tokens could introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Even with replay protection, an attacker might try to replay a token many times within a short window.

**4.2 Documentation Review (Hypothetical)**

We would expect the `mamaral/onboard` documentation to:

*   Clearly describe the token format and generation process.
*   Recommend secure storage and transmission practices.
*   Explain any built-in replay protection mechanisms.
*   Provide guidance on token expiration and revocation.
*   Warn against common pitfalls (e.g., using predictable secrets).

**4.3 Threat Modeling**

Here are some potential attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Network Eavesdropping:**
    *   **Attacker:**  An attacker on the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi) uses a packet sniffer to capture the initial onboarding token sent from the server to the device.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If the token is sent over HTTP, or if HTTPS is improperly configured (e.g., weak ciphers), the attacker can easily obtain the token.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can replay the token to impersonate the device and complete the onboarding process, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionality.

*   **Scenario 2: Compromised Client Device:**
    *   **Attacker:**  The attacker has gained access to the device (e.g., through malware or physical access) and can access the stored token.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  If the token is stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text in Local Storage), the attacker can easily retrieve it.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can replay the token to authenticate as the device, even if the device is offline.

*   **Scenario 3: Short Expiration Window, Rapid Replay:**
    *   **Attacker:** Captures token via the network.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Token has short expiration, but application does not have rate limiting.
    *   **Impact:** Attacker replays token multiple times before it expires, potentially causing denial of service or other issues.

**4.4 Dynamic Analysis (Hypothetical)**

Based on the static analysis, we would hypothesize the following dynamic behaviors:

*   **Token Exchange:**  The application likely initiates the onboarding process, and the server generates a token.  This token is sent to the device, which then uses it in subsequent requests.
*   **Validation:**  The server validates the token on each request, checking its signature, expiration, and potentially a `jti` or nonce.
*   **Replay Failure:**  If a token is replayed after it has expired or after its `jti` has been used, the server *should* reject the request.
*   **Error Handling:**  The application *should* handle token validation errors gracefully, without revealing sensitive information.

**4.5 Mitigation Recommendations**

Here are prioritized mitigation strategies:

*   **High Priority:**
    *   **Use HTTPS:**  Ensure *all* communication involving tokens uses HTTPS with strong ciphers and proper certificate validation.  This is the most fundamental protection.
    *   **Short-Lived Tokens:**  Use tokens with short expiration times (e.g., minutes or hours, depending on the onboarding process).  This minimizes the window of opportunity for replay.
    *   **Token Revocation:** Implement a mechanism to revoke tokens if they are compromised.  This might involve a blacklist of revoked tokens or a more sophisticated system.
    *   **Secure Token Storage (Client):**  Store tokens securely on the client device.  Use the most secure storage mechanism available for the platform (e.g., Keychain on iOS, Keystore on Android, `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookies for web).
    *   **Validate `jti` (if used):** If the library or application uses `jti` (JWT ID) claims, *strictly* enforce their uniqueness.  Maintain a record of used `jti` values and reject any duplicates.  Consider a short time-to-live (TTL) for this record to avoid unbounded growth.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that accept tokens. This prevents attackers from rapidly replaying a token even within a short validity window.

*   **Medium Priority:**
    *   **Nonce-Based Replay Protection:**  Consider using nonces if the onboarding process involves multiple steps.  The server would generate a unique nonce for each request, and the client would include it in the subsequent request.
    *   **Token Binding:** Explore techniques to bind the token to a specific device or session.  This could involve using device-specific identifiers or cryptographic binding.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Low Priority (But Still Important):**
    *   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual patterns of token usage, which could indicate a replay attack.
    *   **Educate Developers:**  Ensure developers are aware of the risks of token replay attacks and best practices for secure token handling.

### 5. Conclusion

Token replay attacks are a serious threat to applications using onboarding libraries like `mamaral/onboard`. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks. The most critical mitigations are using HTTPS, short-lived tokens, secure storage, `jti` validation (if applicable), and token revocation. Rate limiting is also crucial to prevent rapid replay attempts. Continuous security review and updates are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
