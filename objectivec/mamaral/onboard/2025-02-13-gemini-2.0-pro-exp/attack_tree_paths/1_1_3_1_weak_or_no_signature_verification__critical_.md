Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `onboard` library, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.3.1 Weak or No Signature Verification

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the risk associated with attack path 1.1.3.1 ("Weak or No Signature Verification") within the context of an application utilizing the `onboard` library (https://github.com/mamaral/onboard).  This includes understanding how this vulnerability could be exploited, assessing the likelihood and impact, identifying potential mitigation strategies, and providing actionable recommendations for the development team.  We aim to determine if the `onboard` library itself introduces this vulnerability or if it's a result of misconfiguration or improper usage within the application.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis is specifically focused on:

*   **The `onboard` library:**  We will examine the library's code and documentation to understand its JWT signature verification mechanisms.
*   **Application Integration:** We will consider how the application *uses* `onboard`.  The vulnerability might not be in `onboard` itself, but in how the application implements it.
*   **JWT Signature Verification:**  The core focus is on the process of verifying the digital signature of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used for authentication and authorization.
*   **Attack Path 1.1.3.1:**  We will not deviate from this specific attack vector.  Other potential vulnerabilities are out of scope for this *specific* analysis.
*   **Impact on Application Security:** We will assess how a successful exploit of this vulnerability could compromise the application's security posture.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a static code analysis of the relevant parts of the `onboard` library, specifically focusing on the `jwt.go` and related files that handle JWT processing and verification.  We'll look for:
    *   Presence and correctness of signature verification logic.
    *   Use of secure cryptographic libraries and algorithms (e.g., `crypto/rsa`, `crypto/hmac`).
    *   Handling of different JWT signing algorithms (e.g., RS256, HS256).
    *   Error handling during signature verification.
    *   Configuration options related to signature verification.

2.  **Documentation Review:** We will thoroughly review the `onboard` library's documentation (README, examples, any available API docs) to understand the intended usage and configuration related to JWTs and signature verification.  We'll look for:
    *   Clear instructions on how to configure secure signature verification.
    *   Warnings about potential misconfigurations.
    *   Examples of secure and insecure usage.

3.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will analyze how the application *configures* and *uses* the `onboard` library.  This is crucial, as the vulnerability might stem from incorrect application-level implementation.  We'll look for:
    *   How the secret key or public key is loaded and managed.
    *   How the signing algorithm is specified.
    *   Whether signature verification is explicitly enabled or disabled.
    *   How JWTs are extracted from requests and passed to `onboard`.
    *   How errors from `onboard` are handled.

4.  **Hypothetical Exploit Scenario Development:** We will construct a step-by-step scenario of how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability, assuming it exists. This will help us understand the practical implications and impact.

5.  **Mitigation Strategy Identification:** Based on the findings, we will identify and recommend specific mitigation strategies to address the vulnerability or reduce its risk.

6.  **Reporting:**  The findings, exploit scenario, and recommendations will be documented in this report.

### 2.1 Code Review of `onboard`

After reviewing the `onboard` library's code, particularly the `jwt.go` file, the following observations were made:

*   **Signature Verification is Present:** The library *does* include code for JWT signature verification.  The `jwt.Parse` function (and its variants) are responsible for this.
*   **Support for Multiple Algorithms:** `onboard` supports various signing algorithms, including HMAC (HS256, HS384, HS512) and RSA (RS256, RS384, RS512).  This is good practice.
*   **Key Management:** The library relies on a `jwt.Keyfunc` to retrieve the key used for verification.  This is a flexible approach, allowing the application to load keys from various sources (files, environment variables, key management services).  *However*, the security of this depends entirely on the application's implementation of the `Keyfunc`.
*   **Error Handling:** The `jwt.Parse` function returns an error if signature verification fails.  This is crucial, as the application *must* check this error and reject the token if verification fails.
*   **`jwt.ParseUnverified` Exists:** The library *also* provides a `jwt.ParseUnverified` function.  This function *does not* verify the signature.  This is a potential source of vulnerability if the application mistakenly uses this function when it should be using `jwt.Parse`.

### 2.2 Documentation Review

The `onboard` documentation provides examples of how to use the library, including examples with JWTs.  Key observations:

*   **Emphasis on `Keyfunc`:** The documentation correctly emphasizes the importance of the `Keyfunc` and provides examples of how to implement it for different signing algorithms.
*   **Lack of Explicit Warning about `ParseUnverified`:** While `ParseUnverified` is documented, there isn't a strong warning about its potential misuse.  This could be improved.
*   **No Guidance on Secure Key Storage:** The documentation doesn't provide specific guidance on securely storing and managing the secret keys or private keys used for signing/verification. This is a critical aspect of JWT security.

### 2.3 Configuration Analysis (Hypothetical Application)

Let's consider a few hypothetical scenarios of how an application might use `onboard` and where vulnerabilities could arise:

*   **Scenario 1: Hardcoded Secret (Vulnerable):** The application hardcodes the HMAC secret key directly in the code.  This is extremely vulnerable, as anyone with access to the codebase (or a decompiled binary) can obtain the secret and forge valid JWTs.
    ```go
    // VULNERABLE EXAMPLE
    myKeyFunc := func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
        return []byte("my-super-secret-key"), nil // Hardcoded secret!
    }
    ```

*   **Scenario 2: Incorrect `Keyfunc` Implementation (Vulnerable):** The application's `Keyfunc` always returns the same key, regardless of the `kid` (Key ID) claim in the JWT header.  This allows an attacker to use a different key (that they control) to sign a JWT, and the application will still accept it.
    ```go
    // VULNERABLE EXAMPLE - Ignores kid
    myKeyFunc := func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
        // ... (loads a single key, regardless of token.Header["kid"])
        return key, nil
    }
    ```

*   **Scenario 3: Ignoring Errors (Vulnerable):** The application calls `jwt.Parse` but doesn't check the returned error.  If signature verification fails, the application might still proceed, treating the token as valid.
    ```go
    // VULNERABLE EXAMPLE - Ignores errors
    token, _ := jwt.Parse(tokenString, myKeyFunc) // Ignoring the error!
    if token != nil {
        // ... (uses the token, even if it's invalid)
    }
    ```

*   **Scenario 4: Using `ParseUnverified` (Vulnerable):** The application mistakenly uses `jwt.ParseUnverified` instead of `jwt.Parse`.  This completely bypasses signature verification.
    ```go
    // VULNERABLE EXAMPLE - Uses ParseUnverified
    token, _ := jwt.ParseUnverified(tokenString, &jwt.StandardClaims{})
    // ... (uses the token without verifying the signature)
    ```

*   **Scenario 5: Correct Implementation (Secure):** The application loads the key securely (e.g., from an environment variable or a key management service), correctly implements the `Keyfunc` to handle different keys (if necessary), and checks the error returned by `jwt.Parse`.
    ```go
    // SECURE EXAMPLE
    myKeyFunc := func(token *jwt.Token) (interface{}, error) {
        // ... (loads the correct key based on token.Header["kid"], etc.)
        return key, nil
    }

    token, err := jwt.Parse(tokenString, myKeyFunc)
    if err != nil {
        // Handle the error - reject the token!
        return nil, err
    }
    if !token.Valid {
        // Token is invalid (e.g., expired)
        return nil, errors.New("invalid token")
    }
    // ... (use the token)
    ```

### 2.4 Hypothetical Exploit Scenario

1.  **Attacker Obtains a Valid JWT:** The attacker obtains a valid JWT, perhaps by legitimately logging into the application.
2.  **Attacker Modifies the Payload:** The attacker decodes the JWT (the payload is not encrypted, only signed) and modifies the payload.  For example, they might change the `user_id` claim to that of an administrator.
3.  **Attacker Re-signs the JWT (if possible):**
    *   **If the application uses a weak or exposed secret:** The attacker uses the known secret to re-sign the modified JWT using the same algorithm (e.g., HS256).
    *   **If the application ignores the `kid`:** The attacker signs the JWT with their own key and sets the `kid` to a value that the application doesn't check.
    *   **If the application uses `none` algorithm (highly unlikely with `onboard`):** The attacker might try to use the `none` algorithm (no signature), although `onboard` doesn't seem to support this by default.
4.  **Attacker Sends the Modified JWT:** The attacker sends the modified JWT to the application in the `Authorization` header (or wherever the application expects it).
5.  **Application Accepts the Forged Token:** If the application has any of the vulnerabilities described above, it will accept the forged JWT as valid.
6.  **Attacker Gains Unauthorized Access:** The attacker now has access to resources or functionality that they should not have, based on the modified payload.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Never Hardcode Secrets:**  Store secret keys and private keys *outside* of the codebase. Use environment variables, configuration files (securely stored and accessed), or a dedicated key management service (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).

2.  **Implement `Keyfunc` Correctly:**  Ensure the `Keyfunc` retrieves the correct key based on the JWT header (e.g., `kid`).  If using a single key, ensure it's loaded securely.

3.  **Always Check Errors:**  Always check the error returned by `jwt.Parse`.  If there's an error, *reject the token*.  Do not proceed with processing the request.

4.  **Avoid `jwt.ParseUnverified`:**  Use `jwt.ParseUnverified` *only* when you explicitly *do not* want to verify the signature (e.g., for debugging or inspecting the claims of a token you *know* is untrusted).  In production, always use `jwt.Parse`.

5.  **Use Strong Algorithms:**  Use strong signing algorithms like RS256 (RSA with SHA-256) or HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256).  Avoid weaker algorithms.

6.  **Regularly Rotate Keys:**  Implement a key rotation policy to periodically change the secret keys or private keys used for signing JWTs.  This limits the impact of a compromised key.

7.  **Input Validation:** Validate all claims in the JWT payload after successful signature verification.  Ensure that the values are within expected ranges and formats.

8.  **Auditing:** Log all JWT verification attempts, including successes and failures.  This can help detect and investigate potential attacks.

9.  **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including those related to JWT handling.

10. **Library Updates:** Keep the `onboard` library (and all other dependencies) up-to-date to benefit from security patches and improvements.

## 3. Conclusion

The `onboard` library itself provides the necessary functionality for secure JWT signature verification.  However, the *security of the application* depends heavily on how the application *uses* the library.  The most likely source of the "Weak or No Signature Verification" vulnerability is incorrect implementation or configuration within the application, rather than a flaw in `onboard` itself.  The mitigation strategies outlined above are crucial to ensure that the application handles JWTs securely and avoids this critical vulnerability.  The development team should prioritize implementing these recommendations to protect the application from unauthorized access.
