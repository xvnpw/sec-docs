# Deep Analysis: Bypass Authentication/Authorization in `onboard`-based Application

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Bypass Authentication/Authorization" attack path within an application leveraging the `onboard` library (https://github.com/mamaral/onboard).  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to enhance the application's security posture.  This analysis will focus on preventing unauthorized access to protected resources and functionalities.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by, or interacting with, the `onboard` library.  It encompasses:

*   **`onboard` Library Code:**  Direct examination of the library's source code for potential vulnerabilities in its authentication and authorization logic.  This includes how it handles sessions, tokens, user roles, and access control checks.
*   **Application Integration:** How the application integrates and utilizes the `onboard` library.  This includes configuration settings, custom extensions, and interactions with other security components (e.g., database, external identity providers).
*   **Client-Side Interactions:**  How the client-side application (e.g., a web browser or mobile app) interacts with the `onboard`-managed authentication and authorization flows.  This includes handling of tokens, cookies, and API requests.
*   **Dependencies:**  Indirectly, we will consider vulnerabilities in `onboard`'s dependencies *if* they directly impact the authentication/authorization process.  We will not perform a full dependency analysis, but will flag known critical vulnerabilities.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Attacks that do not directly target the authentication/authorization process (e.g., DDoS, XSS *unless* it leads to auth bypass).
*   Physical security of servers.
*   Social engineering attacks (unless they directly facilitate auth bypass, e.g., phishing for credentials used by `onboard`).
*   Vulnerabilities in the application's business logic *unrelated* to authentication/authorization.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (SAST):**
    *   Manual code review of the `onboard` library and the application's integration code.  We will look for common coding errors, logic flaws, and insecure practices related to authentication and authorization.
    *   Automated SAST tools (e.g., Semgrep, SonarQube) will be used to identify potential vulnerabilities based on predefined rules and patterns.  We will configure these tools to focus on security-relevant code.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):**
    *   Black-box testing:  We will attempt to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms without prior knowledge of the internal workings.  This includes manipulating requests, injecting malicious payloads, and testing for common web vulnerabilities.
    *   Grey-box testing:  With partial knowledge of the system (e.g., API documentation, configuration files), we will perform more targeted attacks.
    *   Fuzzing:  We will use fuzzing techniques to send malformed or unexpected inputs to the authentication and authorization endpoints to identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   We will use the initial attack tree as a starting point and expand upon it to identify specific attack vectors and scenarios.
    *   We will consider the attacker's perspective, their potential motivations, and the resources they might have access to.

4.  **Dependency Analysis (Limited):**
    *   We will use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` (depending on the project's package manager) to identify known vulnerabilities in `onboard`'s dependencies.  We will prioritize vulnerabilities that could directly impact authentication or authorization.

5.  **Review of Documentation:**
    *   We will thoroughly review the `onboard` library's documentation to understand its intended security features and best practices.  We will also review the application's documentation to ensure it aligns with secure usage of `onboard`.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the "Bypass Authentication/Authorization" Attack Path

This section details the specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors we will investigate, categorized for clarity.  Each category includes potential attack scenarios and mitigation strategies.

### 4.1.  Vulnerabilities in `onboard` Library Code

*   **4.1.1.  Insecure Session Management:**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:**
        *   **Session Fixation:**  An attacker sets a known session ID before the user logs in, allowing them to hijack the session after authentication.
        *   **Session Prediction:**  Session IDs are generated using a predictable algorithm, allowing an attacker to guess valid session IDs.
        *   **Insufficient Session Expiration:**  Sessions do not expire after a reasonable period of inactivity or upon logout, allowing an attacker to reuse old session tokens.
        *   **Session Hijacking (via XSS):**  If `onboard` stores session tokens in cookies without proper `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, an XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal the token.
        *   **Lack of Session Regeneration after Privilege Change:** If a user's role or permissions change, the session ID is not regenerated, potentially allowing the user to retain old privileges.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for session ID generation.
        *   Implement proper session expiration (both absolute and inactivity-based).
        *   Regenerate session IDs upon successful login and after any privilege changes.
        *   Set `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.  Consider using SameSite attributes (`Strict` or `Lax`) to mitigate CSRF attacks.
        *   Implement robust logout functionality that invalidates the session on both the server and client sides.
        *   Consider using a well-vetted session management library instead of rolling a custom solution.

*   **4.1.2.  Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:**
        *   **Weak Password Policies:**  `onboard` (or the application using it) allows weak passwords, making them susceptible to brute-force or dictionary attacks.
        *   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  `onboard` does not support or enforce MFA, making it easier for attackers to gain access with compromised credentials.
        *   **Insecure Password Reset:**  The password reset mechanism is vulnerable to account enumeration or takeover (e.g., predictable reset tokens, weak security questions).
        *   **Improper Handling of Authentication Tokens:**  If `onboard` uses JWTs or other tokens, vulnerabilities like weak signing keys, lack of signature verification, or algorithm downgrade attacks could allow attackers to forge tokens.
        *   **Lack of Rate Limiting on Login Attempts:**  An attacker can perform unlimited login attempts, making brute-force attacks feasible.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, and password history checks).
        *   Implement and strongly encourage the use of MFA.
        *   Secure the password reset process: use unique, unpredictable tokens, short expiration times, and email verification.  Avoid revealing whether an account exists during password reset.
        *   If using JWTs:
            *   Use a strong, randomly generated secret key (at least 256 bits for HS256, or an appropriate key size for asymmetric algorithms).
            *   Always verify the JWT signature before trusting its contents.
            *   Use a specific, strong algorithm (e.g., `HS256`, `RS256`) and prevent algorithm downgrade attacks.
            *   Include `exp` (expiration time) and `nbf` (not before) claims to limit the token's validity period.
            *   Consider using `jti` (JWT ID) claims to prevent replay attacks.
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts (and password reset attempts) to mitigate brute-force attacks.  Consider using CAPTCHAs or account lockouts after multiple failed attempts.

*   **4.1.3.  Authorization Flaws:**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:**
        *   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  `onboard` (or the application) allows users to access resources or perform actions by manipulating identifiers (e.g., user IDs, resource IDs) without proper authorization checks.
        *   **Broken Access Control:**  `onboard`'s role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) implementation is flawed, allowing users to escalate privileges or access resources they shouldn't.
        *   **Missing Function-Level Access Control:**  `onboard` does not properly restrict access to specific functions or API endpoints based on user roles or permissions.
        *   **Mass Assignment:** If onboard handles user data updates, it might be vulnerable to mass assignment, allowing attackers to modify unauthorized fields (e.g., changing their role to "admin").
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks at every layer of the application (presentation, business logic, and data access).
        *   Use indirect object references (e.g., UUIDs or random tokens) instead of predictable, sequential IDs.
        *   Validate all user-supplied input and ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to access.
        *   Implement a well-defined RBAC or ABAC system and ensure that it is correctly enforced.
        *   Use a "deny by default" approach: explicitly grant access to specific resources and functions based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Carefully review and test all authorization logic to ensure it is working as intended.
        *   Use whitelisting for allowed input parameters during user data updates to prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities.

### 4.2.  Vulnerabilities in Application Integration

*   **4.2.1.  Misconfiguration:**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:**
        *   **Default Credentials:**  The application uses default credentials for `onboard` or its underlying database, allowing attackers to easily gain access.
        *   **Debug Mode Enabled in Production:**  `onboard` or the application is running in debug mode in a production environment, exposing sensitive information or enabling debugging features that could be exploited.
        *   **Insecure Configuration Settings:**  `onboard`'s configuration settings are not properly secured, allowing attackers to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.
        *   **Improper Error Handling:**  Error messages reveal sensitive information about the authentication or authorization process, aiding attackers in their efforts.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change all default credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Disable debug mode in production environments.
        *   Carefully review and secure all `onboard` configuration settings.  Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   Implement proper error handling that does not reveal sensitive information.  Use generic error messages for authentication failures.

*   **4.2.2.  Custom Extensions and Overrides:**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:**
        *   **Vulnerable Custom Authentication Logic:**  The application overrides or extends `onboard`'s authentication logic with custom code that introduces vulnerabilities.
        *   **Insecure Handling of User Data:**  Custom code that interacts with `onboard`'s user data (e.g., roles, permissions) introduces vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test any custom code that interacts with `onboard`.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom authentication or authorization logic.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent XSS.

### 4.3.  Client-Side Vulnerabilities

*   **4.3.1.  Token Handling:**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:**
        *   **Token Storage in Local Storage:**  Storing authentication tokens in `localStorage` makes them vulnerable to XSS attacks.
        *   **Token Leakage in URLs:**  Authentication tokens are passed in URL parameters, making them visible in browser history, server logs, and referrer headers.
        *   **Lack of Token Refresh Mechanism:**  If tokens have a long expiration time and there's no refresh mechanism, a compromised token could be used for an extended period.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store tokens in `HttpOnly` cookies (for web applications) or secure storage mechanisms (for mobile apps).
        *   Avoid passing tokens in URL parameters.  Use request headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) instead.
        *   Implement a token refresh mechanism to limit the lifetime of access tokens.

*   **4.3.2  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Attack Scenarios:**
        *   An attacker tricks a logged-in user into making a request to the application that performs an unauthorized action (e.g., changing their password, making a purchase). This is particularly relevant if `onboard` handles state-changing actions related to authentication.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens) to protect against CSRF attacks.  `onboard` might provide built-in CSRF protection; if not, the application must implement it.
        *   Use the `SameSite` cookie attribute to restrict how cookies are sent with cross-origin requests.

## 5.  Reporting and Remediation

*   All identified vulnerabilities will be documented in detail, including:
    *   Description of the vulnerability.
    *   Affected components (`onboard` library, application code, configuration).
