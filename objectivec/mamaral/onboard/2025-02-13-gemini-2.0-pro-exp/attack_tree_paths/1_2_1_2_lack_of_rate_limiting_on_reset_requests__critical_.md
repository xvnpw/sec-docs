## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.1.2

### 2.1 Vulnerability Analysis

**Attack Scenarios:**

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker sends a massive number of password reset requests for various usernames (valid or invalid). This overwhelms the application's resources (CPU, memory, database connections, email server) and prevents legitimate users from accessing the service or resetting their passwords.  The email server, in particular, is a likely bottleneck.
2.  **Reset Token Brute-Forcing:** If the reset tokens generated by `mamaral/onboard` (or the application) are predictable or have low entropy, an attacker could send numerous reset requests for a specific user, hoping to guess a valid token before it expires.  This would allow them to take over the user's account.
3.  **Account Enumeration:** Even if the reset tokens are strong, an attacker might be able to use the reset request endpoint to determine if a specific username or email address exists in the system.  This is because the application might respond differently for valid vs. invalid accounts (e.g., "Reset email sent" vs. "User not found").  This information can be used for targeted phishing attacks or other social engineering attempts.
4.  **Spam/Abuse:**  The attacker could use the reset functionality to send unwanted emails to legitimate users, potentially damaging the application's reputation or causing users to mark the emails as spam.

**Technical Root Cause:**

The primary root cause is the *absence of a mechanism to limit the number of password reset requests* that can be made within a specific timeframe, either:

*   **Per IP Address:**  The application doesn't track and limit the number of requests originating from a single IP address.
*   **Per User Account:** The application doesn't track and limit the number of reset requests for a specific user account.
*   **Globally:**  The application doesn't have an overall limit on the total number of reset requests it will process.

**Likelihood and Impact (Re-evaluation):**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Rate limiting is a crucial security control that is often overlooked or implemented inadequately.  The ease of automating this attack makes it more likely.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High.  A successful DoS attack can disrupt the application's availability, while a successful brute-force attack can lead to account compromise.  Account enumeration can facilitate further attacks.

### 2.2 Testing and Validation

**Manual Testing:**

1.  **Rapid Requests:**  Manually attempt to request password resets for the same user account multiple times in quick succession (e.g., 10 requests within 1 minute).  Observe the application's behavior.  Does it allow all requests?  Does it send multiple emails?
2.  **Different IP Addresses:**  If possible, repeat the test from different IP addresses (e.g., using a VPN or proxy) to see if IP-based rate limiting is in place.
3.  **Valid vs. Invalid Users:**  Test with both valid and invalid usernames/email addresses to check for account enumeration vulnerabilities.  Observe the response messages and timing.

**Automated Testing (Burp Suite Example):**

1.  **Capture a Reset Request:**  Use Burp Suite's proxy to capture a legitimate password reset request.
2.  **Send to Intruder:**  Right-click the captured request and select "Send to Intruder."
3.  **Configure Intruder:**
    *   **Positions:**  Clear any default payload positions.  If testing for account enumeration, you might add a payload position for the username/email field.
    *   **Payloads:**
        *   **Simple List:**  If testing for DoS, you can use a simple list with a single entry (the captured request).
        *   **Numbers:**  If testing for token brute-forcing, you might use a number range or a custom list of potential tokens.
        *   **Usernames/Emails:** If testing for account enumeration, use a list of usernames or email addresses.
    *   **Options:**
        *   **Request Engine:**  Set the number of threads (start with a low number, e.g., 5, and gradually increase).  Set a delay between requests (e.g., 100ms).
        *   **Grep - Match:**  Configure Burp to highlight responses that contain specific keywords (e.g., "Reset email sent," "User not found," "Too many requests").
4.  **Start Attack:**  Start the Intruder attack and monitor the results.  Observe the response codes, response times, and any error messages.

**Expected Results (Without Mitigation):**

*   The application will likely process all or most of the reset requests without any errors.
*   Multiple reset emails will be sent to the target email address (if the user exists).
*   The application's performance might degrade under heavy load.
*   If testing for account enumeration, you might observe different responses for valid and invalid users.

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Development

**Short-Term Mitigations (Immediate Fixes):**

1.  **IP-Based Rate Limiting (Middleware):** Implement a middleware that tracks the number of reset requests per IP address within a sliding time window (e.g., 5 requests per 10 minutes).  If the limit is exceeded, return a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code.  This is the *most crucial* short-term mitigation.  Libraries like `express-rate-limit` (for Node.js) or similar packages for other languages can be used.
    *   **Example (Node.js with `express-rate-limit`):**

    ```javascript
    const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

    const resetLimiter = rateLimit({
      windowMs: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
      max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
      message: 'Too many password reset requests from this IP, please try again later.',
      keyGenerator: (req) => {
        return req.ip; // Use IP address as the key
      },
      handler: (req, res, next) => {
          // Log the rate limit event
          console.warn(`Rate limit exceeded for password reset from IP: ${req.ip}`);
          res.status(429).send(resetLimiter.message);
      }
    });

    // Apply the middleware to the reset password route
    app.post('/reset-password', resetLimiter, resetPasswordController);
    ```

2.  **User-Based Rate Limiting (Database/Cache):**  Store a timestamp and counter for each user's reset requests in the database or a cache (e.g., Redis).  Increment the counter with each request and check if the limit has been exceeded within the time window.  This is important to prevent targeted attacks against specific accounts.
    *   **Example (Conceptual - Database):**

    ```sql
    -- Table: user_reset_attempts
    -- Columns: user_id, attempt_count, last_attempt_time

    -- On reset request:
    UPDATE user_reset_attempts
    SET attempt_count = attempt_count + 1, last_attempt_time = NOW()
    WHERE user_id = ? AND last_attempt_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';

    -- Check if limit exceeded:
    SELECT attempt_count
    FROM user_reset_attempts
    WHERE user_id = ? AND last_attempt_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';

    -- If attempt_count > 5, reject the request.
    ```

3.  **CAPTCHA:**  Add a CAPTCHA (e.g., reCAPTCHA) to the password reset form.  This helps prevent automated attacks, but it can negatively impact user experience.  Use it as a *secondary* measure, *in addition to* rate limiting, not as a replacement.

**Long-Term Mitigations (Robust Solutions):**

1.  **Token Expiration and Uniqueness:** Ensure that reset tokens have a short expiration time (e.g., 30 minutes) and are cryptographically strong (high entropy).  Use a secure random number generator (e.g., `crypto.randomBytes` in Node.js) to generate tokens.  Store tokens securely (e.g., hashed) in the database.
    * **Example (Node.js token generation):**
    ```javascript
    const crypto = require('crypto');

    function generateResetToken() {
      return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'); // 32 bytes = 256 bits of entropy
    }
    ```

2.  **Email Rate Limiting (Separate Service):**  Implement rate limiting at the email sending level.  This can be done using a dedicated email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) that provides built-in rate limiting features, or by implementing a custom solution that queues and throttles email sending.

3.  **Account Lockout (After Multiple Failed Attempts):**  After a certain number of failed reset attempts (e.g., 5 within an hour), temporarily lock the user's account and require additional verification (e.g., email confirmation, security questions) to unlock it.  This prevents brute-force attacks against the reset tokens.

4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring to track the rate of password reset requests and trigger alerts if unusual activity is detected (e.g., a sudden spike in requests).  This allows for proactive response to potential attacks.

5.  **Honeypot Field:** Add a hidden field to the reset form that should *not* be filled in by legitimate users.  If the field is filled, it indicates a bot and the request can be silently ignored or rejected.

6. **Review and potentially modify `mamaral/onboard`:**
    * Examine how `mamaral/onboard` generates tokens. If they are predictable, consider overriding the token generation logic with a more secure method.
    * Investigate if `mamaral/onboard` provides any hooks or configuration options for implementing rate limiting. If not, consider submitting a feature request or contributing a pull request to the library.
    * If necessary, fork the library and implement the necessary rate-limiting features directly.

### 2.4 Remediation Verification

After implementing the mitigations, repeat the manual and automated tests described in Section 2.2.  The expected results should now be:

*   **Rate Limiting:**  The application should reject requests that exceed the defined rate limits (IP-based and user-based).  A `429 Too Many Requests` status code should be returned.
*   **Token Security:**  It should be computationally infeasible to brute-force reset tokens within their expiration time.
*   **Account Enumeration:**  The application should respond consistently for both valid and invalid users, preventing account enumeration.
* **DoS Prevention:** The application should remain responsive even under a high volume of reset requests (within reasonable limits).

## 3. Conclusion

The "Lack of Rate Limiting on Reset Requests" vulnerability is a serious security flaw that can lead to denial of service, account compromise, and other attacks.  By implementing a combination of short-term and long-term mitigations, including IP-based and user-based rate limiting, strong token generation, and email throttling, the vulnerability can be effectively addressed.  Regular security testing and monitoring are crucial to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of these mitigations.  The `mamaral/onboard` library should be carefully reviewed and potentially modified to ensure it supports these security best practices.
