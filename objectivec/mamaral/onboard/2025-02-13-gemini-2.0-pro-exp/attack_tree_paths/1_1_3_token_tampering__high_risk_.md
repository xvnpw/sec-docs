Okay, let's dive deep into analyzing the "Token Tampering" attack path within the context of an application using the `mamaral/onboard` library.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.3 Token Tampering

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, and mitigation strategies related to token tampering within an application leveraging the `mamaral/onboard` library for user onboarding and authentication.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses in how tokens are generated, handled, stored, and validated, and to propose concrete steps to enhance the application's security posture against this threat.  The ultimate goal is to prevent unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and data breaches stemming from manipulated tokens.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the `1.1.3 Token Tampering` attack path.  This encompasses:

*   **Token Generation:** How `mamaral/onboard` (and any integrated libraries or custom code) generates tokens (e.g., JWTs, opaque tokens).  This includes the algorithms used, key management practices, and the inclusion of necessary claims (e.g., user ID, roles, expiration).
*   **Token Handling:** How the application transmits tokens between the client (e.g., browser, mobile app) and the server.  This includes the use of HTTP headers (e.g., `Authorization`), cookies, and any custom transport mechanisms.
*   **Token Storage:** Where and how tokens are stored on both the client-side and server-side (if applicable).  This includes considerations for browser storage (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, cookies), mobile app storage, and server-side databases or caches.
*   **Token Validation:** How the application verifies the authenticity and integrity of tokens upon receipt.  This includes signature verification, expiration checks, audience checks, issuer checks, and any custom validation logic.
*   **Token Revocation:** How the application handles token invalidation or revocation, particularly in scenarios like user logout, password changes, or detected suspicious activity.  This is crucial for limiting the window of opportunity for an attacker using a compromised token.
*   **Dependencies:**  The security of any third-party libraries used by `mamaral/onboard` or the application itself that are involved in token handling.  Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited for token tampering.
* **Integration with the application:** How the application uses the tokens generated by `mamaral/onboard`.

**Methodology:**

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the `mamaral/onboard` library's source code, focusing on the token-related functionalities.  We will also review the application's code that integrates with `mamaral/onboard` to identify any custom token handling logic.
2.  **Static Analysis:**  Using static analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the code, such as insecure cryptographic practices, improper input validation, and potential injection flaws.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis:**  Testing the running application with various inputs and scenarios to observe its behavior and identify vulnerabilities that might not be apparent during static analysis.  This includes attempting to tamper with tokens and observing the application's response.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Considering various attacker profiles and their potential motivations and capabilities to identify likely attack vectors and prioritize mitigation efforts.
5.  **Security Best Practices Review:**  Comparing the implementation against established security best practices for token-based authentication, such as those outlined by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project).
6.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Checking for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of `mamaral/onboard` and the application itself using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated vulnerability scanners.
7. **Documentation Review:** Examining the documentation of `mamaral/onboard` for any security recommendations or warnings.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.3 Token Tampering

Given the "Token Tampering" attack path, we'll break down the analysis into specific areas of concern, potential attack vectors, and corresponding mitigation strategies.

**2.1. Token Generation Weaknesses**

*   **Weak Cryptographic Algorithms:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If `mamaral/onboard` or the application uses weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1 for signing; weak symmetric encryption) to generate tokens, an attacker could potentially forge valid tokens or crack existing ones.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Ensure the use of strong, industry-standard algorithms.  For JWTs, this means using at least `HS256` (HMAC with SHA-256) or preferably `RS256` (RSA with SHA-256) or `ES256` (ECDSA with SHA-256).
        *   Regularly review and update cryptographic algorithms as new vulnerabilities are discovered.
        *   Use a well-vetted cryptographic library rather than implementing custom cryptography.
*   **Insufficient Entropy:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the secret key used for signing tokens is generated with insufficient entropy (randomness), it might be predictable or guessable, allowing an attacker to forge tokens.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate secret keys.
        *   Ensure the secret key is of sufficient length (e.g., at least 256 bits for symmetric algorithms, 2048 bits for RSA).
        *   Store secret keys securely, outside of the codebase (e.g., using environment variables, a secrets management service).
*   **Predictable Token Structure:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  If the token structure is easily predictable (e.g., sequential IDs, easily guessable timestamps), an attacker might be able to generate valid tokens without knowing the secret key.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use UUIDs or other cryptographically random values for token IDs.
        *   Avoid including easily guessable information in the token payload.
        *   Consider using opaque tokens instead of JWTs if the token payload doesn't need to be readable by the client.
* **Missing or Incorrect Claims:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If crucial claims like `exp` (expiration), `aud` (audience), `iss` (issuer), or `nbf` (not before) are missing or improperly configured, the token's validity window might be too broad, or it might be accepted by unintended recipients.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Always include `exp` to limit the token's lifetime.
        *   Use `aud` to specify the intended recipient(s) of the token.
        *   Use `iss` to identify the token issuer.
        *   Use `nbf` to prevent the token from being used before a specific time.
        *   Validate all claims on the server-side.

**2.2. Token Handling Vulnerabilities**

*   **Transmission over Unencrypted Channels:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If tokens are transmitted over HTTP (instead of HTTPS), an attacker could intercept them using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Always use HTTPS for all communication between the client and the server.
        *   Enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to prevent downgrade attacks.
*   **Improper Token Storage (Client-Side):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Storing tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` makes them vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the application, they can steal the token.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use HTTP-only, secure cookies to store tokens.  HTTP-only cookies are inaccessible to JavaScript, mitigating XSS risks.  Secure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
        *   Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax` to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Improper Token Storage (Server-Side):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If tokens are stored in a database or cache without proper security measures, they could be compromised if the server is breached.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   If storing tokens server-side is necessary (e.g., for revocation), encrypt them at rest.
        *   Implement strong access controls to limit access to the token storage.
        *   Regularly audit and monitor access to the token storage.
* **Token Leakage in Logs or Error Messages:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If tokens are accidentally logged or included in error messages, they could be exposed to unauthorized individuals.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Sanitize logs and error messages to remove sensitive information, including tokens.
        *   Implement robust logging and monitoring practices.

**2.3. Token Validation Deficiencies**

*   **Missing or Incomplete Signature Verification:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the server doesn't properly verify the token's signature, an attacker could tamper with the token's payload and create a seemingly valid token.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Always verify the token's signature using the correct secret key or public key.
        *   Use a well-vetted JWT library to handle signature verification.
        *   Reject tokens with invalid signatures.
*   **Ignoring Expiration Checks:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the server doesn't check the `exp` claim, an attacker could use an expired token indefinitely.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Always check the `exp` claim and reject expired tokens.
        *   Consider implementing a short token lifetime and using refresh tokens for longer-lived sessions.
*   **Missing Audience/Issuer Checks:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the server doesn't check the `aud` or `iss` claims, it might accept tokens intended for a different application or issued by a different entity.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Always check the `aud` and `iss` claims and reject tokens that don't match the expected values.
* **Algorithm Confusion:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker might try to change the algorithm specified in the JWT header (e.g., from `RS256` to `HS256`) and then sign the token with the public key (which is often publicly available) as if it were the secret key.  If the server doesn't properly validate the algorithm, it might accept this forged token.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Explicitly specify the allowed algorithms on the server-side and reject tokens that use a different algorithm.
        *   If using asymmetric algorithms (like `RS256`), ensure the server only uses the public key for verification and never treats it as a secret key.

**2.4. Token Revocation Issues**

*   **Lack of Revocation Mechanism:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If there's no way to revoke tokens, a compromised token can be used until it expires, even if the user logs out or changes their password.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement a token revocation mechanism, such as a blacklist or a whitelist of valid tokens.
        *   Consider using short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens.  When a user logs out, the refresh token can be revoked, preventing the generation of new access tokens.
*   **Inefficient Revocation Implementation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the revocation mechanism is slow or inefficient, there might be a significant delay between the revocation request and the actual invalidation of the token.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a fast and scalable data store for the revocation list (e.g., Redis).
        *   Ensure the revocation check is performed on every request that requires authentication.

**2.5. Dependency Vulnerabilities**

*   **Vulnerable JWT Library:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the JWT library used by `mamaral/onboard` or the application has known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to forge or tamper with tokens.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly update all dependencies, including the JWT library, to the latest versions.
        *   Use a dependency vulnerability scanner to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a well-vetted and actively maintained JWT library.

**2.6. Integration with the Application**

* **Over-reliance on Client-Side Validation:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application relies solely on client-side validation of the token, an attacker can bypass this validation and send manipulated tokens directly to the server.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Always perform server-side validation of the token, regardless of any client-side checks.  Client-side validation can improve the user experience, but it should never be the sole security mechanism.
* **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Even with a valid token, the application might not properly enforce authorization rules.  An attacker could tamper with the token's payload to gain access to resources or functionalities they shouldn't have access to.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks on the server-side, based on the user's roles and permissions.
        *   Use a principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum necessary access.
* **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Token Payload:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the token payload contains sensitive information (e.g., passwords, PII), this information could be exposed if the token is intercepted or stolen.
    * **Mitigation:**
        *   Avoid including sensitive information in the token payload.
        *   If sensitive information must be included, encrypt it before adding it to the token.
