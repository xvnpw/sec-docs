# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Input Validation and Sanitization (for `onboard` Configuration and User Input within `onboard` Flows)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_input_validation_and_sanitization__for__onboard__configuration_and_user_input_within__onboard_1a26ca38.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Schema Definition (for `onboard` Configuration):** Create a strict schema (JSON Schema, YAML Schema, etc.) that defines the *exact* structure and allowed data types for the `onboard` *configuration file*. This is crucial because the configuration file *dictates the behavior of `onboard`*. The schema should specify:
    *   Required fields within the configuration.
    *   Allowed values for each field (e.g., regular expressions for email formats, allowed step types).
    *   Data type constraints (string, number, boolean, array, object) for each field.
    *   Allowed properties for custom steps or components, if `onboard` supports them.
2.  **Schema Validation (of `onboard` Configuration):** Integrate a schema validation library into your application. *Before* `onboard` processes its configuration, the validator must check the configuration file against the defined schema. If the configuration is invalid (doesn't match the schema), the application *must reject it* and log a detailed error. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious configurations.
3.  **Input Sanitization (within `onboard` Flows):** For any user-provided input *collected within the `onboard` flow itself* (e.g., form fields presented by `onboard`), sanitize the input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters. Use a well-vetted sanitization library appropriate for the context (HTML, text, etc.). This is distinct from general input sanitization; it's specifically for input *handled by `onboard`*.
4.  **Custom Validation Function Sandboxing (if `onboard` supports them):** If `onboard` allows defining custom validation functions *within its configuration*, run these functions in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Web Worker in JavaScript) to isolate them from the main application context. This prevents malicious code within a custom `onboard` validation function from accessing sensitive data or manipulating the DOM outside of `onboard`'s intended scope.
5. **Custom Validation Function Auditing (if `onboard` supports them):** Manually review the code of all custom validation functions *defined within the `onboard` configuration* for potential vulnerabilities. This is a critical step, as these functions are part of the `onboard` flow's logic.
6. **Custom Validation Function Rate Limiting (if `onboard` supports them):** Implement rate limiting for custom validation functions *used by `onboard`* to prevent attackers from using them for denial-of-service. This limits the execution frequency of these `onboard`-specific functions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Configuration Injection (Severity: High):** Attackers could inject malicious code or unexpected data types *into the `onboard` configuration file itself*, potentially hijacking the entire onboarding flow, altering its logic, or gaining control of how `onboard` interacts with the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code into user input fields *presented by `onboard`*, which could then be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This is specific to XSS vulnerabilities *within the `onboard` flow*.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Attackers could use custom validation functions *within `onboard`* or malformed input *to `onboard`* to trigger computationally expensive operations.
*   **Bypassing Onboarding Steps (Severity: Medium):** Attackers could manipulate input *provided to `onboard`* to bypass required steps in the onboarding flow defined by `onboard`.

**Impact:**
*   **Configuration Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with proper schema validation and enforcement of the `onboard` configuration).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Risk reduced from High to Low (with proper input sanitization of data *handled by `onboard`*).
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with rate limiting and sandboxing of custom validation functions *within `onboard`*).
*   **Bypassing Onboarding Steps:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with robust input validation and server-side state validation, specifically validating the state transitions *managed by `onboard`*).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Schema validation for the `onboard` configuration file is implemented using `jsonschema`. Input sanitization for `onboard`-collected data is partially implemented.
*   *(Fill this in based on your project.)*

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* Sandboxing of custom validation functions (if used within `onboard`) is not implemented. The input sanitization function for `onboard` data needs to be reviewed and potentially replaced.
*   *(Fill this in based on your project.)*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure State Management (Specifically for `onboard`'s State)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_state_management__specifically_for__onboard_'s_state_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Server-Side State Validation (of `onboard`'s State):** Do *not* rely solely on client-side state *managed by `onboard`* to track the user's progress. The client-side state is easily manipulated. Maintain a parallel state on the server and validate *each step transition managed by `onboard`* against the server-side state. This prevents attackers from manipulating `onboard`'s flow.
2.  **Signed/Encrypted Client-Side State (if `onboard` stores state client-side):** If `onboard` *itself* stores any state on the client-side (e.g., in cookies or local storage), ensure that this `onboard`-managed state is:
    *   **Signed:** Use a cryptographic signature (e.g., HMAC) to prevent tampering with the `onboard`-specific state.
    *   **Encrypted:** If the `onboard`-managed state contains sensitive information, encrypt it.
3.  **Short-Lived State (for `onboard`'s identifiers):** If `onboard` uses any internal tokens or identifiers to track progress, ensure these are short-lived. This minimizes the window of opportunity for attackers to misuse them.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **State Manipulation (within `onboard`) (Severity: High):** Attackers could manipulate the client-side state *managed by `onboard`* to bypass steps, replay steps, or inject invalid data, potentially gaining unauthorized access or corrupting data *by interfering with the `onboard` flow*.
*   **Bypassing `onboard` Logic (Severity: High):** Directly related to state manipulation, attackers could circumvent the intended flow and logic defined within `onboard`.

**Impact:**
*   **State Manipulation (within `onboard`):** Risk reduced from High to Low (with server-side validation of *`onboard`'s state transitions* and signed/encrypted client-side state *if `onboard` uses it*).
* **Bypassing `onboard` Logic:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Server-side validation of `onboard`'s state transitions is partially implemented.
*   *(Fill this in based on your project.)*

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* Client-side state used by `onboard` is not signed or encrypted. Server-side validation is incomplete and doesn't cover all `onboard` steps.
*   *(Fill this in based on your project.)*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conditional Logic and Template Review (within `onboard`'s Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/conditional_logic_and_template_review__within__onboard_'s_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Conditional Logic Review:** If `onboard` uses any form of conditional branching or dynamic step generation *within its configuration*, meticulously review the logic. Ensure there are no unintended paths or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by manipulating input data *passed to `onboard`*. Look for:
    *   Logic flaws that allow skipping steps.
    *   Conditions that can be manipulated to reveal hidden steps or data.
    *   Conditions that lead to unexpected or insecure states.
2. **Template Injection Prevention:** If `onboard` uses any templating system *to render content within the onboarding flow*, ensure that user input *passed to `onboard`* is properly escaped or sanitized to prevent template injection attacks. This is crucial if `onboard` allows dynamic content generation based on user input. Use a templating engine with built-in auto-escaping features, and thoroughly test for injection vulnerabilities.
3. **External Service Interaction Review (if configured within `onboard`):** If `onboard` is configured to interact with external services (e.g., for email verification), ensure that these integrations are secure *within the `onboard` configuration*.  Verify that:
    * API keys are not exposed in the `onboard` configuration (use environment variables or a secure configuration management system).
    * Responses from external services are validated *before being used by `onboard`*.
    * Appropriate error handling is in place for failures in external service interactions *within the `onboard` flow*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Logic Flaws (within `onboard`) (Severity: High):**  Errors in `onboard`'s conditional logic could allow attackers to bypass security checks or access unauthorized features.
*   **Template Injection (within `onboard`) (Severity: High):**  If `onboard` uses templates, attackers could inject malicious code into the templates, leading to XSS or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Insecure External Service Interactions (configured via `onboard`) (Severity: Medium to High):**  Vulnerabilities in how `onboard` interacts with external services could be exploited.

**Impact:**
*   **Logic Flaws (within `onboard`):** Risk reduced from High to Low (with thorough review and testing of `onboard`'s conditional logic).
*   **Template Injection (within `onboard`):** Risk reduced from High to Low (with proper escaping and sanitization in `onboard`'s templating).
*   **Insecure External Service Interactions (configured via `onboard`):** Risk reduced from Medium/High to Low (with secure configuration and validation of external service interactions *within `onboard`*).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Basic review of `onboard`'s conditional logic has been performed.
*   *(Fill this in based on your project.)*

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:*  Template injection prevention is not fully implemented for `onboard`'s dynamic content. External service interactions within `onboard` need a security review.
*   *(Fill this in based on your project.)*
