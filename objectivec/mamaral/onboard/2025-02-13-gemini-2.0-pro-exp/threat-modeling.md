# Threat Model Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Threat: [Session Hijacking during Onboarding](./threats/session_hijacking_during_onboarding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or guesses the session token used by `onboard` to track the user's progress through the multi-step onboarding process.  This token might be stored in a cookie, local storage, or passed as a URL parameter.  If the token is predictable or weakly protected *by the onboard library itself*, the attacker can take over the onboarding session.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can complete the onboarding process on behalf of the legitimate user, potentially setting a password they control or associating the account with their own email address.
*   **Affected Component:**  `sessionManagement` module (or a similar component responsible for handling user sessions during onboarding).  This likely involves functions for generating, validating, and storing session tokens *within onboard*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Library:** `onboard` *must* use cryptographically secure random tokens for session identifiers.  Avoid predictable patterns.
    *   **Library:** `onboard` should provide secure storage options for session tokens.  If using cookies, it should *recommend* or *enforce* setting the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags. If using local storage, `onboard` should document the security implications.
    *   **Library/Frontend (Integration):** Developers integrating `onboard` must ensure they are using the library's session management features correctly and securely.

## Threat: [Bypassing Email Verification (Due to `onboard` Logic Flaw)](./threats/bypassing_email_verification__due_to__onboard__logic_flaw_.md)

*   **Description:** A flaw in `onboard`'s internal logic allows an attacker to manipulate the client-side code or API calls to bypass the email verification step *without* directly exploiting a backend vulnerability.  This implies a failure in `onboard`'s state management or control flow.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can create accounts with unverified email addresses, which can be used for spam, abuse, or impersonation.
*   **Affected Component:**  `accountCreation` module and `emailVerification` module (specifically, the interaction and state management *within onboard*).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Library:** `onboard`'s code must be thoroughly reviewed and tested to ensure that the email verification step cannot be bypassed through client-side manipulation.  State transitions should be carefully controlled.
    *   **Library:** `onboard` should provide clear documentation and examples on how to securely integrate the email verification flow with the backend.
    *   **Library/Frontend (Integration):** Developers integrating `onboard` must follow the library's documentation and best practices to ensure the email verification step is correctly implemented.

## Threat: [Password Reset Token Brute-Forcing (Due to Weak `onboard` Token Generation)](./threats/password_reset_token_brute-forcing__due_to_weak__onboard__token_generation_.md)

*   **Description:** If `onboard` itself is responsible for generating password reset tokens, and it uses a weak algorithm or insufficient entropy, an attacker can attempt to guess the token sent to a user's email address.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains full control of the user's account.
*   **Affected Component:**  `passwordReset` module (specifically, the function responsible for generating password reset tokens *within onboard*).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Library:** `onboard` *must* use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate password reset tokens.  The tokens *must* be long enough to prevent brute-force attacks (e.g., at least 128 bits of entropy).
    *   **Library:** `onboard` should provide configuration options to control the length and format of password reset tokens.
    *   **Library/Frontend (Integration):** Developers integrating `onboard` should ensure they are using the library's recommended settings for token generation.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of API Keys/Secrets (within `onboard`)](./threats/improper_handling_of_api_keyssecrets__within__onboard__.md)

*   **Description:** If `onboard` *itself* requires API keys or secrets to communicate with third-party services (e.g., email providers, *and* `onboard` handles these directly), and these are hardcoded into the client-side JavaScript or improperly managed *by onboard*, they can be exposed.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can use the exposed keys to access the third-party services, potentially sending spam, incurring costs, or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Affected Component:** Any module *within onboard* that interacts with external services (e.g., `emailVerification`, `socialLogin` - if implemented *and* if `onboard` manages the credentials directly).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Library:** `onboard` should *never* hardcode secrets in client-side code.
    *   **Library:** `onboard` should provide a secure mechanism for developers to provide API keys and secrets, *without* exposing them in the client-side code. This might involve using a configuration object that is passed to `onboard` during initialization, but *not* stored in a way that is accessible to the browser.  Ideally, `onboard` should *not* handle third-party credentials directly, but instead rely on the backend to act as a proxy.
    *   **Library/Frontend (Integration):** Developers integrating `onboard` must follow the library's documentation and best practices for handling API keys and secrets.
