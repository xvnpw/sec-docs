Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Password Reset Token Brute-Forcing" threat, focusing on the `onboard` library:

## Deep Analysis: Password Reset Token Brute-Forcing in `onboard`

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to determine the vulnerability of the `onboard` library (specifically its password reset token generation mechanism) to brute-force attacks.  We aim to identify weaknesses in the token generation process that could allow an attacker to predict or guess valid reset tokens.  The analysis will inform specific recommendations for improving the library's security.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `passwordReset` module within the `onboard` library (https://github.com/mamaral/onboard).  We will examine:

*   The source code of the token generation function within `onboard`.
*   Any configuration options related to token length, character set, and generation algorithm.
*   The library's documentation regarding secure token generation practices.
*   Any dependencies used by `onboard` that are involved in the token generation process.

We *will not* analyze:

*   The application's implementation *using* `onboard` (unless directly relevant to how `onboard` generates tokens).  This is the responsibility of the application developers.
*   Other aspects of the `onboard` library unrelated to password reset token generation.
*   Network-level attacks or email interception (these are outside the scope of the library itself).

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a static analysis of the `onboard` source code, focusing on the `passwordReset` module.  We will identify the specific function(s) responsible for generating reset tokens and analyze the algorithm used.  We will pay close attention to:
    *   The source of randomness (e.g., `Math.random()`, a CSPRNG like `crypto.randomBytes()` in Node.js, or `/dev/urandom` on Linux).
    *   The length of the generated token.
    *   The character set used in the token (e.g., alphanumeric, hexadecimal, etc.).
    *   Any potential biases or predictability in the token generation process.

2.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will identify any dependencies used by `onboard` for random number generation or token formatting.  We will assess the security of these dependencies, looking for known vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

3.  **Documentation Review:** We will examine the `onboard` documentation for any guidance or recommendations related to password reset token security.  We will check if the documentation clearly states the expected token length, entropy, and generation method.

4.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will identify any configuration options provided by `onboard` that allow developers to customize the token generation process.  We will assess whether these options allow for secure configurations and if the default settings are secure.

5.  **Entropy Calculation:** We will calculate the theoretical entropy of the generated tokens based on the observed length and character set.  This will help us determine the resistance to brute-force attacks.

6.  **Proof-of-Concept (Optional):** If a potential weakness is identified, we may develop a limited proof-of-concept (PoC) to demonstrate the vulnerability *in a controlled environment*.  This PoC would *not* be used against any live systems.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

Based on the threat model and the methodology outlined above, here's a breakdown of the analysis:

**2.1. Code Review (Hypothetical Scenarios & Analysis):**

Since we don't have the actual `onboard` code in front of us, we'll analyze several hypothetical scenarios, representing different levels of security:

*   **Scenario 1:  `Math.random()` (Insecure)**

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical onboard code (INSECURE)
    function generateResetToken() {
      let token = '';
      const characters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';
      for (let i = 0; i < 16; i++) { // 16 characters
        token += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length));
      }
      return token;
    }
    ```

    *   **Analysis:** This is highly insecure. `Math.random()` is *not* cryptographically secure.  It's a predictable pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).  An attacker could potentially predict the sequence of numbers generated by `Math.random()`, especially if they can influence the seed or have access to other tokens generated around the same time.  The 16-character length is also insufficient.
    *   **Entropy:**  With a 62-character alphabet (A-Za-z0-9), a 16-character token has log2(62^16) â‰ˆ 95 bits of entropy.  However, because `Math.random()` is predictable, the *actual* entropy is much lower, making it vulnerable to brute-forcing.

*   **Scenario 2:  Short `crypto.randomBytes()` (Somewhat Secure, but Insufficient)**

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical onboard code (Node.js - Somewhat Secure, but Insufficient)
    const crypto = require('crypto');

    function generateResetToken() {
      return crypto.randomBytes(8).toString('hex'); // 8 bytes = 16 hex characters
    }
    ```

    *   **Analysis:** This is better because it uses `crypto.randomBytes()`, which is a CSPRNG in Node.js.  However, 8 bytes (resulting in a 16-character hexadecimal token) is still too short.
    *   **Entropy:** 8 bytes = 64 bits.  This is significantly better than Scenario 1, but still within the realm of feasibility for a determined attacker with sufficient resources.

*   **Scenario 3:  Long `crypto.randomBytes()` with Base64 (Secure)**

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical onboard code (Node.js - Secure)
    const crypto = require('crypto');

    function generateResetToken() {
      return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64'); // 32 bytes, Base64 encoded
    }
    ```

    *   **Analysis:** This is a secure approach.  `crypto.randomBytes()` provides strong randomness, and 32 bytes (256 bits) provides ample entropy.  Base64 encoding is a reasonable choice for representing the token.
    *   **Entropy:** 32 bytes = 256 bits.  This is considered highly secure against brute-force attacks.

*   **Scenario 4:  Configurable Length (Secure if Configured Properly)**

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical onboard code (Node.js - Secure if Configured Properly)
    const crypto = require('crypto');

    function generateResetToken(length = 32) { // Default to 32 bytes
      return crypto.randomBytes(length).toString('base64');
    }
    ```
    *   **Analysis:** This is secure *if* the default length is sufficiently long (e.g., 32 bytes) and *if* the documentation clearly recommends using a secure length.  The risk here is that developers might override the default with an insecure value.
    *   **Entropy:** Depends on the `length` parameter.  The default of 32 bytes provides 256 bits of entropy.

**2.2. Dependency Analysis:**

*   If `onboard` uses a third-party library for random number generation, we need to examine that library's security.  For example, if it uses an outdated or vulnerable version of a cryptography library, that would be a critical finding.
*   If `onboard` uses a library for encoding the token (e.g., a Base64 library), we need to ensure that library is not vulnerable to any known encoding-related attacks.

**2.3. Documentation Review:**

*   The `onboard` documentation *must* explicitly state the recommended token length and the importance of using a CSPRNG.
*   It should provide clear examples of secure token generation using the library.
*   It should warn against using insecure methods like `Math.random()`.
*   It should explain any configuration options related to token generation and their security implications.

**2.4. Configuration Analysis:**

*   If `onboard` provides configuration options for token length, character set, or generation algorithm, we need to ensure:
    *   The default values are secure.
    *   The options allow for secure configurations.
    *   The documentation clearly explains how to configure the library securely.
    *   There are no "hidden" or undocumented configuration options that could weaken security.

**2.5. Entropy Calculation:**

*   As demonstrated in the code review scenarios, we calculate entropy using the formula: `log2(character_set_size ^ token_length)`.
*   We need to consider the *effective* entropy, taking into account any predictability in the random number generator.

**2.6. Proof-of-Concept (Hypothetical):**

*   If we found that `onboard` used `Math.random()` and a short token length, we could create a PoC to demonstrate the vulnerability.  This PoC would:
    1.  Generate a large number of tokens using the same (hypothetical) `onboard` code.
    2.  Attempt to predict subsequent tokens based on the observed pattern.
    3.  Measure the success rate of the prediction.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we can refine the initial mitigation strategies:

*   **Library (Mandatory):** `onboard` *must* use a CSPRNG (e.g., `crypto.randomBytes()` in Node.js, `/dev/urandom` on Linux, or a well-vetted third-party library).
*   **Library (Mandatory):** The generated tokens *must* have at least 128 bits of entropy (e.g., 16 bytes of random data).  A length of 256 bits (32 bytes) is recommended.
*   **Library (Strongly Recommended):** `onboard` should provide configuration options to control the token length and, optionally, the character set.  The default values *must* be secure.
*   **Library (Mandatory):** The `onboard` documentation *must* clearly explain the security implications of token generation and provide guidance on secure configuration.
*   **Library/Frontend (Integration - Mandatory):** Developers integrating `onboard` *must* follow the library's documentation and use the recommended settings for token generation.  They should *not* override the default settings with insecure values.
*   **Library (Recommended):** Consider adding a "token complexity" check to the `onboard` library. This check could enforce minimum length and character set requirements, preventing developers from accidentally using weak configurations.
*   **Library (Recommended):** Implement rate limiting on password reset attempts *within the onboard library itself*. This would add an extra layer of defense against brute-force attacks, even if the token generation were somehow compromised. This rate limiting should be configurable.
*  **Library (Recommended):** Consider adding an option to use HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to further secure the token. The token could be generated as `HMAC(secret, user_id + timestamp)`. This makes it impossible to forge a token without knowing the secret, even if the random number generator is compromised.

### 4. Conclusion

This deep analysis provides a framework for evaluating the security of the `onboard` library's password reset token generation mechanism. By following the methodology and addressing the recommendations, the `onboard` library can be made significantly more resistant to brute-force attacks, protecting user accounts from unauthorized access. The key takeaway is the absolute necessity of using a CSPRNG and generating tokens with sufficient entropy. The library should also provide clear documentation and secure defaults to guide developers towards secure implementations.
