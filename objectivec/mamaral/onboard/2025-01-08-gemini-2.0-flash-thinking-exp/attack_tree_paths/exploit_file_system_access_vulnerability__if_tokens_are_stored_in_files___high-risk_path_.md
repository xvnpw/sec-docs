## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit File System Access Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in files) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This analysis delves into the specific attack path: **Exploit File System Access Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in files)**, focusing on its sub-steps and implications for the Onboard application. This path is flagged as **HIGH-RISK** due to the potential for complete account takeover and unauthorized data access.

**Context:** We are assuming Onboard, as a note-taking application, might store user authentication tokens in files on the server's file system. This is a common, albeit less secure, practice compared to database storage or dedicated token management systems.

**ATTACK TREE PATH BREAKDOWN:**

**High-Level Goal:** **Exploit File System Access Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in files)**

* **Risk Level:** High
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, access to all notes, potential for data manipulation or deletion, and potential for further lateral movement within the system if the server is compromised.
* **Likelihood (Assuming tokens are in files):** Moderate to High, depending on the implementation details and security awareness of the development team.

**Detailed Analysis of Sub-Steps:**

**1. Identify and Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in Onboard's File Handling:**

* **Description:** This is the primary attack vector. An attacker attempts to manipulate file paths provided to the application (e.g., through URL parameters, form inputs, or API calls) to access files outside the intended directories. This is often achieved by using special characters like `..` (dot-dot-slash) to navigate up the directory structure.
* **Mechanism:**
    * **Vulnerable Code:** The application might have code that constructs file paths based on user input without proper sanitization or validation. For example, a function that retrieves a file based on a user-provided filename could be vulnerable if the filename isn't checked for malicious characters.
    * **Example Attack:**  Imagine Onboard has a feature to download attachments. If the download path is constructed using user input like `/download?file=user_uploaded_file.txt`, an attacker could try `/download?file=../../../etc/passwd` or `/download?file=../../tokens/user_token.txt` (assuming tokens are stored in a `tokens` directory).
    * **Common Vulnerable Areas:** File upload/download functionalities, image processing, any feature that involves reading or writing files based on user input.
* **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, including potentially sensitive files like configuration files, database credentials, and, in this specific scenario, authentication tokens.
* **Likelihood:** Moderate to High. Path traversal vulnerabilities are a well-known and frequently found web application security issue. The likelihood depends on the developer's awareness of this vulnerability and the rigor of their input validation practices.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation on all user-provided file paths. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and file extensions instead of blacklisting.
    * **Canonicalization:** Resolve file paths to their canonical form to eliminate relative path components (`.`, `..`).
    * **Sandboxing/Chroot:** Restrict the application's access to only the necessary parts of the file system.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions.
    * **Secure File Handling Libraries:** Utilize well-vetted libraries for file operations that offer built-in security features.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**2. Exploit Insufficient File Permissions on Token Storage:**

* **Description:** This sub-step relies on the assumption that even if the attacker can reach the token files through path traversal, they need to have the necessary permissions to read them. If the token storage directory or the token files themselves have overly permissive permissions (e.g., world-readable), the attacker can directly access the token data.
* **Mechanism:**
    * **Misconfigured File System Permissions:** The operating system's file permission system (e.g., chmod on Linux) might be configured to allow unauthorized access. This could be due to oversight during deployment or insecure default configurations.
    * **Example Scenario:** If the `tokens` directory and the individual token files within it have permissions like `777` (read, write, and execute for all users), any user with access to the server (including a compromised web application) can read the tokens.
* **Impact:**  Significantly lowers the barrier to entry for attackers. Even if path traversal is complex, overly permissive permissions make accessing the tokens trivial.
* **Likelihood:** Moderate. While best practices dictate restrictive permissions, misconfigurations can occur, especially in simpler applications or during rapid development.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (File System Level):** Ensure that only the application user (or a dedicated user with minimal privileges) has read access to the token storage directory and files.
    * **Restrictive Permissions:**  Use appropriate file permissions (e.g., `700` for the directory, `600` for the files) to limit access to the owner.
    * **Regular Permission Checks:** Implement automated checks to ensure file and directory permissions remain secure.
    * **Secure Deployment Practices:** Include secure file permission configuration in deployment scripts and documentation.

**Interrelation of Sub-Steps:**

While the path traversal vulnerability allows the attacker to *locate* the token files, insufficient file permissions allow them to *read* the contents of those files. Both vulnerabilities can exist independently, but their combination creates a highly exploitable attack path. Even if path traversal is difficult, weak permissions make the tokens an easy target if the attacker can somehow guess or discover their location.

**Overall Risk Assessment of the Attack Path:**

* **Severity:** **Critical**. Successful exploitation leads to complete account takeover, which can have severe consequences for users and the application's reputation.
* **Likelihood:** **Moderate to High**, depending on the security practices employed during development and deployment. The presence of either path traversal or weak file permissions increases the likelihood, and their combination makes it significantly more probable.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Remediation:** This attack path should be considered a high priority for remediation.
* **Secure Token Storage:**
    * **Avoid Storing Tokens in Files:**  Explore more secure alternatives like storing tokens in a dedicated database, using secure session management, or employing a dedicated token management service.
    * **Encryption at Rest:** If file storage is unavoidable, encrypt the token files at rest using strong encryption algorithms and securely manage the encryption keys.
* **Implement Robust Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input, especially file paths.
* **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:**  Restrict file system permissions and application privileges to the bare minimum required for functionality.
* **Conduct Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Developer Training:** Educate developers on common web application vulnerabilities, including path traversal and insecure file handling.
* **Utilize Security Linters and Static Analysis Tools:**  Integrate tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect potential security flaws.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path exploiting file system access vulnerabilities to steal tokens is a significant security risk for Onboard. By understanding the mechanisms and potential impact of path traversal and insufficient file permissions, the development team can implement effective mitigation strategies to protect user accounts and data. Shifting away from file-based token storage is the most robust long-term solution, but in the interim, rigorous input validation and strict file permission management are crucial for mitigating this high-risk attack path.
