## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Token Retrieval/Display [HIGH-RISK PATH] for Onboard Application

This analysis delves into the "Exploit Vulnerabilities in Token Retrieval/Display" path within the attack tree for the Onboard application (https://github.com/mamaral/onboard). This path is marked as HIGH-RISK, indicating the potential for significant impact on the application's security and user data. We will break down each sub-path, analyzing the technical details, potential impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies.

**Overall Goal of the Attack Path:**

The attacker's primary objective in this path is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive tokens managed by the Onboard application. This could involve directly stealing the tokens or manipulating their display and retrieval to achieve malicious goals. Successful exploitation could lead to:

* **Complete compromise of managed resources:** Attackers can use stolen tokens to access systems and services protected by Onboard.
* **Data breaches:** Accessing sensitive data protected by the compromised tokens.
* **Reputational damage:** Loss of trust in the application and the organization using it.
* **Financial losses:**  Depending on the value of the protected resources.

**Detailed Analysis of Sub-Paths:**

**1. Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Onboard's HTTPS (Less likely if application uses HTTPS correctly):**

* **Description:** This attack involves an adversary positioning themselves between the user's browser and the Onboard server, intercepting the communication flow. The goal is to eavesdrop on the exchange and capture the tokens being transmitted.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Weak or improperly configured TLS/SSL on the Onboard server is the primary enabler. This could include:
        * **Using outdated TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0, 1.1):** These protocols have known vulnerabilities.
        * **Weak cipher suites:**  Using easily crackable encryption algorithms.
        * **Missing or incorrectly configured HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** HSTS forces browsers to always use HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks.
        * **Invalid or self-signed certificates without proper pinning mechanisms:**  Allows attackers to present their own certificate.
    * **Attack Execution:**
        * The attacker might use techniques like ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning to redirect the user's traffic through their machine.
        * They then present a seemingly valid SSL/TLS certificate to the user's browser, while simultaneously establishing a separate connection with the legitimate Onboard server.
        * All communication passes through the attacker's machine, allowing them to intercept and potentially modify data, including the tokens.
* **Impact:**
    * **Direct token theft:** The attacker gains access to the raw token values being transmitted.
    * **Session hijacking:** If session cookies are also intercepted, the attacker can impersonate the user.
* **Likelihood:**  Labeled as "Less likely if application uses HTTPS correctly," this highlights the importance of proper HTTPS implementation. However, complacency or misconfiguration can still make this a viable attack vector. Factors increasing likelihood:
    * **Internal network attacks:** Easier for attackers on the same network.
    * **Compromised Wi-Fi networks:** Public or poorly secured Wi-Fi can facilitate MITM attacks.
    * **Lack of awareness among users:** Users might ignore browser warnings about certificate issues.
* **Detection:**
    * **Network monitoring:** Detecting unusual traffic patterns or suspicious connections.
    * **Browser warnings:** Users might receive warnings about invalid or untrusted certificates.
    * **Security audits:** Regularly assessing the TLS configuration of the Onboard server.
* **Prevention:**
    * **Strong TLS configuration:** Using the latest TLS protocols (1.3 or higher), strong cipher suites, and ensuring proper certificate validation.
    * **Implementing HSTS:** Enforcing HTTPS usage and preventing downgrade attacks.
    * **Certificate pinning:**  Hardcoding or configuring the expected certificate for the Onboard server in the client application (if applicable).
    * **Educating users:**  Raising awareness about the risks of connecting to untrusted networks and ignoring browser warnings.
    * **Regular security assessments:**  Penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the HTTPS implementation.
* **Specific Considerations for Onboard:** The development team must ensure the server hosting Onboard is configured with a robust and up-to-date TLS setup. Consider using tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test to verify the configuration.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Onboard's Interface (leading to token theft):**

* **Description:** This attack involves injecting malicious scripts into the Onboard application's interface, which are then executed by other users' browsers. The attacker's goal is to manipulate the user's session and steal tokens.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output encoding within the Onboard application. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
    * **Attack Execution:** The attacker injects malicious scripts into areas where user-provided data is displayed without proper escaping. This can happen in various parts of the application.
* **Impact:**
    * **Token theft:** The injected script can access the user's session storage or cookies where tokens might be stored and send them to the attacker's server.
    * **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies allows the attacker to impersonate the logged-in user.
    * **Keylogging:** Capturing user keystrokes, potentially revealing login credentials or other sensitive information.
    * **Redirection to malicious sites:**  Redirecting users to phishing pages or sites hosting malware.
    * **Defacement of the application:**  Altering the appearance or functionality of the Onboard interface.
* **Likelihood:**  This is a significant risk if the development team doesn't prioritize secure coding practices. The likelihood depends on the extent of user-provided input and how it's handled.
* **Detection:**
    * **Code reviews:** Identifying areas where user input is not properly sanitized or encoded.
    * **Security testing (SAST/DAST):** Automated tools can detect potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Browser security features:** Content Security Policy (CSP) can help mitigate XSS attacks.
    * **User reports:** Users might report unexpected behavior or suspicious scripts.
* **Prevention:**
    * **Input sanitization:**  Cleaning user input to remove or neutralize potentially malicious characters before storing it.
    * **Output encoding:**  Escaping special characters when displaying user-provided data in the browser to prevent them from being interpreted as code.
    * **Using a Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Defining a policy that restricts the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    * **Framework-level protections:** Utilizing security features provided by the development framework to prevent XSS.
    * **Regular security training for developers:** Ensuring developers understand XSS vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.
* **Specific Considerations for Onboard:**  Identify all areas where user input is accepted and displayed, such as token names, descriptions, search fields, and any other customizable fields.

**2.1. Stored XSS in Token Descriptions or Names:**

* **Description:** This is a persistent form of XSS where the malicious script is stored directly within the Onboard database, specifically within the token descriptions or names. Every time a user views a token with the malicious description or name, the script is executed in their browser.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Lack of input validation and output encoding when saving and displaying token metadata (descriptions, names).
    * **Attack Execution:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (or by exploiting another vulnerability to gain those privileges) injects malicious JavaScript into the token description or name field. This script is then stored in the database. When other users view this token, the script is retrieved from the database and executed in their browsers.
* **Impact:**
    * **Widespread token theft:**  Any user viewing the compromised token will have their tokens potentially stolen.
    * **Persistent threat:** The malicious script remains active until the vulnerable data is cleaned.
    * **Account compromise:**  Stealing session cookies can lead to account takeover.
* **Likelihood:** High if input validation is weak for token metadata. This is a particularly dangerous vulnerability due to its persistent nature.
* **Detection:**
    * **Database scanning:**  Searching the database for suspicious script tags or encoded JavaScript within token descriptions and names.
    * **Manual review of token data:**  Inspecting token details for any unexpected or suspicious content.
    * **Monitoring for unusual activity:**  Detecting unexpected requests or data exfiltration originating from user sessions viewing specific tokens.
* **Prevention:**
    * **Strict input validation on token descriptions and names:**  Rejecting or sanitizing any input containing HTML tags or JavaScript.
    * **Output encoding when displaying token descriptions and names:**  Ensuring that any potentially malicious characters are escaped before being rendered in the browser.
    * **Regular security audits and penetration testing:**  Specifically targeting the token management features.
* **Specific Considerations for Onboard:**  The forms used to create and modify tokens are critical points of entry for this type of attack. Ensure robust validation and encoding are implemented here.

**2.2. Reflected XSS in Onboard's Search or Filter Functionality:**

* **Description:** This is a non-persistent form of XSS where the malicious script is injected through a URL parameter, such as a search query or filter value. When the server processes the request and includes the malicious script in the response, the user's browser executes it.
* **Technical Details:**
    * **Vulnerability:** The application reflects user input from the URL back into the HTML response without proper encoding.
    * **Attack Execution:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within a search query or filter parameter. They then trick a user into clicking on this link (e.g., through phishing or social engineering). When the user clicks the link, the Onboard server processes the request, includes the malicious script in the search results or filtered view, and sends the response back to the user's browser, where the script is executed.
* **Impact:**
    * **Targeted token theft:** The attacker can target specific users by sending them crafted links.
    * **Credential harvesting:**  The injected script can display fake login forms to steal user credentials.
    * **Redirection to malicious sites:**  Redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites.
* **Likelihood:** Moderate, depending on how search and filter functionality is implemented. Requires user interaction to click on the malicious link.
* **Detection:**
    * **Log analysis:**  Identifying suspicious URLs containing script-like patterns.
    * **User reports:** Users might report unexpected behavior after clicking on specific links.
    * **Security testing (DAST):**  Tools can identify reflected XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious payloads into URL parameters.
* **Prevention:**
    * **Avoid reflecting user input directly into the HTML response:**  If reflection is necessary, ensure proper output encoding.
    * **Use POST requests for sensitive actions:**  This makes it harder to craft malicious URLs.
    * **Implement robust input validation on search and filter parameters:**  Rejecting or sanitizing any input containing potentially malicious code.
    * **Educate users about the risks of clicking on untrusted links:**  Raising awareness about phishing attacks.
* **Specific Considerations for Onboard:**  Examine how search queries and filter values are handled and displayed. Ensure that any user-provided data in these areas is properly encoded before being rendered.
