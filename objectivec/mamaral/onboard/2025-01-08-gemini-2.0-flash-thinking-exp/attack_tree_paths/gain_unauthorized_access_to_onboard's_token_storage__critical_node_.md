## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Unauthorized Access to Onboard's Token Storage

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path focusing on gaining unauthorized access to Onboard's token storage. As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, my goal is to dissect the potential vulnerabilities and offer actionable mitigation strategies.

**CRITICAL NODE: Gain Unauthorized Access to Onboard's Token Storage**

**Description:** This is the most critical point of failure. Successful exploitation of this node grants the attacker complete control over all API tokens managed by Onboard. This effectively bypasses all intended authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing the attacker to impersonate any user or service interacting with Onboard. The impact is catastrophic, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and reputational damage.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood of this node being successfully exploited depends heavily on the security measures implemented around token storage. If proper security practices are not followed, this node becomes a prime target for attackers.

**Impact:**

* **Complete Compromise of API Tokens:**  All tokens are exposed, allowing attackers to impersonate any user or service.
* **Data Breaches:** Attackers can use the tokens to access sensitive data protected by the onboard application.
* **Service Disruption:** Attackers can revoke tokens, modify configurations, or disrupt the functionality of services relying on Onboard.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack of this nature can severely damage the trust in the onboard application and the organization using it.
* **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the data managed by Onboard, this breach could lead to significant regulatory penalties.

**Detailed Analysis of High-Risk Paths:**

**1. Exploit File System Access Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in files) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

**Description:** This path assumes Onboard stores API tokens in files on the server's file system. The attacker aims to leverage vulnerabilities that allow them to read these files without proper authorization.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood depends on how Onboard handles file paths and permissions. If not implemented carefully, these vulnerabilities are common.

**Impact:** Direct access to token files exposes all stored tokens.

**1.1. Identify and Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in Onboard's File Handling:**

**Description:**  Path traversal (also known as directory traversal) occurs when an application allows user-controlled input to construct file paths without proper sanitization. An attacker can manipulate these inputs (e.g., using "../") to access files and directories outside the intended scope, including those containing token data.

**Technical Details:**

* **Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual):** Imagine Onboard has a feature to download configuration files where the filename is taken from user input: `file_path = "/config/" + user_input + ".conf"`. An attacker could provide `user_input = "../../token_storage/tokens"` to access files outside the `/config/` directory.
* **Exploitation Methods:**
    * **Web Interface:** Manipulating URL parameters or form fields.
    * **API Endpoints:**  Crafting malicious requests to API endpoints that handle file paths.
    * **Command Injection (Indirect):**  If Onboard uses user input to construct commands that interact with the file system, path traversal can be a component of a command injection attack.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Avoid User-Controlled File Paths:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly using user input to construct file paths. Instead, use predefined identifiers and map them to actual file locations server-side.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user input that influences file path construction. Blacklisting ".." is insufficient; use whitelisting and canonicalization techniques.
* **Secure File Handling Libraries:** Utilize secure file handling libraries and functions provided by the programming language or framework, which often have built-in protection against path traversal.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully traverse directories.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Proactively identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities through thorough code reviews and security testing.

**1.2. Exploit Insufficient File Permissions on Token Storage:**

**Description:** If the directory or files containing the API tokens have overly permissive permissions, an attacker with access to the server (even with limited privileges initially) could read the token data.

**Technical Details:**

* **Incorrect Permissions:**  Common mistakes include setting world-readable permissions (e.g., `chmod 777`) or group permissions that are too broad.
* **Compromised User Account:** An attacker who has compromised a less privileged user account on the server could potentially access the token files if the permissions are not restrictive enough.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):**  Grant the application user (under which Onboard runs) the minimum necessary permissions to access the token storage. Restrict access for all other users and groups.
* **Restrictive Directory and File Permissions:**  Set permissions to `600` (read/write for owner only) for token files and `700` (read/write/execute for owner only) for the token storage directory. Adjust group permissions only if absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.
* **Regular Permission Audits:**  Periodically review and verify the permissions on the token storage directory and files to ensure they remain secure.
* **Consider Dedicated Storage:** If possible, store tokens in a separate, isolated location with even stricter access controls.

**2. Exploit Database Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in a database) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

**Description:** This path assumes Onboard stores API tokens in a database. The attacker aims to exploit vulnerabilities in the database or the application's interaction with the database to gain unauthorized access to the token data.

**Likelihood:** The likelihood depends on the security posture of the database and the application's database interaction code. SQL injection is a common vulnerability, making this a significant risk if not addressed properly.

**Impact:** Direct access to the token database exposes all stored tokens.

**2.1. SQL Injection in Onboard's Database Queries:**

**Description:** SQL injection occurs when an application uses untrusted user input directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code that alters the query's logic, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data (like tokens), or even manipulate the database.

**Technical Details:**

* **Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual):** Imagine Onboard retrieves a user's token based on a username provided by the user: `query = "SELECT token FROM tokens WHERE username = '" + user_input + "';"`. An attacker could provide `user_input = "'; DROP TABLE tokens; --"` to execute a malicious query.
* **Exploitation Methods:**
    * **Web Interface:** Injecting SQL code into form fields or URL parameters.
    * **API Endpoints:**  Crafting malicious requests to API endpoints that construct database queries based on input.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database. This separates the SQL code from the user-supplied data, preventing the data from being interpreted as code.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  While parameterized queries are the primary defense, still validate and sanitize user input to prevent other types of attacks.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):**  Grant the database user used by Onboard the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid granting `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` privileges on all tables if not required.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Actively look for SQL injection vulnerabilities through code reviews and penetration testing.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  A WAF can help detect and block common SQL injection attempts.

**2.2. Exploit Weak Database Credentials or Default Settings:**

**Description:** If the database used by Onboard is configured with default credentials or easily guessable passwords, an attacker who discovers these credentials can directly access the database and retrieve the token data. Similarly, default settings might expose unnecessary ports or features.

**Technical Details:**

* **Default Usernames and Passwords:** Many database systems come with default usernames (e.g., "root", "admin") and passwords. These should be changed immediately upon installation.
* **Weak Passwords:**  Using simple or common passwords makes the database vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
* **Exposed Database Ports:** If the database port is publicly accessible without proper firewall rules, attackers can attempt to connect directly.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strong and Unique Database Credentials:**  Use strong, unique passwords for all database users. Consider using a password manager to generate and store these securely.
* **Change Default Credentials Immediately:**  The first step after installing the database should be to change all default usernames and passwords.
* **Restrict Database Access:**  Use firewall rules to restrict access to the database server to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
* **Disable Unnecessary Features and Ports:**  Disable any database features or ports that are not required by Onboard to reduce the attack surface.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  Keep the database software up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Database Access:** Consider implementing MFA for database administrative access to add an extra layer of security.

**Conclusion:**

Gaining unauthorized access to Onboard's token storage represents a critical security vulnerability with potentially devastating consequences. Both file system and database storage methods present distinct attack vectors that must be addressed proactively. The development team must prioritize implementing robust security measures throughout the application lifecycle, focusing on secure coding practices, proper configuration, and regular security assessments.

**Recommendations:**
