## Deep Analysis: Insecure Client-Side Storage of Onboarding State in `onboard`

This analysis delves into the potential attack surface identified as "Insecure Client-Side Storage of Onboarding State" within applications utilizing the `onboard` library (https://github.com/mamaral/onboard). We will examine the mechanisms, potential exploits, impact, and provide detailed mitigation strategies for the development team.

**1. Deeper Understanding of the Attack Surface:**

The core vulnerability lies in the trust placed on the client's browser to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the onboarding process state. While client-side storage (cookies, local storage, session storage) offers convenience and potentially improved user experience by avoiding constant server round trips, it inherently introduces security risks. The browser environment is controlled by the user, and therefore, any data stored there is susceptible to manipulation by a malicious actor.

**1.1. How `onboard` Might Contribute (Specific Examples):**

Let's consider concrete ways `onboard`'s implementation could lead to this vulnerability:

* **Storing the Current Step Index:** `onboard` might store a simple integer representing the current step the user is on (e.g., `onboarding_step: 3`). If this is stored in plain text in a cookie, an attacker could easily change it to bypass steps.
* **Flagging Completed Steps:**  The library could use flags to indicate completed steps (e.g., `step_1_complete: true`, `step_2_complete: false`). Tampering with these flags could allow bypassing mandatory data entry or validation.
* **Storing Temporary Data:** `onboard` might temporarily store data collected during the onboarding process before it's finalized on the server. If this data is sensitive and stored insecurely, it could be exposed or modified.
* **Using Unique Identifiers:**  While less likely for simple state management, `onboard` could potentially store temporary user identifiers or tokens client-side. If these are not properly secured, they could be misused.
* **Configuration Data:** In some scenarios, `onboard` might store configuration settings or user preferences related to the onboarding flow client-side. Manipulating this could alter the intended behavior.

**1.2. Detailed Attack Vectors and Exploitation Scenarios:**

Expanding on the provided example, here are more detailed attack vectors:

* **Direct Cookie Manipulation:** Attackers can use browser developer tools or extensions to directly view and modify cookies associated with the application's domain. This is the simplest form of exploitation.
* **Local/Session Storage Manipulation:** Similar to cookies, local and session storage can be accessed and modified through browser developer tools.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** While HTTPS provides encryption for data in transit, if the client-side storage mechanism itself is insecure, an attacker performing a MitM attack could potentially intercept and modify the stored data before it's used by the application.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:** If the application is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that reads and modifies the client-side storage used by `onboard`. This is a more sophisticated but highly effective attack.
* **Replay Attacks:** An attacker could capture the client-side storage data at a specific point in the onboarding process and replay it later to revert the user to that state or bypass subsequent steps.
* **Automation and Scripting:** Attackers can automate the process of manipulating client-side storage to quickly bypass onboarding for multiple accounts or to test for vulnerabilities at scale.

**1.3. Deeper Dive into the Impact:**

The impact of this vulnerability extends beyond simply bypassing onboarding steps. Consider these potential consequences:

* **Unauthorized Access to Features:** As highlighted, bypassing onboarding can grant access to features intended only for fully onboarded users, potentially exposing sensitive data or functionality.
* **Data Integrity Issues:** Modifying data stored client-side could lead to inconsistencies and errors in the application's data. For example, if a required field is bypassed, the application might operate with incomplete or invalid data.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, manipulating the onboarding state could potentially lead to privilege escalation. For instance, an attacker might bypass verification steps that are necessary for granting administrative privileges.
* **Business Logic Bypass:** Onboarding processes often implement crucial business logic, such as account creation, verification, or agreement to terms of service. Bypassing these steps can undermine the application's core functionality and legal compliance.
* **Injection of Malicious Data:** If temporary data is stored client-side before server-side validation, an attacker could inject malicious code or data that is later processed by the application, leading to further vulnerabilities.
* **Reputational Damage:** If attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or cause data breaches, it can severely damage the application's and the organization's reputation.

**2. Risk Severity Justification:**

The "High" risk severity assessment is justified due to the following factors:

* **Ease of Exploitation:** Manipulating client-side storage is relatively straightforward, requiring minimal technical skills and readily available browser tools.
* **Potential for Significant Impact:** As detailed above, the consequences of successful exploitation can be severe, ranging from unauthorized access to data breaches and business logic bypass.
* **Likelihood of Occurrence:** If `onboard` or the application developers are not explicitly implementing secure client-side storage practices, this vulnerability is likely to be present.
* **Wide Applicability:** This vulnerability is relevant to any application using client-side storage for sensitive state management, making it a common attack vector.

**3. Elaborated Mitigation Strategies for Developers:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's expand on them with more specific recommendations:

* **Prioritize Server-Side Sessions:**
    * **Stateless Authentication:** Utilize stateless authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) stored securely (e.g., HTTP-only, Secure cookies) to verify user identity after successful onboarding.
    * **Session Management:** Implement robust server-side session management to track the user's onboarding progress. This ensures the state is controlled and secured on the server.
    * **API Design:** Design APIs that require the server to validate the onboarding state before allowing access to protected resources.

* **If Client-Side Storage is Absolutely Necessary:**
    * **Encryption:**
        * **Choose Strong Algorithms:** Use robust encryption algorithms like AES-256 for encrypting sensitive data before storing it client-side.
        * **Secure Key Management:**  Crucially, the encryption key *must not* be stored client-side or derived from client-side information. Key management should be handled server-side. Consider techniques like encrypting the data with a key derived from the server-side session or using a server-side encryption service.
    * **Signing (Integrity Checks):**
        * **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code):** Use HMAC with a secret key (again, managed server-side) to generate a signature for the client-side data. The server can then verify this signature to ensure the data hasn't been tampered with.
        * **Digital Signatures:** For stronger integrity guarantees, consider using digital signatures with cryptographic keys.
    * **Minimize Stored Data:** Only store the absolute minimum amount of information required client-side. Avoid storing sensitive data if possible.
    * **Short Expiration Times:** If storing temporary data client-side, set short expiration times to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.
    * **HTTP-Only and Secure Flags for Cookies:** When using cookies, always set the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent JavaScript access and the `Secure` flag to ensure the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS.
    * **Consider `SameSite` Attribute for Cookies:** Use the `SameSite` attribute to help mitigate CSRF attacks by controlling when cookies are sent in cross-site requests.

* **Implement Integrity Checks:**
    * **Server-Side Validation:** Always validate the onboarding state received from the client against the server-side session data. Never rely solely on client-side information.
    * **Regular Re-authentication/Authorization:** Periodically re-authenticate and re-authorize users to ensure they haven't bypassed any onboarding steps since their initial login.

* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities related to client-side storage.
    * **Manual Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough manual code reviews, specifically focusing on how `onboard` is integrated and how client-side data is handled.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the application's onboarding process.

* **Consider Alternatives to Client-Side Storage:**
    * **URL Parameters (with Caution):** For simple state management, URL parameters can be used, but be mindful of information leakage and the limitations of URL length. Sensitive data should never be passed in URL parameters.
    * **Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets:** For real-time updates on onboarding progress, consider using SSE or WebSockets to communicate directly from the server to the client.

**4. Specific Considerations for `onboard` Library:**

When working with `onboard`, developers should:

* **Review `onboard`'s Documentation:** Carefully examine the library's documentation to understand how it manages state and if it offers any built-in security features or configuration options related to client-side storage.
* **Inspect `onboard`'s Source Code:** If possible, review the source code of `onboard` to understand its internal workings and identify potential security risks.
* **Configuration Options:** Check if `onboard` provides options to disable or customize client-side storage mechanisms. If so, prioritize server-side management.
* **Secure Defaults:** Advocate for `onboard` to have secure defaults that minimize reliance on insecure client-side storage.
* **Wrapper Functions:** Consider creating wrapper functions around `onboard`'s API to enforce security measures like encryption and integrity checks before storing any data client-side.

**5. Elaborated Mitigation Strategies for Users (Limited but Important):**

While users have limited direct control, they can take steps to mitigate the risk:

* **Keep Browsers Updated:** Ensure their web browsers are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Use Reputable Security Software:** Employ reputable antivirus and anti-malware software to protect against malicious scripts and browser extensions.
* **Be Cautious with Browser Extensions:** Avoid installing untrusted browser extensions that could potentially access and manipulate client-side storage.
* **Clear Browser Data Regularly:** Periodically clear browser cookies, local storage, and cache to remove potentially compromised data.
* **Be Aware of Phishing Attempts:** Be vigilant against phishing attacks that could trick users into revealing credentials or installing malicious software.

**Conclusion:**

The insecure client-side storage of onboarding state represents a significant attack surface in applications using the `onboard` library. By understanding the potential attack vectors, impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk associated with this vulnerability. Prioritizing server-side session management, employing strong encryption and integrity checks when client-side storage is necessary, and conducting thorough security audits are crucial steps in securing the onboarding process and protecting the application and its users.
