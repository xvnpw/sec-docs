## Deep Dive Analysis: Onboarding Flow Manipulation (Injection) Threat

This analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of the "Onboarding Flow Manipulation (Injection)" threat targeting applications using the `onboard` library. We will delve into the attack vectors, potential consequences, and expand on the provided mitigation strategies, offering actionable recommendations for the development team.

**1. Understanding the Threat in the Context of `onboard`:**

The `onboard` library facilitates the creation of guided onboarding experiences. It relies on a definition of the flow, outlining the sequence of steps and associated actions. This threat exploits potential vulnerabilities in how this flow definition is managed and processed.

**Key Considerations for `onboard`:**

* **Flow Definition Format:** How is the onboarding flow defined? Is it a JSON/YAML configuration file, a database entry, or dynamically generated code? The format and storage location are crucial.
* **Dynamic Generation:**  If the flow is dynamically generated, what are the sources of input? Is user input directly incorporated? Are there external data sources?
* **Action Handlers:** `onboard` likely has a mechanism to execute actions associated with each step (e.g., API calls, data updates). How are these actions defined and executed?
* **State Management:** How does `onboard` track the user's progress through the onboarding flow? Can this state be manipulated?

**2. Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors:**

Expanding on the initial description, here are specific ways an attacker could inject malicious data or code:

* **Direct Data Injection into Flow Definition:**
    * **Scenario:** If the flow definition is stored in a file accessible to unauthorized users or if vulnerabilities exist in the application's configuration management, an attacker could directly modify the file.
    * **Example:** Injecting a new step that sends user data to an external server or modifies account settings maliciously.
    * **Relevance to `onboard`:**  Depends on how `onboard` loads its configuration. If it reads directly from a file without proper integrity checks, this is a high risk.

* **Injection via User Input influencing Flow Definition:**
    * **Scenario:** If user input (e.g., during registration or initial setup) is used to dynamically construct parts of the onboarding flow definition, an attacker could inject malicious payloads.
    * **Example:** A username field could be used to build a step name. An attacker could input a value like `"step1", "malicious_step": {"action": "execute_evil_script"}`.
    * **Relevance to `onboard`:** If `onboard`'s flow logic directly uses or interpolates user input without sanitization, this is a significant vulnerability.

* **Manipulation of Data Associated with Existing Steps:**
    * **Scenario:** Even without adding new steps, attackers could modify the data associated with legitimate steps to achieve malicious goals.
    * **Example:** Modifying the API endpoint or parameters of an action handler within a step to point to a malicious server or execute unintended operations.
    * **Relevance to `onboard`:**  If the flow definition allows for complex data structures within steps, vulnerabilities in parsing or using this data could be exploited.

* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dynamic Flow Generation Logic:**
    * **Scenario:** If the onboarding flow is generated based on data from a database or external API, vulnerabilities in these sources or the logic that processes them could lead to injection.
    * **Example:** An SQL injection vulnerability in the database query used to fetch onboarding steps could allow an attacker to inject malicious steps into the retrieved data.
    * **Relevance to `onboard`:**  The application's architecture surrounding `onboard` is critical here. If it relies on external data sources without proper security measures, `onboard` becomes a vector for exploiting those vulnerabilities.

* **Leveraging Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable):**
    * **Scenario:** If the flow definition is serialized and deserialized (e.g., using libraries like `pickle` in Python), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could allow for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Relevance to `onboard`:**  Depends on the implementation details of how `onboard` handles its flow definition. If serialization/deserialization is involved, this is a serious concern.

**3. Deeper Dive into Potential Impacts:**

The "Critical" risk severity is justified due to the wide range of potential impacts:

* **Direct Code Execution:** Injecting malicious code directly into action handlers or leveraging deserialization vulnerabilities could lead to immediate code execution within the application's context. This grants the attacker significant control.
* **Account Compromise:**
    * **Credential Theft:** Injecting steps that capture user credentials (e.g., by presenting a fake login form) or modifying existing steps to send credentials to an attacker's server.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Manipulating the onboarding flow to obtain valid session tokens or cookies.
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  Modifying the onboarding process to grant higher privileges to the attacker's account or other accounts.
* **Data Exfiltration:**
    * **Direct Data Theft:** Injecting steps that make API calls to exfiltrate sensitive user data or application data.
    * **Indirect Data Theft:**  Modifying onboarding steps to grant access to sensitive resources that the attacker can later exploit.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) / Broken User Experience:**
    * **Disrupting Onboarding:** Injecting steps that cause errors or infinite loops, preventing legitimate users from completing onboarding.
    * **Resource Exhaustion:** Injecting steps that consume excessive resources, leading to application instability.
* **Manipulation of Application State:** Injecting steps that alter critical application settings or data, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
* **Supply Chain Issues (Indirect):** If the `onboard` flow definition includes dependencies on external resources or services, an attacker could manipulate the flow to introduce malicious dependencies.

**4. Enhancing Mitigation Strategies and Actionable Recommendations:**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Here's a more detailed breakdown with actionable recommendations:

* **Secure Storage and Access Control for Onboarding Flow Definitions:**
    * **Recommendation:** Store flow definitions securely on the server-side, protected by robust access control mechanisms. Avoid storing them in client-side code or easily accessible configuration files.
    * **Implementation:** Utilize environment variables, secure configuration management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted databases to store flow definitions. Implement role-based access control to limit who can modify these definitions.
    * **Consideration for `onboard`:** Ensure `onboard` is configured to load flow definitions from these secure locations and not directly from user-provided input.

* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for **any** user-provided data that could potentially influence the onboarding flow definition, even indirectly.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters, formats, and values for user inputs.
        * **Data Type Validation:** Ensure inputs conform to expected data types.
        * **Sanitization:** Remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code snippets.
        * **Contextual Escaping:**  Escape data appropriately based on where it will be used (e.g., HTML escaping for display, SQL escaping for database queries).
    * **Consideration for `onboard`:**  If user input is used to select or parameterize onboarding steps, this input must be rigorously validated and sanitized before being used to construct the flow.

* **Avoid Dynamic Evaluation of Untrusted Input:**
    * **Recommendation:**  Strictly avoid using `eval()`, `exec()`, or similar functions on user-provided input or data derived from user input within the onboarding flow logic.
    * **Implementation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions. For dynamic logic, use predefined functions or a controlled set of operations based on validated input.
    * **Consideration for `onboard`:**  Examine how `onboard` handles action handlers. If it allows for arbitrary code execution based on configuration, this is a major vulnerability. Prefer a declarative approach where actions are predefined and selected based on validated input.

* **Strict Schema Validation for Onboarding Flow Definitions:**
    * **Recommendation:** Define a strict schema (e.g., using JSON Schema or a similar mechanism) for the onboarding flow definition and validate against it before processing.
    * **Implementation:** Implement validation logic that checks the structure, data types, and allowed values within the flow definition. Reject any definitions that do not conform to the schema.
    * **Consideration for `onboard`:**  This adds a crucial layer of defense against malformed or malicious flow definitions.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Recommendation:** Ensure the application components responsible for loading and processing the onboarding flow definition operate with the minimum necessary privileges.
    * **Implementation:** Avoid running these components with administrative or overly permissive access rights.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the risk of injected scripts executing in the user's browser if the onboarding flow involves client-side rendering.
    * **Implementation:** Define a CSP that restricts the sources from which the browser can load resources.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Recommendation:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the onboarding flow and its interaction with `onboard`.
    * **Implementation:** Engage security professionals to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

* **Error Handling and Logging:**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to detect and track any attempts to manipulate the onboarding flow.
    * **Implementation:** Log relevant events, such as attempts to load invalid flow definitions or unexpected errors during onboarding.

* **Consider a Static or Highly Controlled Dynamic Definition Approach:**
    * **Recommendation:**  Where possible, favor a static definition of the onboarding flow or a highly controlled dynamic generation process with minimal reliance on untrusted input.
    * **Implementation:**  If dynamic generation is necessary, carefully design the logic and limit the influence of user input to predefined, validated options.

**5. Conclusion:**

The "Onboarding Flow Manipulation (Injection)" threat is a serious concern for applications utilizing the `onboard` library. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability being exploited. A layered security approach, combining secure storage, robust input validation, and strict schema enforcement, is crucial for protecting the integrity and security of the onboarding process.
