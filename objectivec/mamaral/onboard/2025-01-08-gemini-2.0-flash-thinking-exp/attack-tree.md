## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Managed API Tokens via Onboard [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/steal_managed_api_tokens_via_onboard__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path represents the attacker's primary goal of obtaining sensitive API tokens managed by onboard. Success in this path directly compromises the security of the applications relying on these tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Onboard's Token Storage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_onboard's_token_storage__critical_node_.md)

* This critical node represents a direct breach of the storage mechanism for API tokens. If an attacker gains access here, all managed tokens are immediately compromised, bypassing any authentication or authorization controls within the onboard application itself.
    * Exploit File System Access Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in files) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * Identify and Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in Onboard's File Handling: An attacker could manipulate file paths to access token files stored outside the intended directories.
        * Exploit Insufficient File Permissions on Token Storage: If the token storage directory or files have overly permissive permissions, an attacker could directly read the token data.
    * Exploit Database Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in a database) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * SQL Injection in Onboard's Database Queries: By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker could bypass authentication and retrieve token data directly from the database.
        * Exploit Weak Database Credentials or Default Settings: Using default or easily guessable database credentials allows direct access to the token data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File System Access Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in files) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_system_access_vulnerability__if_tokens_are_stored_in_files___high-risk_path_.md)

* Identify and Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability in Onboard's File Handling: An attacker could manipulate file paths to access token files stored outside the intended directories.
        * Exploit Insufficient File Permissions on Token Storage: If the token storage directory or files have overly permissive permissions, an attacker could directly read the token data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Vulnerability (If tokens are stored in a database) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_vulnerability__if_tokens_are_stored_in_a_database___high-risk_path_.md)

* SQL Injection in Onboard's Database Queries: By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker could bypass authentication and retrieve token data directly from the database.
        * Exploit Weak Database Credentials or Default Settings: Using default or easily guessable database credentials allows direct access to the token data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Onboard's Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_onboard's_authenticationauthorization_mechanisms__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

* This critical node signifies a failure in onboard's access control. Successfully bypassing authentication or authorization grants the attacker access to sensitive functionalities and data, including the ability to steal or manipulate tokens.
    * Exploit Authentication Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * Brute-force Default or Weak Onboard Credentials: Attempting to guess common or default usernames and passwords to gain access.
        * Exploit Lack of Account Lockout Mechanism:  Allows for unlimited login attempts, facilitating brute-force attacks.
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Onboard's Login Functionality (e.g., credential stuffing): Exploiting flaws in the login process to bypass security checks or using lists of compromised credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

* Brute-force Default or Weak Onboard Credentials: Attempting to guess common or default usernames and passwords to gain access.
        * Exploit Lack of Account Lockout Mechanism:  Allows for unlimited login attempts, facilitating brute-force attacks.
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Onboard's Login Functionality (e.g., credential stuffing): Exploiting flaws in the login process to bypass security checks or using lists of compromised credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Token Retrieval/Display [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_token_retrievaldisplay__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path involves exploiting weaknesses in how onboard retrieves and presents token information to authorized users, allowing attackers to intercept or steal tokens.
    * Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Onboard's HTTPS (Less likely if application uses HTTPS correctly): Intercepting communication between the user and the onboard server to steal tokens in transit (often due to weak TLS configuration on the onboard server).
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Onboard's Interface (leading to token theft): Injecting malicious scripts into onboard's interface that can steal tokens when viewed by other users.
        * Stored XSS in Token Descriptions or Names: Malicious scripts are permanently stored and executed when the token is viewed.
        * Reflected XSS in Onboard's Search or Filter Functionality: Malicious scripts are injected through URLs and executed when a user clicks on a crafted link.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify or Delete Managed API Tokens via Onboard [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_or_delete_managed_api_tokens_via_onboard__high-risk_path_.md)

* This path focuses on the attacker's ability to disrupt the application by altering or removing API tokens, potentially breaking integrations or causing denial of service.
    * Gain Unauthorized Access to Onboard's Token Management Interface [CRITICAL NODE]: Achieving unauthorized access to the interface where tokens are managed is a critical step in modifying or deleting them. This relies on the vulnerabilities described in "Bypass Onboard's Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms".

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Onboard's Token Management Interface [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_onboard's_token_management_interface__critical_node_.md)

Achieving unauthorized access to the interface where tokens are managed is a critical step in modifying or deleting them. This relies on the vulnerabilities described in "Bypass Onboard's Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms".
