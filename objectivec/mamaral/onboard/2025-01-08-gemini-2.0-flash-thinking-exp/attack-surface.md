# Attack Surface Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Client-Side Storage of Onboarding State](./attack_surfaces/insecure_client-side_storage_of_onboarding_state.md)

*   **Description:** The `onboard` library might rely on client-side storage (like cookies or local storage) to maintain the state of the onboarding process. If this data is not properly secured, it can be tampered with.
    *   **How onboard Contributes:** `onboard`'s design might involve storing progress indicators or temporary data in the browser to manage the multi-step flow. If the library doesn't enforce encryption or integrity checks on this data, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could modify a cookie storing the current onboarding step to skip steps requiring data input or validation, potentially gaining unauthorized access to features intended for fully onboarded users.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing onboarding steps, accessing restricted features, potentially injecting malicious data into the application's workflow.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Primarily use server-side sessions to manage onboarding state. If client-side storage is necessary, encrypt and sign the data to prevent tampering. Implement integrity checks to verify the data hasn't been modified.
        *   **Users:**  No direct mitigation for users.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation in Onboarding Forms](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation_in_onboarding_forms.md)

*   **Description:** Data collected during onboarding steps might not be properly validated and sanitized, leading to common injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How onboard Contributes:** `onboard` likely handles the rendering and submission of forms within the onboarding process. If the application doesn't implement thorough validation on the data submitted through these forms, it's an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a "username" field during onboarding, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when the application displays this data later.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (if data is used in database queries), other injection attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all data collected during onboarding. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Escape output to prevent XSS.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about the information entered during onboarding and avoid pasting data from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data During Onboarding](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_sensitive_data_during_onboarding.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information collected during onboarding (e.g., personal details, payment information) might not be handled securely.
    *   **How onboard Contributes:** `onboard` might be responsible for collecting and temporarily storing this data. If the library doesn't enforce encryption at rest and in transit, it introduces a risk.
    *   **Example:**  Sensitive data collected during onboarding is stored in plain text in a temporary location, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential compliance violations, reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (using HTTPS). Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily. Implement strong access controls to onboarding data.
        *   **Users:** Ensure the connection is secure (HTTPS) when providing sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `onboard` or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__onboard__or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The `onboard` library itself or its dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How onboard Contributes:** By including `onboard` in the application, any vulnerabilities within the library or its dependencies become potential attack vectors for the application.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of a library used by `onboard` could be exploited to perform a remote code execution attack.
    *   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update the `onboard` library and all its dependencies to the latest secure versions. Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** No direct mitigation for users.
