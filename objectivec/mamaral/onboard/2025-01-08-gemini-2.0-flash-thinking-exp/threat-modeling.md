# Threat Model Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Threat: [Onboarding State Tampering](./threats/onboarding_state_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker could directly modify the stored onboarding state managed by `onboard` (e.g., in a database record, session storage, or a cookie). They might manipulate values to mark steps as completed without actually performing them, or alter data associated with specific steps that `onboard` uses to track progress.

**Impact:** Users could bypass required onboarding steps, gaining premature access to application features or sensitive data. This could lead to incomplete user profiles, incorrect data within the system, or bypassed security checks intended during onboarding, all due to manipulation of `onboard`'s state management.

**Affected Component:** State management module (within `onboard`, responsible for reading, writing, and validating the onboarding progress).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls on the storage mechanism used by `onboard` for onboarding state, limiting who can read and write this data.
* Configure `onboard` to use signed or encrypted state to prevent unauthorized modification. Ensure the application verifies the signature or decrypts the state before processing.
* Implement server-side validation of the onboarding state managed by `onboard` at each step transition, rather than relying solely on client-side information.

## Threat: [Onboarding Flow Manipulation (Injection)](./threats/onboarding_flow_manipulation__injection_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious data or code into the definition of the onboarding flow that `onboard` uses, especially if the flow is dynamically generated or partially based on user input processed by `onboard`. This could involve altering the sequence of steps, adding malicious steps that `onboard` will interpret, or modifying the data associated with existing steps within `onboard`'s configuration.

**Impact:**  Malicious code could be executed within the application's context during the onboarding process managed by `onboard`, potentially leading to account compromise, data exfiltration, or other security breaches. The intended onboarding process defined within `onboard` could be disrupted, leading to a broken user experience.

**Affected Component:** Flow definition logic (within `onboard`, responsible for parsing and interpreting the onboarding flow configuration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store onboarding flow definitions securely and prevent direct user modification within the application's configuration for `onboard`. Avoid storing them in easily accessible locations or relying on client-side definitions that `onboard` consumes.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data that influences the onboarding flow definition used by `onboard`.
* Avoid dynamic evaluation of untrusted input within the onboarding flow logic of `onboard`. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if database interaction is involved within `onboard`'s action handlers.
* Implement a strict schema or structure for the onboarding flow definition that `onboard` uses and validate against it.

## Threat: [Insecure Action Triggering](./threats/insecure_action_triggering.md)

**Description:** The `onboard` library allows triggering actions upon completion of certain onboarding steps. An attacker could attempt to directly trigger these actions exposed by `onboard` outside of the intended onboarding flow or trigger them multiple times if `onboard`'s action triggering mechanism is not properly secured.

**Impact:**  Unintended actions could be executed via `onboard`, potentially leading to privilege escalation (e.g., granting administrative rights prematurely), data modification without proper validation, or denial of service if actions triggered by `onboard` consume significant resources.

**Affected Component:** Action execution module (within `onboard`, responsible for triggering actions based on onboarding progress).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authorization checks within the action handlers configured for `onboard` before executing any action. Verify that the user has genuinely completed the necessary preceding steps as tracked by `onboard`.
* Ensure actions configured for `onboard` are idempotent or have appropriate safeguards against being triggered multiple times maliciously.
* Avoid directly exposing internal application functionalities as onboarding actions through `onboard` without careful consideration and security review.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within the `onboard` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_the__onboard__library_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software, the `onboard` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS) if it renders content, injection flaws, authentication bypasses within its own logic).

**Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability within `onboard`, this could lead to various security issues, including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service directly impacting the application through the vulnerable library.

**Affected Component:** The entire `onboard` library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be critical or high depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities in the `onboard` library by monitoring its repository and security advisories.
* Regularly update the library to the latest version with security patches.
* Consider using static analysis tools or software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the `onboard` library's code.
* Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS vulnerabilities if `onboard` renders any user-controlled content.
