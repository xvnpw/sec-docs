*   **Web Application Server (e.g., Flask with Jinja2):**
    *   Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data to prevent SSRF attacks. Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists for allowed URLs or hostnames.
    *   Ensure secure session management by setting `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies. Implement session timeouts and consider using anti-CSRF tokens.
    *   Utilize Jinja2's autoescaping feature to prevent template injection vulnerabilities. Avoid constructing templates from user input.
    *   Implement proper error handling and logging practices to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Sanitize any data logged.

**3. API Layer (API Gateway):**

*   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms at the API Gateway. Verify JWT signatures or use other secure authentication protocols before routing requests to backend services.
*   Configure rate limiting and throttling rules to protect backend services from abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   Carefully configure routing rules to ensure requests are directed to the correct backend services and prevent unintended access.
*   Harden the API Gateway infrastructure and implement access controls. Regularly update the API Gateway software.
*   Ensure the API Gateway correctly enforces authentication and authorization policies defined in the Authentication Service.

**4. Service Layer:**

*   **Authentication Service:**
    *   Use strong and salted password hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).
    *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the user registration process.
    *   Secure the password reset process by using time-limited, unique tokens sent to the user's verified email address.
