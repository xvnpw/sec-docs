### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Existing Flow Definition

**Attack Tree Path:** Manipulate Existing Flow Definition

**Method:** If onboard stores flow definitions in a modifiable location without proper access controls, an attacker could alter existing flows to introduce malicious steps or change the intended onboarding process.

**Prerequisites:** Unauthorized access to the storage mechanism for flow definitions (e.g., database, file system).

**Consequences:** Bypassing security checks, granting unauthorized access, manipulating user roles or permissions.

#### 4.1 Detailed Breakdown

* **Method: Altering Existing Flow Definitions**

    This method hinges on the assumption that the storage mechanism for flow definitions lacks robust access controls. An attacker, having gained unauthorized access, could directly modify these definitions. This could involve:

    * **Introducing Malicious Steps:** Injecting new steps into the onboarding flow that perform actions unintended by the application developers. This could include:
        * Executing arbitrary code on the server.
        * Stealing sensitive user data during the onboarding process.
        * Redirecting users to phishing sites.
        * Installing malware on user devices (if the flow involves client-side interactions).
    * **Modifying Existing Steps:** Altering the behavior of legitimate steps within the flow. This could involve:
        * Changing validation rules to bypass security checks.
        * Modifying data processing logic to grant unauthorized permissions.
        * Altering the order of steps to circumvent intended security measures.
    * **Deleting or Disabling Steps:** Removing crucial steps from the onboarding process, potentially bypassing essential security checks or data collection.

* **Prerequisites: Unauthorized Access to Flow Definition Storage**

    The success of this attack path relies entirely on the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the location where flow definitions are stored. Potential scenarios for achieving this include:

    * **Database Compromise:** If flow definitions are stored in a database, vulnerabilities like SQL injection, weak database credentials, or insecure database configurations could allow an attacker to gain access and modify the data.
    * **File System Access:** If flow definitions are stored in files, vulnerabilities like directory traversal, insecure file permissions, or compromised server credentials could grant an attacker the ability to read and modify these files.
    * **API Vulnerabilities:** If flow definitions are managed through an API, vulnerabilities like broken authentication, authorization flaws, or insecure API endpoints could allow an attacker to manipulate the definitions.
    * **Compromised Credentials:**  An attacker could gain access using legitimate credentials that have been compromised through phishing, brute-force attacks, or data breaches. These credentials could belong to administrators or users with sufficient privileges to access the flow definition storage.
    * **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the storage mechanism could intentionally manipulate the flow definitions.

* **Consequences: Impact of Successful Manipulation**

    The consequences of successfully manipulating flow definitions can be severe, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the entire application and its users:

    * **Bypassing Security Checks:** Attackers could modify flows to skip authentication or authorization steps, granting them unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.
    * **Granting Unauthorized Access:** By altering flow definitions related to user roles and permissions, attackers could elevate their own privileges or grant unauthorized access to other users.
    * **Manipulating User Roles or Permissions:** Attackers could change user roles to gain administrative privileges or modify permissions to access sensitive data or perform restricted actions.
    * **Data Breaches:** Malicious steps injected into the flow could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data or application secrets.
    * **Account Takeover:** By manipulating onboarding flows, attackers could potentially create new accounts with elevated privileges or hijack existing user accounts.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Altering flow definitions could disrupt the normal onboarding process, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
    * **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack could severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it.

#### 4.2 Potential Vulnerabilities in `onboard`

Based on the analysis, potential vulnerabilities in `onboard` that could make it susceptible to this attack include:

* **Insecure Storage of Flow Definitions:**
    * **Lack of Encryption:** If flow definitions are stored in plain text, attackers gaining access can easily understand and modify them.
    * **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Weak or missing access controls on the database, file system, or API endpoints where flow definitions are stored.
    * **Default or Weak Credentials:**  Using default or easily guessable credentials for accessing the flow definition storage.
* **Lack of Integrity Checks:**
    * **Missing Signatures or Checksums:** Absence of mechanisms to verify the integrity of flow definitions, allowing for undetected modifications.
    * **No Version Control or Audit Logging:** Lack of tracking changes to flow definitions, making it difficult to identify and revert malicious modifications.
* **Vulnerabilities in Flow Definition Processing:**
    * **Lack of Input Validation:**  If the application doesn't properly validate flow definitions before processing them, attackers could inject malicious code or commands.
    * **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** If flow definitions are serialized and deserialized, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
* **Insufficient Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**  Easy-to-guess passwords or lack of multi-factor authentication for accessing the flow definition management interface.
    * **Granular Authorization Issues:**  Not having fine-grained control over who can read, modify, or delete flow definitions.

#### 4.3 Attack Scenarios

Here are a couple of scenarios illustrating how this attack could be carried out:

* **Scenario 1: Database Compromise via SQL Injection:**
    1. An attacker identifies a SQL injection vulnerability in an API endpoint used to manage flow definitions.
    2. Using the vulnerability, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the database storing flow definitions.
    3. The attacker modifies an existing onboarding flow to include a step that executes a malicious script, granting them administrative privileges upon a new user's successful onboarding.
    4. A new user goes through the modified onboarding flow, unknowingly triggering the malicious script and granting the attacker unauthorized access.

* **Scenario 2: File System Access via Directory Traversal:**
    1. The application stores flow definitions in JSON files on the server's file system.
    2. An attacker discovers a directory traversal vulnerability in an application feature that allows accessing files based on user input.
    3. The attacker uses this vulnerability to access and modify the flow definition files, injecting a step that redirects newly onboarded users to a phishing site.
    4. New users completing the onboarding process are unknowingly redirected to the attacker's phishing site, potentially compromising their credentials.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

A successful attack exploiting the "Manipulate Existing Flow Definition" path can have a significant impact:

* **High Severity:** This attack can lead to complete compromise of the application's security and potentially user data.
* **Confidentiality Impact:** Sensitive user data can be exposed or exfiltrated through malicious steps injected into the flow.
* **Integrity Impact:** The integrity of the onboarding process and user data can be compromised by manipulating the flow definitions.
* **Availability Impact:** The onboarding process can be disrupted, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
* **Compliance Impact:** Depending on the nature of the data handled by the application, this attack could lead to violations of data privacy regulations.
