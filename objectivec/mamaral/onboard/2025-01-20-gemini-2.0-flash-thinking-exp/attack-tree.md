## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Flow Definition](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_flow_definition.md)

**Method:** If onboard allows external configuration or loading of flow definitions (e.g., from files, databases), an attacker might inject a malicious definition that, when processed, leads to unintended actions within the application.

**Prerequisites:** Access to configuration files or database used by onboard.

**Consequences:** Execution of arbitrary code within the application context, manipulation of user data, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Existing Flow Definition](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_existing_flow_definition.md)

**Method:** If onboard stores flow definitions in a modifiable location without proper access controls, an attacker could alter existing flows to introduce malicious steps or change the intended onboarding process.

**Prerequisites:** Unauthorized access to the storage mechanism for flow definitions (e.g., database, file system).

**Consequences:** Bypassing security checks, granting unauthorized access, manipulating user roles or permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Misuse or Lack of Validation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_misuse_or_lack_of_validation.md)

**Method:** If the application's integration with onboard's API lacks proper input validation or authorization checks, an attacker could send malicious requests to onboard, leading to unintended actions.

**Prerequisites:** Understanding of the API endpoints and parameters used by the application to interact with onboard.

**Consequences:** Manipulating user progress, triggering arbitrary actions within the onboarding flow, potentially impacting other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

**Method:** Onboard likely relies on third-party libraries or frameworks. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the application.

**Prerequisites:** Identification of vulnerable dependencies used by onboard.

**Consequences:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Onboard](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_onboard.md)

This is the top-level category encompassing all vulnerabilities directly related to the `onboard` library. Compromising any part of this node means successfully exploiting a weakness within `onboard` itself to impact the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flow Definition Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flow_definition_vulnerabilities.md)

This node is critical because the way onboarding flows are defined and processed is fundamental to `onboard`'s functionality. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can directly lead to malicious code execution or significant manipulation of the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the crucial interaction point between the application and the `onboard` library. Weaknesses in this integration can be easily exploited to manipulate `onboard` and, consequently, the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Onboard](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_onboard.md)

This node is critical because vulnerabilities in third-party libraries are a common attack vector. If `onboard` relies on vulnerable dependencies, it can provide a direct path for attackers to compromise the application, often with severe consequences like remote code execution.
