**Detailed Data Flow Description:**

1. **User Access:** The user navigates to the onboarding section of the application via their browser.
2. **Request Onboarding Page:** The browser sends a request to the Web Application Server.
3. **Request User Context & Onboarding Flow:** The Web Application Server requests the user's profile information and the relevant onboarding flow definition from the API Gateway.
4. **Route to User Profile Service:** The API Gateway routes the user profile request to the User Profile Service.
5. **Retrieve User Profile:** The User Profile Service retrieves the user's profile from the Relational Database.
6. **Return User Profile:** The Relational Database returns the user profile to the User Profile Service.
7. **Return User Profile to API Gateway:** The User Profile Service sends the user profile information back to the API Gateway.
8. **Route to Onboarding Management Service:** The API Gateway routes the onboarding flow request to the Onboarding Management Service.
9. **Retrieve Onboarding Flow (Cache):** The Onboarding Management Service first checks the Cache Store for the relevant onboarding flow definition.
10. **Return Flow (if cached):** If the flow definition is found in the cache, it's returned to the Onboarding Management Service.
11. **Retrieve Onboarding Flow (DB):** If the flow definition is not in the cache, the Onboarding Management Service retrieves it from the Relational Database.
12. **Return Flow (if not cached):** The Relational Database returns the onboarding flow definition.
13. **Determine Current Task:** The Onboarding Management Service determines the current task for the user based on their progress and the flow definition, potentially interacting with the Task Orchestration Service.
14. **Retrieve Task Details:** The Task Orchestration Service retrieves the details of the current task from the Relational Database.
15. **Return Task Details:** The Relational Database returns the task details to the Task Orchestration Service.
16. **Return Task Info to OMS:** The Task Orchestration Service sends the task information back to the Onboarding Management Service.
17. **Send Onboarding Data to API Gateway:** The Onboarding Management Service sends the combined user profile and onboarding task data back through the API Gateway.
18. **Send Data to Web Application Server:** The API Gateway forwards the data to the Web Application Server.
