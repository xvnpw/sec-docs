# Attack Surface Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Predictable Temporary Credentials/Tokens](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_predictable_temporary_credentialstokens.md)

*   **Description:** `onboard` generates temporary credentials or tokens (e.g., for email verification or initial login) that are easily guessable or predictable.
    *   **How `onboard` Contributes:** If `onboard`'s implementation uses weak random number generators or predictable algorithms for generating these temporary credentials, it directly introduces this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Temporary passwords are generated using a simple sequential counter or a weak hashing algorithm within `onboard`, allowing attackers to easily predict valid credentials for new accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized account access, potentially leading to data breaches or misuse of application features.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Random Number Generation:** Ensure `onboard` uses cryptographically secure random number generators for creating temporary credentials and tokens. This might require configuration or even code modification within `onboard` if it's the source of the weak generation.
        *   **Sufficient Token Length and Complexity:** Configure or modify `onboard` to generate tokens with sufficient length and a diverse character set to make brute-force attacks infeasible.
        *   **Token Expiration:** Configure `onboard` to implement short expiration times for temporary credentials and tokens.
        *   **Rate Limiting on Token Usage:** If `onboard` handles token usage, ensure it implements rate limiting to prevent brute-forcing.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Temporary Onboarding Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_temporary_onboarding_data.md)

*   **Description:** `onboard` temporarily stores sensitive onboarding data (e.g., unhashed passwords, personal information) in an insecure manner.
    *   **How `onboard` Contributes:** If `onboard`'s design involves storing sensitive data temporarily in easily accessible locations (e.g., plain text files, unencrypted databases) without proper protection, it creates this risk.
    *   **Example:** Temporary passwords are stored in a plain text file by `onboard` on the server during the onboarding process before being hashed.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data if the storage location managed by `onboard` is compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Temporary Storage within `onboard`:** If possible, modify or configure `onboard` to avoid storing sensitive data temporarily.
        *   **Encryption at Rest within `onboard`:** If temporary storage within `onboard` is necessary, ensure it encrypts the data at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
        *   **Secure Storage Locations:** If `onboard` allows configuration of storage locations, ensure these are secure with restricted access controls.
        *   **Timely Deletion:** Ensure `onboard` securely deletes temporary data as soon as it's no longer needed.
