# Threat Model Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Threat: [Malicious Checklist Manipulation](./threats/malicious_checklist_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the `onboard` library's API or data handling to directly manipulate the checklist data associated with a user. This could involve sending crafted requests to mark tasks as complete or incomplete without proper authorization, leveraging flaws in how `onboard` manages and updates checklist status.

**Impact:** Users might gain access to application features or data prematurely, bypassing necessary onboarding procedures enforced by `onboard`. This undermines the intended onboarding flow and can lead to security risks or incorrect application usage.

**Affected Component:** `onboard`'s API Endpoints for updating checklist status, `onboard`'s Data Storage mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly audit and secure `onboard`'s API endpoints, implementing strong authentication and authorization checks.
* Implement server-side validation within `onboard` to verify the legitimacy of checklist update requests.
* Ensure `onboard` uses secure methods for storing and managing checklist data, preventing direct manipulation.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Checklist Data (if relying on `onboard`'s default mechanisms)](./threats/insecure_storage_of_checklist_data__if_relying_on__onboard_'s_default_mechanisms_.md)

**Description:** If the `onboard` library provides default storage mechanisms that are inherently insecure (e.g., local storage without encryption, easily accessible files), an attacker gaining access to the user's device or the application's storage could directly view or modify checklist data managed by `onboard`.

**Impact:** Sensitive information potentially contained within the onboarding checklist could be exposed. Attackers could also manipulate the onboarding status of users by directly altering the data managed by `onboard`, bypassing the intended application logic.

**Affected Component:** `onboard`'s Data Storage Module (specifically the default storage implementation if used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid relying on insecure default storage mechanisms provided by `onboard`.
* Integrate `onboard` with secure server-side storage and manage data access through secure APIs.
* If client-side storage is unavoidable, ensure data is encrypted using strong cryptographic methods *outside* of `onboard`'s core functionality.
