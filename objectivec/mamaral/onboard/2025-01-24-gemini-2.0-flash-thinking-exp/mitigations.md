# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mamaral/onboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strengthen Invite Code Randomness](./mitigation_strategies/strengthen_invite_code_randomness.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strengthen Invite Code Randomness
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inspect Onboard Code:** Examine the `onboard` application's codebase, specifically the modules responsible for generating invite codes.
    2.  **Verify CSPRNG Usage:** Confirm that the code utilizes a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG) for invite code generation.  Look for functions like `secrets.token_urlsafe()` or `os.urandom()` in Python, or `crypto.randomBytes()` in JavaScript, depending on the implementation language of `onboard`.
    3.  **Replace PRNG if Necessary:** If standard Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) like `random.random()` or `Math.random()` are used, replace them with appropriate CSPRNG functions.
    4.  **Test Randomness (Onboard Specific):** After implementation, generate a sample set of invite codes using `onboard` and perform statistical tests to validate their randomness.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Predictable Invite Codes (High Severity):** Attackers could guess invite codes generated by `onboard` if the randomness is weak, bypassing the invite system.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Weak randomness makes brute-forcing invite codes in `onboard` more feasible.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Predictable Invite Codes:** High Reduction - Directly addresses and eliminates the threat of predictable invite codes within `onboard`.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium Reduction - Makes brute-force attacks against `onboard`'s invite system significantly harder.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Unknown without inspecting `onboard`'s code.  Assume missing unless explicitly verified to use CSPRNG.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Likely missing if `onboard` uses standard PRNGs for invite code generation. Requires code modification within `onboard`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Increase Invite Code Complexity and Length](./mitigation_strategies/increase_invite_code_complexity_and_length.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Increase Invite Code Complexity and Length

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Reduction - Makes brute-forcing `onboard`'s invite codes practically infeasible.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** Medium Reduction - Reduces the effectiveness of dictionary attacks against `onboard` invites.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Partially implemented if `onboard` already generates somewhat complex codes. Check `onboard`'s configuration or code for invite code generation settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  If `onboard` generates short or simple invite codes, this mitigation is missing. Requires configuration or code changes within `onboard`.

    2.  **Update Onboard Redemption Logic:**  Modify the invite code redemption logic within `onboard`:
        *   Before user registration, query the database to check if the submitted invite code is marked as "used".
        *   If used, reject redemption in `onboard`.
        *   If unused, proceed with registration in `onboard` and immediately update the database to mark the invite code as "used".
