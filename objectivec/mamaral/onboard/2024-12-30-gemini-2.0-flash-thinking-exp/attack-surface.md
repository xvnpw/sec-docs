Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on high and critical elements directly involving Onboard:

*   **Attack Surface: Onboarding State Parameter Manipulation**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URL parameters or session data used by Onboard to track the user's progress through the onboarding flow. This can lead to bypassing steps or accessing unintended stages.
    *   **How Onboard Contributes:** Onboard's core functionality relies on managing and interpreting these state parameters. Weak or predictable logic in handling these parameters directly creates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `step` parameter in the URL from `step=1` to `step=3`, directly influencing Onboard's state management and skipping intermediate onboarding steps.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security checks, skipping mandatory configurations, gaining unauthorized access to features, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side State Management:** Implement state management entirely on the server-side, minimizing reliance on client-side parameters that Onboard might expose.
        *   **Non-Sequential and Unpredictable State Tokens (Managed by Application):** While Onboard might use some internal mechanism, the application should enforce its own secure, unpredictable tokens for critical state transitions, not solely relying on Onboard's internal handling.
        *   **Strict Validation of State Transitions (Application-Level):** The application integrating Onboard must implement strict server-side validation to ensure state transitions are legitimate, regardless of Onboard's internal logic.

*   **Attack Surface: Unvalidated User Input during Onboarding**
    *   **Description:** User-provided data collected through Onboard during onboarding steps is not properly sanitized and validated by the application, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS or other injection attacks.
    *   **How Onboard Contributes:** Onboard provides the mechanism for collecting this user input. While the application is ultimately responsible for validation, Onboard's design and the data it collects directly contribute to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker enters malicious JavaScript code in a "username" field provided by Onboard during onboarding. If the application later displays this username without proper escaping, the script will execute in other users' browsers (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and malicious actions on behalf of the user. Potentially other injection vulnerabilities depending on how the data is used by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (Application-Level):** The application *must* implement strict input sanitization and validation on the server-side for all data collected *through* Onboard.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding (Application-Level):** The application must encode output based on the context where it's being displayed, especially when rendering data collected by Onboard.
        *   **Consider Onboard's Input Handling:** Understand if Onboard provides any built-in sanitization (though relying solely on this is not recommended) and how it handles different input types.

*   **Attack Surface: Vulnerabilities in Onboard's Dependencies**
    *   **Description:** Onboard relies on other libraries (dependencies) that might contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Onboard Contributes:** By including these dependencies, Onboard directly introduces the attack surface associated with those vulnerabilities into the application.
    *   **Example:** Onboard uses an older version of a library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. This vulnerability can then be exploited within the application through Onboard's use of that dependency.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a critical vulnerability exists in a dependency) or High (for high severity vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep Onboard's dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is a shared responsibility; the application developers need to be aware of Onboard's dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan Onboard's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Evaluate Onboard's Dependency Management:** Understand how Onboard manages its dependencies and if it provides mechanisms for updating them. Consider forking or contributing to Onboard if critical vulnerabilities are not addressed promptly.
