## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Goal:** Execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Buffer Overflow in Image Decoder:**
            * An attacker provides a maliciously crafted image with oversized dimensions or corrupt headers.
            * This exploits a vulnerability in the image decoding library used by SDWebImage, causing a buffer overflow.
            * The overflow allows the attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Format-Specific Vulnerabilities (e.g., GIF, WebP):**
            * An attacker provides an image file that exploits known vulnerabilities specific to a particular image format (e.g., vulnerabilities in the GIF or WebP parsing logic).
            * Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes, including denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Caching Mechanisms**](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_caching_mechanisms.md)

* **Goal:** Serve malicious content to application users.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Cache Poisoning:**
            * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack During Image Download:**
                * The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the image server (e.g., on an unsecured Wi-Fi network).
                * The attacker replaces the legitimate image being downloaded with a malicious image.
                * This malicious image is then stored in the application's cache.
                * The next time the application tries to load the image, it retrieves the malicious version from the cache.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Goal:** Serve malicious content or intercept sensitive information.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Server-Side Vulnerabilities on Image Host:**
            * While not directly an SDWebImage vulnerability, if the image hosting server is compromised, attackers can inject malicious images directly at the source.
            * The application using SDWebImage will then download and potentially cache these malicious images.
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] DNS Spoofing:**
            * The attacker manipulates the DNS resolution process to redirect the application's image download requests to a malicious server controlled by the attacker.
            * The application then downloads images from this malicious server.
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Downgrade Attacks (e.g., forcing HTTP instead of HTTPS):**
            * The attacker manipulates network traffic to force the application to use an unencrypted HTTP connection instead of HTTPS for image downloads.
            * This allows the attacker to perform MITM attacks (as described in Cache Poisoning) more easily.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependencies of SDWebImage**](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_dependencies_of_sdwebimage.md)

* **Goal:** Execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., libjpeg, libpng):**
            * SDWebImage relies on other libraries (like libjpeg for JPEG decoding and libpng for PNG decoding).
            * If these underlying libraries have known vulnerabilities, and the application is using a vulnerable version (through SDWebImage), attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by providing specially crafted images.
            * This can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.
