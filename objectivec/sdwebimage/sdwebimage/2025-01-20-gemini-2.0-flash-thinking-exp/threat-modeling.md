# Threat Model Analysis for sdwebimage/sdwebimage

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Image Download](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_image_download.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic managed by `SDWebImageDownloader` while the application is fetching an image. The attacker can replace the legitimate image with a malicious one by exploiting the lack of enforced HTTPS or vulnerabilities in TLS implementation within the networking layer used by SDWebImage.
    *   **Impact:** Displaying incorrect or malicious content to the user, potentially leading to phishing attacks, misinformation, or exploitation of other vulnerabilities if the malicious image triggers a client-side vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `SDWebImageDownloader`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce HTTPS for all image URLs used with SDWebImage. Implement certificate pinning within the `SDWebImageDownloader` configuration for critical image sources to prevent trust in rogue certificates.

## Threat: [Serving Malicious Images from Compromised Servers](./threats/serving_malicious_images_from_compromised_servers.md)

*   **Description:** The application, using `SDWebImageDownloader`, fetches an image from a compromised server. This server serves a malicious image specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities within the image decoding process handled by `SDWebImageCoder`.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for application crashes, memory corruption, or even remote code execution due to vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries used by `SDWebImageCoder`. Displaying harmful or inappropriate content to the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** `SDWebImageDownloader`, `SDWebImageCoder`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Carefully vet image sources and implement robust input validation on image URLs passed to SDWebImage. Regularly update SDWebImage to benefit from updates to its dependencies, including the image decoding libraries used by `SDWebImageCoder`. Implement error handling for image decoding failures within the `SDWebImageCoder` delegate methods.

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities Leading to Crashes or Exploitation](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities_leading_to_crashes_or_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** `SDWebImageCoder` utilizes underlying image decoding libraries. A specially crafted malicious image, fetched and processed by SDWebImage, can exploit vulnerabilities within these decoding libraries, leading to application crashes or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, memory corruption, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `SDWebImageCoder`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update SDWebImage to ensure the latest versions of its image decoding dependencies are used. Be aware of reported vulnerabilities in common image formats and decoding libraries. Implement robust error handling during image decoding within the `SDWebImageCoder` delegate methods.
