## Attack Tree Path: [*** Trigger Buffer Overflow in Image Decoder [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_image_decoder__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious image that, when processed by SDWebImage's image decoding library, causes a buffer overflow. This overwrites memory, potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Conditions:** This requires a vulnerable image decoding library within SDWebImage and the ability for the attacker to serve this malicious image to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Controls Image Source [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_controls_image_source__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a critical enabling condition for several other attacks. If an attacker can control where the application fetches images from, they can serve malicious images designed to exploit various vulnerabilities.
    *   **Scenarios:** This can occur through:
        *   `*** Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Image Request`: Intercepting network traffic and replacing legitimate images with malicious ones.
        *   `*** Application Loads Image from User-Controlled URL`: The application allows users to specify image URLs, which can be pointed to attacker-controlled servers hosting malicious images.

## Attack Tree Path: [SDWebImage Uses Vulnerable Image Decoding Library [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sdwebimage_uses_vulnerable_image_decoding_library__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  SDWebImage relies on underlying libraries for decoding various image formats. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs), attackers can exploit them by serving specially crafted images.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly updating SDWebImage is crucial to patch these underlying library vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Cache Poisoning](./attack_tree_paths/cache_poisoning.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manages to serve a malicious image that gets cached by SDWebImage. Subsequently, when the application attempts to load the legitimate image, it retrieves the attacker's malicious version from the cache.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to defacement, serving malware to users, or other malicious activities depending on the nature of the malicious image.
    *   **Condition:** This often requires the attacker to control the image source for a resource shared by multiple users or the ability to manipulate the cache directly (less common).

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts the network communication between the application and the image server. They then replace the legitimate image being downloaded with a malicious one.
    *   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to deliver malicious images to the application, potentially exploiting image processing vulnerabilities or tricking users.
    *   **Condition:** This is more likely on insecure networks or if HTTPS is not properly enforced.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploiting Insecure Connection (If HTTPS is not enforced properly)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_connection__if_https_is_not_enforced_properly_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows loading images over HTTP instead of HTTPS, the communication is unencrypted and vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    *   **Impact:** This makes the application susceptible to having malicious images injected during download.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Loading Images from Untrusted Sources [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/loading_images_from_untrusted_sources__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application allows loading images from sources that are not under the application's control or are not properly validated. This could be through user-provided URLs or by fetching images from untrusted third-party servers.
    *   **Impact:** This directly allows attackers to serve malicious images, potentially leading to various exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Using Outdated or Vulnerable SDWebImage Version [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/using_outdated_or_vulnerable_sdwebimage_version__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using an older version of SDWebImage means the application is vulnerable to any known security flaws that have been patched in later versions.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can leverage publicly known exploits targeting these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly updating SDWebImage is essential to address this risk.
