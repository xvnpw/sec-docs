# Threat Model Analysis for sdwebimage/sdwebimage

## Threat: [Image Bomb Denial of Service](./threats/image_bomb_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Image Bomb Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL to a specially crafted, extremely large image (e.g., a very high-resolution image or a "decompression bomb" that expands to a huge size in memory). SDWebImage attempts to download and decode this image, consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, unresponsiveness, device-wide performance degradation, excessive data usage, battery drain.
    *   **Affected SDWebImage Component:** `SDWebImageDownloader` (downloading the image), `SDWebImageManager` (managing the download and potentially caching), Image Decoders (underlying system libraries *used by* SDWebImage for decoding).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set `downloadTimeout` on `SDWebImageDownloader` to a reasonable value (e.g., 5-10 seconds).
        *   Limit `maxConcurrentDownloads` on `SDWebImageDownloaderConfig`.
        *   Use `SDWebImageContext.imageScaleFactor` to downscale large images if the display size is known.
        *   Implement server-side checks (if you control the image source) to limit the maximum image size.  This is *indirect*, but still a good practice.
        *   Monitor memory usage and implement circuit breakers.
        *   Use progressive loading (`SDWebImageProgressiveLoad`) to display partial images and allow early cancellation.

## Threat: [Excessive Image Request Denial of Service](./threats/excessive_image_request_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Excessive Image Request Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the application with requests for many different images (potentially non-existent or rapidly changing URLs), overwhelming SDWebImage's download queue and caching mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, resource exhaustion (memory, network), slow image loading for legitimate requests.
    *   **Affected SDWebImage Component:** `SDWebImageDownloader` (handling numerous requests), `SDWebImageManager` (managing the queue and cache), `SDImageCache` (potentially filling up with useless data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement client-side rate limiting on image requests.
        *   Implement server-side rate limiting (if you control the image source) - *indirect* but important.
        *   Configure `SDImageCache` with appropriate `maxMemoryCost` and `maxDiskSize` limits.
        *   Use a CDN to offload image serving - *indirect* but helpful.

## Threat: [Image Decoding Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/image_decoding_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Image Decoding Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the underlying image decoding libraries (e.g., libjpeg, libpng) that SDWebImage uses.  The attacker aims to cause a crash or potentially achieve remote code execution.  SDWebImage is the *conduit* for this attack.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for remote code execution (RCE) â€“ though RCE is less likely due to modern OS security features.
    *   **Affected SDWebImage Component:**  Indirectly affects all components that handle image data, as SDWebImage relies on system image decoders. Specifically, any component using `UIImage` or `NSImage` *after* SDWebImage has downloaded and passed the data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for crashes)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the OS and SDWebImage up-to-date to receive security patches for image decoding libraries.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   Consider server-side image re-encoding to a known-safe format - *indirect* but effective.
        *   (Advanced) Use `SDWebImageCoderHelper` for additional image validation before system decoding. This is a more complex, but direct mitigation.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Image Substitution (If using SDWebImage with plain HTTP)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__image_substitution__if_using_sdwebimage_with_plain_http_.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Image Substitution (If using SDWebImage with plain HTTP)
    *   **Description:** If, and *only if*, the application uses SDWebImage to fetch images over plain HTTP (not HTTPS), an attacker can intercept the network traffic and replace a legitimate image with a malicious one. SDWebImage would then download and display the attacker's image.  This is *directly* related to how SDWebImage is *used*, not an inherent flaw.
    *   **Impact:** Display of malicious or inappropriate content, potential for phishing attacks (e.g., a fake login form disguised as an image).
    *   **Affected SDWebImage Component:** `SDWebImageDownloader` (fetching the image), `SDWebImageManager`, and any component displaying the downloaded image.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use HTTPS for all image URLs.** This completely eliminates this threat.
        *   Consider certificate pinning (adds complexity but increases security).
