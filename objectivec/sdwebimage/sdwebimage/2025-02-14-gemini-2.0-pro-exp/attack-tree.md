## Attack Tree Path: [1. Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Image Data](./attack_tree_paths/1__unauthorized_access_to_sensitive_image_data.md)

*   **1.1. Bypass Caching Mechanism (URL Manipulation)**
    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to bypass the intended caching mechanism to access images they should not have permission to view.
    *   **1.1.1. Predictable Cache Keys [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The application uses easily guessable or predictable methods to generate cache keys for images.  An attacker can craft URLs that match these keys, even if they don't have legitimate access to the underlying image.
        *   **Example:** If the cache key is simply a hash of the image URL, the attacker can try different URLs until they find one that hits a cached image.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use strong, unpredictable cache keys. Include a user-specific, randomly generated salt in the cache key generation. Implement authorization checks *before* serving cached images.
    *   **1.1.2. Insufficient Cache Key Validation [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The application doesn't properly validate the components of the cache key before using it.  An attacker might be able to manipulate parts of the key to bypass access controls.
        *   **Example:** If the cache key includes a user ID, but the application doesn't verify that the requesting user matches the ID in the key, an attacker could change the user ID to access another user's images.
        *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly validate all parts of the cache key before using it. Ensure the key corresponds to the requesting user and their permissions.

*   **1.2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Image Decoding/Transformation**
    *   **1.2.1. Known CVEs {CRITICAL NODE} [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in SDWebImage or its dependencies (like libwebp, libjpeg-turbo). These vulnerabilities might allow for arbitrary code execution or unauthorized data access.
        *   **Example:** An older version of libwebp might have a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by a specially crafted image.
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep SDWebImage and *all* its dependencies up-to-date. Regularly check for security advisories and CVEs. Use a dependency vulnerability scanner.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Image Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/2__image_manipulation.md)

*   **2.1. Replace Legitimate Images with Malicious or Inappropriate Content**
    *   **2.1.1. URL Manipulation [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates URL parameters (e.g., those controlling image resizing or transformations) to cause the server to fetch and display a different image than intended.
        *   **Example:** If the URL includes `?width=100&height=100`, the attacker might change it to `?width=10000&height=10000` (potentially causing a DoS) or point it to a completely different image URL.
        *   **Mitigation:** Validate and sanitize all URL parameters. Use strict whitelisting of allowed parameter values. Avoid exposing transformation parameters directly in the URL. Use signed URLs or tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **3.1. Resource Exhaustion (Memory/CPU)**
    *   **3.1.1. Large Image Downloads [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker requests extremely large images, consuming excessive server resources (memory and CPU).
        *   **Example:** Repeatedly requesting a multi-gigabyte image file.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **3.1.1.1 Limit Image Size {CRITICAL NODE}:** Implement strict limits on the maximum image size that can be downloaded or processed.
    *   **3.1.2. Many Concurrent Requests [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker floods the server with a large number of image requests, overwhelming its capacity to handle them.
        *   **Example:** Using a botnet to send thousands of image requests simultaneously.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **3.1.2.1 Rate Limiting {CRITICAL NODE}:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a single user or IP address can make within a given time period.
