# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `sdwebimage`, is a library for asynchronous image downloading, caching, and displaying for iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS and visionOS.

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a robust and efficient way for applications to display images from the web.
  - Improve application performance by handling image loading and caching asynchronously and efficiently.
  - Simplify the process of image management for developers, reducing development time and complexity.
  - Ensure compatibility and stability across different Apple platforms and operating system versions.

- Business Goals:
  - Increase developer adoption of the library within the Apple ecosystem.
  - Maintain a high level of performance and reliability to meet the demands of modern applications.
  - Continuously improve the library with new features and optimizations based on community feedback and platform advancements.
  - Establish `sdwebimage` as the de-facto standard for image handling in Apple development.

- Business Risks:
  - Performance bottlenecks in image loading or caching could negatively impact application user experience.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors to compromise applications using it.
  - Incompatibility issues with new operating system versions or hardware could lead to application crashes or malfunctions.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to stagnation and eventual obsolescence of the library.
  - Incorrect handling of image data could lead to unexpected application behavior or security issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: HTTPS is enforced by default for image downloads, ensuring encrypted communication channel. Implemented within the networking layer of the library.
  - security control: Image data is validated to some extent during decoding to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior. Implemented within the image decoding components.
  - security control: Caching mechanism is implemented to reduce network requests and improve performance. Implemented within the caching components.
  - security control: Memory management is handled to prevent memory leaks and crashes. Implemented throughout the library.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities in underlying libraries used for networking or image processing. Risk is mitigated by regular updates of dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service attacks if the library is forced to process a large number of malicious or oversized images. Risk is mitigated by OS level resource limits and library's internal resource management.
  - accepted risk: Information disclosure if cached images are not properly protected on the device file system. Risk is mitigated by OS level file system permissions and application's responsibility to protect sensitive data.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement input validation for image URLs to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning to automatically identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Consider implementing integrity checks for downloaded images to ensure they haven't been tampered with during transit.
  - security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using the library, especially regarding handling sensitive image data.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Applications using `sdwebimage` are responsible for handling authentication to image sources if required. `sdwebimage` should support passing authentication headers or tokens provided by the application to the image server.
  - Authorization:
    - Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using `sdwebimage`. The library itself does not handle authorization. Applications should ensure that users are authorized to access the images being displayed.
  - Input Validation:
    - Image URLs provided to `sdwebimage` should be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure they conform to expected formats.
    - Image data received from the network should be validated to prevent processing of malicious or malformed image files that could lead to crashes or vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - All network communication for downloading images should be encrypted using HTTPS.
    - If sensitive images are cached, consider providing options for encrypting the cached data at rest. This is likely the responsibility of the application using the library, but the library could provide extension points or guidance.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Displaying images within applications is a critical process for applications that rely on visual content. Failure or compromise of this process can lead to a degraded user experience, loss of functionality, or reputational damage. The criticality level depends on the specific application and its reliance on images. For some applications, it might be core functionality, while for others, it might be less critical.

- Data to Protect:
  - Cached Images: The primary data to protect are the images cached by the library.
    - Sensitivity: The sensitivity of cached images depends entirely on the application using `sdwebimage`. For applications displaying public images (e.g., stock photos, website logos), the sensitivity is low. However, if an application uses `sdwebimage` to display personal photos, medical images, or other sensitive visual data, the sensitivity is high.
  - Application Data:  While `sdwebimage` itself doesn't directly handle sensitive application data, vulnerabilities in the library could potentially be exploited to compromise the application and access other sensitive data managed by the application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to provide a widely adopted and reliable image handling library for Apple platforms.
  - Assumption: Performance and ease of use are key drivers for adoption.
  - Question: What are the specific target applications or use cases for `sdwebimage`? Are there any specific industries or application types that are particularly important?
  - Question: What is the acceptable level of risk for security vulnerabilities in the library? Is it acceptable to prioritize rapid feature development over extensive security testing in certain situations?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Applications using `sdwebimage` are responsible for handling user authentication and authorization to image sources.
  - Assumption: HTTPS is considered a baseline security control for image downloads.
  - Question: Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements that need to be considered (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) related to image data handling?
  - Question: What is the process for reporting and responding to security vulnerabilities in `sdwebimage`? Is there a security contact or a vulnerability disclosure policy?

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: The current architecture is primarily focused on performance and functionality, with security being considered but not necessarily the primary driver.
  - Assumption: The library is designed to be lightweight and have minimal dependencies.
  - Question: Are there any plans to introduce features that would require handling more sensitive data or introduce new security considerations (e.g., image encryption, watermarking)?
  - Question: What are the performance requirements for image loading and caching? Are there specific performance metrics that need to be met?
