# Threat Model Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `blockskit` library relies on other third-party libraries (dependencies). These dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities. If the application uses a version of `blockskit` with vulnerable dependencies, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities. This exploitation would directly target code within the libraries that `blockskit` utilizes.

**Impact:** Depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, attackers could potentially achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the application, leading to full system compromise. Other impacts could include denial of service or information disclosure by exploiting flaws within the dependency's code that `blockskit` utilizes.

**Affected Component:** The `blockskit` library's dependency tree, specifically the vulnerable dependency (e.g., a specific version of a library used for parsing, data manipulation, etc.). This is identified in `blockskit`'s `package.json` or similar dependency management files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `blockskit` library to the latest stable version. Newer versions often include updates to address vulnerabilities in their dependencies.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in `blockskit`'s dependencies.
* Investigate and update vulnerable dependencies identified by the scanning tools, even if it requires updating `blockskit` or using a different version if necessary.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) practices to continuously monitor and manage the security risks associated with open-source dependencies.
