# Attack Surface Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities__xss_.md)

**Description:**  Malicious scripts can be injected into the application's UI through data used by Blockskit for rendering, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**How Blockskit Contributes:** If Blockskit renders user-provided data or data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, it becomes a conduit for XSS attacks. The library's rendering logic might interpret malicious strings as executable code.

**Example:** An attacker injects a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which is then rendered by Blockskit without sanitization, causing the alert to pop up in other users' browsers.

**Impact:**  Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided data and data from external sources *before* passing it to Blockskit for rendering. Use a robust HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify.
* **Contextual Output Encoding:** Ensure Blockskit (or the application code using it) properly encodes data based on the context where it's being rendered (e.g., HTML escaping for text content, attribute encoding for HTML attributes).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Logic Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/client-side_logic_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate the client-side JavaScript code or data associated with Blockskit components to alter the application's behavior or bypass security checks.

**How Blockskit Contributes:** If Blockskit relies on client-side logic for critical functionality or security checks within the rendered blocks, it creates an opportunity for manipulation. The library's structure might expose data or functions that can be tampered with.

**Example:** Blockskit renders a button that should only be enabled after a specific condition is met. An attacker modifies the JavaScript code to bypass this check and enable the button prematurely, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** Circumvention of security controls, unauthorized actions, data manipulation, unexpected application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Server-Side Enforcement:**  Enforce all critical logic and security checks on the server-side. Do not rely solely on client-side logic provided by Blockskit for security.
* **Code Obfuscation (Limited Effectiveness):** While not a primary defense, obfuscating client-side JavaScript can make it slightly harder for attackers to understand and manipulate the code.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Review the client-side code and how Blockskit is used to identify potential areas for manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration and Customization Risks](./attack_surfaces/configuration_and_customization_risks.md)

**Description:** Insecure configuration options or poorly written custom block implementations within Blockskit can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How Blockskit Contributes:** If Blockskit allows for custom block implementations or has configuration options that, if misused, can create security holes, it expands the attack surface.

**Example:** A developer creates a custom Blockskit block that makes uncontrolled network requests to arbitrary URLs, allowing an attacker to potentially exfiltrate data or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, SSRF, data exfiltration, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Configuration Practices:**  Follow security best practices when configuring Blockskit. Avoid insecure defaults and carefully review all configuration options.
* **Secure Development Practices for Custom Blocks:**  Implement secure coding practices when developing custom Blockskit blocks. Avoid executing arbitrary code or making uncontrolled network requests.
* **Code Reviews for Custom Blocks:**  Thoroughly review the code of any custom Blockskit blocks for potential security vulnerabilities.
