# Attack Surface Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Attack Surface: [1. Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/1__deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:**  The process of converting serialized block data (e.g., JSON) back into usable objects. BlocksKit inherently performs this operation, making it a direct attack vector if the input is untrusted.
    *   **How BlocksKit Contributes:** BlocksKit's core functionality *requires* serialization and deserialization of block data. This is the direct point of vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a crafted JSON payload that, upon deserialization by BlocksKit (or a library it uses), triggers the execution of arbitrary code. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process itself or leveraging unsafe deserialization practices.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement a *strict* whitelist of allowed block types and properties *before* deserialization. Reject any non-conforming data.
        *   **Safe Deserialization:**  Use a secure deserialization library or technique that is specifically designed to prevent code execution during deserialization. Avoid any method that could potentially execute arbitrary code from the input (e.g., `eval()`, unsafe `pickle` usage).
        *   **Schema Validation:** Use a schema validation library (e.g., `jsonschema`, `ajv`) to enforce the structure and data types of the block data *before* deserialization. This adds a strong layer of defense.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [2. Block Type/Property Manipulation (Leading to High-Severity Issues)](./attack_surfaces/2__block_typeproperty_manipulation__leading_to_high-severity_issues_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject unexpected block types or manipulate properties to cause vulnerabilities *specifically enabled by BlocksKit's handling of these blocks*. This focuses on cases where the manipulation directly leverages BlocksKit's features to achieve a high-severity impact.
    *   **How BlocksKit Contributes:** BlocksKit's system of defining and handling block types and properties creates the *mechanism* for this attack. The vulnerability lies in how BlocksKit (or its interaction with application code) processes these manipulated blocks.
    *   **Example:**
        *   An attacker injects a custom block type that, while seemingly harmless, interacts with BlocksKit's internal rendering or data handling in a way that triggers a previously unknown vulnerability within BlocksKit itself (e.g., a buffer overflow in a rarely used rendering path). This is distinct from a vulnerability in *application* code handling the block; it's a vulnerability *within BlocksKit* triggered by the manipulated block.
        *   An attacker manipulates a property that controls resource allocation within BlocksKit (if such a property exists), leading to a denial-of-service condition *specifically within BlocksKit's processing*, not just general application resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially RCE (if a vulnerability within BlocksKit is triggered), Denial of Service (specifically targeting BlocksKit's internal processing), or other high-severity issues depending on the specific vulnerability within BlocksKit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Block Types:** Maintain a strict, *minimal* whitelist of allowed block types. This reduces the attack surface within BlocksKit.
        *   **Rigorous Property Validation:** Implement extremely thorough validation of *all* block properties, including type checking, length limits, value constraints, and sanitization, *specifically considering how BlocksKit will process these properties*.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Conduct fuzz testing of BlocksKit itself, specifically targeting the block parsing, deserialization, and rendering logic with a wide variety of malformed and unexpected block data. This helps identify vulnerabilities within BlocksKit.
        *   **Security Audits of BlocksKit:**  If feasible, consider commissioning or conducting a security audit of the BlocksKit library itself, focusing on the areas highlighted above.

## Attack Surface: [3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly affecting BlocksKit)](./attack_surfaces/3__dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_affecting_blockskit_.md)

*    **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in BlocksKit's own dependencies, which can be directly exploited through the use of BlocksKit.
    *   **How BlocksKit Contributes:** BlocksKit, as a library, relies on other libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, using BlocksKit exposes the application to those vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A dependency used by BlocksKit for JSON parsing has a known, high-severity vulnerability that allows for remote code execution. An attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted block data that triggers the vulnerability in the dependency *through* BlocksKit's use of that dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, but could include RCE, information disclosure, or other high-severity issues.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management and Scanning:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, yarn, pip) and regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated vulnerability scanners.
        *   **Update Dependencies:** Keep BlocksKit and *all* of its dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. Prioritize updates that address known high or critical severity vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for information related to BlocksKit and its dependencies.
