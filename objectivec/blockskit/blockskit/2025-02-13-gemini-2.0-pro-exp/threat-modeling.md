# Threat Model Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Threat: [Invalid Block Header Processing](./threats/invalid_block_header_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a block with an invalid header (e.g., incorrect proof-of-work, invalid timestamp, manipulated Merkle root) and sends it to the `blockskit` instance. The attacker aims to disrupt the node's state or trigger unexpected behavior *within blockskit's processing logic*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential chain split if the invalid block is accepted by some nodes due to a `blockskit` bug.
    *   Denial-of-service if `blockskit` crashes or enters an infinite loop while processing the invalid header.
    *   Wasted resources (CPU, memory) within `blockskit` processing invalid data.
    *   Incorrect state representation within the application due to `blockskit`'s flawed validation.
*   **Affected Component:** `blockskit.chain.ChainManager` (or similar component responsible for block validation and chain management), specifically functions related to header validation (e.g., `validate_header()`, `process_block()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement rigorous header validation checks within the `ChainManager` (or equivalent component).  Verify proof-of-work/proof-of-stake, timestamp validity, Merkle root integrity, and adherence to all consensus rules.  Ensure these checks are performed *before* any further processing of the block. Use well-tested cryptographic libraries.
    *   **Developer:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid headers without crashing or entering an unstable state *within blockskit*.
    *   **Developer:**  Fuzz test the header validation functions with a wide range of malformed inputs.

## Threat: [Transaction Signature Bypass](./threats/transaction_signature_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a transaction with an invalid or missing signature but manages to bypass `blockskit`'s signature verification, allowing the transaction to be processed as if it were valid.  This *specifically targets a bug or flaw in blockskit's signature verification logic*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized spending of funds if the transaction involves transferring assets (and `blockskit` is involved in wallet functionality).
    *   Execution of unauthorized smart contract code (if `blockskit` handles smart contract interactions).
    *   Corruption of the blockchain state if the invalid transaction is included in a block due to `blockskit`'s failure.
    *   Loss of trust in the application due to `blockskit`'s vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** `blockskit.transactions.Transaction` (or similar class representing transactions), specifically the `verify_signature()` method (or equivalent). Also potentially `blockskit.mempool.Mempool` (if transactions are added to the mempool without proper validation *by blockskit*).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use a well-vetted and widely used cryptographic library for signature verification (e.g., `secp256k1` for Bitcoin-like signatures).  Avoid implementing custom cryptographic code.
    *   **Developer:** Ensure that signature verification is performed *before* any other processing of the transaction *within blockskit*.
    *   **Developer:**  Thoroughly test the `verify_signature()` method with a variety of valid and invalid signatures, including edge cases and known attack vectors.
    *   **Developer:**  Implement multiple layers of signature verification *within blockskit* (e.g., in the `Transaction` class, in the `Mempool`, and again during block validation).

## Threat: [RPC Interface Abuse (Internal Logic Flaws)](./threats/rpc_interface_abuse__internal_logic_flaws_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities *within blockskit's RPC interface implementation* to execute unauthorized commands, retrieve sensitive data, or cause a denial-of-service. This focuses on flaws *within blockskit's code*, not just general RPC security best practices.  This includes vulnerabilities like improper input sanitization leading to code injection *within blockskit*, or logic errors that bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data managed *by blockskit* (e.g., if `blockskit` has internal state related to private keys, even if it shouldn't).
    *   Unauthorized modification of the node's state *through blockskit's flawed logic*.
    *   Denial-of-service by overwhelming the RPC interface due to a `blockskit` vulnerability.
    *   Remote code execution *within the context of blockskit* if a vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `blockskit.rpc.RPCServer` (or similar component handling RPC requests), and all individual RPC methods exposed by the server (e.g., `get_block()`, `send_transaction()`, `get_balance()`).  The vulnerability must be *within blockskit's implementation* of these methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if private keys are exposed or RCE is possible *due to a blockskit bug*).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all RPC methods *within blockskit's code*.  Use a well-defined schema for request and response data.
    *   **Developer:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms *within blockskit's RPC handling*.
    *   **Developer:**  Use rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding the RPC interface, specifically addressing any vulnerabilities *within blockskit's rate limiting implementation*.
    *   **Developer:**  Avoid exposing unnecessary or dangerous RPC methods *through blockskit*.
    *   **Developer:**  Regularly audit the RPC interface *implementation within blockskit* for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption in Data Serialization/Deserialization](./threats/memory_corruption_in_data_serializationdeserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how `blockskit` serializes and deserializes blockchain data (e.g., blocks, transactions) to trigger memory corruption *within blockskit's memory space*, potentially leading to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or denial-of-service. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within blockskit's serialization/deserialization code*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial-of-service due to crashes or hangs of `blockskit`.
    *   Remote code execution if the attacker can control the corrupted memory *within blockskit's process*.
    *   Data corruption if the memory corruption affects critical data structures *within blockskit*.
*   **Affected Component:** Any component that handles serialization/deserialization of blockchain data, such as `blockskit.transactions.Transaction`, `blockskit.chain.Block`, and potentially `blockskit.p2p.NetworkManager` (if it serializes/deserializes messages *internally*). Specific functions like `serialize()`, `deserialize()`, `from_bytes()`, `to_bytes()` are likely targets.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if RCE is possible *within blockskit*)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use a memory-safe language whenever possible (e.g., Python, Go, Java) for handling serialization/deserialization *within blockskit*.
    *   **Developer:** If using a language with manual memory management, use well-vetted serialization libraries and follow secure coding practices to prevent buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and other memory corruption vulnerabilities *within blockskit's code*.
    *   **Developer:**  Thoroughly test the serialization/deserialization functions *within blockskit* with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including fuzz testing.
    *   **Developer:**  Implement runtime checks to detect memory corruption (e.g., using memory sanitizers, address sanitizers) *within blockskit's execution environment*.
