# Threat Model Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Threat: [Malicious Block Injection via User Input](./threats/malicious_block_injection_via_user_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user input to inject malicious JSON or specific block elements into block structures generated using `blockskit`. When these malformed blocks are sent to Slack, it can trick users or expose sensitive information within Slack.

**Impact:** Users within Slack could be tricked into performing unintended actions (e.g., clicking phishing links). Sensitive information displayed in the block could be exposed.

**Affected Component:** Block Definition (how the application constructs blocks using `blockskit`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user inputs used in block definitions. Use allow-lists for allowed block elements and properties.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Block Kit Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_block_kit_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the `blockskit` library itself by crafting specific block structures that trigger unexpected behavior or errors in the application or within Slack's rendering.

**Impact:** The application might crash or become unresponsive. Slack's rendering of blocks might be disrupted. In severe cases, could potentially lead to XSS within the Slack client (though less likely due to Slack's sanitization).

**Affected Component:** Core `blockskit` library (parsing and validation logic).

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update the `blockskit` library to the latest version. Monitor the `blockskit` repository for security advisories.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Interaction Payloads](./threats/manipulation_of_interaction_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious interaction payloads sent from Slack to the application, leveraging their knowledge of the block structure defined by `blockskit`. This can trigger unintended actions or bypass authorization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions could be performed. Application state could be corrupted. Sensitive data could be accessed or modified without authorization.

**Affected Component:** Interaction Payload Handling (how the application processes data received from Slack based on `blockskit` definitions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly validate the authenticity and integrity of interaction payloads. Verify `callback_id` and `action_id`. Use state parameters and cryptographic signatures.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Interaction Payloads](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_interaction_payloads.md)

**Description:** The application's deserialization of JSON interaction payloads (structured based on `blockskit`) is vulnerable. An attacker could craft malicious payloads to trigger arbitrary code execution during deserialization.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, leading to data breaches or complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Interaction Payload Deserialization (the process of converting the JSON payload into usable data structures, influenced by `blockskit`'s structure).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Use secure deserialization libraries and practices. Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into complex objects. Implement strict validation of the payload structure before deserialization.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `blockskit` Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__blockskit__dependencies.md)

**Description:** `blockskit` relies on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect the security of the application.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** `blockskit` Dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies, can be High or Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly audit and update the dependencies of `blockskit`. Use dependency management tools to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Use of Deprecated or Insecure Features in `blockskit`](./threats/use_of_deprecated_or_insecure_features_in__blockskit_.md)

**Description:** Older versions of `blockskit` might contain deprecated features with known security issues. Using these features exposes the application to vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to attacks targeting these deprecated features, potentially leading to compromise.

**Affected Component:** Specific `blockskit` Modules or Functions (deprecated or insecure ones).

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the deprecated feature's vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:** Stay updated with `blockskit` documentation and release notes. Avoid using deprecated features and migrate to recommended alternatives.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Block Definitions](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_block_definitions.md)

**Description:** Developers unintentionally include sensitive information (API keys, internal IDs) directly within block definitions created using `blockskit`, which is then exposed in Slack.

**Impact:** Sensitive information is leaked to unauthorized individuals within the Slack workspace, potentially leading to account compromise or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Block Definition (the process of creating and populating block structures using `blockskit`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in block definitions. Use environment variables or secure configuration management. Implement code reviews to identify and remove accidentally included sensitive data.
