## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Blockskit [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_blockskit__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in Blockskit's client-side code to execute malicious actions within users' browsers. This is a high-risk area due to the direct impact on users and the potential for widespread compromise.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Client-side vulnerabilities, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), are prevalent and can lead to severe consequences like account takeover, data theft, and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user. Blockskit, as a UI library, directly handles user input and rendering, making it a prime target for these attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Script via Blockskit Component [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_script_via_blockskit_component__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application through Blockskit components. This can occur if Blockskit doesn't properly sanitize user input or if there are flaws in its rendering logic.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Successful script injection (XSS) allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser, bypassing security controls and potentially stealing sensitive information or manipulating the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Input Sanitization Failure in Blockskit Component [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__input_sanitization_failure_in_blockskit_component__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Blockskit components fail to properly sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in the browser. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts within the data.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Input sanitization failures are a common source of XSS vulnerabilities. If Blockskit components don't encode or sanitize user input, attackers can inject `<script>` tags or other malicious HTML to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Script through User-Controlled Data Passed to Blockskit](./attack_tree_paths/inject_script_through_user-controlled_data_passed_to_blockskit.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers provide malicious input through user-facing elements that is then processed and rendered by Blockskit without proper sanitization, leading to script execution.
    * **Why High-Risk:** This is a direct and common method of exploiting XSS vulnerabilities. If user input is not treated as potentially malicious, it can be used to inject harmful scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Blockskit [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_blockskit__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Blockskit relies on third-party JavaScript libraries that may contain known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Using outdated or vulnerable dependencies is a significant security risk. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to various levels of compromise, including Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client-side or server-side (depending on the nature of the dependency and the vulnerability).

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Blockskit's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_blockskit's_dependencies.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the libraries that Blockskit depends on.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Publicly known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits, making them easier to exploit. Failure to keep dependencies updated leaves the application vulnerable to these known threats.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Integration with Application Logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_integration_with_application_logic__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application's logic for using Blockskit components contains flaws that attackers can exploit to manipulate the application's behavior or gain unauthorized access. This can involve relying on client-side logic for security decisions or mishandling data passed between the application and Blockskit.
    * **Why High-Risk/Critical:** Insecure integration points can create vulnerabilities that bypass intended security mechanisms. If the application trusts client-side logic provided by Blockskit without proper server-side validation, attackers can manipulate this logic to their advantage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flaws in How the Application Uses Blockskit Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flaws_in_how_the_application_uses_blockskit_components.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit weaknesses in how the application developers have implemented Blockskit components, leading to unintended functionality or security breaches.
    * **Why High-Risk:**  Even if Blockskit itself is secure, improper usage can introduce vulnerabilities. This highlights the shared responsibility for security between the library developers and the application developers.
