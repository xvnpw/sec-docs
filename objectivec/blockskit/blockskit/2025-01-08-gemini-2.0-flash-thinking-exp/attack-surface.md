# Attack Surface Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Block Data:](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_block_data.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into block definitions. When these blocks are rendered by the user's browser, the scripts execute.
* **How BlocksKit Contributes:** BlocksKit renders content based on block definitions. If the application doesn't sanitize data within these definitions, BlocksKit will render the malicious script.
* **Example:** A user creates a "text" block with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. Without sanitization, this script executes in another user's browser.
* **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, application defacement, redirection to malicious sites.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement robust server-side validation and context-aware output encoding when rendering block data.
        * Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP).
        * Ensure any built-in BlocksKit sanitization is correctly applied.
        * Regularly update BlocksKit and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [DOM Manipulation and Client-Side Logic Exploitation:](./attack_surfaces/dom_manipulation_and_client-side_logic_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers manipulate the DOM or exploit client-side logic within rendered blocks to cause unintended actions or reveal sensitive information.
* **How BlocksKit Contributes:** BlocksKit creates and manipulates the DOM. Vulnerabilities in BlocksKit's or the application's client-side logic can be exploited to modify the rendered output.
* **Example:** An attacker manipulates CSS or JavaScript associated with a block to hide information or trigger actions on user interaction.
* **Impact:** Information disclosure, client-side denial of service, unauthorized actions.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Ensure secure client-side logic associated with blocks.
        * Implement access controls on client-side interactions.
        * Regularly audit client-side JavaScript code.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Block Definitions:](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_block_definitions.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into block definitions that, when processed by the application or BlocksKit, leads to vulnerabilities beyond simple XSS.
* **How BlocksKit Contributes:** BlocksKit relies on the application to provide block definitions. Lack of validation allows injection of data that exploits weaknesses in how BlocksKit or the application processes it.
* **Example:** Injecting a block definition with a crafted URL that, when processed by the application (triggered by BlocksKit), leads to SSRF.
* **Impact:** Server-side vulnerabilities, unauthorized access to internal resources, data breaches.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement strict schema validation for block definitions.
        * Sanitize and validate all data within block definitions.
        * Be cautious about using data from block definitions for server-side requests.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization of Block Definitions (if applicable):](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_of_block_definitions__if_applicable_.md)

* **Description:** If block definitions are serialized and stored and later deserialized, vulnerabilities could allow arbitrary code execution on the server.
* **How BlocksKit Contributes:** If the application uses an insecure serialization format for block definitions that BlocksKit relies on, it introduces this risk.
* **Example:** A malicious serialized block definition executes arbitrary code when deserialized by the server.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, complete system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * Avoid vulnerable serialization formats for block definitions.
        * Use safer alternatives or implement robust security measures against malicious deserialization.
        * Implement integrity checks for serialized data.
