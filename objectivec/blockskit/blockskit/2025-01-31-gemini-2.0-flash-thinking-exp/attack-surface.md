# Attack Surface Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Attack Surface: [Block Definition Injection](./attack_surfaces/block_definition_injection.md)

**Description:** Blockskit's mechanism for defining and registering blocks is vulnerable to injection if it allows untrusted sources to influence block definitions without proper validation.

**Blockskit Contribution:** Blockskit's design for dynamic block registration or loading from external sources, if not securely implemented, directly enables this attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker leverages Blockskit's block registration API to inject a malicious block definition that executes arbitrary JavaScript on the client-side when rendered, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Data Breach, Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Validation:** Blockskit should enforce rigorous validation and sanitization of all inputs used in block definitions, including names, properties, actions, and rendering logic, *within its own block definition handling mechanisms*.
*   **Secure Block Definition Loading:** Blockskit should provide secure methods for loading block definitions, discouraging or disabling dynamic loading from untrusted sources by default.
*   **Code Review of Blockskit Core:** Developers using Blockskit should review Blockskit's code related to block definition parsing and loading to ensure it is secure against injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Block Configuration Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/block_configuration_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Blockskit's handling of block configurations is vulnerable to manipulation if it doesn't enforce proper validation and authorization on configuration data.

**Blockskit Contribution:** If Blockskit's architecture allows user-provided or external data to directly configure blocks without sufficient validation *within Blockskit's configuration processing*, it creates this attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates block configuration data, passed through Blockskit's configuration mechanisms, to alter the intended behavior of a block, leading to unauthorized data access or actions.

**Impact:**  Data Breach, Unauthorized Access, Privilege Escalation, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Configuration Validation within Blockskit:** Blockskit should provide built-in mechanisms to validate block configurations against expected schemas or rules, preventing malicious or unexpected data from being processed.
*   **Authorization Enforcement:** Blockskit should offer features to enforce authorization checks on block configurations, ensuring only authorized users or processes can modify specific block settings *at the Blockskit level*.
*   **Secure Configuration Handling:** Blockskit's documentation and examples should emphasize secure practices for handling block configurations, discouraging insecure patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Blockskit Uses Deserialization)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_blockskit_uses_deserialization_.md)

**Description:** If Blockskit internally serializes and deserializes block definitions or configurations, it could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks if insecure deserialization practices are used.

**Blockskit Contribution:** If Blockskit's internal implementation relies on insecure deserialization for handling block data, it directly introduces this critical vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized block definition that, when deserialized by Blockskit's internal processes, executes arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Corruption.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Deserialization in Blockskit Core:** Blockskit's developers should avoid using deserialization for handling block definitions and configurations if possible.
*   **Secure Deserialization Practices (If Necessary):** If deserialization is unavoidable, Blockskit must employ secure deserialization libraries and practices, including input validation and object signing, *within its own codebase*.
*   **Regular Security Audits of Blockskit:** Security audits of Blockskit's codebase should specifically examine deserialization practices for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities__xss_.md)

**Description:** If Blockskit's client-side rendering logic doesn't properly handle and escape user-provided data within blocks, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Blockskit Contribution:** Blockskit's client-side rendering components, if not designed with proper output encoding, directly contribute to XSS risks in applications using it.

**Example:** Blockskit renders a text block on the client-side without properly escaping user-provided content. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the text block's data, which then executes in another user's browser.

**Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Session Hijacking, Cookie Theft, Defacement, Redirection to Malicious Sites.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Automatic Output Encoding in Blockskit Rendering:** Blockskit's client-side rendering engine should automatically encode or escape user-provided data by default to prevent XSS.
*   **Secure Templating within Blockskit:** Blockskit should utilize secure templating mechanisms that inherently handle output encoding for common contexts like HTML, JavaScript, and URLs.
*   **Documentation and Best Practices:** Blockskit's documentation should clearly emphasize the importance of output encoding and provide guidance on secure rendering practices for custom blocks.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities (If Blockskit Supports Server-Side Rendering)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering_vulnerabilities__if_blockskit_supports_server-side_rendering_.md)

**Description:** If Blockskit offers server-side rendering capabilities, vulnerabilities like Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) can arise if the rendering process is not secure.

**Blockskit Contribution:** If Blockskit's server-side rendering features rely on insecure template engines or allow uncontrolled external data fetching *within its rendering process*, it introduces SSTI and SSRF attack surfaces.

**Example (SSTI):** An attacker injects malicious code into block configuration data that is processed by Blockskit's server-side template engine, leading to remote code execution on the server.

**Example (SSRF):** An attacker crafts a block configuration that, when rendered server-side by Blockskit, causes the server to make unauthorized requests to internal network resources.

**Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Data Breach, Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for RCE/SSRF) / **High** (for data breach/DoS)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Server-Side Rendering Implementation in Blockskit:** Blockskit's server-side rendering implementation should utilize secure templating engines and avoid dynamic template construction from user input *within its core rendering logic*.
*   **Input Validation for Server-Side Rendering:** Blockskit should validate and sanitize all data used in server-side rendering processes *at the Blockskit level*.
*   **Restrict External Requests from Blockskit Rendering:** Blockskit's server-side rendering should limit and control its ability to make external requests, especially based on user-provided data, to prevent SSRF.
*   **Security Audits of Server-Side Rendering Features:** If Blockskit provides server-side rendering, these features should undergo thorough security audits to identify and mitigate SSTI and SSRF vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration and Insecure Defaults in Blockskit](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_and_insecure_defaults_in_blockskit.md)

**Description:** Blockskit might have insecure default configurations or allow for misconfigurations that weaken the security of applications using it.

**Blockskit Contribution:** If Blockskit ships with insecure default settings or provides configuration options that, if improperly set, can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, it directly contributes to this attack surface.

**Example:** Blockskit's default configuration allows unauthenticated access to block definition APIs, or insecure default permissions for block configurations expose sensitive data.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, Weakened Security Posture, Enablement of other attack vectors.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Defaults in Blockskit:** Blockskit should be configured with secure defaults out-of-the-box, minimizing the attack surface without requiring extensive manual configuration.
*   **Security Hardening Documentation:** Blockskit should provide clear and comprehensive documentation on security hardening, guiding developers on how to securely configure Blockskit and its related components.
*   **Configuration Validation and Warnings:** Blockskit should provide tools or warnings to help developers identify and correct insecure configurations.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege by Default:** Blockskit's default settings should adhere to the principle of least privilege, minimizing default permissions and access rights.
