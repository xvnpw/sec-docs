# Threat Model Analysis for blockskit/blockskit

## Threat: [Blockskit Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/blockskit_library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities present within the Blockskit library's code. This could involve crafting specific inputs or interactions with the application that trigger a vulnerability in Blockskit. Successful exploitation could lead to severe consequences such as remote code execution on the application server, unauthorized access to sensitive data handled by Blockskit, or complete denial of service of the application. The attacker's ability to exploit this depends on the specific vulnerability and the application's exposure of Blockskit functionalities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server.
        *   **High:** Information Disclosure - unauthorized access to sensitive data processed by the application or Blockskit.
        *   **High:** Denial of Service (DoS) - crashing the application or Blockskit, rendering it unusable.
    *   **Blockskit Component Affected:** Core Blockskit library code, potentially affecting any module or function depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability type and exploitability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Updates:**  Prioritize and immediately apply updates to the Blockskit library as soon as security patches are released.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor Blockskit's official repository, security advisories, and community channels for vulnerability disclosures.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the development pipeline to continuously check for known vulnerabilities in Blockskit and its dependencies.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, including code reviews and penetration testing, focusing on the application's Blockskit integration to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Chain Vulnerability in Blockskit Dependencies](./threats/dependency_chain_vulnerability_in_blockskit_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Blockskit relies on external libraries and packages to function. These dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities that are not directly within Blockskit's code but are introduced through its dependency chain. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities by targeting the application's interaction with Blockskit, indirectly triggering the vulnerable code within a dependency. This could lead to similar impacts as direct Blockskit vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server via a dependency vulnerability.
        *   **High:** Information Disclosure - unauthorized access to sensitive data due to a dependency vulnerability.
        *   **High:** Denial of Service (DoS) - crashing the application due to a vulnerability in a Blockskit dependency.
    *   **Blockskit Component Affected:** Blockskit's dependency management and indirectly any Blockskit module or function that relies on a vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific dependency vulnerability and its exploitability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Up-to-date Dependencies:**  Maintain Blockskit's dependencies updated to their latest secure versions. Regularly check for and apply updates to all transitive dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Scanning Tools:** Utilize dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in Blockskit's dependency tree. Integrate these tools into CI/CD pipelines for continuous monitoring.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Implement SCA practices to gain visibility into the application's open-source components (including Blockskit's dependencies) and manage associated security risks proactively.
        *   **Vulnerability Remediation Plan:** Establish a clear plan and process for promptly addressing and remediating vulnerabilities identified in Blockskit's dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Blockskit State Management Manipulation (If Applicable and Vulnerable)](./threats/insecure_blockskit_state_management_manipulation__if_applicable_and_vulnerable_.md)

*   **Description:** If Blockskit provides or encourages state management mechanisms for handling user interactions or application flow, and these mechanisms are insecurely designed or implemented, attackers could manipulate this state. This could involve tampering with state data to bypass authorization checks within Blockskit-driven workflows, modify application behavior in unintended ways, or potentially gain access to sensitive information if state data is not properly protected by Blockskit. The attacker would need to understand how Blockskit manages state and find weaknesses in its implementation or the application's usage of it.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Authorization Bypass - circumventing intended access controls within the application's Blockskit interactions.
        *   **High:** Data Tampering - manipulating application state leading to incorrect or malicious application behavior.
        *   **Medium to High:** Information Disclosure - if sensitive data is stored in Blockskit-managed state and is not adequately protected.
    *   **Blockskit Component Affected:** Blockskit's state management modules or functions (if any exist and are vulnerable). Application's usage of Blockskit's state management features.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if authorization bypass or significant data tampering is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure State Design Review:** Thoroughly review Blockskit's state management design and implementation (if applicable) for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Server-Side Validation:**  Always perform server-side validation of any state data received from Blockskit interactions. Never rely solely on client-side or Blockskit-internal state for security decisions.
        *   **Minimize State Usage:**  Minimize the amount of sensitive information stored in Blockskit-managed state. Prefer stateless approaches or secure server-side session management for sensitive data.
        *   **Secure State Storage (If Client-Side):** If Blockskit utilizes client-side state storage (avoid for sensitive data), ensure it is properly encrypted and integrity-protected to prevent tampering. Consider if Blockskit even *should* be managing sensitive state client-side.
