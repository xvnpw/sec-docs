## Attack Tree Path: [1. Malicious Block Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH_RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__malicious_block_injection__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies an input vector in the application that is used to construct Block Kit block definitions. This could be:
    *   User-submitted forms or text fields where the input is directly incorporated into blocks.
    *   API endpoints that accept data which is then used to generate blocks.
    *   Webhook data from external services that is processed and displayed as blocks.
*   **Exploitation:** The attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by the application and Blockskit, results in the injection of unintended or harmful blocks into Slack messages or surfaces.
*   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Lack of input sanitization and validation on data used to build block definitions. Failure to treat user input as untrusted when constructing blocks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Inject Malicious Block Payload [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH_RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__inject_malicious_block_payload__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Building upon Malicious Block Injection, the attacker focuses on the *payload* within the injected blocks to achieve specific malicious goals.
*   **Exploitation:** The attacker crafts block payloads to:
    *   **Exfiltrate Data (Payload to Exfiltrate Data [HIGH_RISK PATH]):**
        *   Create blocks with actions (e.g., buttons, select menus) that, when interacted with, send sensitive data to an attacker-controlled external URL. This could be achieved by embedding user IDs, session tokens, or other application-specific data in the action's `value` or `url` fields.
        *   Craft blocks that visually reveal sensitive information directly within the Slack UI, perhaps by manipulating text formatting or using code blocks to display data that should be hidden.
    *   **Perform Unauthorized Actions (Payload to Perform Unauthorized Actions [HIGH_RISK PATH]):**
        *   Create blocks with actions that trigger unintended or unauthorized operations within the application. This could involve crafting actions that modify application state in ways not intended by the application's design, potentially bypassing access controls or business logic.
        *   Impersonate legitimate actions by crafting blocks that mimic the appearance and behavior of authorized application features, tricking users into performing actions that benefit the attacker.
*   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**  Lack of output encoding when displaying data in blocks, insecure action handling logic, insufficient authorization checks on actions triggered by blocks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Action Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH_RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__action_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the application's backend logic that handles actions triggered by Block Kit blocks (e.g., button clicks, select menu selections).
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers aim to manipulate or exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes action payloads received from Slack.
*   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Lack of input validation in action handlers, insecure deserialization of action payloads, insufficient authentication or authorization checks for action requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Manipulate Action Payloads [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH_RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__manipulate_action_payloads__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Focuses on directly manipulating the data within action payloads to achieve malicious objectives.
*   **Exploitation:**
    *   **Payload Injection in Action Values [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**
        *   Inject malicious strings or code into the `value` fields of actions. If the application's action handlers do not properly validate or sanitize these values before using them in backend operations (e.g., database queries, system commands), it could lead to injection vulnerabilities (like command injection or NoSQL injection, if applicable).
    *   **Action Spoofing [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**
        *   Craft completely forged action payloads that mimic legitimate action requests but are sent by the attacker directly, bypassing the intended Slack interaction flow. This could involve reverse-engineering the expected action payload structure and sending malicious payloads to the application's action handler endpoints.
*   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Lack of input validation in action handlers, predictable action payload structure, insufficient verification of action origin (e.g., not properly verifying Slack signature if applicable).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit State Management Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH_RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_state_management_weaknesses__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targets the application's state management mechanisms used in conjunction with Blockskit. This is relevant when applications need to maintain state across multiple block interactions or messages.
*   **Exploitation:**
    *   **State Injection/Manipulation [HIGH_RISK PATH]:**
        *   If the application stores state related to blocks (e.g., in a database, session storage, or even within block definitions themselves), attackers might attempt to directly modify this state. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the state storage mechanism or by injecting malicious data into state variables. Manipulating state can lead to bypassing application logic, escalating privileges, or corrupting data.
*   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Insecure state storage mechanisms, lack of access control on state data, insufficient validation of state data before use.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Misconfiguration/Insecure Usage of Blockskit by Application Developer [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH_RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__misconfigurationinsecure_usage_of_blockskit_by_application_developer__critical_node__high_risk_pa_56082535.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a broad category encompassing vulnerabilities arising from developers not using Blockskit securely or misconfiguring the application in ways that introduce security flaws.
*   **Exploitation:**
    *   **Exploit Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH_RISK PATH]:**
        *   Failing to sanitize user inputs before using them in block definitions (leading to Malicious Block Injection).
        *   Not implementing proper input validation in action handlers (leading to Payload Injection in Action Values).
        *   Insecurely storing API keys or secrets related to Blockskit or Slack integration (though less directly a Blockskit vulnerability, it's a common developer error in this context).
*   **Vulnerabilities Exploited:** Lack of developer security awareness, insufficient code reviews, inadequate security testing during development.
