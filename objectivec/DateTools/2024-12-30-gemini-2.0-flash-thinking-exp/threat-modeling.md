- **Threat:** Malicious Input Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities
    - **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted date or time strings as input to the application. DateTools' parsing functions (`dateFromString:format:`) might fail to handle these malformed inputs correctly, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even allowing the attacker to influence the internal state of the application.
    - **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for further exploitation if the parsing error leads to memory corruption or other low-level issues.
    - **Affected Component:** `dateFromString:format:` function, potentially other parsing-related functions.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement strict input validation before passing data to DateTools.
        - Use specific and well-defined date formats when parsing.
        - Implement robust error handling around DateTools parsing functions to catch and manage exceptions gracefully.
        - Consider using alternative, more robust parsing libraries if DateTools' parsing capabilities are insufficient or prone to errors.
