# Threat Model Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of User Images and Metadata](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_user_images_and_metadata.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain unauthorized access to user images and their metadata if the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library inadvertently stores temporary files or cached images in insecure locations on the device's file system. This could occur due to improper handling of temporary files or insecure default storage configurations within the library. An attacker (another app, malware, or user with physical access) could then access these files.
    *   **Impact:** High - Significant privacy breach, unauthorized access to user's personal photos and potentially sensitive metadata (EXIF data, location data). Could lead to identity theft, stalking, or reputational damage. Potential regulatory compliance violations (GDPR, CCPA).
    *   **Affected Component:** File System Storage (Temporary file handling, caching mechanisms within the library module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library's documentation and source code to understand its temporary file handling and caching mechanisms.
        *   Implement application-level checks to ensure temporary files created by the library are deleted immediately after use.
        *   If caching is necessary, implement secure storage mechanisms with appropriate access controls. Avoid default, insecure storage locations.
        *   Consider stripping sensitive metadata (EXIF data) from images before further processing or storage within the application to minimize data exposure.

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide a maliciously crafted image to the application through the image picker functionality provided by `react-native-image-crop-picker`. If the native image processing libraries used by `react-native-image-crop-picker` (or the library's own image handling code) contain vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows), processing this malicious image could lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially memory corruption. In a worst-case scenario, although less likely in a React Native context, it could theoretically be exploited for code execution within the native context.
    *   **Impact:** High - Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption and unpredictable application behavior. In extreme cases, could lead to limited code execution within the native context if vulnerabilities are severe.
    *   **Affected Component:** Image processing functions (cropping, resizing, format conversion) within the native modules used by `react-native-image-crop-picker`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Critical:**  Always keep the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library updated to the latest version. Updates often include bug fixes and security patches for underlying image processing vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement server-side image validation and sanitization if images are uploaded to a backend. This adds a layer of defense against malicious images even if client-side processing has vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to image processing libraries used by React Native and `react-native-image-crop-picker`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The `react-native-image-crop-picker` library relies on native modules and potentially other JavaScript dependencies. If any of these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities, they are indirectly introduced into your application. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through your application's use of `react-native-image-crop-picker`.
    *   **Impact:** High - Vulnerabilities in dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application or the user's device. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, malware installation, or other malicious activities depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependencies of `react-native-image-crop-picker` (native modules, JavaScript libraries).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Critical:** Regularly update the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library and **all** its dependencies to the latest versions. Dependency updates often contain critical security patches.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, or dedicated SCA tools) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to the dependencies of `react-native-image-crop-picker`.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise](./threats/supply_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** The `react-native-image-crop-picker` library itself, or one of its dependencies, could be compromised at the source. This could involve malicious code being injected into the npm package, the GitHub repository, or the distribution channels. If a compromised version of the library is used in your application, it could introduce malicious functionality directly into your app.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - A compromised library could inject malicious code directly into your application. This could lead to a wide range of severe security breaches, including data theft, unauthorized access to user accounts, malware distribution, and complete compromise of the application and potentially user devices.
    *   **Affected Component:** `react-native-image-crop-picker` npm package, its dependencies, and the distribution channels (npm registry, GitHub).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Critical:** Use reputable package managers (npm, yarn) and verify package integrity using checksums or package signing if available. While not always foolproof, it adds a layer of verification.
        *   Monitor the library's repository and npm package for any suspicious activity, unexpected changes, or signs of compromise. Be vigilant about updates and verify the source of updates.
        *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that can detect potential supply chain risks and monitor for changes in dependencies.
        *   Implement code review processes for all library updates, especially for critical libraries like `react-native-image-crop-picker`. Look for any unexpected or suspicious code changes.
        *   In highly sensitive applications, consider using dependency pinning and more rigorous verification processes for all external libraries.
