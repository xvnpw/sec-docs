# Attack Surface Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image File Processing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_file_processing.md)

*   **Description:** Processing of user-provided image files by `react-native-image-crop-picker` can expose the application to vulnerabilities if these files are crafted to exploit weaknesses in underlying image decoding or processing libraries used by the library's native modules.

    *   **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:**  `react-native-image-crop-picker` directly takes image files selected by the user (from gallery or camera) and processes them using native code for cropping, resizing, and format handling. This processing pipeline becomes vulnerable if a malicious image is provided.

    *   **Example:** A user selects a specially crafted TIFF image. When `react-native-image-crop-picker`'s native module attempts to decode this TIFF using a vulnerable native library, it triggers a heap buffer overflow. This overflow allows an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's context.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the device, potentially leading to complete device compromise.
        *   **High:** Memory corruption, leading to application crash and Denial of Service.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Critical:**  Immediately update `react-native-image-crop-picker` to the latest version and monitor for security updates. Patch underlying native dependencies if vulnerabilities are identified and patches are available.
            *   **High:** Implement robust error handling and consider input validation (though image format validation is complex and may not be fully effective against sophisticated exploits). Explore sandboxing or isolating image processing if feasible.
        *   **Users:**
            *   **General:** Keep device operating systems updated to receive security patches for system-level image processing libraries.
            *   **Caution:** Be wary of downloading images from untrusted sources and using them with applications that utilize image processing functionalities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Native Modules](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_native_modules.md)

*   **Description:** `react-native-image-crop-picker` relies on native modules which may depend on third-party native libraries for image processing and other functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these *transitive* dependencies become part of the attack surface introduced by using `react-native-image-crop-picker`.

    *   **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:**  The security posture of `react-native-image-crop-picker` is directly tied to the security of its native module dependencies. If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through the library's functionalities.

    *   **Example:**  `react-native-image-crop-picker`'s native module on Android relies on a specific version of a native image processing library that is later discovered to have a critical remote code execution vulnerability. Applications using `react-native-image-crop-picker` become vulnerable to this RCE if they process images from potentially malicious sources.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a vulnerable dependency allows for it.
        *   **High:**  Local code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or Denial of Service, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (can be, depending on the dependency vulnerability)

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Critical:** Implement a process for regularly auditing and updating both direct and transitive dependencies of `react-native-image-crop-picker`'s native modules. Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
            *   **High:**  Monitor security advisories related to the dependencies used by `react-native-image-crop-picker` and its native modules.  Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the development pipeline.
        *   **Users:**
            *   **General:** Keeping applications and device operating systems updated helps ensure that underlying libraries are patched against known vulnerabilities, although this is less direct control for users regarding specific library dependencies.
