  - Offer a feature-rich and customizable solution to meet diverse developer needs.
  - Maintain a high level of quality and stability to ensure developer trust and adoption.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors in applications that depend on it, leading to data breaches or application instability.
  - Lack of timely security updates and bug fixes could erode developer trust and lead to decreased adoption.
  - Poor performance or compatibility issues could negatively impact the user experience of applications using the library.
  - Legal and compliance risks if the library mishandles user data or violates privacy regulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The library is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Relies on `npm` or `yarn` for dependency management, which includes mechanisms for vulnerability scanning and updates (though not explicitly enforced by the library itself). Implemented: `package.json`, `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`.
  - security control: Platform Security - Leverages the underlying security features of the mobile operating systems (iOS and Android) for image processing and storage. Implemented: Native modules relying on OS APIs.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - The library depends on third-party packages, which may contain security vulnerabilities. Mitigation relies on regular dependency updates.
  - accepted risk: Misuse by Developers - Developers integrating the library might misuse its features or not implement proper security practices in their applications, leading to vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Platform Specific Vulnerabilities - Underlying mobile platforms (iOS/Android) may have undiscovered vulnerabilities that could affect the library's security.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated tools to regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and trigger alerts for necessary updates.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically analyze the codebase for potential security flaws.
  - security control: Code Review Process - Implement mandatory code reviews, including security-focused reviews, for all code changes before merging them into the main branch.
  - security control: Input Validation and Sanitization -  Ensure robust input validation and sanitization within the library to prevent common injection attacks, especially when handling image paths and cropping parameters.
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable as this is a client-side library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application integrating this library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable as this is a client-side library. Authorization is the responsibility of the application integrating this library.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all inputs received from the application using the library, including image paths, cropping dimensions, and options.
    - Requirement: Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., path traversal).
    - Requirement: Implement checks to ensure that provided image paths are within expected boundaries and accessible.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If the library handles sensitive image data in memory or during temporary storage, consider using encryption to protect it. (Note: Based on the library's description, this might not be a primary requirement, but should be considered if sensitive data handling is introduced).
    - Requirement: Ensure secure handling of any cryptographic keys or sensitive data if encryption is implemented.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a secure and reliable image picking and cropping library for React Native developers.
  - Maintaining developer trust and ensuring wide adoption of the library.
  - Protecting the reputation of the library and applications that use it.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - User Images: Potentially sensitive personal photos or images depending on the application context. Sensitivity level varies greatly depending on the application using the library (e.g., healthcare app vs. social media app).
  - Cropping Parameters: Relatively low sensitivity, but could be exploited if not properly validated (e.g., path traversal).
  - Temporary Files: Temporary image files created during processing. Sensitivity depends on the content of the images. Should be securely handled and deleted after use.
