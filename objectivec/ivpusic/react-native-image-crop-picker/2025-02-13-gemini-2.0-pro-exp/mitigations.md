## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Library Options for Least Privilege](./mitigation_strategies/configure_library_options_for_least_privilege.md)

1.  **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Library Options for Least Privilege

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **`multiple` Option:** If your application only needs to select a *single* image or video at a time, set the `multiple` option to `false`. This prevents the user from accidentally (or maliciously, through a compromised app) selecting multiple files.
            ```javascript
            ImagePicker.openPicker({
              multiple: false, // Enforce single selection
              // ... other options
            });
            ```
        2.  **`mediaType` Option:** Specify the exact type of media you need.  Use `'photo'` for images only, `'video'` for videos only, and *avoid* `'any'` unless absolutely necessary. This restricts the user's selection to the appropriate media type.
            ```javascript
            ImagePicker.openPicker({
              mediaType: 'photo', // Only allow image selection
              // ... other options
            });
            ```
        3. **`cropping` Option:** If you intend to crop the image, set `cropping: true`. If you don't need cropping, set it to `false`. This can help prevent unnecessary processing and potential vulnerabilities related to the cropping functionality.
        4. **`cropperCircleOverlay` Option:** If `cropping` is enabled, and you need a circular crop, set `cropperCircleOverlay: true`.
        5. **`width` and `height` Options:** Use these options to control the dimensions of the *cropped* or *resized* image.  This is crucial for:
            *   **DoS Prevention:** Limiting the output dimensions prevents excessively large images from being generated, which could lead to memory exhaustion or performance issues.
            *   **Data Minimization:**  If you only need a small thumbnail, set `width` and `height` to the thumbnail dimensions.
            ```javascript
            ImagePicker.openPicker({
              width: 300, // Maximum width
              height: 400, // Maximum height
              cropping: true,
              // ... other options
            });
            ```
        6. **`compressImageMaxWidth`, `compressImageMaxHeight`, `compressImageQuality` Options:** If you don't need cropping, but want to reduce image size, use these options. `compressImageQuality` is a value between 0 and 1.
        7. **`includeBase64` Option:** Only set `includeBase64: true` if you *absolutely* need the image data as a Base64-encoded string.  Base64 encoding significantly increases the size of the data, which can impact performance. If you're storing the image to a file or uploading it, you likely *don't* need the Base64 representation.
        8. **`includeExif` Option:** Only set `includeExif: true` if you specifically need the EXIF metadata. EXIF data can contain sensitive information (like location), so avoid including it unless necessary.
        9. **`avoidEmptySpaceAroundImage` Option:** Set this option to `true` to avoid empty space around the image.
        10. **Careful use of `freeStyleCropEnabled`:** Only enable if absolutely necessary.
        11. **Review all other options:** Carefully review *all* available options in the `react-native-image-crop-picker` documentation and configure them appropriately for your use case, always prioritizing security and minimizing data exposure.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Media:** (Severity: High) - By limiting the selection scope (single vs. multiple, media type), you reduce the risk of unintended access.
        *   **Data Leakage:** (Severity: Medium) - By minimizing the amount of data processed and included (Base64, EXIF), you reduce the potential for leakage.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium) - By limiting image dimensions, you prevent excessively large images from being processed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly reduces risk by restricting user selection.
        *   **Data Leakage:** Moderately reduces risk by limiting the data handled.
        *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces risk by controlling image dimensions.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `multiple: false` is set in `src/components/ImagePickerComponent.js`.
        *   `width` and `height` are set in `src/components/ImagePickerComponent.js`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **`mediaType` Dynamic Configuration:** The `mediaType` option is currently hardcoded.  *Dynamically set `mediaType` based on the specific use case in different parts of the application.*
        *   **`includeBase64` Review:**  `includeBase64` is currently set to `false`. *Verify that this is correct for all use cases. If Base64 is needed in a specific part of the app, ensure it's only enabled there.*
        *   **`includeExif` Review:** `includeExif` is currently set to `false`. *Verify that this is correct for all use cases. If EXIF data is needed, ensure it's only enabled where necessary and that sensitive information is handled appropriately.*
        *   **Comprehensive Option Review:** *Review all other options in the library's documentation and ensure they are configured securely and optimally for each use case.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Library-Provided Cleanup (If Available)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_library-provided_cleanup__if_available_.md)

2.  **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Library-Provided Cleanup (If Available)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Check for Cleanup Functions:** Thoroughly examine the `react-native-image-crop-picker` documentation and source code to determine if it provides any functions for cleaning up temporary files or resources. This might be a method like `clean()`, `cleanup()`, `destroy()`, or similar.
        2.  **Call Cleanup Function:** If such a function exists, call it *immediately* after you have finished using the library and obtained the final processed image. This should be done in a `finally` block to ensure it's executed even if errors occur.
            ```javascript
            try {
              const image = await ImagePicker.openPicker({ /* ... options ... */ });
              // ... process the image ...
            } catch (error) {
              // ... handle errors ...
            } finally {
              // Call the cleanup function (if it exists)
              ImagePicker.clean() // Example - the actual function name might be different
                .catch(err => console.error("Error cleaning up image picker:", err));
            }
            ```
        3. **Handle Errors:** Wrap the cleanup function call in a `try...catch` block to handle any potential errors that might occur during cleanup.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Leakage of Processed Images:** (Severity: High) - Helps prevent temporary files containing sensitive image data from being left on the device.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Leakage:** Significantly reduces risk if the library provides a reliable cleanup function.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **None:** The current implementation does *not* utilize any library-provided cleanup functions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Check for and Implement Cleanup:** *Thoroughly investigate the library for cleanup functions. If found, implement the cleanup logic as described above in `src/components/ImagePickerComponent.js` and any other places where the library is used.* *This is a high-priority item.*
