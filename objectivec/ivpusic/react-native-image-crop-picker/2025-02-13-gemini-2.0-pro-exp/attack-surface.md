# Attack Surface Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Input](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_input.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide crafted image files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image parsing or processing.
    *   **`react-native-image-crop-picker` Contribution:** The library is the *direct* entry point for image data from potentially untrusted sources (camera, gallery), facilitating the delivery of the malicious payload. It handles the initial interaction with the OS for image selection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted JPEG image with a malformed header that triggers a buffer overflow in the underlying image decoding library used by the OS or a dependency *called through* `react-native-image-crop-picker`.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for DoS/Information Disclosure).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement strict validation *immediately after* receiving the image data from the library. Check file size, dimensions, and use an image sanitization library (e.g., one that re-encodes the image, stripping potentially malicious metadata).  Do *not* rely solely on file extension checks or metadata provided by the library.
            *   **Sandboxing:** If technically feasible, process the image in an isolated process or context (e.g., a separate native module or a sandboxed JavaScript environment) to contain the impact of a successful exploit. This is crucial for mitigating RCE.
            *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `react-native-image-crop-picker`, its dependencies, React Native, and the target OS SDKs updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
            *   **Least Privilege:** Request only the absolutely necessary permissions (e.g., camera access only if taking photos is a core feature).
        *   **User:**
            *   Keep the device's operating system up-to-date (this helps mitigate vulnerabilities in underlying OS image handling libraries).

## Attack Surface: [File Path Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/file_path_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to manipulate file paths returned by the library to access or overwrite files outside the application's sandbox.
    *   **`react-native-image-crop-picker` Contribution:** The library *directly* provides file paths or URIs representing the selected/cropped images. These paths are the *direct* target of manipulation.
    *   **Example:** The library returns a path like `/data/user/0/com.example.app/cache/image.jpg`. An attacker, through a vulnerability in how the application handles this path, might try to modify it to `/data/user/0/com.example.app/../../../../etc/passwd` (path traversal) to read sensitive system files. The library *provided* the initial, manipulable path.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized File Access, File Overwrite, Data Corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Path Validation:** *Never* use the returned paths directly without rigorous validation.  Validate that the path is within the expected application directory and does *not* contain path traversal sequences (`../` or similar). Use platform-specific APIs (e.g., `normalize()` in Node.js, or equivalent functions in Java/Kotlin for Android and Objective-C/Swift for iOS) to canonicalize the path *before* any file system operations.  Check for symbolic links.
            *   **Scoped Storage (Android):** Utilize Android's scoped storage mechanisms to restrict file access to the application's designated directories. This is a strong defense.
            *   **File System Permissions (iOS):** Leverage iOS's file system permissions to limit the application's access to only necessary directories.
            *   Avoid using absolute paths returned by the library if at all possible. Prefer relative paths within the application's sandbox.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Underlying Native Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_underlying_native_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the native iOS or Android libraries used by `react-native-image-crop-picker` for image handling.
    *   **`react-native-image-crop-picker` Contribution:** The library acts as a *direct* bridge to these native components, potentially exposing vulnerabilities that might not be directly accessible otherwise. The library's native code *calls* the vulnerable OS functions.
    *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in the Android media framework's image decoding component is exploited through a crafted image provided *via* `react-native-image-crop-picker`. The library's native code is the conduit for the exploit.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Privilege Escalation, Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical or High (depending on the specific native vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Indirect Mitigation:** Robust input validation and sandboxing (as described in "Malicious Image Input") are *crucial* here. They can significantly reduce the impact, even if they don't prevent the exploitation of the underlying native vulnerability.
            *   **Stay Informed:** Monitor security advisories for the target OS versions and for the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library itself.
            * **Library Choice:** If a specific vulnerability is identified and not patched, consider temporarily switching to an alternative library (if available and secure) until a fix is released.
        *   **User:**
            *   Keep the device's operating system up-to-date. This is the *primary* defense against native OS vulnerabilities, and it's outside the direct control of the application developer.
