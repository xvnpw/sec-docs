## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthorized Data Access](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_data_access.md)

*   **Critical Node: 1.1 Exploit File Path Vuln.**
    *   **Description:** This attack focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in how the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library, or the application using it, handles file paths. If the library or application doesn't properly sanitize or validate file paths used for image selection, cropping, or temporary storage, an attacker could craft a malicious path to access files outside the intended directory. This is a classic "path traversal" vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on implementation. Proper sanitization reduces likelihood significantly.)
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential access to arbitrary files on the device or server, leading to data breaches or further compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Path traversal attacks are well-understood and relatively easy to attempt.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice - Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Standard web application security scanners can often detect basic path traversal. Custom implementations might require more targeted testing.)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Path Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on *all* file paths. Reject paths with suspicious characters or sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`, absolute paths). Use a whitelist approach, allowing only specific, known-safe directories.
        *   **Use Platform-Specific APIs:** Leverage platform-specific APIs (e.g., Android's `getExternalFilesDir()`, iOS's `Documents` directory) to ensure files are stored in designated, sandboxed locations. Avoid hardcoding paths.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation.md)

*   **Critical Node: 2.1 Modify Image Before Upload (Client-Side) [HIGH]**
    *   **Description:** This is the most critical attack vector. An attacker can manipulate the image data *after* the user selects and crops it, but *before* it's uploaded to the server. This could involve:
        *   Injecting malicious code (e.g., JavaScript in an SVG, XSS).
        *   Altering EXIF data (to mislead the application or leak information).
        *   Replacing the image entirely with a different, malicious image.
        *   Modifying image content subtly to cause misinterpretation or errors on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Client-side modification is *always* possible; the attacker controls the client environment.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium - High (The impact depends entirely on the server-side defenses. If the server blindly trusts the client-provided image, the impact can be very high, leading to code execution, data breaches, or other severe consequences. If the server validates thoroughly, the impact is mitigated.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Easily achievable with browser developer tools, proxy tools, or simple scripts.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice - Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (If server-side validation is implemented correctly, the attack will be detected immediately. The *risk* is high because of the potential consequences if validation is *absent*.)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Image Validation (MANDATORY):** *Never* trust client-side image data. Always perform thorough image validation on the server. This includes:
            *   **File Type Verification:** Check that the file is actually an image of the expected type (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF) and not an executable or script disguised as an image.
            *   **Dimensions Check:** Verify that the image dimensions are within expected limits.
            *   **Content Analysis:** Scan the image content for malicious patterns or embedded code. Use a reputable image processing library and keep it updated.
            *   **Re-encoding/Transformation:** Consider re-encoding or transforming the image on the server to remove any potentially malicious code or metadata.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the application displays images to users, use a strict CSP to prevent the execution of injected JavaScript (XSS).
        *   **EXIF Data Sanitization:** Remove or sanitize EXIF data on the server-side. EXIF data can be a source of information leakage or, in some cases, injection attacks.
        *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):** Validate *all* input parameters related to the image upload, including cropping coordinates, file names, and any other metadata.
