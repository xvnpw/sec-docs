# Threat Model Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Threat: [Library Code Tampering (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/library_code_tampering__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library itself (or one of its *direct* dependencies) and injects malicious code.  This differs from the previous entry by focusing on *direct* dependencies of the library, not transitive dependencies of React Native itself. This could happen through a compromised npm package, a malicious pull request that gets merged, or a direct attack on the library's repository. The attacker's goal is to gain control over the library's functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the library's functionality, allowing the attacker to steal data (images, metadata), execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, or cause denial of service.  This is a high-impact threat because the compromised library is directly integrated into the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the library's code (JavaScript or native).  This includes the core image selection and cropping logic, as well as any utility functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Package Manager Security:** Use a reputable package manager (npm, yarn) with integrity checks (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`).  Regularly run these audits to detect known vulnerabilities in the library and its *direct* dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependencies to specific versions (using a lockfile â€“ `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code.  This is crucial for preventing supply-chain attacks.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library to the latest version to receive security patches and bug fixes.  However, always review the release notes and changelog before updating.
        *   **Code Review (If Possible):** If you have the resources and expertise, consider periodically reviewing the library's source code (especially after updates) for suspicious patterns or unexpected changes. This is a more advanced mitigation.
        *   **Code Signing (Native Modules):** If feasible, explore using code signing and verification mechanisms for the library's native modules. This can help ensure that the native code hasn't been tampered with.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Exploiting Image/Video Processing Vulnerabilities) - *Direct Library Vulnerability*](./threats/denial_of_service__exploiting_imagevideo_processing_vulnerabilities__-_direct_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** This threat focuses on vulnerabilities *within* the `react-native-image-crop-picker`'s *own* native code (not just the underlying OS libraries). An attacker crafts a specially designed image or video file that exploits a bug *specifically* in the library's image processing logic (e.g., a buffer overflow in its cropping implementation). This is distinct from exploiting vulnerabilities in the OS's image processing libraries.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, or *potentially* remote code execution (RCE) if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the library's native code. The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** The native image/video processing functions within the library's code, particularly those related to cropping, resizing, and format conversion. This includes any custom image manipulation logic implemented by the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if RCE is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Library Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation.  The library developers are responsible for fixing vulnerabilities in their code.  Regularly update to the latest version to receive security patches.
        *   **(Difficult/Advanced):** Fuzz testing of the library's *own* image processing functions (specifically targeting the native code) could potentially identify vulnerabilities. This requires significant expertise and resources.
        *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While you can't fully sanitize an image to prevent all possible exploits, basic checks (e.g., validating the image format header, limiting dimensions) *before* passing data to the library's core processing functions might mitigate some attacks. However, this is *not* a reliable defense against sophisticated exploits targeting specific vulnerabilities. Focus on validating dimensions and file size as a first line of defense.
        * **Review Pull Requests and Issues:** Keep an eye on the library's GitHub repository. Review pull requests and issues, especially those related to security or image processing. This can give you early warning of potential problems.
