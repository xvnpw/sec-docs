## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_input_validation_weaknesses.md)

* Malicious Configuration Injection (CRITICAL NODE):
    * Inject excessively large image dimensions during cropping, leading to resource exhaustion or crashes.
      * Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Novice, Detection Difficulty: Easy
    * Inject invalid file paths or URIs, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.
      * Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Low to Medium, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Novice, Detection Difficulty: Medium
  * Path Traversal Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE):
    * If the library doesn't sanitize file paths properly, an attacker might be able to access files outside the intended directories.
      * Example: Providing a path like "../../sensitive_data.txt" during image selection or cropping.
        * Likelihood: Low, Impact: High, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Hard
  * Exploiting Insecure Data Handling (CRITICAL NODE):
    * If the library temporarily stores images in insecure locations, an attacker with local access could retrieve them.
      * Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Novice, Detection Difficulty: Hard
    * If the library returns sensitive information (e.g., full file paths) that is not properly handled by the application, it could be exposed.
      * Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Low to Medium, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Novice, Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse of Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_of_functionality.md)

* Denial of Service (DoS) (CRITICAL NODE):
    * Repeatedly trigger image selection or cropping with large or complex images, exhausting device resources and crashing the application.
      * Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Novice, Detection Difficulty: Easy
    * Exploit any asynchronous operations to create a backlog of tasks, leading to performance degradation or crashes.
      * Likelihood: Low to Medium, Impact: Medium, Effort: Medium, Skill Level: Intermediate, Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Data Leakage through Insecure Temporary Storage (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_data_leakage_through_insecure_temporary_storage__critical_node_.md)

* If the library stores temporary files with insufficient permissions, other applications or malicious actors with local access could potentially access them.
    * Likelihood: Medium, Impact: Medium, Effort: Low, Skill Level: Novice, Detection Difficulty: Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Supply Chain Attacks (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_chain_attacks__critical_node_.md)

* Compromised Dependency (CRITICAL NODE):
    * A malicious actor could compromise the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library itself and inject malicious code that is then included in applications using the library.
      * Likelihood: Very Low, Impact: Critical, Effort: High, Skill Level: Expert, Detection Difficulty: Hard
    * This could involve backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
      * Likelihood: Very Low, Impact: Critical, Effort: High, Skill Level: Expert, Detection Difficulty: Hard
