# Threat Model Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Threat: [Insecure Temporary File Storage](./threats/insecure_temporary_file_storage.md)

**Description:** The library stores temporary files (e.g., cropped images) in a publicly accessible or insecure location on the device's file system. An attacker with access to the device's file system could read or modify these files, potentially exposing sensitive image data.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user photos or information contained within them.

**Affected Component:** Native modules responsible for file handling within the library (e.g., image saving after cropping).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the library utilizes secure, application-specific temporary directories provided by the operating system.
*   Verify that temporary files are deleted promptly after they are no longer needed.
*   Review the library's source code or documentation to understand its temporary file handling mechanisms.

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** A specially crafted malicious image, when processed by the library's cropping or resizing functions, triggers a vulnerability such as a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue. This could lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Native modules responsible for image decoding, processing, and manipulation (cropping, resizing).

**Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the library updated to the latest version, as updates often include security patches.
*   Monitor for reported vulnerabilities related to image processing libraries used by `react-native-image-crop-picker`.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** The library allows specifying file paths directly without proper sanitization (e.g., when selecting an image). An attacker could manipulate the path to access files outside the intended directories on the device's file system.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the device.

**Affected Component:** Modules responsible for handling file paths and accessing files from the device's storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the library internally handles file paths securely and does not allow arbitrary path manipulation.
*   Avoid directly passing user-controlled input as file paths to the library if possible.
*   Verify that the library uses secure APIs for file access provided by the operating system.

## Threat: [Permission Bypass](./threats/permission_bypass.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in the library allows bypassing the standard permission checks required to access the device's camera or photo library. This could happen if the library has flaws in its interaction with the operating system's permission model.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the user's camera and photo library.

**Affected Component:** Native modules responsible for requesting and handling camera and storage permissions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the library updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Thoroughly test the application's permission handling to ensure the library respects the user's choices.
*   Monitor for any reported vulnerabilities related to permission handling in the library.
