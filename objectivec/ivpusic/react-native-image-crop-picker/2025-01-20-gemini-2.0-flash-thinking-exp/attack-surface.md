# Attack Surface Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via User-Controlled Input](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_user-controlled_input.md)

**Description:** If the application uses user-provided input to specify image paths for cropping, an attacker could potentially access files outside the intended directories.

**How react-native-image-crop-picker Contributes:** The library's functionality involves handling file paths. If the application doesn't sanitize paths before passing them to the library or processing the library's output, it can be vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious payload that, when processed by the application, leads to the library attempting to access a sensitive file like `/etc/passwd` if the application naively uses a user-provided path segment.

**Impact:** Unauthorized file access, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or application compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used to construct file paths before interacting with the library.
    * **Use Whitelisting:** If possible, restrict the allowed directories or file patterns for image selection.
    * **Avoid Direct Path Manipulation:** Instead of directly using user input in file paths, use secure methods like storing file identifiers and resolving paths server-side or through controlled application logic.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Native Code Bridge](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_native_code_bridge.md)

**Description:** The library relies on native modules (written in Objective-C/Swift for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android) to interact with the device's media capabilities. Vulnerabilities in these native modules, such as buffer overflows or improper memory management when handling image data, could be exploited.

**How react-native-image-crop-picker Contributes:** The library's core functionality depends on these native modules. Security flaws in these modules directly impact the application's security.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the native image decoding logic could be exploited by providing a specially crafted image that causes a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Application crashes, potential arbitrary code execution, device compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * **Keep Library Updated:** Regularly update the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    * **Code Audits (If Possible):** For critical applications, consider performing security audits of the library's native code or relying on reputable and well-maintained libraries.
