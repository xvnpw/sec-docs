## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Manipulation -> Malicious Image Upload -> Inject Malicious Code via Image Metadata [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_manipulation_-_malicious_image_upload_-_inject_malicious_code_via_image_metadata__crit_fbe417b3.md)

**Attack Description:** An attacker crafts a seemingly normal image file but embeds malicious code within its metadata fields (such as EXIF, IPTC, or XMP). When the application uses `react-native-image-crop-picker` to process this image (e.g., to display it, save it, or extract information), the underlying image processing libraries parse the metadata. If these libraries have vulnerabilities or if the application doesn't properly sanitize the metadata, the embedded malicious code can be executed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Tools and techniques for embedding malicious code in image metadata are readily available. Many applications do not implement robust metadata sanitization.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful execution of malicious code can lead to remote code execution on the user's device, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or compromise the application's integrity. It can also cause application crashes or denial of service.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires knowledge of image metadata formats and potentially scripting skills to craft the malicious image.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detecting this attack requires inspecting image metadata for suspicious content, which might not be a standard practice. Specialized metadata analysis tools can help, but basic security checks might miss it.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Metadata Stripping:**  Remove all unnecessary metadata from uploaded images before processing.
    *   **Metadata Sanitization:**  If metadata is required, use a well-vetted library to parse and sanitize it, ensuring only expected and safe data is retained.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the actions that embedded scripts can perform, reducing the impact of successful code injection (though this might be less applicable in a pure React Native context).
    *   **Regularly Update Image Processing Libraries:** Ensure the underlying native image processing libraries used by `react-native-image-crop-picker` are up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Manipulation -> Malicious Image Upload -> Exploit Image Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_manipulation_-_malicious_image_upload_-_exploit_image_processing_vulnerabilities__crit_ecaac724.md)

**Attack Description:** An attacker creates a specially crafted image file that exploits vulnerabilities (such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or format string bugs) within the native image processing libraries used by `react-native-image-crop-picker`. When the application attempts to process this malformed image, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to crashes, denial of service, or even remote code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - While exploiting these vulnerabilities requires specific knowledge, image processing libraries are complex and have historically been targets for security flaws.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation can result in application crashes, denial of service, and, in some cases, remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the user's device.
*   **Effort:** High - Requires a deep understanding of image file formats, the internal workings of the image processing libraries, and potential vulnerability research or reverse engineering.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - These attacks might manifest as seemingly normal application crashes, making them difficult to diagnose without specific knowledge of the exploited vulnerability or advanced debugging techniques.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Ensure `react-native-image-crop-picker` and its underlying native dependencies (especially image processing libraries like `libjpeg`, `libpng`, etc.) are updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on image dimensions, file size, and potentially file headers before passing them to the image processing library.
    *   **Consider Alternative Libraries:** If security is a paramount concern, evaluate alternative image processing libraries with a strong security track record.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques during development to identify potential crashes and vulnerabilities in how the application handles various image formats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Library Vulnerabilities -> Leverage Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_library_vulnerabilities_-_leverage_known_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Description:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library itself. This often involves using readily available exploit code or techniques documented in security advisories or CVE databases.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - The likelihood depends heavily on whether the application is using an outdated and vulnerable version of the library. Publicly known vulnerabilities with available exploits make this attack easier to execute.
*   **Impact:** Varies - The impact depends on the specific vulnerability being exploited. It can range from application crashes and denial of service to data breaches, unauthorized access, or even remote code execution.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - If a working exploit is publicly available, the effort is low. Otherwise, understanding the vulnerability and crafting an exploit requires more effort.
*   **Skill Level:** Basic to Intermediate - Exploiting known vulnerabilities with existing tools can be done with basic skills. Understanding and adapting exploits requires intermediate skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Security tools like Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scanners can detect the use of vulnerable library versions. Intrusion detection systems might also detect attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities if they match known attack signatures.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Maintain an up-to-date version of `react-native-image-crop-picker`. Implement a process for regularly checking for and applying updates.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Utilize dependency scanning tools (SCA) in the development pipeline to identify and flag vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases (like CVE) to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities in the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Weaknesses -> Insecure Data Handling After Library Usage [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_weaknesses_-_insecure_data_handling_after_library_usage__critical_.md)

**Attack Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise from how the application handles the image data or file path returned by `react-native-image-crop-picker` after the library has completed its task. This could include displaying user-uploaded images without proper sanitization (leading to Cross-Site Scripting - XSS), storing sensitive images insecurely, or mishandling file paths, potentially leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - This is a common area for security vulnerabilities as developers might not always consider the security implications of how they process data after it's returned by a library.
*   **Impact:** High - The impact can be significant, including Cross-Site Scripting (allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application), exposure of sensitive user data due to insecure storage, or unauthorized access to files through path traversal.
*   **Effort:** Low - Exploiting these vulnerabilities often requires basic knowledge of web application security principles and common attack techniques like XSS or path traversal.
*   **Skill Level:** Basic to Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Vulnerabilities like XSS and insecure storage can be detected using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools and dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) tools. Code reviews can also help identify these issues.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** When displaying user-generated content (including images), ensure proper encoding or escaping to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Implement secure storage mechanisms for sensitive images, such as encrypting data at rest and using appropriate access controls.
    *   **Path Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any file paths returned by the library before using them to access files, preventing path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access files and resources.
    *   **Security Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security code reviews to identify potential insecure data handling practices.
