# Threat Model Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Native Code](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_native_code.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor could craft a specially designed image or video file with excessively large dimensions or other malicious data that, when processed by the library's native code, could cause a buffer overflow. This could potentially lead to application crashes or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the device.

**Affected Component:** Native modules responsible for image processing and manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the library updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
*   The library developers should implement memory-safe programming practices in the native code.

## Threat: [Insecure Temporary File Storage](./threats/insecure_temporary_file_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to temporary image or video files created by the library if they are stored in publicly accessible locations on the device's file system. This could involve using file manager applications or exploiting other vulnerabilities to browse the file system.

**Impact:** Confidential user images or videos could be exposed, leading to privacy breaches, blackmail, or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Native module responsible for handling temporary file creation and storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure the library utilizes secure, application-specific temporary storage locations provided by the operating system.
*   The library developers should ensure temporary files are deleted immediately after they are no longer needed.

## Threat: [Intent Hijacking (Android Specific)](./threats/intent_hijacking__android_specific_.md)

**Description:** On Android, if the library's interaction with the operating system's intent system for accessing the gallery or camera is not implemented securely, a malicious application could potentially intercept or manipulate these intents to access or modify images/videos without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to images/videos, potential for data manipulation or theft.

**Affected Component:** Native Android implementation of the image selection and camera access functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   The library developers should follow Android security best practices for handling intents.
*   Review the library's Android-specific code for potential intent hijacking vulnerabilities.
