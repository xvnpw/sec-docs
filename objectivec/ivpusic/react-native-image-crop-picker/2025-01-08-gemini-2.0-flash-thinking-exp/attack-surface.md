# Attack Surface Analysis for ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image File Processing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_file_processing.md)

* **Description:** The library processes image files selected by the user from their device's gallery or camera. These files could be maliciously crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image decoding or processing libraries.
    * **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:** It provides the functionality to select and process these external image files, passing them to native modules for decoding and manipulation (cropping, resizing).
    * **Example:** A user selects a specially crafted PNG file containing a buffer overflow payload. When the native module attempts to decode or process this image, it triggers the overflow, potentially leading to a crash or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for remote code execution on the user's device.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability in the underlying libraries).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Keep the `react-native-image-crop-picker` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the library itself and potentially its dependencies.
            * Be aware of and monitor for known vulnerabilities in the image processing libraries used by the native modules on both iOS and Android.
            * Consider implementing additional security checks or sanitization on the image data before or after processing (though this might be complex and resource-intensive).

## Attack Surface: [Platform-Specific Native API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/platform-specific_native_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** The library relies on native APIs (iOS and Android) for image access and manipulation. Vulnerabilities in these underlying platform APIs could be indirectly exploitable through the library.
    * **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:** It acts as an interface to these native APIs, and if those APIs have vulnerabilities, the library's usage could expose the application to those risks.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability exists in the Android MediaStore API that allows for arbitrary file access. If `react-native-image-crop-picker` uses this API in a vulnerable way, it could potentially be exploited to access files outside of the intended scope.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the nature of the underlying native API vulnerability, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the underlying platform vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Stay informed about security advisories and updates for the target mobile platforms (iOS and Android).
            * Follow best practices for using native APIs securely.
            * Update the target SDK versions for both platforms to benefit from platform-level security improvements.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Native Modules](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_native_modules.md)

* **Description:** The library relies on native modules for image processing tasks. These native modules might have their own dependencies, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could introduce security risks.
    * **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:** It integrates and utilizes these native modules, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in their dependency tree.
    * **Example:** A native image processing library used by `react-native-image-crop-picker` has a dependency with a known remote code execution vulnerability. By processing a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the library.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Regularly audit the dependencies of the native modules used by `react-native-image-crop-picker`.
            * Use tools and techniques to identify known vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
            * If possible, update the native modules to versions that address known vulnerabilities in their dependencies.
            * Consider alternative libraries if the dependencies pose significant and unresolvable risks.
