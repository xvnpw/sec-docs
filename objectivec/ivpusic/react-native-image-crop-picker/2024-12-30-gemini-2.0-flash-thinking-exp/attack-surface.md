* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Data Injection via Native Bridge
    * **Description:**  Untrusted or malformed data passed from the JavaScript side to the native modules (iOS/Android) through the React Native bridge can exploit vulnerabilities in the native code.
    * **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:** This library relies on the native bridge to send parameters for image selection, cropping, and processing. If the native code doesn't properly sanitize these inputs, it can be vulnerable.
    * **Example:** A malicious application could manipulate the `options` object passed to `openPicker` or `openCamera` to include excessively long file paths or unexpected data types, potentially causing buffer overflows or other errors in the native image processing logic.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution in the native context if vulnerabilities are severe enough.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**  The library developers should implement robust input validation and sanitization on the native side for all data received from the JavaScript bridge.
        * **Developer:**  Use safe coding practices in the native modules to prevent buffer overflows and other memory corruption issues.
        * **Developer:**  Keep the native dependencies used by the library updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

* **Attack Surface:** Native Code Vulnerabilities (Memory Corruption/Buffer Overflows)
    * **Description:**  Flaws in the native iOS or Android code responsible for image manipulation (cropping, resizing, compression) can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    * **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:** The library utilizes native APIs and potentially custom native code for image processing. Vulnerabilities in this code are directly exposed through the library's functionality.
    * **Example:** Providing an extremely large or malformed image to the cropping functionality could trigger a buffer overflow in the native image processing library, leading to a crash or potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite memory.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution in the native context.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** The library developers should conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of the native codebase.
        * **Developer:** Utilize memory-safe programming practices and tools in the native code.
        * **Developer:** Leverage secure and well-maintained native image processing libraries.

* **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Handling
    * **Description:**  Improper handling of file paths provided to the library could allow an attacker to access or manipulate files outside the intended directories.
    * **How `react-native-image-crop-picker` Contributes:** The library interacts with the file system to access selected images and potentially save cropped versions. If file paths are not properly validated, path traversal attacks are possible.
    * **Example:** A malicious application could provide a crafted file path like `../../../sensitive_data.txt` when configuring where to save a cropped image, potentially allowing the library to overwrite or read sensitive files.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized file modification or deletion.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:** The library developers must implement strict validation and sanitization of all file paths received from the application.
        * **Developer:** Use secure file access methods that restrict operations to intended directories.
        * **Developer:** Avoid directly using user-provided file paths without thorough validation.
