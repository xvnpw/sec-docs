### High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving IGListKit

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Data Injection Leading to XSS/UI Spoofing
    *   **Description:** The application renders data provided to IGListKit without proper sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content.
    *   **How IGListKit Contributes:** IGListKit's core function is to render the provided data in the UI. If this data contains malicious HTML or JavaScript, IGListKit will execute it, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It also directly renders the data, enabling UI spoofing by displaying manipulated text or images.
    *   **Example:** A compromised API returns a user's "bio" containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. IGListKit renders this bio in a `UILabel`, causing the script to execute. Alternatively, the bio could contain misleading text to trick the user.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** XSS can lead to session hijacking, access token theft, data exfiltration, and arbitrary code execution within the app's context.
        *   **Medium:** UI spoofing can trick users into performing unintended actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all data received from external sources *before* passing it to IGListKit. Use appropriate encoding techniques (e.g., HTML escaping).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP in web views (if applicable) to restrict script sources.
        *   **Data Validation:** Validate data structure and content before rendering.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Section Controllers
    *   **Description:** Developers implement custom `ListSectionController` subclasses. Vulnerabilities within this custom code can introduce security risks.
    *   **How IGListKit Contributes:** IGListKit relies on these custom controllers for data display and user interaction within specific sections. Bugs or insecure practices in these controllers directly expose vulnerabilities within the IGListKit-managed UI.
    *   **Example:** A section controller fetching user data based on an ID doesn't validate the ID, allowing access to other users' data. Another example is a section controller using a web view with unsanitized URLs, leading to open redirects.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Information disclosure (accessing other users' data), unauthorized actions, potentially remote code execution if interacting with vulnerable web views.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines in custom section controllers (input validation, output encoding, avoid hardcoded secrets).
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom section controllers.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant section controllers access only to necessary data and resources.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies used within section controllers updated.
