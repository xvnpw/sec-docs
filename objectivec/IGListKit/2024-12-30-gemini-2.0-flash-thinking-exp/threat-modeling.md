### High and Critical IGListKit Threats

* **Threat:** Incorrect Data Display via Diffing Manipulation
    * **Description:** An attacker, by manipulating the data source provided to the `ListAdapter`, could craft data updates that exploit subtle errors in the `diffIdentifier` or `isEqualToDiffableObject` implementations. This could lead to the `ListAdapter` incorrectly identifying changes, resulting in the display of outdated, incorrect, or even sensitive data intended for other users or states. The core of the issue lies in the incorrect functioning of IGListKit's diffing mechanism due to developer error or malicious data.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure (displaying wrong user's data), data integrity issues (showing outdated information as current), application malfunction due to incorrect state representation.
    * **Affected IGListKit Component:** `ListAdapter`, specifically the diffing algorithm and the developer-implemented `diffIdentifier` and `isEqualToDiffableObject` methods within `ListDiffable` conforming objects.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust and thorough unit tests for `diffIdentifier` and `isEqualToDiffableObject` to ensure they correctly identify changes.
        * Validate data integrity at the source before passing it to the `ListAdapter`.
        * Consider using immutable data structures to prevent accidental modifications that could lead to diffing errors.
        * Utilize IGListKit's debugging tools to inspect diffing behavior during development and testing.

* **Threat:** Section Controller Logic Vulnerability Leading to Data Exposure
    * **Description:** A developer might introduce a vulnerability within the custom logic of a `ListSectionController`. For example, a poorly implemented data filtering or access control mechanism within a section controller could allow an attacker (potentially through manipulating the application state or external factors) to access or modify data they shouldn't have access to within that specific section. This directly involves the custom code interacting with and managing data within an IGListKit component.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure (accessing data within the section), data manipulation (modifying data within the section), potential for escalating privileges if the section controller interacts with sensitive application logic.
    * **Affected IGListKit Component:** `ListSectionController` (specifically the custom implementation of its methods like `cellForItem(at:)`, `didUpdate(to:)`, etc.).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test the logic within each custom `ListSectionController`.
        * Follow secure coding practices within section controllers, including proper input validation and authorization checks.
        * Avoid storing sensitive data directly within the section controller if possible; rely on secure data management practices elsewhere.
        * Implement unit tests specifically for the logic within section controllers.
