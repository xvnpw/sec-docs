# Threat Model Analysis for cocoanetics/dtcoretext

## Threat: [Malicious JavaScript Execution via HTML Injection](./threats/malicious_javascript_execution_via_html_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML containing JavaScript code into content processed by `DTCoreText`. The library renders this content, causing the JavaScript to execute within the application's context. This could happen if the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided or external HTML before passing it to `DTCoreText`.

**Impact:**  The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information (if accessible within the rendering context), redirect the user to malicious websites, or manipulate the application's UI.

**Affected DTCoreText Component:** HTML Parser, Core Text Rendering Engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input sanitization and validation on all HTML content before passing it to `DTCoreText`. Use an allow-list approach to permit only safe HTML tags and attributes.
*   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of JavaScript within the rendered content.
*   Ensure that the application's architecture minimizes the privileges available to the rendering context.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malformed HTML](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malformed_html.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides extremely large, deeply nested, or otherwise malformed HTML content to `DTCoreText`. The library attempts to parse and render this content, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.

**Impact:** This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, causing the application to become slow, unresponsive, or crash.

**Affected DTCoreText Component:** HTML Parser, Memory Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the size and complexity of HTML content that can be processed by `DTCoreText`.
*   Set timeouts for parsing and rendering operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
*   Consider using a streaming or incremental parsing approach if supported by `DTCoreText` or if feasible to implement around it.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities in HTML or CSS](./threats/exploitation_of_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_html_or_css.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts specific HTML or CSS input that exploits a bug or vulnerability within `DTCoreText`'s parsing logic. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially even remote code execution (though less likely in a rendering library).

**Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could range from application crashes to more severe security breaches.

**Affected DTCoreText Component:** HTML Parser, CSS Parser

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `DTCoreText` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Monitor the `DTCoreText` project's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
*   Consider fuzzing `DTCoreText` with various HTML and CSS inputs to identify potential parsing issues.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption due to Rendering Bugs](./threats/memory_corruption_due_to_rendering_bugs.md)

**Description:** A bug within `DTCoreText`'s rendering engine could be triggered by specific HTML or attributed string content, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact:** This could cause application crashes, unexpected behavior, or in some cases, potentially exploitable conditions.

**Affected DTCoreText Component:** Core Text Rendering Engine, Memory Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `DTCoreText` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.
*   Monitor the `DTCoreText` project for reports of rendering-related crashes or vulnerabilities.
*   Perform thorough testing with a wide range of HTML and attributed string content.
