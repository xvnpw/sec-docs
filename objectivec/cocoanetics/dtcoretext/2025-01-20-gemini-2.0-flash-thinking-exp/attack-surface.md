# Attack Surface Analysis for cocoanetics/dtcoretext

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious HTML](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_html.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into HTML content that is then rendered by the application using DTCoreText. These scripts can execute in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** DTCoreText parses and renders HTML. If the application doesn't sanitize user-provided or untrusted HTML *before* passing it to DTCoreText, the library will faithfully render any embedded scripts.
*   **Example:** A user submits a comment containing `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. When this comment is rendered using DTCoreText, the `onerror` event will trigger, executing the JavaScript alert.
*   **Impact:** Highjacking user sessions, defacing the application, redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-side HTML Sanitization:**  Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer, Bleach for Python) to remove or escape potentially malicious HTML tags and attributes *before* passing the content to DTCoreText.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Resource Fetching](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_external_resource_fetching.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can cause the server running the application to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources by injecting URLs into HTML tags like `<img>` or `<link>`.
*   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** If DTCoreText is configured to fetch external resources referenced in the HTML it processes, it can be tricked into making requests to attacker-controlled or internal resources.
*   **Example:** A user provides HTML containing `<img src="http://internal.network/admin/delete_all.png">`. If DTCoreText fetches this image, it could trigger an unintended action on the internal network.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, denial of service against internal services, port scanning.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Resource Fetching:** If external resource fetching is not a core requirement, disable it in DTCoreText's configuration.
    *   **URL Allowlisting/Denylisting:** If external fetching is necessary, maintain a strict allowlist of allowed domains or a denylist of blocked domains.
    *   **Input Validation for URLs:** Validate URLs provided by users to ensure they conform to expected patterns and don't point to internal or malicious addresses.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Specific Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_specific_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities within DTCoreText's HTML or CSS parsing logic could be exploited by crafting specific input that triggers unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially even code execution (though less likely in a library like this).
*   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** The complexity of parsing HTML and CSS makes it prone to subtle bugs within the library's implementation.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted HTML tag with unusual attributes or a CSS selector with a specific combination of characters might trigger a parsing error that can be exploited.
*   **Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, crashes, potential for more severe vulnerabilities depending on the nature of the bug.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep DTCoreText Updated:** Staying up-to-date is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:** Employ fuzzing techniques and security testing to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities within DTCoreText.
    *   **Error Handling and Resilience:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected parsing errors and prevent crashes.
