## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via DTCoreText (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_dtcoretext__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of DTCoreText vulnerabilities leading to a compromise of the application's security. It's critical because it signifies a complete breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Execute Arbitrary Code (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__execute_arbitrary_code__critical_node_.md)

This is a high-impact outcome where the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application's process. This allows for complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system. It's critical because it's a direct path to achieving the attacker's goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This involves leveraging weaknesses in DTCoreText's HTML and CSS parsing logic. Attackers can craft malicious input that triggers unexpected behavior, leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Script Injection via Malicious HTML Attributes (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/4__script_injection_via_malicious_html_attributes__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code within HTML attributes that DTCoreText parses and renders. If the application doesn't properly sanitize the output or if DTCoreText has vulnerabilities in handling certain attributes (e.g., `onerror`, `onload`, `href` with `javascript:`), this can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context (if the rendered output is used in a web view or similar context).
*   **Example:**  Crafting HTML like `<img src="invalid-url" onerror="alert('XSS')">` or `<a href="javascript:maliciousCode()">Click Me</a>`.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. CSS Expression or `@import` Abuse for Code Execution (if applicable) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/5__css_expression_or__@import__abuse_for_code_execution__if_applicable___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If DTCoreText's CSS parsing implementation supports or has vulnerabilities related to CSS expressions (an older, non-standard feature) or the `@import` rule, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code. This is less common in modern implementations but remains a potential risk if the library has such vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Using a CSS expression like `property: expression(alert('XSS'));` or importing a malicious stylesheet from an attacker-controlled server that contains exploitable CSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/6__cause_denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path_.md)

This path aims to make the application unavailable or unresponsive by overwhelming its resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Resource Exhaustion via Malformed HTML/CSS (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/7__resource_exhaustion_via_malformed_htmlcss__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers provide specially crafted HTML or CSS that consumes excessive CPU, memory, or other resources when parsed and rendered by DTCoreText.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Excessive Nesting of HTML Elements:** Creating deeply nested HTML structures that take a long time to parse and render.
    *   **Large or Complex CSS Rules:** Defining overly complex CSS selectors or rules that require significant processing power.
    *   **Recursive CSS Imports:**  Using `@import` to create a chain of stylesheet imports that leads to a loop or excessive requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Information Disclosure (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/8__information_disclosure__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on gaining access to sensitive information that the application should protect.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External Resources in HTML/CSS (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/9__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_external_resources_in_htmlcss__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application renders HTML or CSS provided by users or untrusted sources, and DTCoreText attempts to fetch external resources (images, stylesheets, etc.) specified in that content, an attacker can manipulate these URLs to target internal servers or services.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Embedding Malicious Image URLs:** Including `<img src="http://internal-server/sensitive-data">` in the HTML.
    *   **Using `@import` in CSS to Access Internal Resources:**  Using `@import url('http://internal-service/admin-panel');` in the CSS.
    *   This allows the attacker to probe internal network infrastructure, potentially access sensitive data, or perform actions on internal systems.
