# Threat Model Analysis for cocoanetics/dtcoretext

## Threat: [Malformed HTML Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/malformed_html_parsing_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML with syntax errors, deeply nested elements, or invalid attributes and provides it as input to dtcoretext. This exploits parsing logic flaws within dtcoretext, potentially leading to memory corruption or unexpected program behavior. The attacker aims to trigger application crashes, denial of service, or potentially more severe exploits if vulnerabilities exist in the parsing routines that go beyond simple crashes.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential for memory corruption, unpredictable rendering behavior, data corruption if parsing errors affect data processing beyond rendering. In a worst-case scenario, if a parsing flaw is severe enough, it *could* theoretically lead to code execution, although this is less likely in a rendering library but should be considered if deep vulnerabilities are present.
*   **Affected dtcoretext Component:** HTML Parser Module (specifically the HTML parsing functions within dtcoretext responsible for interpreting HTML tags and attributes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to potential for application instability, denial of service, and in worst-case scenarios, potential for more severe exploits if parsing flaws are critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and rigorously validate HTML input *before* passing it to dtcoretext. Use a well-vetted HTML sanitization library to remove or escape potentially malicious or malformed HTML elements and attributes.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep dtcoretext library updated to the latest version. Security patches and bug fixes are crucial for addressing known parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Error Handling and Sandboxing:** Implement robust error handling around dtcoretext rendering calls to gracefully handle parsing errors and prevent application crashes. Consider running dtcoretext in a sandboxed environment if feasible to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:** Conduct thorough fuzzing and security testing on dtcoretext with a wide range of malformed and malicious HTML inputs to proactively identify and address parsing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion via Malicious HTML](./threats/memory_exhaustion_via_malicious_html.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts HTML specifically designed to trigger excessive memory allocation by dtcoretext during parsing or rendering. This could involve very large images (referenced but not necessarily loaded), extremely long text strings, or deeply nested structures that consume significant memory when processed by dtcoretext. The attacker aims to cause application crashes due to out-of-memory conditions, leading to denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, memory exhaustion, instability, potentially impacting other application functionalities if memory exhaustion is severe.
*   **Affected dtcoretext Component:** Memory Management within HTML Parser and Rendering Engine (memory allocation routines used during parsing and rendering processes).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for reliable denial of service, application crashes, and significant impact on application availability and user experience, especially on resource-constrained devices).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits (Memory):** Implement strict memory limits for dtcoretext rendering processes or the application as a whole to prevent uncontrolled memory consumption. Monitor memory usage and implement safeguards to terminate rendering processes if memory usage exceeds safe thresholds.
    *   **Input Size and Complexity Limits:** Impose limits on the size and complexity of HTML input accepted by the application. Restrict the maximum size of HTML documents, the depth of nesting, and the length of text strings to prevent excessively large documents from being processed.
    *   **Memory Monitoring and Management:** Implement robust memory monitoring during dtcoretext rendering to detect and respond to potential memory exhaustion issues proactively. Employ efficient memory management practices within the application to minimize memory footprint.
    *   **Regular Updates and Patches:** Keep dtcoretext updated to benefit from potential memory management improvements and bug fixes included in newer versions.
