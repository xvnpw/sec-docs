# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, dtcoretext, is an open-source library for rendering rich text with HTML-like attributes and CSS styling on iOS and macOS.

- Business priorities:
  - Provide developers with a robust and flexible solution for displaying styled text in their applications.
  - Offer an alternative to platform-native text rendering that might be limited in features or customization.
  - Maintain compatibility and performance across different iOS and macOS versions.
  - Foster a community around the library for contributions and improvements.

- Business goals:
  - Increase adoption of dtcoretext among iOS and macOS developers.
  - Expand the library's features and capabilities to meet evolving developer needs.
  - Ensure the library remains a reliable and performant solution for rich text rendering.
  - Attract contributions and maintain active community engagement.

- Business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the text rendering logic could lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.
  - Performance issues could negatively impact user experience in applications using dtcoretext.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated or unusable.
  - Compatibility issues with new OS versions could break existing integrations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions (described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Static code analysis tools might be used by developers locally (not explicitly mentioned, but a common practice).
  - security control: Dependency management using tools like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager (implicitly used for library integration).

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature implies public code visibility, potentially exposing vulnerabilities if discovered.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions introduces a risk of malicious or poorly vetted code being merged.
  - accepted risk: No dedicated security team continuously monitoring the project for vulnerabilities.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
  - security control: Introduce dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Consider code signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity of the library.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable as dtcoretext is a library and does not handle user authentication directly. Applications using dtcoretext will manage authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable as dtcoretext is a library and does not handle user authorization directly. Applications using dtcoretext will manage authorization.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: Robust input validation is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) if user-provided content is rendered.
    - Requirement: Validate HTML-like attributes and CSS styles to prevent unexpected behavior or security issues.
    - Requirement: Handle potentially malicious or malformed input gracefully without crashing or exposing sensitive information.
  - Cryptography: Not a primary requirement for dtcoretext as it is a text rendering library. Cryptography might be relevant if the library were to handle encrypted text, which is not its core function. However, applications using dtcoretext might need to handle encrypted data before rendering.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process:
  - Providing reliable and secure rich text rendering functionality to application developers.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the dtcoretext library.

- Data we are trying to protect:
  - Source code of dtcoretext: Sensitivity - High (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Exposure could lead to intellectual property theft or supply chain attacks.
  - Build artifacts (compiled library): Sensitivity - Medium (Integrity, Availability). Compromised artifacts could lead to malicious applications using a vulnerable library.
  - User data processed by applications using dtcoretext: Sensitivity - Variable (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Depends on the application and the type of text content being rendered. dtcoretext itself does not store user data, but applications using it might process sensitive information.
