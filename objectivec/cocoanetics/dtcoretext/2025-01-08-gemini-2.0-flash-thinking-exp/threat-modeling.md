# Threat Model Analysis for cocoanetics/dtcoretext

## Threat: [Malicious HTML Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_html_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript code within content processed by DTCoreText. This occurs because DTCoreText's HTML parsing and rendering logic, despite aiming for sanitization, might contain vulnerabilities or bypasses that allow the execution of the injected script in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing session cookies).
    *   Credential theft (capturing user input on the page).
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Keylogging or other client-side attacks.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   HTML Parser module
    *   Text rendering engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of External Resources leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/insecure_handling_of_external_resources_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** If DTCoreText's resource fetching module (for images, stylesheets, etc.) doesn't properly validate or restrict the URLs it processes, an attacker can inject URLs pointing to internal resources or unintended external targets. This forces the server hosting the application to make requests on behalf of the attacker.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Access to Internal Services: An attacker could potentially access internal services or resources that are not publicly accessible.
    *   Port Scanning: An attacker could use the application as a proxy to scan internal networks.
    *   Data Exfiltration: An attacker might be able to trick the application into fetching and revealing sensitive data from internal resources.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Resource fetching module (e.g., for images, stylesheets)
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Image Handling leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_image_handling_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** If DTCoreText's image decoding or rendering functionality has vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows), providing a specially crafted malicious image file could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device or the server processing the image.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution: An attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine or the server. This is the most severe impact, allowing for complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Image decoding and rendering module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
