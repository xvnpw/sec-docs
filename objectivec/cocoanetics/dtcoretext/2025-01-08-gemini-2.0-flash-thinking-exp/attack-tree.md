Objective: To compromise application using DTCoreText vulnerabilities via High-Risk Paths.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)** **[HIGH-RISK GOAL, CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability in DTCoreText** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Trigger Buffer Overflow during HTML/CSS parsing** **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
            *   Inject overly long or deeply nested HTML/CSS tags leading to buffer overflow when processed by DTCoreText's parser.
*   **Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / UI Redressing within the application's context** **[HIGH-RISK GOAL, CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Inject Malicious HTML/CSS that DTCoreText renders without proper sanitization** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Inject malicious `<script>` tags within HTML** **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
            *   Provide HTML content containing `<script>` tags that DTCoreText renders, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the application's context (if rendered in a web view or similar).
        *   **Inject event handlers with malicious JavaScript within HTML tags** **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
            *   Provide HTML content with attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, etc., containing JavaScript that gets executed when the event occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH-RISK GOAL, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___high-risk_goal__critical_node_.md)

*   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability in DTCoreText** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Trigger Buffer Overflow during HTML/CSS parsing** **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
        *   Inject overly long or deeply nested HTML/CSS tags leading to buffer overflow when processed by DTCoreText's parser.

    **Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [HIGH-RISK GOAL, CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This is the attacker's most impactful goal, aiming for complete control over the application and potentially the underlying device. Success allows for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, and further system compromise.

*   **Exploit Memory Corruption Vulnerability in DTCoreText [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This critical node represents the exploitation of flaws in how DTCoreText manages memory. Attackers target vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or heap overflows to overwrite memory locations, potentially hijacking the program's execution flow.

*   **Trigger Buffer Overflow during HTML/CSS parsing [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft overly long or deeply nested HTML or CSS tags. When DTCoreText parses this malicious input, it attempts to store it in a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking. This leads to data overflowing the buffer and overwriting adjacent memory regions.
    *   **Potential Impact:** If the overwritten memory contains critical data like function pointers or return addresses, the attacker can redirect the program's execution to their own malicious code, resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / UI Redressing within the application's context [HIGH-RISK GOAL, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_cross-site_scripting__xss___ui_redressing_within_the_application's_context__high-risk_goal___f1b2f743.md)

*   **Inject Malicious HTML/CSS that DTCoreText renders without proper sanitization** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Inject malicious `<script>` tags within HTML** **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
            *   Provide HTML content containing `<script>` tags that DTCoreText renders, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the application's context (if rendered in a web view or similar).
        *   **Inject event handlers with malicious JavaScript within HTML tags** **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
            *   Provide HTML content with attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, etc., containing JavaScript that gets executed when the event occurs.

    **Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / UI Redressing within the application's context [HIGH-RISK GOAL, CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This goal focuses on injecting malicious scripts or manipulating the user interface within the application's context. While not directly leading to full system compromise like RCE, successful XSS attacks can lead to data theft, session hijacking, and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user. UI Redressing can trick users into performing actions they didn't intend.

*   **Inject Malicious HTML/CSS that DTCoreText renders without proper sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This critical node highlights the failure to sanitize user-provided or external HTML/CSS content before passing it to DTCoreText for rendering. This lack of sanitization is the primary enabler for XSS attacks.

*   **Inject malicious `<script>` tags within HTML [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers embed `<script>` tags containing malicious JavaScript code within the HTML content that DTCoreText is instructed to render.
    *   **Potential Impact:** When DTCoreText renders this HTML (especially within a web view or similar context), the browser or rendering engine executes the embedded JavaScript code. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user, making unauthorized API calls, or modifying the page content.

*   **Inject event handlers with malicious JavaScript within HTML tags [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers insert HTML attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, etc., into HTML tags. These attributes contain JavaScript code that is executed when the corresponding event occurs.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to `<script>` tag injection, this allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the application's context. For example, `onload` could execute malicious code as soon as an image is loaded, or `onclick` could execute code when a user clicks on a seemingly harmless element.
