# Attack Surface Analysis for cocoanetics/dtcoretext

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_html_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the rendered HTML content and executed within the application's context.
    *   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** DTCoreText parses and renders HTML. If it doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided or externally sourced HTML, it can render malicious script tags.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!');</script>` into a text field that is later rendered using DTCoreText. When the application displays this content, the JavaScript alert will execute.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, and potentially more severe attacks depending on the application's functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided HTML input before passing it to DTCoreText for rendering. Use a robust HTML sanitizer library.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode output appropriately for the rendering context.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Loading of External Resources](./attack_surfaces/insecure_loading_of_external_resources.md)

*   **Description:** DTCoreText loads external resources (images, stylesheets) referenced in HTML, potentially through insecure protocols.
    *   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** DTCoreText follows URLs specified in HTML attributes like `<img> src` or `<link href>`. If these URLs are not validated and HTTPS is not enforced, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides HTML with `<img src="http://malicious.com/evil.jpg">`. If the application doesn't enforce HTTPS, the image will be loaded over an insecure connection, potentially leading to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
    *   **Impact:**  Man-in-the-Middle attacks, where attackers can intercept and modify the loaded resources. This could lead to information disclosure or the injection of malicious content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure that all external resources are loaded over HTTPS.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict the domains from which resources can be loaded.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Implement SRI to ensure that fetched resources haven't been tampered with.

## Attack Surface: [Potential Vulnerabilities in DTCoreText Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/potential_vulnerabilities_in_dtcoretext_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities exist within the DTCoreText library's code, which could be exploited.
    *   **How DTCoreText Contributes:** As a third-party library, DTCoreText itself may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities related to parsing, memory management, or other internal operations.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability within DTCoreText's HTML parsing logic could be triggered by a specially crafted HTML document, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from application crashes to arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep DTCoreText Updated:** Regularly update DTCoreText to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories related to DTCoreText.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** If severe vulnerabilities are discovered and not patched promptly, consider alternative libraries.
