Here are the high and critical threats directly involving DTCoreText:

*   **Threat:** Malicious HTML Injection leading to Script Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML containing JavaScript or other executable content and provides it as input to DTCoreText. The library parses this input, and during the rendering process, the malicious script is executed within the application's context. This directly involves DTCoreText's HTML parsing and rendering capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data within the application, perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect the user to malicious websites, or even compromise the device if vulnerabilities in the rendering engine allow it.
    *   **Affected DTCoreText Component:** `DTHTMLParser`, `DTCoreTextLayoutFrame` (rendering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization on the server-side or client-side *before* passing any user-provided or untrusted HTML to DTCoreText. Use a well-vetted HTML sanitizer library.
        *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) if the rendered content is within a web view to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.
        *   Avoid rendering untrusted HTML directly. If necessary, use a sandboxed environment or a more secure rendering mechanism.

*   **Threat:** Malicious CSS Injection leading to Data Exfiltration or UI Redress
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious CSS code that, when rendered by DTCoreText, attempts to exfiltrate data or manipulate the user interface for malicious purposes. This directly involves DTCoreText's CSS parsing and rendering capabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Sensitive information could be leaked to an attacker-controlled server. Users could be tricked into performing actions they didn't intend due to UI manipulation.
    *   **Affected DTCoreText Component:** `DTCSSParser`, `DTCoreTextLayoutFrame` (rendering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize CSS input to remove potentially dangerous properties or selectors.
        *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of CSS, such as restricting `url()` values.
        *   Carefully review any CSS from untrusted sources.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities in HTML or CSS
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted HTML or CSS input that exploits vulnerabilities within DTCoreText's parsing logic. This is a direct vulnerability within the DTCoreText library itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Application crashes, denial of service, or in severe cases, potential for remote code execution if memory corruption is exploitable within DTCoreText.
    *   **Affected DTCoreText Component:** `DTHTMLParser`, `DTCSSParser`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep DTCoreText updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement input validation to reject overly complex or malformed HTML/CSS structures *before* passing it to DTCoreText, although this might not prevent exploitation of all parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using fuzzing techniques to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities during development.
