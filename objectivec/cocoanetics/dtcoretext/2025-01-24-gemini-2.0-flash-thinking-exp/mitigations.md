# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cocoanetics/dtcoretext

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict HTML and CSS Input Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/strict_html_and_css_input_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Sanitization Library:** Select a robust and actively maintained HTML sanitization library appropriate for your development platform.
    2.  **Define a Strict Allowlist:** Create a precise allowlist of HTML tags, attributes, and CSS properties that are considered safe and necessary for your application's functionality. Be restrictive and disallow potentially dangerous elements.
    3.  **Implement Sanitization Function:** Integrate the chosen sanitization library and create a function to sanitize HTML/CSS input based on your allowlist.
    4.  **Sanitize Before `dtcoretext` Processing:** Ensure *all* HTML and CSS input, especially from untrusted sources, is sanitized *before* being processed by `dtcoretext`.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Allowlist:** Periodically review and update your allowlist and the sanitization library.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents execution of malicious scripts injected through HTML or CSS processed by `dtcoretext`.
    *   **HTML Injection (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintended HTML structure manipulation via `dtcoretext`.
    *   **CSS Injection (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of malicious CSS altering application appearance through `dtcoretext` rendering.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS (High Impact Reduction):** Significantly reduces XSS risk from `dtcoretext` input.
    *   **HTML Injection (Medium Impact Reduction):** Reduces HTML injection risk.
    *   **CSS Injection (Medium Impact Reduction):** Reduces CSS injection risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the project. Basic regex-based HTML sanitization exists in the comment section (`CommentInputHandler.swift`), but it's a blacklist and not comprehensive. CSS sanitization is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Sanitization Library:** Replace regex-based sanitization with a dedicated HTML sanitization library.
    *   **CSS Sanitization:** Implement CSS sanitization with an allowlist.
    *   **Sanitization for all `dtcoretext` Inputs:** Apply sanitization to all `dtcoretext` input sources across the application.
    *   **Regular Allowlist Review Process:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing the allowlist.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Timeouts for Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_timeouts_for_rendering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Input Size Limits:** Limit the maximum size of HTML and CSS input processed by `dtcoretext`. Reject or truncate oversized inputs.
    2.  **Complexity Limits (If Feasible):** Analyze HTML/CSS complexity (nesting, CSS rules) and reject or simplify overly complex inputs before `dtcoretext` processing.
    3.  **Rendering Timeouts:** Set timeouts for `dtcoretext` rendering. Interrupt rendering if it exceeds the timeout to prevent resource exhaustion.
    4.  **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor application CPU and memory usage during `dtcoretext` rendering to detect potential DoS attempts.
    5.  **Throttling/Rate Limiting (If Necessary):** Implement throttling for requests involving `dtcoretext` processing if DoS attacks are suspected.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks caused by malicious HTML/CSS consuming excessive resources during `dtcoretext` rendering.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS (High Impact Reduction):** Effectively reduces DoS risk from resource-intensive `dtcoretext` input.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic client-side input size limit for comments (`commentForm.js`), but easily bypassed and not enforced in the application using `dtcoretext`. Rendering timeouts are not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Server-Side Input Size Limits:** Implement robust input size limits server-side and in the application before `dtcoretext` processing.
    *   **Rendering Timeouts in iOS/macOS:** Implement timeouts for `dtcoretext` rendering in the application.
    *   **Complexity Limits Analysis:** Explore and implement complexity analysis for HTML/CSS input.
    *   **Resource Monitoring Specific to `dtcoretext`:** Enhance resource monitoring for `dtcoretext` rendering.
    *   **Throttling/Rate Limiting for `dtcoretext` Processing:** Implement throttling for user-generated content processed by `dtcoretext`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Handling of External Resources](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_handling_of_external_resources.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Automatic External Resource Loading (If Possible):** Configure `dtcoretext` to disable automatic loading of external resources (images, fonts, stylesheets) if configuration is available.
    2.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP to restrict domains for loading resources in contexts displaying `dtcoretext` output (e.g., web views).
    3.  **Resource URL Validation:** Validate external resource URLs against an allowlist of trusted domains and enforce HTTPS before allowing `dtcoretext` to load them.
    4.  **Resource Proxying (If Necessary and Feasible):** Proxy external resources through your server for better control, validation, and potential security scanning.
    5.  **Limit Resource Types:** Restrict the types of external resources `dtcoretext` is allowed to load to only necessary types.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Mixed Content Issues (HTTPS Weakening) (Medium Severity):** Prevents loading HTTP resources on HTTPS pages via `dtcoretext`.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Referer Headers (Low to Medium Severity):** Reduces data leaks through malicious external resource URLs processed by `dtcoretext`.
    *   **Unintended Resource Loading and Performance Issues (Low to Medium Severity):** Mitigates performance issues and bandwidth usage from excessive external resources loaded by `dtcoretext`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Mixed Content (Medium Impact Reduction):** Eliminates mixed content issues related to `dtcoretext`.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Impact Reduction):** Reduces data exfiltration risk via `dtcoretext` resource loading.
    *   **Performance Issues (Medium Impact Reduction):** Improves performance by controlling `dtcoretext` resource loading.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. `dtcoretext` loads external resources without restrictions. CSP is not implemented in relevant application components.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Disable Automatic Resource Loading (Configuration Check):** Check `dtcoretext` configuration for disabling automatic resource loading.
    *   **Implement CSP:** Implement CSP for web views or components displaying `dtcoretext` output.
    *   **Resource URL Validation:** Implement URL validation for external resources loaded by `dtcoretext`.
    *   **Evaluate Resource Proxying:** Assess feasibility of resource proxying for `dtcoretext`.
    *   **Resource Type Limiting:** Consider limiting the types of external resources loaded by `dtcoretext`.
