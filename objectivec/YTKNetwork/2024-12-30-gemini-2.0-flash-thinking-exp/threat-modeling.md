Here's an updated list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve the YTKNetwork library:

* **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack due to Insufficient Certificate Validation
    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the server. By presenting a fraudulent certificate, the attacker can decrypt and potentially modify the communication without the application or user being aware. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive data or inject malicious responses. This threat directly involves YTKNetwork's handling of SSL/TLS certificates.
    * **Impact:** Confidential data (e.g., user credentials, personal information) can be exposed. The attacker can manipulate data being sent to the server, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption. The application might receive malicious data, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected YTKNetwork Component:** `YTKNetworkConfig` (specifically the certificate pinning or validation settings within the configuration) and the underlying networking implementation used by `YTKBaseRequest`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust certificate pinning by validating the server's certificate against a known set of trusted certificates or public keys. Utilize YTKNetwork's built-in mechanisms or custom implementations for this purpose.
        * Ensure that the application is configured to reject connections to servers with invalid or untrusted certificates.
        * Regularly update the list of trusted certificates if using certificate pinning.

* **Threat:** Insecure Data Transmission over HTTP
    * **Description:** The application might inadvertently or due to misconfiguration send sensitive data over an unencrypted HTTP connection instead of HTTPS. This allows attackers on the network to easily eavesdrop on the communication and steal sensitive information. This threat directly involves how YTKNetwork constructs and sends requests based on the configured base URL.
    * **Impact:** Confidential data transmitted over HTTP is exposed to anyone monitoring the network traffic. This can lead to the compromise of user credentials, personal information, and other sensitive data.
    * **Affected YTKNetwork Component:** `YTKBaseRequest` (specifically the `baseURL()` method and how requests are constructed).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce HTTPS for all network communication by ensuring the `baseURL()` in `YTKNetworkConfig` starts with `https://`.
        * Implement mechanisms to prevent accidental use of `http://` URLs within the application's request logic.
        * Utilize HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on the server-side to instruct clients to only communicate over HTTPS.

* **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization of Server Responses
    * **Description:** If the application relies on YTKNetwork to automatically deserialize server responses (e.g., JSON), vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization logic within YTKNetwork or the application's handling of the deserialized data could be exploited by a malicious server sending crafted responses. This could lead to code execution or other unexpected behavior.
    * **Impact:** A malicious server can potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's context or cause the application to crash. This could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or other security compromises.
    * **Affected YTKNetwork Component:** Response processing within `YTKBaseRequest` and potentially custom response processing blocks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully validate and sanitize data received from the server after deserialization.
        * Consider using safer deserialization methods or libraries if concerns exist about the default deserialization process.
        * Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes due to unexpected response formats.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in YTKNetwork Dependencies
    * **Description:** YTKNetwork might rely on other third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the security of applications using YTKNetwork. This is a direct concern as YTKNetwork's security posture is influenced by its dependencies.
    * **Impact:** Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be exploited by attackers to compromise the application. This could lead to various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Affected YTKNetwork Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire library through its dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be High or Critical).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update YTKNetwork and its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
        * Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
        * Consider using dependency management tools to help track and update dependencies.
