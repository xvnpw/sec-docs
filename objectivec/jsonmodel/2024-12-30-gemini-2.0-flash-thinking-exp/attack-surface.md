* **Attack Surface: Deserialization of Malformed JSON**
    * **Description:** The application attempts to parse and process JSON data that is syntactically incorrect or deviates significantly from the expected structure.
    * **How jsonmodel Contributes:** `jsonmodel` is responsible for taking raw JSON data and attempting to map it to the properties of `JSONModel` subclasses. If the JSON is malformed, `jsonmodel`'s parsing process might consume excessive resources or throw exceptions that are not handled gracefully.
    * **Example:** Sending a JSON payload with a missing closing brace `{"name": "test"` or with incorrect data types for expected properties (e.g., a string where an integer is expected).
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption, application crashes due to unhandled exceptions, or unexpected behavior if parsing partially succeeds.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation *before* passing data to `jsonmodel`. Verify the basic JSON structure using a dedicated JSON validator.
        * Utilize `jsonmodel`'s built-in validation mechanisms (like the `validate` method in subclasses) to enforce expected data types and structures.
        * Implement proper error handling around `jsonmodel`'s parsing methods to catch exceptions and prevent application crashes.

* **Attack Surface: Deserialization of Excessively Large or Deeply Nested JSON**
    * **Description:** The application attempts to parse JSON data that is extremely large in size or contains a very deep level of nesting.
    * **How jsonmodel Contributes:** `jsonmodel` needs to traverse and process the entire JSON structure. Large or deeply nested structures can lead to significant memory consumption and CPU usage during the parsing process.
    * **Example:** Sending a JSON payload with thousands of keys or with nested objects/arrays going hundreds of levels deep.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption (memory exhaustion, CPU overload), potentially leading to application slowdowns or crashes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming JSON payloads.
        * Implement limits on the maximum depth of nesting allowed in JSON structures.
        * Consider using streaming JSON parsers for very large payloads if `jsonmodel`'s performance becomes an issue.
