# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update JSONModel Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_jsonmodel_library.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the `jsonmodel/jsonmodel` GitHub repository or relevant package managers (like CocoaPods, Carthage, Swift Package Manager if applicable) for new releases and security advisories.
2.  **Review Release Notes:** Carefully review the release notes for each update to understand bug fixes, new features, and, most importantly, security patches specifically for `jsonmodel`.
3.  **Update Dependency:** Update the `jsonmodel` dependency in your project's dependency management file (e.g., Podfile, Cartfile, Package.swift) to the latest stable version.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, thoroughly test your application, focusing on areas where `JSONModel` is used for parsing and data handling, to ensure compatibility and no regressions are introduced by the update.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known JSONModel Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated versions of `JSONModel` may contain publicly known vulnerabilities within the library's code itself. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are not patched. Updating directly addresses these known library-specific flaws.

**Impact:**
*   **Exploitation of Known JSONModel Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Directly eliminates known security weaknesses present in older versions of the `JSONModel` library.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a process to check for library updates quarterly, but it's not fully automated and sometimes delayed. This is documented in our dependency management guidelines.

**Missing Implementation:**  Need to automate dependency update checks specifically for `JSONModel` and integrate them into our CI/CD pipeline.  Also, need to ensure updates are applied more frequently than quarterly, ideally monthly or upon critical security advisories related to `JSONModel` or its dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Schema Validation Before Parsing](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_schema_validation_before_parsing.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define JSON Schema:** Create a JSON schema that precisely describes the expected structure, data types, and required fields for each type of JSON payload your application processes *using `JSONModel`*. Use a schema definition language like JSON Schema Draft-07 or later.
2.  **Choose Validation Library:** Select a robust JSON schema validation library compatible with your development environment (e.g., for Swift, consider libraries like `jsonschema.swift` or similar).
3.  **Integrate Validation Before JSONModel:** Before passing any JSON data to `JSONModel` for parsing, use the chosen validation library to validate the JSON against the defined schema. This step must occur *before* `JSONModel` is invoked.
4.  **Handle Validation Failures:** Implement proper error handling for schema validation failures. Reject invalid JSON payloads and log the validation errors. *Crucially, do not proceed with parsing invalid JSON using `JSONModel`*.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks Exploiting JSONModel Parsing Logic (Medium to High Severity):** By validating the schema *before* `JSONModel` processes the data, you prevent attacks that rely on sending unexpected JSON structures or data types that could potentially exploit vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in `JSONModel`'s parsing logic.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed JSON Targeting JSONModel (Medium Severity):**  Reduces DoS risk by rejecting malformed JSON that could cause parsing errors or excessive resource consumption *specifically within `JSONModel`'s parsing engine*.
*   **Data Integrity Issues Due to Unexpected JSON Structure in JSONModel (Medium Severity):** Ensures data conforms to expected types and structure *before* `JSONModel` interprets it, preventing data corruption or unexpected application behavior arising from `JSONModel` misinterpreting unexpected input.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks Exploiting JSONModel Parsing Logic:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the attack surface by ensuring `JSONModel` only processes strictly validated input.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed JSON Targeting JSONModel:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents many DoS attempts specifically aimed at overloading `JSONModel`'s parsing capabilities with malformed input.
*   **Data Integrity Issues Due to Unexpected JSON Structure in JSONModel:** High risk reduction. Ensures data consistency and reliability in how `JSONModel` handles and maps JSON data to models.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have basic validation for some critical endpoints using custom code, but it's not schema-based and not consistently applied across all JSON processing with `JSONModel`.

**Missing Implementation:** Need to implement comprehensive schema validation using a dedicated library for all API endpoints that process JSON data with `JSONModel`.  This includes defining schemas for all relevant JSON structures and *strictly enforcing* the validation step *before* any `JSONModel` parsing occurs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Define JSONModel Models and Data Types](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_define_jsonmodel_models_and_data_types.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Precise Model Definition for JSONModel:** Define your `JSONModel` models with *precise* data types for each property, accurately reflecting the expected data types in the JSON payloads that `JSONModel` will process. Utilize `JSONModel`'s built-in type checking and validation features within model definitions.
2.  **Enforce Required Properties in JSONModel:**  Use `JSONModel` features to explicitly mark properties as required within your model definitions if they are essential for your application logic. This leverages `JSONModel`'s capabilities to enforce data presence.
3.  **Utilize JSONKeyMapper in JSONModel:** If your JSON keys do not directly match your model property names, use `JSONModel`'s `JSONKeyMapper` to explicitly map JSON keys to model properties. This ensures correct data mapping and avoids potential misinterpretations by `JSONModel`.
4.  **Test JSONModel Definitions:** Thoroughly test your `JSONModel` model definitions with both valid and deliberately invalid JSON payloads. Verify that `JSONModel` behaves as expected, correctly parses valid data, and appropriately handles or rejects invalid data based on your model definitions and type constraints.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Type Confusion Vulnerabilities within JSONModel Parsing (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of type confusion errors and vulnerabilities that could arise *during `JSONModel`'s parsing process* if data types are not strictly defined and enforced in the models.
*   **Data Integrity Issues Due to Incorrect JSONModel Mapping (Medium Severity):** Ensures data is correctly interpreted and mapped to model properties *by `JSONModel`*, preventing data corruption or unexpected application behavior due to `JSONModel` misinterpreting or mis-mapping JSON data based on loosely defined models.

**Impact:**
*   **Type Confusion Vulnerabilities within JSONModel Parsing:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of type-related errors and potential vulnerabilities that could be triggered during `JSONModel`'s parsing due to ambiguous type handling.
*   **Data Integrity Issues Due to Incorrect JSONModel Mapping:** High risk reduction. Improves data consistency and reliability in how `JSONModel` interprets and maps JSON data to your application's models, ensuring accurate data representation after parsing.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  We use `JSONModel` models, but the definitions are not always as precise as they could be.  Data type enforcement, required property definitions, and explicit key mapping using `JSONKeyMapper` are not consistently utilized across all models.

**Missing Implementation:** Need to review and refine all `JSONModel` model definitions to ensure they are precise, rigorously enforce data types *within `JSONModel`'s context*, and utilize features like required properties and explicit key mapping where necessary.  Implement unit tests specifically for `JSONModel` model definitions to verify their correctness and ensure they function as intended with `JSONModel`'s parsing behavior.
