# Attack Surface Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

## Attack Surface: [Malformed or Unexpected JSON Input](./attack_surfaces/malformed_or_unexpected_json_input.md)

* **Description:** The application attempts to parse JSON data that is syntactically incorrect or overly complex, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in `jsonmodel`'s parsing logic.
    * **How jsonmodel Contributes:** `jsonmodel` is the component directly responsible for parsing the provided JSON string into Objective-C objects. Its internal parsing mechanisms are the point of interaction with the potentially malicious input.
    * **Example:**
        * Sending a JSON payload with extremely deep nesting levels that could cause stack overflow errors within `jsonmodel`'s parsing routines.
        * Providing a JSON string with subtle invalid syntax that might be mishandled by `jsonmodel`, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), application crashes directly caused by errors within `jsonmodel`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Implement input validation *before* passing data to `jsonmodel`, specifically checking for excessive nesting or potential syntax issues.
            * Set reasonable limits on the size and complexity of JSON data accepted by the application.
            * Utilize `jsonmodel`'s error handling to gracefully manage parsing failures and prevent crashes.

## Attack Surface: [Type Mismatches Leading to Unexpected Behavior or Crashes](./attack_surfaces/type_mismatches_leading_to_unexpected_behavior_or_crashes.md)

* **Description:** The JSON data contains values whose types do not match the expected property types in the `jsonmodel` subclass, potentially leading to errors during `jsonmodel`'s mapping process.
    * **How jsonmodel Contributes:** `jsonmodel`'s core function is to map JSON values to Objective-C object properties. If type expectations are violated, `jsonmodel`'s implicit or explicit conversion attempts can lead to runtime exceptions or unexpected state changes within the application.
    * **Example:**
        * A `jsonmodel` subclass expects an `NSNumber` for a property, but the JSON contains a string. If `jsonmodel`'s conversion fails or results in `nil` where it's not handled, it can cause a crash.
        * A date field in JSON is in a format that `jsonmodel` cannot parse, leading to a parsing error during the mapping process.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes due to unhandled exceptions during `jsonmodel`'s data mapping, potential for unexpected program behavior if type mismatches lead to incorrect object states.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Define clear and strict data type expectations in your `jsonmodel` subclasses.
            * Utilize `jsonmodel`'s built-in validation mechanisms or implement custom validation logic within your `jsonmodel` subclasses to check data types before or after mapping.
            * Ensure robust error handling around the `jsonmodel` initialization and property setting to catch potential type mismatch errors.
