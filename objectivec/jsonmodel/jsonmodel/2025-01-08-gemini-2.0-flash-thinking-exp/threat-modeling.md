# Threat Model Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

## Threat: [Malformed JSON leading to application crash](./threats/malformed_json_leading_to_application_crash.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload that does not conform to the expected structure defined by the `jsonmodel` model. The `jsonmodel` library attempts to parse this malformed JSON, leading to an unhandled exception or error *within `jsonmodel`'s parsing logic* that crashes the application.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application instability.

**Affected Component:**

* `jsonmodel`'s core deserialization logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement robust server-side validation of incoming JSON payloads *before* passing them to `jsonmodel`.
* Utilize `try-catch` blocks or similar error handling mechanisms around `jsonmodel` initialization and property mapping to gracefully handle parsing errors *without crashing the application*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in custom `setValue:forKey:` implementations (if used)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom__setvalueforkey__implementations__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses custom logic within `setValue:forKey:` or similar methods in `jsonmodel` subclasses for data transformation or validation, vulnerabilities could be introduced *directly within this custom code executed by `jsonmodel`*. An attacker might craft JSON payloads specifically designed to trigger flaws in this custom logic (e.g., leading to unexpected state changes, or even code execution if the custom logic is poorly written).

**Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom code, potentially leading to code execution, information disclosure, or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:**

* Custom implementations of `setValue:forKey:` or similar methods in `jsonmodel` subclasses.

**Risk Severity:** High (potential for code execution elevates this to high)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Thoroughly review and test any custom mapping logic for security vulnerabilities.
* Follow secure coding practices when implementing custom mapping logic, including proper input validation and sanitization within the custom methods.
* Consider avoiding complex custom mapping logic if simpler, safer alternatives exist.
