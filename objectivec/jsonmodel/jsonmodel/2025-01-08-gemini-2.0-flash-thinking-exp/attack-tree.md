# Attack Tree Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the `jsonmodel/jsonmodel` library (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using jsonmodel (HIGH-RISK STARTING POINT)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_jsonmodel__high-risk_starting_point_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. It is marked as a high-risk starting point because any successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within `jsonmodel` directly leads to this objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JSON Deserialization Vulnerabilities in jsonmodel (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_json_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_jsonmodel__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the broad category of attacks that leverage weaknesses in how `jsonmodel` parses and interprets JSON data. It's critical because it serves as the gateway to multiple specific attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Maliciously Crafted JSON Input (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/maliciously_crafted_json_input__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the attacker's ability to provide specially crafted JSON data to the application. It's critical because it's the initial step required to exploit many of the deserialization vulnerabilities. Without the ability to inject malicious JSON, many subsequent attacks are not possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Unexpected Application Behavior (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_unexpected_application_behavior__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path focuses on manipulating the JSON input to cause the application to behave in unintended ways, even if it doesn't directly lead to a crash or complete compromise. It's high-risk because unexpected behavior can often be a stepping stone to further exploitation or can directly cause issues like data corruption or incorrect processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Invalid or Malformed JSON (HIGH-RISK PATH NODE within Trigger Unexpected Application Behavior)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_invalid_or_malformed_json__high-risk_path_node_within_trigger_unexpected_application_behavior_d34ac937.md)

This specific attack step within the "Trigger Unexpected Application Behavior" path is considered high-risk due to its high likelihood. It is relatively easy for an attacker to introduce syntax errors or structural issues in JSON data. While the immediate impact might be a parsing error, if not handled correctly, it can lead to unhandled exceptions, incorrect application state, or information disclosure through error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Property Mapping Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_property_mapping_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This node focuses on vulnerabilities related to how `jsonmodel` maps JSON keys to the properties of Objective-C objects. It's critical because successful exploitation can allow attackers to directly manipulate the internal state of the application by overwriting critical variables.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Critical Object Properties (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_critical_object_properties__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This path involves crafting JSON to overwrite object properties that are crucial for the application's security or logic. It's high-risk because successfully modifying these properties can lead to significant consequences, such as bypassing authentication, escalating privileges, or manipulating business processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Input Validation (if relying solely on jsonmodel) (HIGH-RISK PATH NODE within Exploit Property Mapping Weaknesses)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_input_validation__if_relying_solely_on_jsonmodel___high-risk_path_node_within_exploit_propert_fba41280.md)

This specific attack step is high-risk because it highlights a common security mistake: relying solely on a data mapping library for input validation. If the application doesn't implement its own validation and trusts the data parsed by `jsonmodel` implicitly, attackers can inject malicious data that would otherwise be blocked. This injected data can then be used in subsequent operations, leading to various vulnerabilities depending on how the application processes it.
