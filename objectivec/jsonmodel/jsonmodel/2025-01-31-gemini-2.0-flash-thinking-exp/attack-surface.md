# Attack Surface Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Property Population leading to Privilege Escalation](./attack_surfaces/unintended_property_population_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical vulnerability where `jsonmodel` inadvertently populates model properties, particularly those controlling access or permissions, with attacker-controlled data from unexpected JSON keys, leading to unauthorized privilege elevation.
    *   **jsonmodel Contribution:** `jsonmodel`'s automatic mapping of JSON keys to model properties, based on naming conventions, can lead to unintended property setting if the incoming JSON contains extra, malicious keys that happen to match sensitive property names in the `JSONModel`.
    *   **Example:** A `User` `JSONModel` class has an `isAdmin` property. The application logic relies on this property to determine administrative privileges. If an attacker can manipulate the JSON input (e.g., via API request) and include `"isAdmin": true` in the JSON payload, `jsonmodel` will populate the `isAdmin` property of the `User` model. If the application then uses this model without proper authorization checks, the attacker could gain administrative access.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical** - Privilege escalation, unauthorized administrative access, complete compromise of application functionality and data depending on the scope of elevated privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Model Definitions and Property Whitelisting:** Define `JSONModel` classes with only explicitly expected properties. Implement logic to explicitly ignore or reject any unexpected keys in the JSON input during the mapping process.  Do not rely on implicit mapping for sensitive properties.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege and Authorization Checks:** Never rely solely on model properties populated by `jsonmodel` for authorization decisions, especially for sensitive operations. Always perform explicit authorization checks based on secure, server-side or validated user session data, independent of the data within the `JSONModel` itself. Validate user roles and permissions through secure backend systems, not just client-side data models.
        *   **Input Structure Validation:** Validate the structure of the incoming JSON to ensure it strictly adheres to the expected schema and does not contain unexpected or unauthorized keys before processing it with `jsonmodel`.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed JSON Processing leading to Denial of Service](./attack_surfaces/malformed_json_processing_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** High risk vulnerability where processing maliciously crafted, excessively complex, or malformed JSON input by `jsonmodel` leads to resource exhaustion, application crashes, or significant performance degradation, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **jsonmodel Contribution:** `jsonmodel` is responsible for parsing the JSON data. If it, or the underlying JSON parsing mechanisms it utilizes, is not robust against maliciously crafted JSON, it can become a point of failure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with extremely deep nesting levels or an excessive number of keys to the application endpoint that uses `jsonmodel` to process the response. `jsonmodel` attempts to parse this deeply nested JSON, leading to excessive CPU and memory consumption on the server, potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** **High** - Denial of Service, application unavailability, significant performance degradation, impacting legitimate users and potentially causing financial or reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Complexity Limits:** Implement input validation *before* passing JSON to `jsonmodel`.  Enforce limits on JSON complexity, such as maximum nesting depth, maximum number of keys, and overall payload size. Reject JSON payloads that exceed these limits.
        *   **Resource Management and Rate Limiting:** Implement resource management techniques (e.g., setting limits on memory and CPU usage for JSON parsing) and rate limiting to prevent abuse and mitigate the impact of DoS attacks.
        *   **Robust JSON Parsing Library (Underlying System Library):** Ensure `jsonmodel` relies on a well-vetted and robust JSON parsing library, ideally the system's built-in libraries which are generally optimized and regularly updated for security and performance.  Avoid using custom or less-tested JSON parsing implementations if possible.
