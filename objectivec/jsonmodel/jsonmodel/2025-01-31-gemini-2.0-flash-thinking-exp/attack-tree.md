## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via JSONModel](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_jsonmodel.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, disrupting service, stealing data, or otherwise harming the application and its users through vulnerabilities related to JSONModel usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JSON Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_json_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node represents a critical category of attacks that target the JSON parsing process itself. Successful exploitation can lead to Denial of Service or pave the way for further attacks like injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [JSON Injection Attacks (Data Level)](./attack_tree_paths/json_injection_attacks__data_level_.md)

*   This node is critical because it encompasses several high-impact attack vectors where malicious data is injected into JSON payloads. These attacks can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, and Business Logic Bypasses, all with potentially severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Command Injection Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/inject_command_injection_payloads.md)

*   This specific injection attack is critical due to its potential for complete system compromise. If an attacker can inject commands that are executed by the server, they can gain full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Execution via Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_execution_via_deserialization.md)

*   Although very low likelihood for JSONModel's direct purpose, the possibility of code execution via deserialization is always a critical concern in any system processing external data. If somehow JSONModel or its integration allowed for this, the impact would be catastrophic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node is critical because it represents a broad category of attacks that target the software supply chain. Compromising the JSONModel library or its dependencies can have widespread and severe impact on all applications using them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise JSONModel Library Itself](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_jsonmodel_library_itself.md)

*   Directly compromising the JSONModel library is a critical supply chain attack. It would allow attackers to inject malicious code into the library itself, affecting all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in JSONModel Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jsonmodel_dependencies.md)

*   Even if JSONModel itself is secure, vulnerabilities in its dependencies can be exploited to compromise applications using JSONModel. This is a critical indirect supply chain risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Extremely Large JSON Payload (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/send_extremely_large_json_payload__dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the application.
*   **Mechanism:** The application attempts to parse this massive payload, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory).
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service - the application becomes slow or unresponsive, potentially crashing the server and disrupting service for legitimate users.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement input size limits for JSON requests, use streaming JSON parsers, and ensure proper resource management (CPU/memory limits).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Scripting Code (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_scripting_code__xss_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript or HTML code into JSON fields.
*   **Mechanism:** If the application later processes this JSON data and renders it in a web context (e.g., in a web page), without proper output encoding, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - attackers can steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement contextual output encoding and sanitization whenever JSON data is used in web contexts (HTML, JavaScript). Use appropriate escaping functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Command Injection Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/inject_command_injection_payloads.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious commands into JSON fields.
*   **Mechanism:** If the application uses JSON data to construct system commands (e.g., using `system()` calls or similar), without proper sanitization, the injected commands will be executed by the server's operating system.
*   **Impact:** Command Injection - attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system, stealing sensitive data, or causing widespread damage.
*   **Mitigation:** Never construct system commands directly from JSON data. Use parameterized commands or secure APIs. Implement strict input validation and sanitization if command construction is absolutely necessary (highly discouraged).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Data to Bypass Business Logic](./attack_tree_paths/inject_data_to_bypass_business_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates JSON data to bypass business logic checks and constraints.
*   **Mechanism:** By altering values in JSON fields (e.g., IDs, quantities, permissions), an attacker can trick the application into performing actions they are not authorized to do, such as accessing restricted resources, manipulating data in unintended ways, or bypassing payment processes.
*   **Impact:** Business Logic Bypass - unauthorized access, data manipulation, financial loss, data integrity issues.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust business logic validation *after* JSONModel parsing. Do not rely solely on JSONModel's data mapping for security. Validate data integrity and authorization at the application level, based on the application's business rules.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Leakage via Error Messages (Trigger JSON Parsing Errors)](./attack_tree_paths/information_leakage_via_error_messages__trigger_json_parsing_errors_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends malformed JSON to trigger parsing errors.
*   **Mechanism:** If error handling is not properly implemented, error messages might expose sensitive information such as internal server paths, configuration details, or database connection strings.
*   **Impact:** Information Leakage - attackers gain valuable information about the application's internal workings, which can be used to plan further, more targeted attacks.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement custom error handling to sanitize error messages. Avoid exposing internal paths or sensitive data in error responses to users. Log detailed errors securely for debugging purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Error Flooding (Repeatedly Send Malformed JSON)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_error_flooding__repeatedly_send_malformed_json_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker repeatedly sends malformed JSON requests.
*   **Mechanism:** The application's error handling logic is triggered repeatedly, consuming resources (CPU, I/O) and potentially overwhelming the server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service - the application becomes slow or unresponsive due to excessive error handling overhead.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on incoming requests to prevent error flooding. Ensure error handling logic is efficient and doesn't introduce significant performance overhead.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in JSONModel Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jsonmodel_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries that JSONModel depends on.
*   **Mechanism:** If JSONModel uses vulnerable dependencies, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through JSONModel's usage. This could lead to various impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially High Impact - depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, this could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution or Data Breach.
*   **Mitigation:** Regularly audit and update JSONModel and all its dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories for JSONModel and its dependencies.
