# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, JSONModel, is a Swift library designed to simplify the process of parsing JSON data into Swift model objects. In essence, it aims to increase developer productivity and reduce boilerplate code associated with handling JSON responses in Swift applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Primary goal is to enhance developer efficiency by providing a convenient and robust way to map JSON data to Swift objects.
 - Secondary goal is to improve the maintainability of Swift codebases that deal with JSON data by promoting a structured and type-safe approach.
 - Supporting goal is to reduce the likelihood of errors related to manual JSON parsing, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk of developer adoption failure if the library is perceived as too complex or not sufficiently beneficial.
 - Risk of introducing vulnerabilities into applications if the library itself contains security flaws or mishandles malicious JSON input.
 - Risk of dependency issues if the library is not actively maintained or becomes incompatible with newer Swift versions or platforms.
 - Risk of performance bottlenecks if the library's JSON parsing is inefficient, especially when dealing with large JSON datasets.
 - Risk of data integrity issues if the library incorrectly parses or transforms JSON data, leading to data corruption or misrepresentation in the application.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
 - security control: Source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Unit tests are included in the repository, which can help verify the correctness and robustness of the library's functionality, including JSON parsing logic. Implemented: within the project's test suite.
 - security control: The library is written in Swift, a memory-safe language, which reduces the risk of certain types of memory-related vulnerabilities common in languages like C or C++. Implemented: Language choice.

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on external contributors for security vulnerability identification and patching, as the project is open source and community-driven.
 - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be present in dependencies if the library relies on external libraries (though JSONModel has minimal dependencies).
 - accepted risk: Risk of misuse by developers who might not use the library correctly or might integrate it into insecure application architectures.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
 - security control: Conduct regular security audits of the codebase, potentially involving external security experts, to identify and address security weaknesses.
 - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization within the library to handle potentially malicious or malformed JSON input gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
 - security control: Consider code signing the library releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of the distributed library.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a JSON parsing library. Authentication is typically handled at the application level when fetching JSON data from APIs.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a JSON parsing library. Authorization is handled at the application level based on the parsed data and user roles.
 - Input Validation: Critical. The library must robustly handle invalid or malicious JSON input to prevent crashes, unexpected behavior, or potential security exploits in applications using the library. Input validation should be performed during the JSON parsing process to ensure data conforms to expected formats and types.
 - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of a JSON parsing library. Cryptographic operations would be handled by the application using the parsed data if needed. However, the library should not introduce vulnerabilities related to cryptographic operations if it handles any sensitive data indirectly.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - For companies using JSONModel, critical business processes are indirectly affected. If JSONModel has vulnerabilities or parsing issues, applications relying on it might malfunction or become vulnerable, impacting any business process supported by those applications. The most critical process is the reliable and secure operation of applications that depend on JSONModel for data handling.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - JSONModel itself processes JSON data. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the context of the application using JSONModel. JSON data can contain sensitive information like user credentials, personal data, financial details, or proprietary business information.
 - The data being protected is the JSON data being parsed by the library and the integrity of the application that uses the library.
 - Sensitivity levels vary greatly depending on the application domain. For applications handling personal data or financial transactions, the sensitivity is high. For applications dealing with public data, the sensitivity might be lower. However, even in cases of less sensitive data, data integrity and application availability are important.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the intended use case and deployment environment for applications using JSONModel? (Assumption: Broad range of Swift applications, primarily mobile apps).
 - Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards that applications using JSONModel must adhere to? (Assumption: General security best practices for mobile applications).
 - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in JSONModel? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting process via GitHub).
 - Are there any known vulnerabilities or security concerns related to JSONModel? (Assumption: No known critical vulnerabilities at the time of writing, based on public information, but continuous monitoring is needed).

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal for using JSONModel is to improve developer productivity and code maintainability in Swift projects dealing with JSON data. Security is a secondary but important consideration.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Existing security controls are primarily based on open-source practices and Swift language safety. Recommended security controls focus on proactive security measures like automated scanning, security audits, and input validation.
 - DESIGN: The design is centered around a library integrated into mobile applications that communicate with backend APIs. Deployment is typical for mobile applications distributed through app stores and backend APIs hosted in cloud infrastructure. Build process uses standard CI/CD practices with GitHub Actions.
