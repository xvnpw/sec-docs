# Threat Model Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

## Threat: [Malformed JSON Denial of Service](./threats/malformed_json_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a deliberately malformed JSON payload to the application. `jsonmodel`'s underlying JSON parsing mechanism attempts to process this invalid data, potentially leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) and causing the application to slow down, become unresponsive, or crash.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, potential resource exhaustion on the server.

**Affected Component:** Underlying JSON parsing mechanism used by `jsonmodel` (e.g., `NSJSONSerialization`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input size limits on incoming JSON payloads.
* Consider using asynchronous parsing with timeouts to prevent blocking the main thread indefinitely.
* Ensure the underlying platform's JSON parsing libraries are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Over-Reliance on jsonmodel for Input Validation](./threats/over-reliance_on_jsonmodel_for_input_validation.md)

**Description:** Developers might mistakenly rely solely on `jsonmodel` to validate incoming data. `jsonmodel` primarily focuses on mapping JSON to objects and does not provide comprehensive input validation capabilities. This can leave the application vulnerable to attacks that exploit missing validation checks (e.g., exceeding length limits, invalid formats).

**Impact:** Potential for injecting malicious data, bypassing security checks, leading to various application vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** The application's input handling logic where `jsonmodel` is used.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement explicit input validation *before* and *after* using `jsonmodel`.
* Validate data types, ranges, formats, and any other relevant constraints based on the application's requirements.
* Do not solely rely on `jsonmodel` for ensuring data integrity and security.
