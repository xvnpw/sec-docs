# Attack Surface Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion / Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/type_confusion__validation_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers provide subtly malformed JSON that bypasses `jsonmodel`'s validation or causes unexpected type conversions, leading to vulnerabilities in the application logic that uses the processed data.

**How `jsonmodel` Contributes:** `jsonmodel` is the *direct* mechanism for parsing and validating JSON input.  Weaknesses in schema definitions or custom validation logic are the *direct* cause of this vulnerability.

**Example:** A field defined as `IntegerField` accepts "123abc" because initial parsing might succeed, but later processing expecting a pure integer fails. Or, a `ListField` expecting `StringField` elements receives a list containing a dictionary, which is then misinterpreted, leading to a type error or unexpected behavior in code that uses the result.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, *potential code execution* (if type confusion leads to vulnerabilities in downstream libraries), denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on how the processed data is used; potential for code execution elevates this).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Type Definitions:** Use the most specific `jsonmodel` field types possible (e.g., `IntegerField` with `min_value` and `max_value`, `StringField` with `regex`).  Avoid `BaseField` unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Comprehensive Validation:** Ensure *all* fields have appropriate validation rules, including length limits, allowed values, and custom validation functions where necessary.  A "deny-by-default" approach is crucial.
    *   **Post-`jsonmodel` Validation:** Implement additional validation *after* `jsonmodel` processing, especially for security-critical fields. Double-check types and values *before* using them in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries, system calls).
    *   **Robust Custom Validators:** Thoroughly test and review any custom validation functions. Use well-established libraries for complex validation tasks (e.g., date/time parsing). Avoid complex regular expressions; use ReDoS-safe libraries if necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - via `jsonmodel` Parsing](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__dos__-_via__jsonmodel__parsing.md)

**Description:** Attackers provide excessively large or deeply nested JSON payloads that consume excessive memory or CPU *during `jsonmodel`'s parsing and object instantiation*, leading to denial of service.

**How `jsonmodel` Contributes:** `jsonmodel` is *directly* responsible for parsing the JSON and creating Python objects. Without limits enforced *within* the `jsonmodel` schema, it can be forced to allocate large amounts of memory.

**Example:** A field defined as `StringField` without a `max_length` receives a multi-gigabyte string, causing `jsonmodel` to attempt to allocate a huge string object. A deeply nested JSON object causes excessive recursion *within jsonmodel's parsing logic*.

**Impact:** Denial of service (application becomes unresponsive).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **`jsonmodel` Field Limits:** *Crucially*, use `jsonmodel`'s built-in validation features to enforce limits *within the schema itself*:
        *   `StringField`: *Always* use `max_length`.
        *   `ListField`: *Always* use `min_items` and `max_items`.
        *   `DictField`: Consider limits on the number of keys, especially if keys are attacker-controlled.
    *   **Recursion Limits (within `jsonmodel`):** Implement limits on the depth of recursion *specifically within `jsonmodel`'s processing*. This likely requires a custom validator that tracks recursion depth during the parsing of recursive structures. This is distinct from application-level limits.

## Attack Surface: [Recursive Structure Attacks (within `jsonmodel`)](./attack_surfaces/recursive_structure_attacks__within__jsonmodel__.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit models with recursive relationships by providing deeply nested or cyclical JSON data, leading to stack overflows or denial of service *during `jsonmodel`'s processing*.

**How `jsonmodel` Contributes:** `jsonmodel` *directly* supports recursive model definitions and handles the parsing of such structures. The vulnerability exists within `jsonmodel`'s handling of these recursive structures.

**Example:** A model representing a comment thread where comments can reply to other comments is abused with deeply nested replies, causing a stack overflow *within `jsonmodel`'s parsing logic*.

**Impact:** Stack overflow, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Depth Limits (within `jsonmodel`):** Implement explicit limits on the depth of recursion *allowed during `jsonmodel`'s processing*. This is *essential* for any recursive model and must be handled *within the context of `jsonmodel`'s validation*, likely through a custom validator that tracks the recursion depth as the JSON is parsed. This is *not* a general application-level check; it's specific to `jsonmodel`'s handling of the recursive structure.
