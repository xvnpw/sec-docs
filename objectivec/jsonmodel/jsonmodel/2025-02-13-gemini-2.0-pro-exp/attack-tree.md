## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   Description:  Attacker overwhelms the application by providing input that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory).
    *   **1.1.1 Deeply Nested JSON [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   Description: Attacker sends a JSON payload with an extremely deep level of nesting (e.g., many nested objects or arrays). This can lead to stack overflow errors or excessive memory allocation, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
    *   **1.1.2 Large Arrays [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   Description: Attacker sends a JSON payload containing very large arrays.  Processing these arrays can consume excessive memory, leading to application crashes or slowdowns.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   **1.2.1 Infinite Recursion via `to_python()` [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   Description: Attacker crafts input that, when processed by `jsonmodel`'s `to_python()` method, triggers infinite recursion due to circular dependencies in the model definitions or custom validation logic. This leads to a stack overflow and application crash.
    *   Likelihood: Low
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__arbitrary_code_execution__ace_.md)

*   **2.2 Exploit Custom Validation Logic**
    *   **2.2.1 Inject malicious code into `validate()` callback [CRITICAL]**
        *   Description: Attacker injects arbitrary Python code into the input, which is then executed by the application if the custom `validate()` function uses `eval()`, `exec()`, or similar functions. This gives the attacker complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
        *   Likelihood: Low (should be very low with proper coding practices)
        *   Impact: Very High
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    * **2.2.2 Bypass Validation via Edge Cases in Custom Logic [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   Description: Attacker crafts input that exploits edge cases or flaws in the custom validation logic to bypass intended validation rules. This could allow invalid or malicious data to be processed, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities.
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: Medium to High
        *   Effort: Medium to High
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard
