# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple, intuitive, and efficient way to define data models using JSON.
*   Enable developers to easily create, validate, and manage data structures.
*   Offer a lightweight and versatile solution for various applications, including web and mobile development.
*   Reduce development time and effort by providing a clear and concise data modeling approach.
*   Ensure data consistency and integrity across different parts of an application.

Business Risks:

*   Inconsistent data validation could lead to data corruption or application instability.
*   Lack of robust error handling might expose sensitive information or cause unexpected application behavior.
*   Insufficient documentation or community support could hinder adoption and long-term maintainability.
*   Performance bottlenecks in the library could impact the performance of applications using it.
*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited to compromise applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input validation: The library performs input validation based on the provided JSON schema. (Described in the library's documentation and implemented in the code.)
*   security control: Type checking: The library enforces type checking based on the schema definition. (Described in the library's documentation and implemented in the code.)
*   security control: Basic tests: The repository includes a set of basic tests to ensure core functionality. (Located in the `tests` directory.)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited support for complex schema validation scenarios.
*   accepted risk: The library's security relies on the correctness of the provided JSON schema.
*   accepted risk: No built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) as it's a data modeling library, not a web framework.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Enhanced input validation: Implement more robust input validation, including checks for regular expression patterns, string lengths, and numeric ranges, beyond basic type checking.
*   security control: Fuzz testing: Introduce fuzz testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and edge cases that might not be covered by standard unit tests.
*   security control: Security audits: Conduct regular security audits of the codebase to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency management: Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Documentation of security considerations: Provide clear documentation on security best practices for using the library, including how to define secure schemas and handle potential vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to this library, as it's a data modeling tool, not an authentication system. Authentication should be handled at the application level.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to this library. Authorization should be handled at the application level.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library MUST validate all input data against the provided JSON schema.
    *   The library MUST support standard JSON schema validation keywords (e.g., `type`, `format`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `enum`).
    *   The library SHOULD provide mechanisms for extending validation with custom rules.
    *   The library MUST handle validation errors gracefully, providing informative error messages.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as the library doesn't handle sensitive data storage or transmission. Cryptographic operations should be handled at the application level if needed.
*   Data Sensitivity: The library should treat all data as potentially sensitive and avoid unnecessary exposure or logging of data values.

    Developer["Developer"]
    Git["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    Tests["Tests"]
    Linter["Linter (e.g., Pylint)"]
    BuildArtifact["Build Artifact (Python Package)"]
    PyPI2["PyPI"]

    Developer -- "Commits Code" --> Git
    Git -- "Triggers Build" --> Tests
    Tests -- "Runs Tests" --> Linter
    Linter -- "Checks Code Style" --> BuildArtifact
    BuildArtifact -- "Published to" --> PyPI2
```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Code Commit:** The developer commits code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  **Build Trigger:** A commit to the repository triggers the build process (e.g., via GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or another CI/CD system).  This project doesn't currently have automated CI/CD.
3.  **Testing:** The build process runs the test suite to ensure code quality and functionality.
4.  **Linting:** A linter (e.g., Pylint) checks the code for style and potential errors.
5.  **Package Creation:** If tests and linting pass, a Python package is created (e.g., a source distribution and a wheel).
6.  **Publish:** The package is published to PyPI (the Python Package Index).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   **Code Repository Security:** The Git repository (GitHub) provides access control and version history.
*   **Automated Testing:** The test suite helps ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **Linting:** The linter enforces code style and helps identify potential errors.
*   *Recommended:* **Dependency Scanning:** A dependency scanner (e.g., pip-audit, Snyk) should be integrated into the build process to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   *Recommended:* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** A SAST tool (e.g., Bandit) should be integrated to scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data validation and consistency: Ensuring that data conforms to defined schemas is crucial for application stability and data integrity.
*   Data model management: Providing a reliable and efficient way to manage data models is essential for developer productivity.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   The library itself doesn't directly handle sensitive data. However, the *schemas* defined using the library can describe sensitive data. The *data* processed by applications *using* the library can be highly sensitive, depending on the application's purpose.
*   Data Sensitivity Levels:
    *   **Schema Definitions:** Low sensitivity (unless the schema itself reveals sensitive information about the application's data structure).
    *   **Data Processed by Applications:** Variable sensitivity, ranging from low (e.g., public data) to high (e.g., personally identifiable information, financial data, health data). The application using JsonModel is responsible for appropriately handling the sensitivity of the data.
