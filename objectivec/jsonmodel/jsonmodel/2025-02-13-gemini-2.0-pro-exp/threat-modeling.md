# Threat Model Analysis for jsonmodel/jsonmodel

## Threat: [Malicious Type Coercion via `BaseField` Subclasses (Without Strict Mode)](./threats/malicious_type_coercion_via__basefield__subclasses__without_strict_mode_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload where a field's type is subtly different from what a `BaseField` subclass (e.g., `IntField`, `FloatField`, `StringField`) expects, but still passes initial, weak validation because `strict=False` (or the equivalent) is used.  The attacker might send a string "123" to an `IntField`, or a very large number as a string to bypass size limitations. This exploits the lack of strict type enforcement *within* `jsonmodel`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unexpected application behavior due to incorrect data types being used internally.  This can lead to logic errors, crashes, or data corruption *if the application doesn't perform its own type checks after deserialization*.
        *   Bypass of intended validation logic within `jsonmodel`, leading to data integrity issues.
    *   **Affected Component:** `BaseField` and its subclasses (e.g., `IntField`, `FloatField`, `StringField`, `BoolField`, `DateField`, `DateTimeField`, etc.), specifically when `strict=False` (or the equivalent for the specific field type) is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it directly impacts data integrity and can lead to unexpected behavior due to `jsonmodel`'s lax validation).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Strict Type Checking:**  *Always* use the `strict=True` option (or equivalent) in `BaseField` subclasses to enforce strict type validation within `jsonmodel`. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Custom Validators:** Implement custom validators (using the `validators` argument) for additional, more granular type and range checks, even with `strict=True`, for extra security.

## Threat: [Unexpected Field Injection via `__allow_extra_fields__`](./threats/unexpected_field_injection_via____allow_extra_fields___.md)

*   **Description:** If `__allow_extra_fields__` is set to `True` on a `jsonmodel` class, an attacker injects fields into the JSON payload that are *not* defined in the model.  `jsonmodel` itself will ignore these, but the threat arises if the application later processes these extra fields. This is a direct vulnerability in how `jsonmodel` handles (or doesn't handle) undefined fields.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unexpected application behavior *if* the application logic iterates over all keys in the deserialized object or otherwise uses the injected fields. This is a potential vulnerability, but the severity depends on *how* the application uses the data *after* deserialization. The threat here is that `jsonmodel` *allows* this to happen.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `jsonmodel` class itself, specifically the behavior controlled by `__allow_extra_fields__` (or any similar configuration option).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it allows unexpected data to be passed through `jsonmodel`, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if the application isn't careful).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Extra Fields:** Set `__allow_extra_fields__` to `False` (or the equivalent) to prevent `jsonmodel` from accepting extra fields. This is the most secure and direct mitigation.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Large `StringField` or `ListField` (Without Length Limits)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_large__stringfield__or__listfield___without_length_limits_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing a very large string in a `StringField` or a very long list in a `ListField`, exceeding memory limits or causing excessive processing time *during* `jsonmodel`'s validation and deserialization. This directly exploits the lack of size limits *within* the `jsonmodel` field definitions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application crash due to out-of-memory errors.
        *   Denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption during `jsonmodel` processing.
        *   Resource exhaustion on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `StringField` and `ListField` (and potentially other field types that can accept large amounts of data), specifically when `max_length` (or equivalent) is *not* specified or is set to a very high value.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it's a direct DoS attack leveraging `jsonmodel`'s handling of potentially unbounded data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Set `max_length`:**  *Always* set a reasonable `max_length` (or equivalent) on `StringField` and `ListField` within the `jsonmodel` definitions. This is the primary mitigation.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Deeply Nested Structures](./threats/denial_of_service_via_deeply_nested_structures.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with deeply nested objects or arrays, exploiting the recursive nature of `jsonmodel`'s validation and deserialization process. This directly targets the recursive handling *within* `jsonmodel`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Stack overflow errors due to excessive recursion within `jsonmodel`.
        *   Denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption during `jsonmodel` processing.
        *   Application crash.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `jsonmodel` validation and deserialization process, particularly when dealing with nested `jsonmodel` classes or fields like `ListField` containing other `jsonmodel` instances.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it's a direct DoS attack exploiting `jsonmodel`'s recursive nature).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Nesting Depth:** Implement a custom validator *within* the `jsonmodel` definition (or a pre-processing check, but ideally within `jsonmodel`) to limit the maximum depth of nesting allowed in the JSON data.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via `RegexField`](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__via__regexfield_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious regular expression or input string that causes catastrophic backtracking when used with a `RegexField` or a custom validator *within* a `jsonmodel` definition that uses regular expressions. This directly targets the regex engine used by `jsonmodel`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption during `jsonmodel`'s regex validation.
        *   Resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `RegexField` and any custom validators *within* `jsonmodel` definitions that utilize regular expressions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (because it's a direct DoS attack exploiting `jsonmodel`'s regex handling).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Complex Regex:** Use simple, well-understood regular expressions within `jsonmodel`. Avoid nested quantifiers.
        *   **ReDoS Testing:** Use tools to detect ReDoS vulnerabilities in regular expressions used *within* `jsonmodel` definitions.
        *   **Regex Timeouts:** If possible, set timeouts for regular expression matching. This might require custom code or integration with other libraries, but the vulnerable regex is *within* the `jsonmodel` definition.
