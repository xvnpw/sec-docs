**Threat Model: Compromising Application Using JSONModel - High-Risk Sub-Tree**

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the JSONModel library.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Malformed JSON Exploitation **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Trigger Parser Errors/Exceptions **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Send Invalid JSON Syntax
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Send Unexpected Data Types for Expected Fields
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Cause Resource Exhaustion
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Send Extremely Large JSON Payloads
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Type Confusion/Mismatch Exploitation
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Provide JSON Data with Incorrect Types (e.g., String for Number)
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Injection Attacks via Unsanitized Data **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Inject Malicious Strings into JSON Fields

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   This category represents a critical entry point for attackers. Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles input data is a common and often effective attack vector.

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Malformed JSON Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   This involves sending syntactically incorrect or unexpected JSON data to trigger errors or resource exhaustion.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Parser Errors/Exceptions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Send Invalid JSON Syntax:**
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: Moderate (Application crash, denial of service)
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Send Unexpected Data Types for Expected Fields:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: Moderate (Application crash, unexpected behavior)
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Cause Resource Exhaustion:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Send Extremely Large JSON Payloads:**
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: Significant (Denial of service, memory exhaustion)
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Type Confusion/Mismatch Exploitation:**
    *   This involves sending JSON data with types that do not match the expected types, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Provide JSON Data with Incorrect Types (e.g., String for Number):**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Moderate (Unexpected behavior, potential crashes, data corruption)
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Low
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Injection Attacks via Unsanitized Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   This involves injecting malicious strings into JSON fields, which can be exploited if the application doesn't properly sanitize the data before using it in sensitive contexts.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Strings into JSON Fields:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (Depends on application usage of data)
            *   Impact: Significant (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
