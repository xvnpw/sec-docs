*   **Threat:** Malformed JSON Processing
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends deliberately malformed or invalid JSON data to the application's endpoint. This could exploit vulnerabilities in `jsonmodel`'s parsing logic, causing the application to crash, throw exceptions, or enter an unexpected state. The attacker aims to disrupt the application's availability or potentially trigger exploitable errors within `jsonmodel` itself.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crashes or resource exhaustion directly caused by `jsonmodel`'s failure to handle malformed input. Potential for unexpected application behavior stemming from errors within `jsonmodel`.
    *   **Affected Component:** `JSONModel`'s internal JSON parsing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust error handling around the `JSONModel` parsing process to catch and manage exceptions gracefully.
        *   Utilize a dedicated JSON schema validation library *before* passing data to `JSONModel` to ensure the input conforms to the expected structure, preventing `JSONModel` from encountering malformed data.
        *   Consider setting timeouts for JSON parsing operations to prevent resource exhaustion within `JSONModel`.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `JSONModel` Library
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability within the `JSONModel` library itself. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code within the application's context, bypass security checks implemented by the application, or gain unauthorized access to data handled by `JSONModel`. The attacker's actions are directly enabled by a flaw in `JSONModel`.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure and data manipulation to complete application compromise, depending on the severity of the vulnerability within `JSONModel`.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the `JSONModel` library code containing the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a severe vulnerability exists)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `JSONModel` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the maintainers.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with `JSONModel`.
