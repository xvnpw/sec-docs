## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary System Commands on Server](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_system_commands_on_server.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a lack of input sanitization in data provided to pnchart. If pnchart uses external commands to generate charts, the attacker injects malicious commands within the data (e.g., in labels or values). These injected commands are then executed by the server's operating system with the privileges of the application.

**Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of files, installation of malware, and disruption of services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code within Application Context](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_within_application_context.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a lack of input sanitization in data provided to pnchart. If pnchart interprets certain data as code (e.g., through a templating engine or dynamic evaluation), the attacker injects malicious code within the data. This injected code is then executed within the application's environment, allowing the attacker to manipulate application logic, access data, or perform other actions.

**Potential Impact:** Complete control over the application, including access to its data, modification of application behavior, and potentially using the application to launch further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Image Processing](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__through_image_processing.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides specially crafted data to pnchart that triggers a known vulnerability in the underlying image processing libraries (like GD or ImageMagick). These vulnerabilities can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server during the image generation process.

**Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the server, similar to command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to the Application through a Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_the_application_through_a_vulnerable_dependency.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in one of pnchart's third-party dependencies. They then exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the application's resources or data. The specific method of exploitation depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency.

**Potential Impact:**  Can range from unauthorized access to sensitive data to complete control over the application, depending on the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) through a Vulnerable Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__through_a_vulnerable_dependency.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a known vulnerability in one of pnchart's third-party dependencies that allows for remote code execution. They exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using pnchart](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_pnchart.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the overall security objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Data Handling Vulnerabilities in pnchart](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_data_handling_vulnerabilities_in_pnchart.md)

This node represents a broad category of attacks that stem from insecure handling of data provided to pnchart. Preventing attacks at this level is crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Chart Generation](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_chart_generation.md)

This is a key step in many high-risk attack paths. Preventing the injection of malicious data effectively blocks these attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization.md)

This node highlights the fundamental vulnerability that enables command and code injection. Implementing proper input sanitization is paramount.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Command Injection (if pnchart uses external commands)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_command_injection__if_pnchart_uses_external_commands_.md)

This node represents a direct path to server compromise and is therefore critical to prevent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Injection (if pnchart interprets data as code)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_injection__if_pnchart_interprets_data_as_code_.md)

This node represents a direct path to application compromise and is critical to prevent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in GD, ImageMagick, etc. (if used by pnchart)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_gd__imagemagick__etc___if_used_by_pnchart_.md)

This node highlights the importance of keeping underlying libraries up-to-date and secure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Vulnerabilities in pnchart's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerabilities_in_pnchart's_dependencies.md)

This node emphasizes the need for careful dependency management and vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

This node specifically focuses on the act of exploiting vulnerabilities in pnchart's dependencies.
