# Attack Surface Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection through Chart Data](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_through_chart_data.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or unexpected data is provided as input to `pnchart` for rendering charts.
    *   **How pnchart Contributes:** `pnchart` processes the provided data to generate the chart. If this data is not properly sanitized or validated before being used by `pnchart`'s rendering functions, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an extremely long string for a chart label. When `pnchart` attempts to render this label, it could lead to a buffer overflow in the underlying graphics library or cause excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion, unexpected chart rendering leading to misleading information, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in underlying graphics libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all data before passing it to `pnchart`. This includes escaping special characters and removing potentially harmful content.
        *   Validate the data against expected formats, types, and lengths. Implement strict limits on the size and complexity of data.

## Attack Surface: [Output Vulnerabilities in Generated Images](./attack_surfaces/output_vulnerabilities_in_generated_images.md)

*   **Description:** `pnchart` generates image files (typically PNG). If the data used to generate the image is not properly handled, it could lead to the creation of malformed images.
    *   **How pnchart Contributes:** `pnchart`'s image generation process is directly responsible for the final image output. Vulnerabilities in how it handles data during this process can lead to exploitable images.
    *   **Example:** Providing specific data patterns that cause `pnchart` to generate a PNG image with a malformed header or corrupted data chunks. When a user's browser or image viewer attempts to render this image, it could trigger a vulnerability in that software.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side vulnerabilities leading to potential code execution on the user's machine when they view the generated image. Denial of service on the client-side due to malformed images crashing the viewer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `pnchart` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Ensure the underlying graphics libraries used by `pnchart` are also up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential client-side exploits.
