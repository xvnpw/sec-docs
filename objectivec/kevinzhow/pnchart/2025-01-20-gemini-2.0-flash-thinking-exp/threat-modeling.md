# Threat Model Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Threat: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data](./threats/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into data provided to `pnchart` (e.g., chart labels, tooltips, data points). This code would then be executed in the victim's browser when the chart is rendered. The attacker might steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact:** High - Could lead to account compromise, data theft, or defacement of the application.

**Affected pnchart Component:** Rendering logic for text elements (labels, tooltips), potentially data processing if not properly escaped before rendering.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict output encoding/escaping of all user-controlled data before passing it to `pnchart`.
* Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into chart configuration without sanitization.

## Threat: [SVG Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/svg_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SVG code into data used by `pnchart` for rendering charts. This injected SVG could contain JavaScript that executes in the user's browser, similar to XSS. The attacker might leverage SVG features to perform actions like making unauthorized API calls or displaying misleading content.

**Impact:** High - Similar to XSS, could lead to account compromise, data theft, or defacement.

**Affected pnchart Component:** SVG rendering module, specifically the part responsible for embedding data into SVG attributes or elements.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and encode user-provided data before embedding it into SVG elements.
* Avoid constructing SVG strings directly from user input.
* If possible, configure `pnchart` to use a safer rendering method if available.

## Threat: [Use of Vulnerable pnchart Version](./threats/use_of_vulnerable_pnchart_version.md)

**Description:** If the application uses an outdated version of `pnchart` with known security vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit these flaws. This requires the attacker to be aware of the specific vulnerabilities present in the used version.

**Impact:** Varies - The impact depends on the severity of the vulnerability. Could range from low to critical.

**Affected pnchart Component:** The entire library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `pnchart` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for `pnchart`.
