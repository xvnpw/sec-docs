# Threat Model Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection Leading to Client-Side Script Execution (XSS)](./threats/malicious_data_injection_leading_to_client-side_script_execution__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted data that, when processed and rendered by `pnchart`, injects and executes arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could happen through specially crafted values in data points, labels, or other configurable chart elements. The attacker might manipulate the data source or intercept and modify data before it reaches `pnchart`.

**Impact:** Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript can lead to various malicious activities, including:

*   Stealing user session cookies and authentication tokens.
*   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
*   Modifying the content of the web page.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Affected Component:** `pnchart`'s rendering logic, specifically how it handles and displays text-based data within chart elements (e.g., labels, tooltips, data point values).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly sanitize and encode all user-provided data before passing it to `pnchart`. Use browser-specific encoding functions to prevent script execution.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
*   Regularly update `pnchart` to the latest version, as vulnerabilities might be patched in newer releases.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in `pnchart`'s Rendering Logic](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in__pnchart_'s_rendering_logic.md)

**Description:**  `pnchart`'s rendering engine might contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited by providing specific, potentially malformed, data. This could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or even the ability to execute arbitrary code if a severe vulnerability exists. The attacker would need to understand the internal workings of `pnchart`'s rendering process to craft such malicious input.

**Impact:**  Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, the impact could range from minor rendering glitches to complete application failure or even client-side code execution.

**Affected Component:** `pnchart`'s core rendering modules responsible for drawing chart elements.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible) / High (for other significant rendering issues)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Stay updated with the latest version of `pnchart` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reported issues related to `pnchart`.
*   Consider performing rigorous testing with various input data, including potentially malformed data, to identify unexpected behavior.
