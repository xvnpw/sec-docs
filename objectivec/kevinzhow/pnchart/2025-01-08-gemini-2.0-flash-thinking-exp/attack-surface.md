# Attack Surface Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Chart Element Input](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_chart_element_input.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into chart elements (labels, titles, tooltips) if user-controlled data is directly used by `pnchart` without proper sanitization.
    *   **How pnchart Contributes:** `pnchart` renders the provided data into SVG or Canvas elements. If this data includes unescaped HTML or JavaScript, the browser will execute it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate input data for a bar chart label to be `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`. When `pnchart` renders this label, the script will execute in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Always sanitize user-provided data on the server-side *before* passing it to the client-side for rendering with `pnchart`. Use appropriate HTML escaping functions or libraries specific to your server-side language.
        *   **Context-Aware Encoding:**  If direct HTML rendering is necessary in specific chart elements, ensure context-aware encoding is applied. For SVG, this might involve encoding specific characters or using secure methods for embedding HTML.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Maliciously Crafted Data](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_maliciously_crafted_data.md)

*   **Description:** Providing excessively large or complex datasets to `pnchart` can overwhelm the client-side rendering process, leading to browser unresponsiveness or crashes.
    *   **How pnchart Contributes:** `pnchart` attempts to process and render all provided data. Inefficient rendering algorithms or lack of input validation can make it susceptible to large datasets.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could send an extremely large array of data points for a line chart, causing the user's browser to freeze or crash while trying to render the chart.
    *   **Impact:** Temporary unavailability of the application for the affected user, potentially impacting user experience and productivity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Limits:** Implement server-side validation to limit the size and complexity of data accepted for chart generation. Set reasonable maximums for the number of data points, label lengths, etc.
        *   **Client-Side Rate Limiting (Carefully Considered):**  While more complex, consider client-side mechanisms to prevent rapid submission of large datasets. However, avoid overly aggressive client-side restrictions that could impact legitimate users.
        *   **Optimize Data Processing (If Possible):** If you have control over how data is prepared before being passed to `pnchart`, optimize this process to reduce the load on the client-side rendering.
