## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of the `pnchart` project, a Python-based command-line tool designed to generate visual network diagrams from a user-defined configuration. The primary purpose of this document is to clearly articulate the system's architecture, individual components, and the flow of data within the application. This detailed design serves as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities, enabling a comprehensive security analysis of the `pnchart` tool.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To develop a user-friendly command-line tool capable of generating informative visual representations of network configurations.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Input Flexibility:** Accept structured input describing network topologies from a user-specified file. Supported formats will initially include YAML and JSON.
    *   **Visual Representation:** Utilize a robust graph visualization library to render the network diagram in a clear and understandable manner.
    *   **Output Variety:** Produce the diagram in common image formats such as PNG and SVG, allowing for easy sharing and integration.
    *   **Ease of Use:** Provide a straightforward command-line interface with clear options and informative feedback.
    *   **Maintainability and Extensibility:** Implement a modular design to facilitate future enhancements and the addition of new features.

## 3. System Architecture

The `pnchart` tool is structured around a modular architecture, promoting separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability. The core functionalities are divided into distinct components that interact to achieve the desired outcome.

*   **Key Architectural Elements:**
    *   **Configuration Management:** Responsible for handling the loading and validation of the user-provided configuration.
    *   **Graph Abstraction Layer:** Provides an interface for interacting with the underlying graph data structure, decoupling the core logic from the specific graph library.
    *   **Rendering Engine Interface:**  Abstracts the interaction with the chosen graph visualization library, allowing for potential future swaps of rendering engines.
    *   **Command Handling:** Manages the processing of user commands and orchestrates the execution of the other components.

*   **Core Components:**
    *   **Input Parser:**  Dedicated to reading and interpreting the user's configuration file. Supports YAML and JSON formats.
    *   **Graph Builder:**  Constructs an in-memory representation of the network graph based on the validated data from the Input Parser.
    *   **Renderer:**  Leverages a graph visualization library to generate the visual diagram from the in-memory graph.
    *   **Output Handler:**  Manages the process of saving the generated diagram to the specified file format and location.
    *   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  Provides the primary point of interaction for the user, handling command-line arguments and initiating the workflow.

## 4. Detailed Component Description

*   **Input Parser:**
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Reads the configuration file path provided by the user via the CLI.
        *   Determines the file format (YAML or JSON) based on file extension or explicit user specification.
        *   Utilizes appropriate libraries (`PyYAML` for YAML, `json` for JSON) to parse the file content.
        *   Performs schema validation against a predefined schema to ensure the input data conforms to the expected structure.
        *   Implements robust error handling for file not found, invalid format, and schema validation failures.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Employs try-except blocks for handling potential exceptions during file operations and parsing.
        *   Schema validation will be implemented using libraries like `jsonschema` or `Cerberus`.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   **YAML/JSON Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  Mitigation strategies include using safe loading methods (`yaml.safe_load`) and strictly adhering to defined schemas.
        *   **Malicious File Injection:**  While the tool primarily reads local files, care must be taken to prevent scenarios where the tool could be tricked into parsing malicious remote content if such functionality were added in the future.

*   **Graph Builder:**
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Receives the validated and parsed configuration data from the Input Parser.
        *   Transforms the parsed data into an abstract graph representation, independent of the specific rendering library. This representation will likely consist of nodes and edges with associated attributes.
        *   Performs logical validation of the network structure (e.g., ensuring referenced nodes exist).
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Utilizes a suitable data structure (e.g., a dictionary of nodes and a list of edges) to represent the graph.
        *   The graph abstraction layer will define interfaces for adding nodes, edges, and retrieving graph information.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The graph builder needs to be resilient to extremely large or complex configurations that could lead to excessive memory consumption or processing time. Implement checks and potential safeguards against such scenarios.
        *   **Logic Errors:** Ensure the graph construction logic correctly interprets the input configuration to prevent the generation of inaccurate diagrams.

*   **Renderer:**
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Accepts the abstract graph representation from the Graph Builder.
        *   Utilizes the `graphviz` library to translate the abstract graph into a visual diagram.
        *   Allows for customization of visual attributes such as node shapes, colors, labels, and layout algorithms through configuration options or command-line arguments.
        *   Supports generating output in various image formats supported by `graphviz` (e.g., PNG, SVG, PDF).
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Interacts with the `graphviz` library through its Python bindings.
        *   Configuration options will be translated into `graphviz` attributes and settings.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   **`graphviz` Vulnerabilities:**  Keep the `graphviz` library updated to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **SVG Output and XSS:** When generating SVG output, sanitize any user-provided labels or attributes to prevent the injection of malicious scripts. Consider using `graphviz`'s built-in sanitization features if available.

*   **Output Handler:**
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Receives the rendered diagram data (in a format suitable for the chosen output type) from the Renderer.
        *   Constructs the output file path based on user input or default settings.
        *   Writes the diagram data to the specified file location.
        *   Handles potential file I/O errors (e.g., permission issues, disk full).
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Uses standard Python file I/O operations.
        *   Implements error handling using try-except blocks.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   **Path Traversal:**  Validate the output file path provided by the user to prevent writing to arbitrary locations on the file system. Consider using functions that resolve relative paths securely.
        *   **Overwriting Existing Files:**  Implement a mechanism to prevent accidental overwriting of existing files (e.g., prompting the user or providing an option to avoid overwriting).

*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Provides the primary interface for user interaction.
        *   Utilizes the `argparse` library to define and parse command-line arguments (e.g., input file path, output file path, output format, styling options).
        *   Validates user-provided arguments.
        *   Orchestrates the execution of the core components based on the parsed arguments.
        *   Provides informative error messages to the user in case of invalid input or errors during processing.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Defines clear and concise command-line options and usage instructions.
        *   Implements input validation to ensure arguments are of the correct type and within acceptable ranges.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   **Command Injection:**  While less likely in this tool's current scope, ensure that any user-provided input used in constructing system commands (if such functionality were added) is properly sanitized to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.

```

*   **User Interaction:** The user invokes the `pnchart` tool from the command line, providing the path to the input configuration file and any desired options (e.g., output file path, format).
*   **CLI Argument Parsing & Validation:** The CLI component parses the command-line arguments, validating their format and ensuring required arguments are present.
*   **Input Parser:** The Input Parser reads the specified configuration file, determines its format, and parses the content into a structured data representation. Schema validation is performed at this stage.
*   **Graph Builder:** The Graph Builder receives the validated configuration data and constructs an in-memory representation of the network graph, using an abstract representation.
*   **Renderer:** The Renderer takes the abstract graph representation and utilizes the `graphviz` library to generate the visual diagram in the desired output format.
*   **Output Handler:** The Output Handler receives the rendered diagram data and saves it to the specified output file path.
*   **Output Diagram File (PNG, SVG, etc.):** The final network diagram image is generated and stored in the chosen format.

## 6. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)

This section details potential security vulnerabilities and considerations relevant for threat modeling.

*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **YAML/JSON Deserialization Attacks:** Failure to use safe loading practices or adequately validate input schemas could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious input files.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Payloads:** Processing excessively large or deeply nested input files could exhaust system resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial of service. Implement size limits and resource monitoring.
    *   **Path Traversal in Input File Path:** While the tool reads local files, ensure that input file path handling prevents users from accessing or processing files outside of intended directories.

*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Third-Party Library Exploits:** The project relies on external libraries like `PyYAML`, `json`, `argparse`, and `graphviz`. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited. Implement a process for regularly updating dependencies and monitoring for security advisories. Use tools like `safety` to check for known vulnerabilities.

*   **Output Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal in Output File Path:**  Insufficient validation of the output file path could allow attackers to write the generated diagram to sensitive locations on the file system, potentially overwriting critical files. Implement strict path validation and sanitization.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Output:** Ensure that the generated diagrams do not inadvertently expose sensitive information contained within the network configuration if the diagrams are shared publicly. Consider options for redacting sensitive data.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in SVG Output:** If the tool generates SVG diagrams, user-provided node labels or other attributes could be vectors for XSS attacks if not properly sanitized. Utilize `graphviz`'s sanitization features or implement custom sanitization logic.

*   **Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **DoS via Complex Graphs:** Generating diagrams for extremely large and complex network topologies could consume significant system resources, potentially leading to a denial of service. Consider implementing safeguards like resource limits or timeouts.

*   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities (Mitigation Focus):**
    *   While not immediately apparent in the current design, if future features involve executing external commands based on user input (e.g., calling external network tools), rigorous input sanitization and validation are crucial to prevent command injection attacks. Avoid direct execution of shell commands with user-provided data.

*   **Error Handling and Information Leaks:**
    *   **Verbose Error Messages:** Ensure that error messages displayed to the user do not reveal sensitive information about the system's internal workings, file paths, or configuration details. Implement generic error messages and log detailed information securely.

## 7. Deployment

*   The `pnchart` tool is intended for deployment as a command-line utility, primarily for use on local workstations or within controlled environments.
*   Installation will typically be performed using `pip`, the Python package installer. A `setup.py` file will be provided for easy installation.
*   Users will need to ensure that the necessary dependencies, including `graphviz` (which may require system-level installation), are installed on their systems. Installation instructions will be clearly documented.
*   No server-side deployment is currently planned for this tool.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   **Support for Additional Input Formats:** Expanding the tool to support more network configuration formats (e.g., NetBox exports, CSV).
*   **Interactive Diagram Features:** Exploring the possibility of adding interactive elements to the generated diagrams (e.g., clickable nodes, tooltips).
*   **Cloud Integration:**  Potentially integrating with cloud platforms to directly generate diagrams from cloud infrastructure configurations.
*   **Enhanced Styling and Customization:** Providing users with more granular control over the visual appearance of the diagrams through configuration options or themes.

This improved design document provides a more detailed and comprehensive overview of the `pnchart` project, with a stronger emphasis on security considerations relevant for threat modeling. The outlined vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies should be thoroughly evaluated during the threat modeling process to ensure the tool is developed with security in mind.
