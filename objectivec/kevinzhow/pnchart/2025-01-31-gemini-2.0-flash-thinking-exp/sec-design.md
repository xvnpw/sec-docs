# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a Javascript charting library, designed to be integrated into web applications to provide data visualization capabilities.

Business priorities and goals:
- Provide a reusable, easy-to-integrate charting library for web developers.
- Offer a range of chart types and customization options to meet diverse visualization needs.
- Ensure the library is performant and does not negatively impact the user experience of applications using it.
- Maintain and update the library to address bugs, add features, and ensure compatibility with modern web browsers and frameworks.
- Encourage community contribution and adoption to improve and expand the library's capabilities.

Most important business risks:
- Low adoption rate due to competition from other charting libraries or lack of perceived value.
- Bugs or performance issues that lead to negative feedback and discourage adoption.
- Security vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited in applications using it, damaging reputation and trust.
- Lack of maintenance and updates, leading to obsolescence and reduced usability over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security.
- security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and potential vulnerability identification.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies if not regularly updated and scanned.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in the library code itself, requiring ongoing security awareness and code review.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) including security requirements, threat modeling, secure coding practices, and security testing.
- security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the development and build process to automatically identify potential code vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement Dependency Scanning to automatically identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the project.
- security control: Establish a process for security vulnerability reporting and response, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security best practices.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for a client-side charting library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that integrate this library.
- Authorization: Not applicable for a client-side charting library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that integrate this library.
- Input validation:
    - security requirement: The library must validate all input data to prevent unexpected behavior, errors, or potential vulnerabilities when processing data for chart rendering.
    - security requirement: Input validation should be implemented to handle various data types, formats, and potential edge cases, ensuring robustness and preventing injection attacks if data is dynamically generated.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable for the core charting functionality of the library. Cryptographic operations are expected to be handled by the applications that integrate this library if needed for data security.

- Build Environment: A controlled environment where the build process executes. This could be a containerized environment or a dedicated build server.
- Build Artifacts (Javascript Files): The output of the build process, which are the distributable Javascript files of the pnchart library.
- Package Registry (npm/CDN): The build artifacts are published to a package registry like npm for distribution and potentially to a CDN for optimized delivery.

- security control: Code Signing: Sign build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- security control: Artifact Repository Security: Secure the package registry or artifact repository where build artifacts are stored and distributed.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the pnchart library.
- Ensuring the library is free from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by applications using it.
- Protecting the reputation and trust associated with the pnchart library.
- Ensuring the continuous development and improvement of the library.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the pnchart library: Sensitive as it represents the intellectual property and contains the logic of the library. Exposure could lead to unauthorized modifications or cloning.
- Build artifacts (Javascript files): Sensitive as compromised artifacts could be distributed to users, leading to potential security issues in applications using the library.
- Development and build infrastructure: Sensitive as compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes or malicious artifact injection.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scope of usage for this library? Is it for general public use, or specific internal projects?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements that the library needs to adhere to (e.g., accessibility standards, data privacy regulations)?
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in the library?
- Is there a dedicated team or individual responsible for the security of the pnchart library project?
- What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for the library?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and reliable open-source charting library for web developers. Community adoption and contribution are important for the project's success.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important, but the primary responsibility for application-level security lies with the developers integrating the library. Basic security controls are in place, but further enhancements are recommended.
- DESIGN: The library is primarily a client-side Javascript component, designed to be deployed via CDN or package registries and used within web browsers. The build process is assumed to be based on standard Javascript development tools and can be enhanced with security checks.
