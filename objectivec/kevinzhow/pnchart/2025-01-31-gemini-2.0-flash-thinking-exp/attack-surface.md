# Attack Surface Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript code, executed in a user's browser, due to insufficient data sanitization when rendering charts.
*   **How pnchart Contributes to Attack Surface:** `pnchart` directly renders charts based on data provided to it. If the application passes unsanitized data to `pnchart` for chart elements like labels, tooltips, or data points, `pnchart` may render malicious JavaScript code embedded within this data as part of the chart. This execution happens within the user's browser context.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into user-controlled data that is used as chart labels in `pnchart`. For instance, if usernames are displayed as labels and an attacker registers a username like `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, `pnchart` will render this as a label, causing the `alert('XSS')` to execute in the browser when the chart is displayed.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, account compromise, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, and potential malware installation on the user's system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strictly Sanitize Data Before pnchart:**  Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding on the application side *before* passing any data to `pnchart`. Treat all data intended for display in charts as potentially untrusted. Use context-aware output encoding appropriate for HTML rendering to neutralize any potentially malicious scripts.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to limit the execution of inline scripts and restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. This acts as a crucial defense-in-depth measure to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if they bypass input sanitization.
        *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing and code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where data flows into `pnchart` to ensure sanitization is effective and no bypasses exist.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Security Updates and Maintenance (Leading to Vulnerability Accumulation)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_security_updates_and_maintenance__leading_to_vulnerability_accumulation_.md)

*   **Description:** The risk of accumulating unpatched security vulnerabilities due to the `pnchart` library being unmaintained.
*   **How pnchart Contributes to Attack Surface:**  `pnchart`'s GitHub repository shows minimal recent activity, indicating it is likely no longer actively maintained. This means that any newly discovered security vulnerabilities within `pnchart` are unlikely to be fixed by the library developers.  Applications using `pnchart` will remain vulnerable to these issues indefinitely unless developers take proactive steps.
*   **Example:** If a new zero-day XSS vulnerability or a critical remote code execution bug is discovered within the core code of `pnchart` itself (independent of data injection), there will likely be no official patch released.  All applications using `pnchart` would then be exposed to this vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Increased likelihood of exploitation of known and unknown vulnerabilities within `pnchart`. This can lead to various security breaches, including those described in the XSS attack surface, and potentially more severe compromises depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (due to the increasing risk over time and the lack of remediation from the library maintainers)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Replace pnchart Immediately:** The most critical and effective mitigation is to **replace `pnchart` with a actively maintained and secure charting library.** Prioritize this action due to the high and increasing risk. Choose a library with a strong security track record, active development, and a responsive security team.
        *   **Manual Security Audit and Patching (Temporary Measure):** If immediate replacement is not feasible, conduct a comprehensive security audit and code review of `pnchart`. Attempt to identify and manually patch any potential vulnerabilities. This is a complex and resource-intensive task and should only be considered a temporary measure until replacement.
        *   **Continuous Security Monitoring:** Implement robust security monitoring and incident response procedures to detect and quickly respond to any potential exploitation attempts targeting vulnerabilities within `pnchart`. This is crucial as no official patches are expected.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Limited Effectiveness):** Utilize vulnerability scanners to scan your application and dependencies, including `pnchart`. However, be aware that scanners may not detect all vulnerabilities, especially in unmaintained libraries or zero-day issues.
