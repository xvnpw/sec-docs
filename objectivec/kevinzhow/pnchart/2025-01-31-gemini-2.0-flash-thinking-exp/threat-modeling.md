# Threat Model Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Image Libraries (e.g., GD)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_image_libraries__e_g___gd_.md)

**Description:** `pnchart` relies on external image processing libraries like GD. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities (such as buffer overflows or integer overflows), attackers can exploit them by providing specific input data to `pnchart` that triggers vulnerable code paths within these libraries during chart generation. This exploitation is facilitated by `pnchart`'s use of these libraries.
*   **Impact:** Server crashes, arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Underlying image processing libraries (e.g., GD) as utilized by `pnchart`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Library Updates:** Ensure the server environment and PHP installation use the latest *stable* and *patched* versions of GD and any other image libraries `pnchart` depends on. Regularly update these libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Dependencies:** Investigate which image libraries `pnchart` uses and actively monitor security advisories for those specific versions.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** Migrate to a more actively maintained and secure charting library that has a better security track record and actively updates its dependencies.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within `pnchart` Code Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within__pnchart__code_itself.md)

**Description:** The `pnchart` library's own codebase may contain security vulnerabilities due to coding errors, insecure practices, or logic flaws. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted requests or data to the application that utilizes `pnchart`, triggering the vulnerable code within the library. Given the library's age and potential lack of active maintenance, the likelihood of unpatched vulnerabilities is elevated.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, potential server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the nature and severity of the vulnerability. Arbitrary code execution is a potential high-impact outcome.
*   **Affected Component:** `pnchart` codebase (various modules and functions within the library).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review & Security Audit:** Conduct a thorough security-focused code review and ideally a professional security audit of the `pnchart` library itself to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize static analysis security scanning tools on the `pnchart` codebase to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor for Known Vulnerabilities:** Regularly check for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to `pnchart` or similar PHP charting libraries.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:**  Strongly consider replacing `pnchart` with a more actively maintained and secure charting library. This is the most effective long-term mitigation.

## Threat: [Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies of `pnchart`](./threats/outdated_or_vulnerable_dependencies_of__pnchart_.md)

**Description:** `pnchart` might rely on other PHP libraries or external components to function. If these dependencies are outdated or contain known security vulnerabilities, the application using `pnchart inherits these vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these dependency vulnerabilities through the application's interaction with `pnchart`.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, potential server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability present in the outdated dependency.
*   **Affected Component:** Dependencies of `pnchart` (external libraries that `pnchart` relies upon).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Analysis:** Identify all external dependencies of `pnchart`.
    *   **Dependency Updates (with caution):** If feasible and without breaking `pnchart`'s functionality, attempt to update its dependencies to the latest secure versions. However, be aware that updating dependencies in an unmaintained library can introduce compatibility issues. Thorough testing is crucial if attempting updates.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Dependencies:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `pnchart`'s dependencies.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:**  As with other high-risk threats, migrating away from `pnchart` to a more modern and actively maintained charting library that manages its dependencies securely is the most robust mitigation strategy.
