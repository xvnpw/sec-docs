## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization with Context-Aware Output Encoding for pnchart Data](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_with_context-aware_output_encoding_for_pnchart_data.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Sanitization for pnchart Data
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify pnchart data inputs:** Pinpoint all code sections where data is passed to `pnchart` functions for rendering charts. This includes data used for labels, titles, data points, tooltips, and any other configurable text or data elements within `pnchart`.
    2.  **HTML Entity Encoding for Text:**  Before passing any user-controlled or untrusted data to `pnchart` for rendering text elements (labels, titles, tooltips, etc.), apply HTML entity encoding. This converts characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` into their HTML entity equivalents, preventing them from being interpreted as HTML tags or JavaScript code. Use appropriate encoding functions in your backend or frontend code *before* data reaches `pnchart`.
    3.  **Validate Data Types for pnchart:** Ensure that the data types provided to `pnchart` functions match the expected types as per `pnchart`'s documentation or code. For example, verify that data points are numerical if `pnchart` expects numbers for a specific chart type.
    4.  **Limit Allowed Characters in pnchart Labels/Titles:** If possible and applicable to your use case, restrict the allowed characters in chart labels and titles to a safe subset (e.g., alphanumeric characters, spaces, and a limited set of punctuation). This reduces the attack surface for XSS.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity (specifically within the context of data rendered by `pnchart`)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from unsanitized data being processed and rendered by `pnchart`. Prevents malicious scripts injected through chart data from executing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Server-side HTML entity encoding is applied to chart titles before passing them to the frontend, which then uses `pnchart`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Client-side encoding is not consistently applied to all data points and dynamically generated tooltips before being used by `pnchart`.
    *   Data type validation specifically for `pnchart`'s expected input formats is not fully implemented.
    *   Character restrictions for labels and titles used in `pnchart` are not enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Size Limits Specific to pnchart Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/data_size_limits_specific_to_pnchart_rendering.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Size Limits for pnchart Rendering
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze pnchart performance:**  Test `pnchart`'s performance with varying amounts of data points and complex chart configurations in target browsers. Identify performance bottlenecks and thresholds where rendering becomes slow or resource-intensive.
    2.  **Implement data point limits for pnchart:** Based on performance testing, establish reasonable limits on the number of data points that can be rendered in a single chart using `pnchart`. Enforce these limits on the server-side before sending data to the client for `pnchart` to process.
    3.  **Implement complexity limits for chart configurations (if applicable):** If `pnchart` allows for complex chart configurations that could impact performance (e.g., excessive number of series, annotations, or custom styling), consider limiting these configurations as well.
    4.  **Provide user feedback on data limits:** If data limits are exceeded, provide clear error messages to the user, explaining the limitations of `pnchart` in handling large datasets and suggesting ways to reduce data complexity.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity (specifically related to `pnchart`'s rendering performance)
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of client-side DoS attacks caused by overwhelming `pnchart` with excessively large datasets or complex configurations that strain browser resources during rendering.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Server-side limits on the number of data points are in place, but these are general application limits, not specifically tuned to `pnchart`'s rendering capabilities.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Performance testing specifically to determine `pnchart`'s rendering limits has not been conducted.
    *   Data point limits are not specifically tailored to `pnchart`'s optimal performance.
    *   Complexity limits for chart configurations within `pnchart` are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation Tailored to pnchart Data Requirements](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_tailored_to_pnchart_data_requirements.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation for pnchart Data Requirements
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Study pnchart's data expectations:**  Thoroughly review `pnchart`'s documentation and, if necessary, its source code to understand the specific data types, formats, and ranges expected for different chart types and data parameters.
    2.  **Implement validation matching pnchart's needs:** Implement server-side validation to ensure that all data intended for `pnchart` conforms precisely to these expected types, formats, and ranges. This includes validating data points, labels, and any other configurable data elements.
    3.  **Handle invalid data gracefully:** If data does not meet `pnchart`'s requirements, reject it on the server-side and provide informative error messages to the client, indicating the specific data validation failures related to `pnchart`'s expectations.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) - Low to Medium Severity (by preventing unexpected data from causing errors or performance issues in `pnchart`)
    *   Potential XSS (indirectly, by ensuring data integrity and preventing unexpected data formats that might bypass sanitization) - Low Severity
*   **Impact:** Minimally to Moderately reduces the risk of client-side DoS and indirectly reduces XSS risk by ensuring data provided to `pnchart` is in the expected format, preventing unexpected behavior or errors within the library.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic data type validation exists, but it is not specifically tailored to the precise data requirements of `pnchart` for all chart types and data parameters.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed validation rules based on `pnchart`'s specific data expectations are not fully defined and implemented.
    *   Validation covers only basic data types and not the specific formats or ranges that `pnchart` might require for optimal and secure operation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Audit and Code Review of pnchart Library](./mitigation_strategies/security_audit_and_code_review_of_pnchart_library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Security Audit of pnchart Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Conduct manual code review:** Perform a detailed manual code review of the `pnchart` library's source code. Focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities, particularly in areas related to data handling, input processing, rendering logic, and any configuration options. Look for common web security vulnerabilities like XSS, and also for potential DoS vulnerabilities or logic flaws specific to charting libraries.
    2.  **Consider third-party security audit:** For critical applications, consider engaging a third-party security firm with expertise in JavaScript security to conduct a professional security audit of the `pnchart` library.
    3.  **Focus on data flow and rendering:** Pay close attention to how `pnchart` processes and renders data, especially user-provided data. Analyze how it handles different data types, special characters, and potentially malicious inputs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity (by identifying potential vulnerabilities within `pnchart`'s code)
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity (by identifying potential vulnerabilities within `pnchart`'s code)
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities - Low Severity (if the audit reveals any previously unknown dependencies and their vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:** Moderately to Significantly reduces the overall risk by proactively identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities *within the `pnchart` library itself*. This is crucial as `pnchart` might be less actively maintained, increasing the risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** A very basic initial code review was performed by the development team, but it was not a comprehensive security-focused audit.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive manual code review by security experts is missing.
    *   A third-party security audit of `pnchart` has not been conducted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Migration to a More Secure and Maintained Charting Library as a Long-Term Strategy](./mitigation_strategies/migration_to_a_more_secure_and_maintained_charting_library_as_a_long-term_strategy.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Migrate to a More Secure Charting Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Evaluate alternative libraries:** Research and evaluate modern, actively maintained JavaScript charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, ApexCharts, ECharts). Prioritize libraries with a strong security track record, active development, and a history of timely security updates.
    2.  **Security-focused comparison:**  Specifically compare the security features, vulnerability disclosure processes, and update frequency of alternative libraries against `pnchart`.
    3.  **Plan and execute migration:** If a suitable and more secure alternative is identified, develop a plan to migrate away from `pnchart`. This involves refactoring code to use the new library's API, testing the new charting implementation thoroughly, and deploying the changes.
    4.  **Phased migration (if needed):** For complex applications, consider a phased migration, replacing `pnchart` gradually in different parts of the application to minimize disruption.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities - High Severity (by moving away from a potentially unmaintained library)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity (by adopting a library with potentially better security practices and faster vulnerability patching)
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity (by adopting a library that might be more performant and robust)
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces long-term security risks by eliminating reliance on `pnchart`, which appears to be less actively maintained and may have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Moving to a more secure and actively updated library provides a more sustainable and secure charting solution.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No evaluation or migration planning is currently underway. `pnchart` remains the primary charting library.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal evaluation of alternative charting libraries has been initiated from a security perspective.
    *   No migration plan exists to replace `pnchart` with a more secure alternative.
