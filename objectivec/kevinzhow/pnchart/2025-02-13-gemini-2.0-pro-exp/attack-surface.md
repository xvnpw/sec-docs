# Attack Surface Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious JavaScript into the web page through `pnchart`'s rendering process.
*   **pnchart Contribution:** `pnchart` renders charts in the browser's DOM.  If it doesn't properly sanitize user-provided data (labels, tooltips, data values) before inserting it into the DOM, it creates an XSS vulnerability. This is the *direct* contribution.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker provides a chart label containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If `pnchart` directly inserts this into the DOM without escaping, the script will execute.
    *   A tooltip configured within `pnchart` to display user-provided data includes malicious JavaScript.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Theft of user cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *   Keylogging and data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping (Within pnchart):**  The *primary* mitigation is for `pnchart` itself to perform robust output encoding (HTML entity encoding) before inserting *any* data into the DOM.  This is the library's responsibility.  Developers integrating `pnchart` should verify this behavior through code review and testing.
    *   **Input Validation (Before pnchart):** While `pnchart` *should* handle escaping, developers should *also* validate and sanitize data *before* passing it to `pnchart` as a defense-in-depth measure.  Use a whitelist approach.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP. While this doesn't prevent the vulnerability *within* `pnchart`, it significantly limits the impact. Disallow `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`.
    *   **Regular Code Review (of pnchart):**  Examine the `pnchart` source code for how it handles data insertion into the DOM. Look for any areas where user-provided data is used without proper escaping.
    * **Report Vulnerabilities:** If a vulnerability is found in `pnchart`, report it responsibly to the maintainers.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities in pnchart](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_vulnerabilities_in_pnchart.md)

*   **Description:** Known vulnerabilities in `pnchart` itself are not addressed, leaving the application exposed.
*   **pnchart Contribution:** This is a direct vulnerability *of* `pnchart`. The library itself contains the flawed code.
*   **Example:**
    *   A published CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) exists for a specific version of `pnchart` that allows for XSS or another critical vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from data leakage to complete system compromise (if the vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (or Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or Snyk to *specifically* scan `pnchart` for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Prompt Updates:** Update `pnchart` to its latest secure version as soon as patches are available. This is the *most direct* mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to `pnchart` to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fork and Patch (if necessary):** If the `pnchart` maintainers are unresponsive, consider forking the project and applying the necessary security patches yourself (and contributing them back to the community).
