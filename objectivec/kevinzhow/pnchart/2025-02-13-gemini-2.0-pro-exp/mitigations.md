# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Configuration Data Handling (pnchart-specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_configuration_data_handling__pnchart-specific_.md)

1.  **Identify `pnchart` Data Needs:** Analyze `pnchart`'s documentation and API to determine the *exact* data structure and properties it expects for chart configuration. Understand which properties are mandatory and which are optional.
2.  **Data Extraction and Filtering:** Create a dedicated function that takes your raw data (e.g., from a database or API) and extracts *only* the fields required by `pnchart`.  Do *not* pass entire data objects to `pnchart`.
3.  **`pnchart`-Specific Data Type Enforcement:** Within the extraction function, explicitly cast data to the types expected by `pnchart`.  Refer to `pnchart`'s documentation for the expected types (e.g., numbers, strings, dates, arrays).  If `pnchart` expects a specific date format, ensure your data conforms to that format *before* passing it.
4.  **`pnchart` Configuration Generation:** Use the extracted, filtered, and type-enforced data to build the configuration object that you will pass to `pnchart`. Avoid any dynamic string concatenation or interpolation using potentially unsafe data within this configuration object.
5.  **Safe Configuration Options:** If user input influences the chart (e.g., selecting a chart type or color scheme), define a set of *pre-approved* configuration options.  Map user selections to these safe options, rather than allowing users to directly construct `pnchart` configuration values.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure via Chart Configuration (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive data from leaking into the `pnchart` configuration, which could be exposed on the client-side.
    *   **Indirectly mitigates some XSS (Severity: Medium):** By limiting and type-checking data, it reduces the potential for injecting malicious code, although dedicated XSS handling is still essential.
    *   **DoS via Malformed Input (Severity: Medium):** By limiting string lengths and enforcing data types, it reduces the risk of specially crafted input causing excessive resource consumption within `pnchart`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk (High to Low).
    *   **XSS:** Provides a small reduction in risk; primary XSS mitigation is separate.
    *   **DoS:** Provides a small reduction in risk; primary DoS mitigation is separate.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Data extraction function exists in `src/utils/chartData.js`.
    *   Data type enforcement is partially implemented (date/number types enforced, string length limits missing).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   String length limits are not consistently enforced in `chartData.js`. Add truncation for all string fields *before* passing to `pnchart`.
    *   Refactor chart configuration in `src/components/ChartComponent.jsx` to use pre-defined, safe configuration options, preventing direct user input from constructing `pnchart` configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Aggressive XSS Protection in `pnchart` Elements](./mitigation_strategies/aggressive_xss_protection_in__pnchart__elements.md)

1.  **Identify `pnchart` Text Rendering Points:** Examine `pnchart`'s documentation and source code (if necessary) to identify *all* places where it renders text: labels, tooltips, legends, axis titles, data labels, etc.
2.  **Prioritize `pnchart`'s Built-in Escaping:** *Thoroughly* check `pnchart`'s documentation for any built-in escaping, sanitization, or security options related to text rendering. If such options exist, *use them* and configure them correctly. This is the preferred approach.
3.  **Output Encoding (if `pnchart` lacks built-in protection):** If `pnchart` *does not* provide built-in protection, or if you are unsure about its effectiveness, you *must* apply output encoding *before* passing any text data to `pnchart`.
    *   **Select an Encoding Library:** Choose a robust HTML encoding library (e.g., DOMPurify for JavaScript).
    *   **Encode *All* Text:** Wrap *every* string value that will be rendered as text by `pnchart` with the encoding function.  This includes labels, tooltip content, legend entries, etc.  Example (using DOMPurify):
        ```javascript
        import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

        const chartConfig = {
          labels: data.map(item => DOMPurify.sanitize(item.label)), // Encode for pnchart
          datasets: [{
            label: DOMPurify.sanitize(datasetLabel), // Encode for pnchart
            data: data.map(item => item.value),
            tooltip: {
              callbacks: {
                label: (context) => DOMPurify.sanitize(context.label) // Encode for pnchart
              }
            }
          }]
        };
        ```
    *   **Context-Specific Encoding:** Ensure you are using the correct type of encoding for how `pnchart` renders the text (HTML, SVG, etc.).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chart Labels/Tooltips (Severity: High):** This directly addresses the threat of attackers injecting malicious JavaScript through `pnchart`'s text rendering.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Reduces the risk of XSS from high to very low, assuming correct implementation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No output encoding is currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Output encoding is completely missing. Add DOMPurify (or equivalent) and apply it to *all* text elements *before* they are passed to `pnchart` in `src/components/ChartComponent.jsx`.  Thoroughly review the component to ensure *no* text bypasses this encoding.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Size Limits for `pnchart`](./mitigation_strategies/input_size_limits_for__pnchart_.md)

1.  **`pnchart` Data Point Limit:** Determine a reasonable maximum number of data points that `pnchart` can handle efficiently without performance degradation or potential crashes. Set this as a hard limit.
2.  **`pnchart` String Length Limits:** Define maximum string lengths for all text inputs that are passed to `pnchart` (labels, tooltips, etc.). This should be consistent across your application and enforced *before* data reaches `pnchart`.
3.  **`pnchart` Configuration Depth Limit:** If `pnchart` allows nested configuration objects, set a reasonable limit on the nesting depth to prevent excessively complex configurations that could lead to performance issues.
4. **Enforcement Before `pnchart`:** Implement these limits in the data preparation and filtering logic *before* the data is passed to `pnchart`. This prevents `pnchart` from even receiving potentially harmful input.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Input (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from sending excessively large or complex data to `pnchart`, which could cause it to consume excessive resources or crash.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Reduces the risk of DoS specifically related to `pnchart`'s handling of input data (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No specific input size limits are enforced for data passed to `pnchart`. Add these limits in `src/utils/chartData.js` and ensure they are enforced *before* calling `pnchart` in `src/components/ChartComponent.jsx`.
