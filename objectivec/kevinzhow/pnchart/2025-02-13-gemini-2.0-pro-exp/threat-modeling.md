# Threat Model Analysis for kevinzhow/pnchart

## Threat: [Compromised `pnchart` Library (Direct)](./threats/compromised__pnchart__library__direct_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the `pnchart` repository (e.g., GitHub) or manages to publish a malicious version to a package manager (if one is used). The attacker could inject malicious code directly into the library, which would then be executed in the user's browser when the chart is rendered. This is a supply chain attack targeting `pnchart` directly.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially severe; the attacker could inject arbitrary code, leading to complete compromise of the application's client-side functionality.  This could include data theft, session hijacking, or further exploitation of the user's system.
    *   **Affected `pnchart` Component:** Potentially any part of the `pnchart` library.  The attacker could modify any function or add new malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Integrity Verification (SRI):** If loading `pnchart` from a CDN, *always* use Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags.  This ensures the browser only executes the library if it matches a known, trusted hash.  Generate the SRI hash from a known-good copy of the library.  Example: `<script src="https://cdn.example.com/pnchart.js" integrity="sha256-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
        *   **Local Hosting:** Host a known-good copy of `pnchart` on your own server, rather than relying on a CDN or the GitHub repository directly.  This gives you complete control over the code and eliminates the risk of a compromised CDN or repository.
        *   **Code Review (If Self-Hosting):** If hosting locally, periodically review the `pnchart` source code for any suspicious changes.  Compare it against a known-good version.  This is especially important if you update your local copy.
        * **Pin to the specific version:** Use specific version of the library, not the latest one.

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities Due to Abandoned Project (Potentially High, depending on undiscovered vulnerabilities)](./threats/unpatched_vulnerabilities_due_to_abandoned_project__potentially_high__depending_on_undiscovered_vuln_37eff7a0.md)

*   **Description:** The `pnchart` project is no longer actively maintained.  If a critical vulnerability is discovered in `pnchart` *itself*, there will be no official patch. An attacker could exploit this unpatched vulnerability to compromise applications using the library.  This is distinct from application-level misuses; it's about flaws *within* `pnchart`.
    *   **Impact:** Variable, but *potentially* high or critical, depending on the nature of the undiscovered vulnerability.  A zero-day vulnerability in `pnchart` could allow for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected `pnchart` Component:** Potentially any part of the `pnchart` library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Variable (Potentially High, depending on undiscovered vulnerabilities).  We must assume the worst-case scenario if the project is truly abandoned.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Monitor Project Activity:** *Actively* monitor the GitHub repository for any signs of life (commits, issue responses, pull requests).  A complete lack of activity over an extended period (e.g., 6+ months) is a strong warning sign.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** *Proactively* evaluate alternative charting libraries that are actively maintained and have a good security track record.  Don't wait for a vulnerability to be discovered; migrate if the project appears abandoned.
        *   **Forking and Self-Maintenance (Last Resort):** If no suitable alternatives exist and `pnchart` is essential, consider forking the project and taking on the responsibility of maintaining it yourself (or finding a community fork).  This is a significant undertaking and requires security expertise.  You would need to perform your own security audits and patch any vulnerabilities discovered.
        * **Security Audit:** Perform security audit of the library.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `pnchart`'s Dependencies (Indirect)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__pnchart_'s_dependencies__indirect_.md)

* **Description:** If `pnchart` has any dependencies (even indirect ones), vulnerabilities in those dependencies could be exploited. An attacker would target the dependency, not `pnchart` directly, but the impact would be felt through the use of `pnchart`.
  * **Impact:** Variable, depending on the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from minor issues to complete application compromise.
  * **Affected `pnchart` Component:** Potentially any part of `pnchart` that relies on the vulnerable dependency.
  * **Risk Severity:** High.
  * **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Analysis:** Use SCA tools to identify all dependencies (direct and transitive) and their known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `pnchart` and all dependencies updated.
    *   **Forking and Auditing (Extreme):** For high-security environments, consider forking and auditing the code.
