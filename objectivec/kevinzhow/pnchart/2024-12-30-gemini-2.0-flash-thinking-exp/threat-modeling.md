*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chart Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the data used to generate the chart, such as labels, data point values, or tooltips. When PNChart renders the chart, it executes this script within the user's browser. The attacker might achieve this by compromising the data source or through vulnerable input fields that feed data to the chart. This directly involves PNChart's handling of input data.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, data theft, defacement of the application, or execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:** PNChart's data processing and rendering logic, specifically how it handles and displays user-provided data for labels, values, and tooltips.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all data received from external sources or user input before passing it to PNChart. Use appropriate encoding techniques (e.g., HTML escaping) to neutralize potentially malicious scripts.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **Framework-Level Protection:** Utilize web development frameworks that offer built-in protection against XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides excessively large or specially crafted datasets *directly to PNChart* that consume significant client-side resources (CPU, memory), leading to browser slowdown, freezing, or crashing. This threat directly involves how PNChart processes and attempts to render the provided data.
    *   **Impact:** Temporary unavailability of the application for the user, negative user experience, potential data loss if the browser crashes unexpectedly.
    *   **Affected Component:** PNChart's rendering engine and data processing logic, particularly how it handles large or complex datasets.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Validation and Limits:** Implement server-side validation to restrict the size and complexity of data allowed for chart generation *before* it reaches PNChart. Set reasonable limits on the number of data points and the length of labels.
        *   **Client-Side Rate Limiting:** Implement client-side checks to prevent users from repeatedly sending excessively large datasets to the chart rendering function.
        *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within the application to gracefully handle cases where PNChart encounters unexpected or overly large data.
