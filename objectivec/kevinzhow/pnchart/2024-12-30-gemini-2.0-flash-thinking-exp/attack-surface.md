Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving PNChart and with high or critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Chart Labels/Tooltips
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into chart labels, tooltips, or other text elements rendered by PNChart. When a user views the chart, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **How PNChart Contributes to the Attack Surface:** PNChart renders the data provided to it, including text elements. If the application doesn't sanitize this data before passing it to PNChart, the library will faithfully render any malicious script embedded within.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates data (e.g., through a vulnerable API endpoint) so that a chart label becomes `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When the chart is displayed, the alert box pops up.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding/escaping on all data before passing it to PNChart. Specifically, HTML-encode any user-provided text that will be rendered by PNChart.
        *   **Developer:** Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in PNChart (Outdated Version)
    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of PNChart that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if they are aware of them.
    *   **How PNChart Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  The outdated library itself contains the exploitable code.
    *   **Example:** A publicly disclosed XSS vulnerability exists in the specific version of PNChart being used. An attacker crafts a malicious URL or input that triggers this vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from XSS to more severe issues like remote code execution (less likely in a client-side library but possible in dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Regularly update PNChart to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developer:** Subscribe to security advisories and monitor the PNChart repository for updates and vulnerability disclosures.
