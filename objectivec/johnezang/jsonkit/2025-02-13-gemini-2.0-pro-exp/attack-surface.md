# Attack Surface Analysis for johnezang/jsonkit

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*Description:* Attackers can craft malicious JSON input designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during parsing, leading to application unavailability.
*How jsonkit Contributes:* `jsonkit`'s parsing algorithms and handling of large or deeply nested structures may be inefficient or have vulnerabilities that can be exploited *directly*. This is the core vulnerability.
*Example:* An attacker sends a JSON payload with thousands of nested objects, an extremely long string, or a huge array.
*Impact:* Application becomes unresponsive; potential system crash.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Input Validation (Pre-Parsing):** Implement strict limits *before* passing data to `jsonkit`:
        *   Maximum JSON payload size.
        *   Maximum nesting depth.
        *   Maximum array length.
        *   Maximum string length.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure OS or container resource limits (CPU, memory).
    *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for `jsonkit` parsing operations.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Fuzz test `jsonkit` *directly* with malformed/edge-case JSON.
    * **Monitoring:** Monitor application for high resource usage.

## Attack Surface: [Algorithmic Complexity Attacks](./attack_surfaces/algorithmic_complexity_attacks.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit weaknesses in the parser's algorithms to trigger worst-case performance, leading to DoS.
*How jsonkit Contributes:* `jsonkit`'s *internal* parsing logic might have time complexity vulnerabilities (e.g., quadratic or exponential time for specific, crafted inputs). This is a *direct* vulnerability of the library's implementation.
*Example:* A crafted JSON payload triggers a specific, inefficient code path *within jsonkit*, causing excessive processing time.
*Impact:* Application slowdown or unavailability (DoS).
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Code Review (If Possible):** Analyze `jsonkit`'s source code for complexity vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (Targeted):** Focus fuzz testing on inputs designed to trigger different code paths *within the jsonkit parser*.
    *   **Library Selection:** If `jsonkit` is demonstrably vulnerable, *replace it* with a more robust JSON parsing library. This is the most effective mitigation if a vulnerability is confirmed.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Help):** General input validation is less effective here; the attack is about *how* the input is structured, not just its size.
