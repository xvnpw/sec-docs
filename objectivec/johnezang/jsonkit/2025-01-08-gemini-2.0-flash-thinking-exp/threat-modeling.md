# Threat Model Analysis for johnezang/jsonkit

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested JSON](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_deeply_nested_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload with excessive levels of nesting. The `jsonkit` parser attempts to process this deeply nested structure, consuming excessive stack space or memory, potentially leading to a crash or unresponsiveness. This is a direct consequence of how `jsonkit` handles deeply nested structures.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or extremely slow, impacting legitimate users. Server resources (CPU, memory) may be exhausted.

**Affected Component:** `JSONDecoder` (specifically the parsing logic handling nested objects and arrays).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum depth of nested JSON structures allowed. Reject requests exceeding this limit *before* they are processed by `jsonkit`.
* Configure timeouts for JSON parsing operations within `jsonkit` if such options are available, or implement timeouts around the parsing call.
* Consider using iterative parsing techniques if `jsonkit` offers them, which can be more memory-efficient for deeply nested structures.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Extremely Large JSON Payloads](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_extremely_large_json_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload (e.g., with very long strings or numerous elements). `jsonkit` attempts to allocate memory to store and process this large payload, potentially exhausting available memory and causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. This is a direct consequence of `jsonkit`'s memory allocation during parsing.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or extremely slow. Server memory resources are exhausted, potentially affecting other applications on the same server.

**Affected Component:** `JSONDecoder` (specifically memory allocation during parsing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming JSON payloads *before* they are processed by `jsonkit`. Reject requests exceeding this limit.
* Consider streaming or chunking large JSON payloads if the application logic allows it, to avoid passing the entire large payload to `jsonkit` at once.

## Threat: [Potential Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Code (If Applicable)](./threats/potential_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_native_code__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** While `jsonkit` is primarily Objective-C, if it relies on any underlying native C/C++ code for performance or specific features, there's a possibility of vulnerabilities like buffer overflows in that native code. An attacker could craft specific JSON payloads to trigger these vulnerabilities *within the parsing logic of the underlying native code*.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution or denial of service if a vulnerability exists in the underlying native code.

**Affected Component:** Any underlying native code components used by `jsonkit`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `jsonkit` updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches in the underlying code.
* If the application has stringent security requirements, consider static and dynamic analysis of the `jsonkit` library, including any native components. This is a more in-depth investigation into `jsonkit` itself.
