# Attack Surface Analysis for johnezang/jsonkit

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through large JSON payloads](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_large_json_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the application.
    *   **How JsonKit Contributes:** JsonKit might load the entire JSON structure into memory before parsing, potentially consuming excessive memory resources. If parsing is also computationally intensive, it can lead to high CPU usage.
    *   **Example:** Sending a JSON payload that is several megabytes or even gigabytes in size containing a large array or deeply nested objects.
    *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or complete crash due to memory exhaustion or CPU overload.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement size limits on incoming JSON payloads *before* passing them to JsonKit for parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Stack Overflow through deeply nested JSON structures](./attack_surfaces/stack_overflow_through_deeply_nested_json_structures.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with an extremely deep level of nesting of objects or arrays.
    *   **How JsonKit Contributes:** If JsonKit's parsing logic uses recursion without proper depth limits, processing deeply nested structures can lead to excessive stack usage, resulting in a stack overflow.
    *   **Example:** A JSON payload with hundreds or thousands of nested objects like `{"a": {"b": {"c": ...}}}`.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to stack overflow.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Investigate if JsonKit has any configuration options to limit the maximum depth of JSON structures it will parse.
        *   Implement checks *before* parsing to detect and reject excessively nested JSON structures.
