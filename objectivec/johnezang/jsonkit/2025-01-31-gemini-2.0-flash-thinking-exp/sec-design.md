# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a GITHUB REPOSITORY for JSONKit, a lightweight JSON parser and serializer for Objective-C.

* Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use JSON parsing and serialization library for Objective-C developers.
 - Offer a robust and reliable solution for handling JSON data in Objective-C applications.
 - Maintain a lightweight footprint to minimize resource consumption in applications.
 - Ensure compatibility with a wide range of Objective-C environments and projects.

* Most Important Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the JSON parsing logic could lead to application security breaches if exploited by malicious JSON input.
 - Performance bottlenecks in parsing or serialization could negatively impact the performance of applications using JSONKit.
 - Incompatibility issues with certain Objective-C environments or libraries could limit adoption and cause integration problems.
 - Bugs or errors in JSON parsing or serialization could lead to data corruption or application instability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Security Controls:
 - security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
 - security control: Open-source nature allows for community review and contributions, potentially identifying security issues. (Implemented: Open Source)

* Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
 - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the code base.
 - accepted risk: No explicitly defined Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) documented in the repository.

* Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the build process to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to ensure no known vulnerable dependencies are introduced.
 - security control: Conduct regular code reviews, focusing on security aspects of JSON parsing and serialization logic.
 - security control: Consider implementing fuzz testing to identify robustness issues and potential vulnerabilities in JSON parsing.
 - security control: Define and document a process for handling security vulnerabilities, including reporting, patching, and disclosure.

* Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable. JSONKit is a library and does not handle user authentication. Applications using JSONKit are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
 - Authorization: Not applicable. JSONKit is a library and does not handle user authorization. Applications using JSONKit are responsible for their own authorization mechanisms.
 - Input Validation:
  - security requirement: Robust input validation is critical to prevent vulnerabilities arising from maliciously crafted JSON inputs.
  - security requirement: The library must handle invalid or malformed JSON gracefully without crashing or exhibiting unexpected behavior.
  - security requirement: Input validation should protect against common injection attacks that might be possible through JSON parsing, although less likely in a pure parsing library.
 - Cryptography:
  - security requirement: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for a JSON parsing library itself.
  - security requirement: If JSONKit is used in applications that handle sensitive data, the applications themselves must implement appropriate encryption and decryption mechanisms outside of the JSON parsing library.
  - security requirement: Ensure that any dependencies used by JSONKit do not introduce cryptographic vulnerabilities.

## DEPLOYMENT

JSONKit is a library and is not deployed as a standalone service. It is integrated directly into Objective-C applications during their build process and deployed as part of those applications. Therefore, the deployment diagram focuses on the application that uses JSONKit.

Assuming a typical deployment scenario for an Objective-C application (e.g., a mobile iOS application):

```mermaid

        A["iOS Application\n(with JSONKit)"]
    end
    subgraph "App Store"
        B["App Store"]
    end

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical Business Processes:
 - Applications relying on JSONKit for data exchange and processing. If JSONKit fails or is compromised, these applications may malfunction or become vulnerable.
 - Development and maintenance of Objective-C applications that depend on JSONKit.

* Data Sensitivity:
 - The sensitivity of data processed by JSONKit depends entirely on the applications that use it. JSONKit itself is a data processing library and does not inherently handle sensitive data.
 - If applications use JSONKit to process sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, financial information, personal data), then the security of JSONKit becomes critical for protecting that sensitive data in transit and at rest within the application's context.
 - The sensitivity level can range from public data to highly confidential data, depending on the application's purpose.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

* Questions:
 - What are the primary use cases for JSONKit? Is it mainly for mobile applications, server-side applications, or a mix?
 - Are there specific performance benchmarks or requirements for JSONKit?
 - What is the intended support and maintenance model for JSONKit?
 - Are there any known integrations with other libraries or frameworks that are important to consider?
 - Is there a community or organization actively using and contributing to JSONKit?

* Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a general-purpose, high-performance JSON library for Objective-C. The project aims for broad applicability across different types of Objective-C applications.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important, but the project currently relies on open-source community review rather than dedicated security processes. Input validation is implicitly considered important for a parsing library.
 - DESIGN: JSONKit is designed as a standalone library with a clear separation of parsing and serialization functionalities. Deployment is intended to be through integration into Objective-C applications, not as a standalone service. The build process is assumed to be standard Objective-C library build practices, potentially leveraging CI for automation.
