# Threat Model Analysis for johnezang/jsonkit

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in JSON Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_json_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload with excessively long strings or deeply nested structures. `jsonkit`'s parsing process, if not properly handling input lengths, attempts to write beyond allocated memory buffers. The attacker might exploit this to overwrite adjacent memory regions.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflowed data to overwrite critical program instructions or data.
*   **Affected JSONKit Component:**  Parsing functions (e.g., functions handling string parsing, object/array construction). Specifically, memory allocation and buffer handling within the parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is achievable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Update `jsonkit` to the latest version.
    *   Implement input validation at the application level to limit JSON size and complexity *before* parsing.
    *   Use memory safety tools (ASan, MSan) during development and testing.
    *   Consider code review of `jsonkit`'s parsing logic if highly critical application.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Size Calculations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_size_calculations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides JSON that triggers large size calculations within `jsonkit` during parsing (e.g., very long strings, huge arrays). If `jsonkit` uses integer types that are too small or doesn't check for overflows, calculations for memory allocation or data handling can wrap around, leading to incorrect sizes. This can result in heap corruption or buffer overflows during subsequent operations.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected JSONKit Component:** Size calculation logic within parsing functions, memory allocation routines.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is achievable)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Code review of `jsonkit`'s size calculation logic (if feasible and critical).
    *   Limit the size and complexity of incoming JSON at the application level.
    *   If modifying `jsonkit`, use safe integer arithmetic functions.
    *   Use memory safety tools (ASan, MSan) during development and testing.
