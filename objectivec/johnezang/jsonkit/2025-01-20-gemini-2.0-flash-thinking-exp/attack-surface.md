# Attack Surface Analysis for johnezang/jsonkit

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Payloads](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_payloads.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Payloads
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the application.
    *   **How JSONKit Contributes to the Attack Surface:** JSONKit attempts to parse the entire large payload into memory. If the payload size exceeds available resources, it can lead to excessive memory consumption, CPU usage, and ultimately application slowdown or crashes. JSONKit itself might not have built-in limits on the size of the JSON it can process.
    *   **Example:** Sending a JSON payload containing a single very long string or a deeply nested structure with thousands of elements.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, potentially leading to service disruption for legitimate users. In severe cases, the server hosting the application might become unstable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Payload Size Limits: Configure the application to reject JSON payloads exceeding a reasonable size threshold *before* passing them to JSONKit.
        *   Resource Monitoring and Throttling: Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) and implement throttling mechanisms to limit the rate of incoming requests or the resources consumed by individual requests.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_deeply_nested_objectsarrays.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with an excessive level of nesting (e.g., objects within objects within objects).
    *   **How JSONKit Contributes to the Attack Surface:** JSONKit's recursive parsing logic might be vulnerable to stack overflow errors when processing deeply nested structures. Each level of nesting consumes stack space, and an excessively deep structure can exhaust the stack, leading to application crashes.
    *   **Example:** A JSON payload with hundreds or thousands of nested objects or arrays.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to stack overflow errors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Nesting Depth Limits:  Implement checks within the application logic *before* or during JSON parsing to reject payloads exceeding a reasonable nesting depth. This might require custom logic as JSONKit itself might not offer this directly.

## Attack Surface: [Use of Outdated Library Version](./attack_surfaces/use_of_outdated_library_version.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Use of Outdated Library Version
    *   **Description:** The application uses an old version of JSONKit that contains known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How JSONKit Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Older versions of JSONKit might have unpatched vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    *   **Example:** Using a version of JSONKit with a known vulnerability related to parsing specific types of malformed JSON.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to the specific security flaws present in the outdated version of the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regular Library Updates:  Keep JSONKit updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes. Implement a process for regularly checking for and applying updates to dependencies.
