## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Trigger Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
* **Send Malformed JSON Causing Infinite Loop/High CPU Usage:** JSONKit, like any parser, needs to handle invalid input. A carefully crafted malformed JSON payload (e.g., deeply nested structures without proper closing tags, recursive definitions) could potentially cause the parsing logic to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
* **Send Extremely Large JSON Payload:** Parsing very large JSON payloads can consume significant memory. An attacker could send an extremely large JSON object or array to exhaust the application's memory, leading to a crash or temporary unavailability.

**Exploit Type Confusion [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
* **Cause the application to misinterpret data leading to logic errors or vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** JSONKit parses JSON into native data types. An attacker could send JSON with unexpected data types (e.g., sending a string where a number is expected, or vice-versa). If the application doesn't perform robust type checking after parsing, this could lead to type confusion errors, potentially causing crashes or allowing the attacker to bypass security checks.

**Exploit Buffer Overflow (if applicable in underlying C/Objective-C code) [CRITICAL NODE]:** JSONKit is written in Objective-C, which is built upon C. If there are vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing logic related to buffer handling (e.g., not properly checking the size of incoming data), a specially crafted JSON payload exceeding buffer limits could potentially overwrite adjacent memory. This is a more serious vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Use of JSONKit [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_use_of_jsonkit__high-risk_path_.md)

**Manipulate Data Through Unexpected JSON Structures:**
* **Bypass validation checks or alter application logic [CRITICAL NODE]:** Even with valid JSON, an attacker can manipulate the structure of the JSON payload (e.g., missing required fields, adding unexpected fields). If the application relies on a specific JSON structure without proper validation, the attacker could bypass validation checks or alter the application's logic by sending unexpected structures.

**Inject Malicious Data Through JSON Payloads [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
* **If not properly sanitized by the application, could lead to secondary vulnerabilities:** While the focus is on JSONKit, it's important to consider how the application uses the parsed data. If the application doesn't properly sanitize data extracted from the JSON, an attacker could inject malicious data (e.g., special characters, escape sequences) that could lead to secondary vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or command injection *if* the application then uses this unsanitized data in a vulnerable way. The focus here is on how JSONKit facilitates this injection, not the general web app vulnerability itself.

**Exploit Assumptions About Data Types [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
* **Cause logic errors or unexpected behavior in the application's processing [CRITICAL NODE]:** The application might make assumptions about the data types it receives from the parsed JSON. An attacker could send JSON with data types that violate these assumptions (e.g., sending a string "true" instead of a boolean `true`). This could lead to logic errors or unexpected behavior in the application's processing.
