*   **Threat:** Insecure Tenant Switching Logic
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the `Onboard` gem's tenant switching logic allow an attacker to bypass intended tenant isolation. This could involve race conditions, improper state management, or flaws in the middleware provided by `Onboard`.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to data belonging to unintended tenants, potential data corruption across tenants, and privilege escalation if an attacker can switch to an administrative tenant.
    *   **Affected Onboard Component:** Tenant Switching Mechanism (the code within `Onboard` that sets the current tenant context).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `Onboard` gem updated to benefit from security patches.
        *   Thoroughly review and test the application's integration with `Onboard`'s tenant switching, paying close attention to any custom logic interacting with it.
        *   Consider contributing to the `Onboard` project by reporting potential vulnerabilities or submitting patches.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Tenant Data Access due to Configuration Errors
    *   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of `Onboard`'s database connection management or tenant resolution mechanisms leads to data leakage between tenants. This might involve misconfigured schema/database separation managed by `Onboard`.
    *   **Impact:**  Tenants can access or modify each other's data, leading to data breaches, corruption, and privacy violations.
    *   **Affected Onboard Component:** Database Connection Management within `Onboard`, Tenant Resolution Middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully follow `Onboard`'s documentation for configuring database isolation (e.g., separate schemas or databases per tenant).
        *   Thoroughly test the configuration to ensure data isolation is enforced.
        *   Regularly review `Onboard`'s configuration as part of security audits.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities within the Onboard Gem Itself
    *   **Description:** The `Onboard` gem itself contains security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Onboard Component:** Any part of the `Onboard` gem's codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `Onboard` gem updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to the `Onboard` gem.
        *   Consider contributing to the `Onboard` project by reporting potential vulnerabilities or submitting patches.
