### 5.2. Data Flow

A more detailed representation of the data flow during a typical onboarding session is as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["New User"] --> B{"Onboarding Frontend"};
    B -- "Request Current Step" --> C{"Onboard Service API"};
    C -- "Retrieve Flow Definition" --> D{"Onboarding Data Store"};
    D -- "Flow Definition" --> C;
    C -- "Retrieve User Progress" --> D;
    D -- "User Progress Data" --> C;
    C -- "Return Step Details & Content" --> B;
    B -- "User Action/Input" --> C;
    C -- "Validate Input" --> C;
    C -- "Update User Progress" --> D;
    C -- "Trigger Platform Action (e.g., Update Profile)" --> E{"User Profile Service API"};
    E -- "Update Profile Data" --> F{"User Profile Data Store"};
    C -- "Log Onboarding Event" --> G{"Analytics Service API"};
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Detailed Description of Data Flow:**

1. **New User Initiates Onboarding:** A new user accesses the platform and is directed to the Onboarding Frontend.
2. **Request Current Step:** The Onboarding Frontend sends a request to the Onboard Service API to retrieve the details of the current onboarding step for the user.
