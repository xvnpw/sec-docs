# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reusable, easy-to-integrate, and visually appealing progress HUD component for iOS application developers.
  - Enhance the user experience of iOS applications by providing clear visual feedback during loading and background operations.
  - Improve developer productivity by offering a well-documented and customizable progress HUD library.
  - Maintain compatibility with a wide range of iOS versions and devices.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of introducing UI glitches or performance issues in applications using the library.
  - Risk of compatibility issues with new iOS versions or device types, leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.
  - Risk of developer dissatisfaction due to complex integration, lack of customization, or poor documentation, hindering adoption.
  - While less critical for a UI library, there is a minor risk of subtle security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if the library handles user input or interacts with sensitive APIs in unexpected ways.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Publicly available code, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Use of standard iOS development tools and SDKs. (Implemented: Development Environment)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Low inherent security risk due to the nature of a UI library, which primarily focuses on visual presentation and does not typically handle sensitive data or core application logic.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying iOS platform and development tools.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the development workflow to identify potential code-level security issues.
  - security control: Conduct regular code reviews, including security-focused reviews, to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. The library itself does not handle user authentication. Applications using the library are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. The library does not enforce authorization. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using the library.
  - Input Validation: Implement input validation for any configurable parameters or API inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities. While a progress HUD library might have limited input, ensure any input is validated against expected types and ranges.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. The library is not expected to handle cryptographic operations. If cryptographic functionality is needed in applications, it should be implemented by the application itself, not within the UI library.

  - What is the expected lifespan and maintenance plan for the library?
- Assumptions:
  - The primary use case is displaying non-sensitive progress information to users.
  - The library is intended to be used in a wide range of iOS applications, from small to large scale.
  - Developers integrating the library are responsible for the overall security of their applications.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the UI library are considered to have a lower impact compared to vulnerabilities in core application logic or data handling components.
  - The library does not handle any user data directly and primarily interacts with iOS UI frameworks.
