## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Text into HUD](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_text_into_hud.md)

*   Attack Vector: The application displays text within the SVProgressHUD that is derived from user input or an external source without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   How it works: An attacker can inject malicious strings containing misleading information, social engineering prompts, or even attempts at basic UI spoofing by manipulating the data source used to populate the HUD's text.
*   Impact: Could lead to users being tricked into performing unintended actions, divulging sensitive information, or misinterpreting the application's state.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Displayed Text](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization_in_displayed_text.md)

*   Attack Vector: This is the specific mechanism by which the "Inject Malicious Text into HUD" attack is carried out.
*   How it works: The application fails to properly sanitize or encode the text before passing it to the SVProgressHUD's display methods. This allows the attacker's malicious input to be rendered directly.
*   Impact: Allows the injection of malicious content, leading to the consequences described above.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Display Phishing Content](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__display_phishing_content.md)

*   Attack Vector: The application, through the SVProgressHUD, displays content that attempts to mimic legitimate login screens or prompts for sensitive information.
*   How it works: An attacker might leverage vulnerabilities or customization options (if available) within the SVProgressHUD or the application's integration to display fake login forms or requests for credentials.
*   Impact: Could lead to the direct theft of user credentials or other sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Embed Links or Text Prompting for Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__embed_links_or_text_prompting_for_credentials.md)

*   Attack Vector: This describes the method used to display phishing content.
*   How it works: The attacker finds a way to embed clickable links or text within the SVProgressHUD that directs the user to a malicious website or prompts them to enter sensitive information directly within the HUD (if the application allows for such rich content).
*   Impact: Facilitates phishing attacks, potentially leading to credential theft and account compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Display Persistent HUD Over Important UI Elements](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__display_persistent_hud_over_important_ui_elements.md)

*   Attack Vector: The SVProgressHUD is displayed in a way that obscures critical information or interactive elements on the screen.
*   How it works: An attacker can exploit logic flaws or gain control over the HUD's display duration and z-index to make it appear and remain on top of other UI elements, preventing the user from seeing or interacting with them.
*   Impact: Hinders usability, can lead to users missing important information, or prevent them from completing necessary actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger HUD with Long Duration and High Z-Index](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__trigger_hud_with_long_duration_and_high_z-index.md)

*   Attack Vector: This is the technical method to achieve the persistent HUD display.
*   How it works: The attacker manipulates the parameters used when showing the SVProgressHUD, setting a very long duration or preventing the dismissal logic from being triggered. The high z-index ensures it stays on top of other elements.
*   Impact: Causes the HUD to remain visible indefinitely, obstructing the user interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Repeatedly Trigger HUD Display](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__repeatedly_trigger_hud_display.md)

*   Attack Vector: The SVProgressHUD is rapidly shown and dismissed, or multiple instances are displayed in quick succession.
*   How it works: An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities or control mechanisms to repeatedly call the methods responsible for showing and dismissing the HUD, potentially overwhelming the UI thread.
*   Impact: Can lead to a denial of service at the UI level, making the application sluggish or unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Flood the UI Thread with Show/Dismiss Calls](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__flood_the_ui_thread_with_showdismiss_calls.md)

*   Attack Vector: This describes the technical execution of the repeated HUD display attack.
*   How it works: The attacker finds a way to rapidly invoke the `show` and `dismiss` methods of the SVProgressHUD, consuming UI resources and causing performance issues.
*   Impact: Results in the application becoming slow or unresponsive to user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Display HUD Indefinitely](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__display_hud_indefinitely.md)

*   Attack Vector: The SVProgressHUD is displayed and cannot be dismissed through normal application interaction.
*   How it works: An attacker can exploit bugs in the dismissal logic or manipulate the application's state to prevent the conditions for dismissing the HUD from being met.
*   Impact: Renders the application unusable, effectively a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Prevent Dismissal of the HUD, Blocking User Interaction](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__prevent_dismissal_of_the_hud__blocking_user_interaction.md)

*   Attack Vector: This is the specific mechanism that causes the indefinite HUD display.
*   How it works: The attacker interferes with the code responsible for dismissing the HUD, preventing it from being called or ensuring that the conditions for dismissal are never met.
*   Impact: Locks the user interface, preventing any further interaction with the application.
