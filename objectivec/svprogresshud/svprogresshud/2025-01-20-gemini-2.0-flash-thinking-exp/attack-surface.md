# Attack Surface Analysis for svprogresshud/svprogresshud

## Attack Surface: [String Injection via Status Messages](./attack_surfaces/string_injection_via_status_messages.md)

* **Description:** The application uses user-controlled or untrusted data directly within the status messages displayed by SVProgressHUD without proper sanitization, leading to significant UI disruption or potential for exploitation.
    * **How SVProgressHUD Contributes:** SVProgressHUD's API (e.g., `show(withStatus:)`) accepts string arguments that are directly rendered in the UI. It does not perform any inherent sanitization or validation of these strings.
    * **Example:** An attacker provides a malicious string containing embedded code or control characters. If this string is directly used in `SVProgressHUD.show(withStatus: userInput)`, it could potentially lead to unexpected UI behavior, rendering issues that obscure critical information, or in rare cases, if the underlying rendering engine has vulnerabilities, potentially more severe consequences.
    * **Impact:**
        * **High:** Significant UI disruption or corruption, rendering the application unusable or misleading.
        * **High:** Potential for UI spoofing, where malicious content is displayed to trick users into taking unintended actions.
        * **High:** Denial of Service (DoS) if excessively long or complex strings cause rendering engine crashes or resource exhaustion, making the application unresponsive.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize or encode *all* user-provided data before using it in SVProgressHUD status messages. This includes escaping HTML entities, control characters, and any other potentially harmful sequences.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Displayed Data:** Avoid displaying untrusted data directly in status messages whenever possible. Use generic, pre-defined messages or display sanitized versions of the data.
        * **String Length Limits and Validation:** Implement strict limits on the length of strings used in status messages and validate their content to prevent excessively long or malformed inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Custom View Injection Leading to UI Spoofing or Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/custom_view_injection_leading_to_ui_spoofing_or_resource_exhaustion.md)

* **Description:** The application utilizes SVProgressHUD's ability to display custom views, and this functionality is exploited by providing malicious or resource-intensive custom views.
    * **How SVProgressHUD Contributes:** Methods like `show(image:status:)` or `show(view:status:)` allow developers to display custom UI elements within the HUD. If the application doesn't properly validate or control the source and content of these custom views, it creates an attack vector.
    * **Example:** An attacker could influence the application to display a custom view that mimics a legitimate system dialog, prompting the user for sensitive information. Alternatively, a malicious actor could force the display of an extremely complex or large custom view, consuming excessive resources and leading to application slowdown or crashes.
    * **Impact:**
        * **High:** UI spoofing, where a malicious custom view is used to deceive users into providing sensitive information or performing unintended actions.
        * **High:** Resource exhaustion leading to application instability, unresponsiveness, or crashes, effectively causing a denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Control Over Custom View Sources:**  Only allow the display of custom views from trusted and verified sources. Do not allow user-provided paths or identifiers to directly determine which custom views are loaded.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization for Custom View Parameters:** If parameters are used to configure custom views, rigorously validate and sanitize these inputs to prevent the loading of malicious content.
        * **Resource Limits and Monitoring:** Implement limits on the size and complexity of custom views that can be displayed. Monitor resource usage to detect and mitigate potential resource exhaustion attacks.
        * **Code Review for Custom View Handling:**  Thoroughly review the code responsible for selecting and displaying custom views to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
