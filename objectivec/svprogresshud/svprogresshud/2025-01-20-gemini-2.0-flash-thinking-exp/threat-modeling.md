# Threat Model Analysis for svprogresshud/svprogresshud

## Threat: [Displaying Malicious or Misleading Content](./threats/displaying_malicious_or_misleading_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker, by compromising the application's data sources or control flow, might manipulate the text or images displayed *through the `SVProgressHUD`'s API*. This involves setting malicious content using the library's methods for displaying text and images.

**Impact:** User confusion, potential for social engineering attacks leading to credential theft or other malicious actions, damage to application reputation and user trust.

**Affected Component:** `string` property used for text display, `image` property used for custom image display.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize and validate all data used to populate the `SVProgressHUD` text *before* passing it to the library.
*   Avoid directly displaying user-provided input within the HUD without proper encoding *at the application level*.
*   Implement strict access controls and input validation on data sources that influence the HUD's content.
*   Consider using predefined, safe messages for common progress states.

## Threat: [Indefinite UI Blocking via Persistent HUD](./threats/indefinite_ui_blocking_via_persistent_hud.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit logic flaws in the application's state management or asynchronous operations to prevent the `SVProgressHUD` from being dismissed *by not calling the dismissal methods*. This directly leverages the library's show and dismiss functionality.

**Impact:** Denial of service for the application, user frustration, potential loss of data if operations are interrupted.

**Affected Component:** `show(withStatus:)`, `showProgress(_:status:)`, `dismiss()` methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust error handling and timeouts for operations that trigger the `SVProgressHUD` *at the application level*.
*   Ensure proper state management to guarantee the HUD is dismissed after the corresponding operation completes or fails.
*   Implement watchdog timers or mechanisms to automatically dismiss the HUD after a reasonable period if the expected dismissal signal is not received.
*   Thoroughly test the application's logic for handling asynchronous operations and state transitions related to the HUD.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities within the SVProgressHUD Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_within_the_svprogresshud_library.md)

**Description:** The `SVProgressHUD` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if they can influence the library's behavior through the application's interaction with it. This could involve triggering specific sequences of calls or providing unexpected input to the library's methods.

**Impact:** Unpredictable, potentially severe depending on the nature of the vulnerability, ranging from application crashes to arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** The entire `SVProgressHUD` library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `SVProgressHUD` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to `SVProgressHUD`.
*   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   If concerns arise about the security of `SVProgressHUD`, evaluate alternative, actively maintained libraries.
