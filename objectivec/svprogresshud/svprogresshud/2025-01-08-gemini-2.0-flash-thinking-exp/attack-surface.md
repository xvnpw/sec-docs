# Attack Surface Analysis for svprogresshud/svprogresshud

## Attack Surface: [UI Blocking/Denial of Service (Local)](./attack_surfaces/ui_blockingdenial_of_service__local_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can make the application unusable by continuously or indefinitely displaying the SVProgressHUD, preventing user interaction.
* **How SVProgressHUD Contributes:** The library provides functions (`show()`, `show(withStatus:)`, etc.) to display the HUD. If these calls are made without corresponding `dismiss()` calls or are made in a loop, the HUD will remain visible, blocking the UI.
* **Example:** A malicious piece of code within the application (due to a vulnerability elsewhere) repeatedly calls `SVProgressHUD.show(withStatus: "Loading...")` without ever calling `SVProgressHUD.dismiss()`. The user is stuck with the loading indicator and cannot interact with the app.
* **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive, leading to a negative user experience and potentially preventing users from completing tasks.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement Proper State Management: Ensure that HUD display logic is tied to specific application states and that there are clear pathways for dismissing the HUD upon completion of the relevant operation or on error.
    * Use Timeouts: Implement timeouts for operations that trigger the HUD. If an operation takes too long, dismiss the HUD and potentially inform the user of an error.
    * Avoid Unconditional HUD Display: Do not display the HUD without a clear expectation of when it will be dismissed.
    * Review Asynchronous Operations: Carefully review asynchronous operations that trigger the HUD to ensure that the dismissal logic is correctly implemented in all success and failure scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Potential SVProgressHUD Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_potential_svprogresshud_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the SVProgressHUD library itself could be exploited.
* **How SVProgressHUD Contributes:** As a third-party dependency, the application relies on the security of the SVProgressHUD codebase.
* **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in SVProgressHUD's rendering logic could be exploited by crafting a specific message or by triggering a specific sequence of calls to the library, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.
* **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability within the library. It could range from a denial of service to more severe issues like unexpected UI behavior or, in extremely rare cases for a UI library, potentially more serious exploits.
* **Risk Severity:** High (potential for critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly update SVProgressHUD to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the maintainers.
    * Monitor for Security Advisories: Stay informed about any reported security vulnerabilities in SVProgressHUD or its dependencies.
    * Consider Alternatives: If severe vulnerabilities are discovered and not promptly addressed, consider alternative progress indicator libraries.
