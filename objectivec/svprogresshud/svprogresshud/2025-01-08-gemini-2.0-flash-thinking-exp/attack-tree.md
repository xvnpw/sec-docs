## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Manipulate Displayed Content](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__manipulate_displayed_content.md)

*   This node represents the overarching goal of manipulating the information displayed by SVProgressHUD to the user.
*   It is critical because successful attacks here directly lead to user deception and potential harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Content](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_content.md)

*   This node describes the attack vector of injecting malicious scripts or links into the content displayed by SVProgressHUD.
*   It is critical because it can lead to phishing attacks or limited cross-site scripting within the UI context.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization.md)

*   This node highlights the vulnerability where the application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input before displaying it in SVProgressHUD.
*   It is critical because it is the root cause enabling the "Inject Malicious Content" attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Supply Crafted Message with Malicious Scripts/Links](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__supply_crafted_message_with_malicious_scriptslinks.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   This path describes the scenario where an attacker crafts a message containing malicious scripts or links that are then displayed by SVProgressHUD.

## Attack Tree Path: [User Clicks Malicious Link (Phishing)](./attack_tree_paths/user_clicks_malicious_link__phishing_.md)

*   This is a sub-step within the "Supply Crafted Message with Malicious Scripts/Links" path.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Script Execution in UI Context (Cross-Site Scripting - Limited Scope)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__script_execution_in_ui_context__cross-site_scripting_-_limited_scope_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High
*   This path describes the scenario where injected scripts are executed within the UI context, potentially allowing for UI manipulation or data theft within that context.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH START] Display Misleading Information](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_start__display_misleading_information.md)

*   This path focuses on attacks where the displayed progress information is manipulated to mislead the user about the application's state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Modify Progress Updates](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_modify_progress_updates.md)

*   This is a sub-path within "Display Misleading Information".
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:**
    *   **Modify API Responses Containing Progress Data:**
        *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
        *   Impact: Medium
        *   Effort: Medium to High
        *   Skill Level: Medium to High
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_application_logic.md)

*   This is a sub-path within "Display Misleading Information".
*   **Exploit Application Vulnerabilities to Control Progress Messages:**
    *   **Gain Control over Data Sent to SVProgressHUD:**
        *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
        *   Impact: Medium
        *   Effort: Medium to High
        *   Skill Level: Medium to High
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH START] Abuse Visual Appearance](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path_start__abuse_visual_appearance.md)

*   This path focuses on attacks that exploit the visual customization options of SVProgressHUD to deceive the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Impersonate Legitimate UI Elements](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__impersonate_legitimate_ui_elements.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   This path describes the scenario where the attacker crafts the appearance of SVProgressHUD to mimic legitimate system dialogs or other UI elements.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Progress HUD to Mimic System Dialogs](./attack_tree_paths/craft_progress_hud_to_mimic_system_dialogs.md)

*   This is a sub-step within the "Impersonate Legitimate UI Elements" path.
*   **Deceive User into Performing Unintended Actions:**
    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
    *   Impact: Medium to High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse.md)

*   This node highlights vulnerabilities arising from incorrect configuration or improper usage of SVProgressHUD by developers.
*   It is critical because it can lead to direct exposure of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Display Sensitive Information in HUD [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__display_sensitive_information_in_hud__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
*   This path describes the scenario where developers unintentionally display sensitive information within the progress messages of SVProgressHUD.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Developers Unintentionally Display Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/application_developers_unintentionally_display_sensitive_data.md)

*   This is a sub-step within the "Display Sensitive Information in HUD" path.
*   **Data Leakage via UI:**
    *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium
