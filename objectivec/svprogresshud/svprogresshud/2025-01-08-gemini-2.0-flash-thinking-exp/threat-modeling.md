# Threat Model Analysis for svprogresshud/svprogresshud

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `SVProgressHUD` Code](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__svprogresshud__code.md)

**Description:** An attacker could discover and exploit a security vulnerability within the `SVProgressHUD` codebase itself (e.g., a memory corruption bug). This could be achieved through reverse engineering or by analyzing reported issues. Successful exploitation could lead to application crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Core `SVProgressHUD` library code (various modules and functions).

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `SVProgressHUD` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Monitor the `SVProgressHUD` GitHub repository for reported security issues and updates.

## Threat: [Displaying Sensitive Information in the HUD Message](./threats/displaying_sensitive_information_in_the_hud_message.md)

**Description:** A developer might unintentionally or carelessly display sensitive user data or system information within the text shown by `SVProgressHUD`. An attacker observing the device could then gain access to this information.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violation.

**Affected Component:** `show(withStatus:)`, `setStatus(_:)`, `showProgress(_:status:)`, `showImage(_:status:)` functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid displaying any sensitive information in `SVProgressHUD` messages.
* Use generic and non-revealing messages for progress updates.
* If specific status information is needed, display it in a secure part of the UI after authentication.

## Threat: [Abandoned Library with Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./threats/abandoned_library_with_unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the `SVProgressHUD` library becomes abandoned and is no longer maintained, any newly discovered vulnerabilities within its code will likely remain unpatched. Attackers could then target applications using these vulnerable versions.

**Impact:** Increased risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities within `SVProgressHUD`, potential for application compromise.

**Affected Component:** All components of the `SVProgressHUD` library.

**Risk Severity:** High (increases over time as vulnerabilities are discovered)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Monitor the activity and maintenance status of the `SVProgressHUD` repository.
* If the library appears abandoned, consider migrating to an actively maintained alternative.
* If migration is not immediately feasible, consider code reviews and potential patching of the library within your own project (with caution).
