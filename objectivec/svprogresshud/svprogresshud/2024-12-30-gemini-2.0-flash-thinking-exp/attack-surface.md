### Key Attack Surface List: SVProgressHUD (High & Critical - Direct Involvement)

This list details key attack surfaces directly involving the `SVProgressHUD` library with high or critical risk severity.

* **Attack Surface: Information Disclosure via Progress Message**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information is displayed within the progress message shown by `SVProgressHUD`, potentially exposing it to unauthorized observers.
    * **How SVProgressHUD Contributes:** `SVProgressHUD` is the mechanism used to display this text on the screen. Any content passed to its text display methods becomes part of the application's visible interface.
    * **Example:** An application displays "Processing user data: John Doe's Social Security Number" in the progress HUD. Someone looking at the screen could see this sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive personal or business data, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * **Sanitize any data displayed in the progress message.** Avoid displaying raw, sensitive data directly.
            * **Use generic progress messages.** Instead of specific details, use messages like "Processing data," "Loading," or "Please wait."
            * **Log sensitive operations securely and separately.** Do not rely on the progress HUD for logging or displaying sensitive information.
