Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `SVProgressHUD` library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Message Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic to inject malicious or misleading messages into the text displayed by `SVProgressHUD`. This directly involves how the application uses `SVProgressHUD`'s text display functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Phishing attacks targeting users, social engineering attempts to deceive users, defacement of the application's user interface, or spreading misinformation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `SVProgressHUD`'s text display functionality, specifically the methods used to set the status message (e.g., `show(withStatus:)`, `setStatus(_:)`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data used to populate the `SVProgressHUD` message *before* passing it to `SVProgressHUD`.
        *   Avoid directly displaying user-provided input without thorough processing when setting the `SVProgressHUD` message.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `SVProgressHUD` Library Itself
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the `SVProgressHUD` library code itself. This is a direct threat stemming from the library's implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `SVProgressHUD` library codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a severe vulnerability exists) to High (for less critical issues).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `SVProgressHUD` library to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues related to the library.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the library.
