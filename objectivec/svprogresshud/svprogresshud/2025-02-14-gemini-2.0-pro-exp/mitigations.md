# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for svprogresshud/svprogresshud

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for Displayed Text](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_displayed_text.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all instances** where `SVProgressHUD` displays text that originates from:
        *   User input (directly or indirectly).
        *   Network responses (API calls, data fetched from servers).
        *   Any external source (files, databases, etc.).
    2.  **Implement a sanitization function:** Create a reusable function (or use an existing, well-vetted library) that takes a string as input and returns a sanitized version. This function should:
        *   **Escape HTML/XML special characters:** Replace characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` with their corresponding HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`). This prevents these characters from being interpreted as HTML tags.
        *   **Consider whitelisting (if applicable):** If you *know* that only a very limited set of characters or patterns are allowed, you can create a whitelist and reject any input that doesn't match.
        *   **Avoid regular expressions for complex sanitization:** Use a dedicated library.
    3.  **Apply the sanitization function:** Before passing *any* string to `SVProgressHUD`'s display methods (e.g., `show(withStatus:)`, `showInfo(withStatus:)`, `showError(withStatus:)`, etc.), call the sanitization function.
    4.  **Test thoroughly:** Test with various inputs, including edge cases and known attack strings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Display-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Low Severity):** Prevents theoretical injection of malicious JavaScript through displayed text.
    *   **Display Corruption/Garbling (Medium Severity):** Prevents unexpected characters from disrupting the HUD's appearance.
    *   **Injection of Control Characters (Low Severity):** Prevents injection of control characters that might interfere with the display.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
    *   **Display Corruption:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Control Character Injection:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Partially implemented. Sanitization function `sanitizeStringForDisplay` exists in `Utility.swift`, but it's basic and needs replacement. Used in `NetworkManager` for error messages.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Not implemented for file upload progress messages in `FileUploadViewController.swift`.
    *   **Example:** Basic sanitization function needs replacement with a robust library.
    *   **Example:** Missing comprehensive testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Displaying Sensitive Information](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_displaying_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review:** Review all calls to `SVProgressHUD`.
    2.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** List all sensitive data within the application.
    3.  **Check for Violations:** Verify that no sensitive data is passed to `SVProgressHUD`, directly or indirectly.
    4.  **Use Generic Messages:** Replace any potential sensitive data displays with generic messages.
    5.  **Automated Checks (Optional):** Consider static analysis tools.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Shoulder Surfing (High Severity):** Reduces risk of nearby observation.
    *   **Screenshot/Screen Recording Capture (High Severity):** Prevents capture in screenshots/recordings.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.
    *   **Shoulder Surfing:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.
    *   **Screenshot/Screen Recording Capture:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Mostly implemented. Code review conducted, known instances removed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Needs ongoing vigilance during code changes. Formal review process for `SVProgressHUD` usage needed.
    *   **Example:** No automated checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Use with Asynchronous Operations](./mitigation_strategies/careful_use_with_asynchronous_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Main Thread Updates:** Ensure *all* `SVProgressHUD` calls are on the main thread. Use `DispatchQueue.main.async`.
    2.  **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Handle *all* outcomes in asynchronous operation completion handlers:
        *   **Success:** Dismiss with success message (if appropriate) and `dismiss(withDelay:)`.
        *   **Failure:** Dismiss with sanitized error message and `dismiss(withDelay:)`.
        *   **Cancellation:** Dismiss in cancellation handler.
    3.  **Avoid Indefinite Display:** Prevent indefinite display without user dismissal or timeout.
    4.  **Use `dismiss(withDelay:)`:** Ensure messages are displayed for a minimum duration.
    5.  **Test Asynchronous Scenarios:** Thoroughly test, including errors and cancellations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **UI Unresponsiveness (Medium Severity):** Prevents HUD blocking the main thread.
    *   **Race Conditions (Low Severity):** Reduces risk of simultaneous updates.
    *   **HUD Stuck Indefinitely (Medium Severity):** Prevents HUD sticking.
    *   **Masking of Underlying Issues (Medium Severity):** Prevents HUD hiding errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **UI Unresponsiveness:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Race Conditions:** Risk reduced from Low to Negligible.
    *   **HUD Stuck Indefinitely:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Masking of Underlying Issues:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Partially implemented. Most use `DispatchQueue.main.async`, but some older code may not.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Comprehensive error/cancellation handling not consistent.
    *   **Example:** `NetworkService.swift` needs review for proper dismissal.
    *   **Example:** Thorough testing of asynchronous scenarios lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update the Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_the_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (CocoaPods, SPM, Carthage).
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly check for updates.
    3.  **Review Changelogs:** Review changelogs for security fixes.
    4.  **Testing After Update:** Test after updating.
    5.  **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Subscribe to repository/security lists.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity Varies):** Protects against vulnerabilities fixed in newer versions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from (Potentially High to Low) to Negligible (with prompt updates).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Partially implemented. Uses SPM, but updates are not regular.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Example:** Schedule for checking/applying updates needed.
    *   **Example:** Automated dependency update checks not configured.
