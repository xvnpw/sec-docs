# Attack Tree Analysis for svprogresshud/svprogresshud

Objective: To degrade user experience, cause denial of service, or potentially leak sensitive information displayed within the HUD by exploiting SVProgressHUD.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulation of HUD Display](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulation_of_hud_display.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary high-risk area, focusing on attacks that alter the content or behavior of the SVProgressHUD to mislead the user or potentially execute malicious code.
*   **Why Critical:** This branch contains the most severe potential vulnerability (XSS) and other attacks that can directly impact the user's perception and trust in the application.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Display Misleading Info](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_display_misleading_info.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the HUD display incorrect or deceptive information, potentially leading the user to take unintended actions.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the direct parent node of the XSS vulnerability and encompasses other attacks that manipulate the information presented to the user.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Inject Malicious Text/HTML](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_inject_malicious_texthtml.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to inject malicious JavaScript (XSS) or HTML into the text displayed by SVProgressHUD. If successful, this could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or complete application compromise.
*   **Why Critical:** XSS is a well-known, high-impact vulnerability with severe consequences.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Assuming proper input sanitization. SVProgressHUD uses `UILabel`, which offers some inherent protection, but custom drawing or attributed string handling could introduce vulnerabilities.)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Potential for complete application compromise.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on the complexity of the injection and the application's defenses.)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires understanding of XSS and potentially bypassing sanitization techniques.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Standard XSS detection tools might catch it, but sophisticated attacks could be obfuscated.)
