# Attack Surface Analysis for svprogresshud/svprogresshud

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via UI Blocking](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_ui_blocking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker prevents legitimate users from interacting with the application by causing `SVProgressHUD` to be displayed indefinitely or in a rapid, disruptive cycle.
    *   **How SVProgressHUD Contributes:** The library provides the mechanism (the modal HUD) that, when improperly managed, can block the UI. This is a *direct* contribution because the HUD itself is the tool used for the attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network requests that are supposed to trigger the dismissal of the HUD, preventing the dismissal from ever occurring. The application is now stuck with the HUD displayed.
    *   **Impact:** Users cannot use the application. Functionality is completely blocked until the application is forcibly closed and restarted (if even that works, depending on the persistence of the attack).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust timeouts for all operations that display the HUD. Ensure that *all* code paths that show the HUD have corresponding, guaranteed dismissal paths, even in error conditions. Provide a user-initiated dismissal mechanism (e.g., a "Cancel" button or a tap-to-dismiss gesture, if appropriate for the context) that is *always* available and functional, regardless of the underlying operation's state. Use `setMinimumDismissTimeInterval:` to prevent rapid show/hide cycles. Thoroughly test error handling and edge cases.
        *   **User:** If the HUD is stuck, try force-quitting the application. If the problem persists, contact the application developers.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Dependency Risk](./attack_surfaces/third-party_dependency_risk.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `SVProgressHUD` library itself could be exploited.
    * **How SVProgressHUD Contributes:** The library is a dependency, and any vulnerabilities in *its* code become part of the application's attack surface. This is a direct contribution.
    * **Example:** A hypothetical *critical* vulnerability is discovered in `SVProgressHUD` that allows for remote code execution when a specific, malformed string is passed as the status text.
    * **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the vulnerability. A critical vulnerability could lead to complete application compromise, data breaches, or other severe consequences.
    * **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the specific vulnerability; could be Low to *Critical*). We include it here because it *can* be High or Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Keep `SVProgressHUD` updated to the latest version. Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) for any reported issues with the library. Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to automatically detect and track vulnerabilities in dependencies. Consider forking the library and conducting your own security audits if the risk is deemed exceptionally high and the library is not actively maintained.
        *   **User:** Keep your device's operating system and applications updated. This helps ensure you have the latest security patches, which may include fixes for vulnerabilities in libraries like `SVProgressHUD`.
