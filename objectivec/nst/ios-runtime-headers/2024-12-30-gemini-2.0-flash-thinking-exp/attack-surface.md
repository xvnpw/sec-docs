Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving `iOS-Runtime-Headers` and with "high" or "critical" risk severity:

* **Attack Surface: Exploitation of Private Method Implementations**
    * **Description:** Attackers can leverage the exposed headers to understand the implementation details of private methods. This knowledge can be used to craft specific inputs or sequences of calls to trigger unexpected behavior, vulnerabilities, or bypass security checks within those private methods.
    * **How iOS-Runtime-Headers Contributes:** The headers provide the signatures and potentially insights into the logic of private methods, making it easier for attackers to identify exploitable weaknesses.
    * **Example:** An attacker discovers a private method responsible for handling user authentication has a flaw when processing unusually long usernames. Using the header information, they can craft a malicious username to bypass authentication.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches, application crashes.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using private APIs entirely.
        * Thorough code review and security audits specifically focusing on private method usage.
        * Implement runtime checks and input validation, even for private methods.

* **Attack Surface: Accessing and Manipulating Private Instance Variables (IVars)**
    * **Description:** The headers expose the structure and types of private instance variables. Attackers can use this information, potentially through runtime manipulation techniques, to access or modify the internal state of objects, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches.
    * **How iOS-Runtime-Headers Contributes:** The headers provide the names and types of private IVars, making it significantly easier to target and manipulate them.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses the header information to identify a private IVar storing a user's sensitive data in memory. They then use runtime techniques to directly access and exfiltrate this data.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of application state, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using private APIs that expose object structures.
        * Implement strong data protection measures at the application level.
        * Be aware that runtime manipulation techniques can bypass access controls.

* **Attack Surface: Invoking Private Selectors for Malicious Purposes**
    * **Description:** Attackers can use the header information to discover and invoke private selectors (method names). This allows them to trigger functionalities or access data that are not intended for public use, potentially bypassing security checks or accessing sensitive information.
    * **How iOS-Runtime-Headers Contributes:** The headers provide the names of private selectors, making it trivial for attackers to identify and attempt to invoke them.
    * **Example:** An attacker discovers a private selector that allows bypassing a payment verification process. Using the header information, they can invoke this selector to make unauthorized purchases.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, privilege escalation, financial loss, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using private APIs that involve invoking selectors.
        * Implement robust authorization checks within all methods, including those with private selectors.

* **Attack Surface: Increased Reverse Engineering Efficiency**
    * **Description:** The availability of headers significantly simplifies the reverse engineering process for attackers. They provide a clear map of the application's internal structure and functionalities, making it easier to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
    * **How iOS-Runtime-Headers Contributes:** The headers directly provide the class structures, method signatures, and property definitions, which are the primary targets of reverse engineering efforts.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses the headers to quickly understand the application's data handling logic and identify a weakness in how sensitive data is processed.
    * **Impact:** Faster identification of vulnerabilities, increased likelihood of successful attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Obfuscation techniques.
        * Code signing and integrity checks.
        * Focus on strong security practices throughout the development lifecycle.
