# Deep Analysis of iOS Application Attack Tree Path: Method Swizzling

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat posed by method swizzling (specifically, replacing a legitimate method with malicious code) to an iOS application that utilizes the `nst/ios-runtime-headers` library.  We aim to identify the technical mechanisms, potential vulnerabilities, mitigation strategies, and detection techniques related to this specific attack vector.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the application's security posture.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

*   **5. Inject Malicious Code**
    *   **5.1. Inject and Execute Code [CRITICAL]**
        *   **5.1.1. Method Swizzling [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   **5.1.1.1. Replace a method with malicious code. [HIGH-RISK]**

The analysis will consider:

*   The role of `nst/ios-runtime-headers` in facilitating or mitigating this attack.
*   The specific Objective-C runtime mechanisms that enable method swizzling.
*   Common vulnerabilities that make an application susceptible to this attack.
*   Practical examples of how an attacker might exploit this vulnerability.
*   Effective mitigation techniques, including both proactive (code hardening) and reactive (runtime detection) measures.
*   Limitations of proposed mitigations.

This analysis *will not* cover other forms of code injection or other attack vectors outside of the specified path.  It assumes a basic understanding of iOS application development, Objective-C, and the iOS runtime.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Literature Review:**  Examine existing research, documentation, and security advisories related to method swizzling, Objective-C runtime manipulation, and iOS application security. This includes Apple's official documentation, security blogs, and academic papers.
2.  **Code Analysis:**  Analyze the `nst/ios-runtime-headers` library to understand how it exposes Objective-C runtime information and how this information could be leveraged by an attacker.
3.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  Identify common coding patterns and architectural decisions that increase the risk of method swizzling attacks.
4.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development (Conceptual):**  Describe, conceptually, how a PoC exploit could be developed to demonstrate the attack.  We will not create a fully functional exploit, but we will outline the steps and necessary code snippets.
5.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation techniques, considering their impact on performance, maintainability, and overall security.
6.  **Detection Analysis:** Explore methods for detecting method swizzling attempts at runtime.
7.  **Recommendation Synthesis:**  Based on the findings, provide concrete recommendations to the development team.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 5.1.1.1 - Replace a method with malicious code

### 2.1. Technical Mechanism of Method Swizzling

Method swizzling in Objective-C is a powerful technique that allows developers to change the implementation of an existing method at runtime.  It leverages the dynamic nature of the Objective-C runtime.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Selectors and IMPs:**  In Objective-C, a method call is essentially sending a message (represented by a *selector*) to an object.  The runtime resolves this selector to a function pointer called an *IMP* (implementation pointer).  The IMP points to the actual code that will be executed.
*   **`method_exchangeImplementations`:**  The core function enabling method swizzling is `method_exchangeImplementations`.  This function, part of the Objective-C runtime, takes two `Method` structures as arguments and swaps their IMPs.  This means that after the call, the first selector will point to the implementation of the second method, and vice versa.
*   **`class_getInstanceMethod` / `class_getClassMethod`:** These functions are used to obtain the `Method` structures for instance methods and class methods, respectively.  They take a `Class` and a `SEL` (selector) as arguments.
*   **`nst/ios-runtime-headers` Role:** This library provides header files that declare the structures and functions of the Objective-C runtime.  While it doesn't *perform* the swizzling itself, it makes it significantly easier for developers (and attackers) to access and manipulate the runtime.  Without these headers, an attacker would need to manually define the necessary structures and function prototypes, which is more error-prone and time-consuming.  It lowers the barrier to entry for runtime manipulation.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Assessment

Several factors can make an iOS application vulnerable to method swizzling:

*   **Lack of Code Integrity Checks:**  If the application doesn't verify the integrity of its own code at runtime, it won't detect that a method's implementation has been altered.
*   **Overly Permissive Entitlements:**  Certain entitlements, if granted unnecessarily, can make it easier for an attacker to inject code into the application's process.
*   **Use of Third-Party Libraries Without Auditing:**  If a third-party library contains vulnerabilities or intentionally malicious code, it could be used to perform method swizzling.
*   **Debugging Symbols Left in Production Builds:**  Debugging symbols can provide attackers with valuable information about the application's internal structure, making it easier to identify target methods for swizzling.
*   **No Jailbreak Detection:** While not strictly required for method swizzling, a jailbroken device provides an attacker with greater control over the system and makes it easier to inject code.  Lack of jailbreak detection means the application won't take defensive measures in a compromised environment.
*   **Predictable Method Names:** Using standard or easily guessable method names makes it easier for an attacker to identify potential targets for swizzling.
* **Absence of Runtime Protection:** The application lacks mechanisms to detect or prevent unauthorized modifications to its runtime environment.

### 2.3. Conceptual Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

Let's imagine a scenario where an application has a method called `-(BOOL)isUserAuthenticated` that checks if the user is logged in. An attacker could use method swizzling to bypass this check:

```objectivec
#import <objc/runtime.h>
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// ... (Assume nst/ios-runtime-headers are included)

// Malicious method to replace isUserAuthenticated
BOOL alwaysAuthenticated(id self, SEL _cmd) {
    return YES; // Always return YES, bypassing the authentication check
}

void injectMaliciousCode() {
    Class targetClass = NSClassFromString(@"SomeViewController"); // Replace with the actual class name
    SEL originalSelector = @selector(isUserAuthenticated);
    SEL maliciousSelector = @selector(alwaysAuthenticated);

    Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(targetClass, originalSelector);
    Method maliciousMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], maliciousSelector); // Assuming this code is in a class

    if (originalMethod && maliciousMethod) {
        // Add the malicious method to the target class if it doesn't exist
        if (!class_getInstanceMethod(targetClass, maliciousSelector))
        {
            class_addMethod(targetClass, maliciousSelector, (IMP)alwaysAuthenticated, "c@:");
            maliciousMethod = class_getInstanceMethod(targetClass, maliciousSelector);
        }
        method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, maliciousMethod);
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Failed to get methods for swizzling.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Include Headers:**  The necessary runtime headers are included.
2.  **`alwaysAuthenticated`:**  This is the malicious method that will always return `YES`.
3.  **`injectMaliciousCode`:**  This function performs the swizzling.
4.  **`NSClassFromString`:**  Gets the `Class` object for the target class (e.g., a view controller).
5.  **`@selector`:**  Gets the `SEL` (selector) for the original and malicious methods.
6.  **`class_getInstanceMethod`:**  Retrieves the `Method` structures for both methods.
7.  **`class_addMethod`:** Adds malicious method to target class.
8.  **`method_exchangeImplementations`:**  Swaps the implementations of the two methods.

After this code executes, any call to `isUserAuthenticated` on an instance of `SomeViewController` will actually execute `alwaysAuthenticated`, effectively bypassing the authentication check.

### 2.4. Mitigation Techniques

Several techniques can be used to mitigate the risk of method swizzling:

*   **Code Obfuscation:**  Obfuscating the code makes it more difficult for an attacker to understand the application's logic and identify target methods.  This includes renaming methods and classes to less obvious names.
*   **Runtime Integrity Checks:**  The application can periodically check the integrity of its own code by comparing the current IMPs of critical methods to their expected values.  This can be done by storing the original IMPs at startup and comparing them later.
    *   **Example:**
        ```objectivec
        // Store original IMP at startup
        IMP originalIMP = method_getImplementation(class_getInstanceMethod(targetClass, originalSelector));

        // ... Later, check the IMP
        IMP currentIMP = method_getImplementation(class_getInstanceMethod(targetClass, originalSelector));
        if (originalIMP != currentIMP) {
            // Method has been swizzled! Take action (e.g., terminate the app, alert the user).
        }
        ```
*   **Jailbreak Detection:**  Detecting if the device is jailbroken allows the application to take defensive measures, such as refusing to run or disabling sensitive features.
*   **Use of Swift:**  Swift's static dispatch for methods (in many cases) makes method swizzling more difficult, although not impossible (dynamic dispatch and `@objc` methods are still vulnerable).  Migrating critical code to Swift can significantly reduce the attack surface.
*   **Anti-Debugging Techniques:**  Making it harder for attackers to debug the application can slow down their analysis and exploitation efforts.
*   **Entitlement Restrictions:**  Carefully review and minimize the entitlements granted to the application.
*   **Code Signing:**  Ensure that the application is properly code-signed and that the signature is verified at runtime.  This helps prevent unauthorized code from being loaded.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Hooking Detection Frameworks:** Use frameworks like Cycript, Frida, or Substrate detection to identify if common hooking frameworks are present.

### 2.5. Detection Techniques

Detecting method swizzling at runtime is crucial for a layered defense:

*   **IMP Comparison (as described above):**  The most direct method is to store the original IMPs of critical methods and periodically compare them to the current IMPs.
*   **Fishhook Detection:** Fishhook is a popular library used for method swizzling.  Detecting the presence of Fishhook in the application's memory can indicate a potential attack.
*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**  Tools like Frida can be used to monitor method calls and detect unexpected behavior.  While attackers can also use these tools, they can be valuable for security researchers and developers.
*   **System Call Monitoring:**  Monitoring system calls made by the application can reveal suspicious activity, such as attempts to access sensitive data or modify system settings.
* **Memory Analysis:** Examining the application's memory space for unexpected code or modifications can help identify injected code.

### 2.6. Limitations of Mitigations

It's important to acknowledge that no mitigation is perfect:

*   **Obfuscation:**  Can be bypassed by determined attackers with sufficient time and resources.
*   **Runtime Integrity Checks:**  Can be bypassed if the attacker can also swizzle the methods that perform the checks.  This creates a "cat and mouse" game.
*   **Jailbreak Detection:**  Jailbreak detection techniques are constantly being bypassed by new jailbreak methods.
*   **Swift:**  While Swift reduces the attack surface, it doesn't eliminate it entirely.
*   **Anti-Debugging:**  Can make legitimate debugging more difficult.

### 2.7. Recommendations

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are made to the development team:

1.  **Prioritize Swift:**  Migrate critical code, especially security-sensitive components, to Swift to leverage its static dispatch and reduce the risk of method swizzling.
2.  **Implement Runtime Integrity Checks:**  Implement runtime checks to verify the integrity of critical methods.  Store original IMPs securely and compare them periodically.  Consider using a rotating set of methods to check to make it harder for attackers to bypass all checks.
3.  **Code Obfuscation:**  Apply code obfuscation techniques to make it more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer the application.
4.  **Jailbreak Detection:**  Implement robust jailbreak detection and take appropriate action (e.g., warn the user, disable sensitive features, or terminate the application) if a jailbreak is detected.
5.  **Entitlement Review:**  Carefully review and minimize the entitlements granted to the application.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
7.  **Security Training:**  Provide security training to the development team to raise awareness of common iOS security threats and best practices.
8.  **Monitor for New Techniques:**  Stay informed about new method swizzling techniques and adapt the application's defenses accordingly.
9. **Consider Third-Party Security Libraries:** Evaluate and potentially integrate reputable third-party security libraries that offer runtime protection and threat detection capabilities.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of method swizzling attacks and improve the overall security of the iOS application. The use of `nst/ios-runtime-headers` should be carefully considered, and if its functionality is essential, extra precautions should be taken to secure the application against runtime manipulation.
