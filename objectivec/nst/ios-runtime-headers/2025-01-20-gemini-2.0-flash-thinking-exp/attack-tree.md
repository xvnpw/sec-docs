## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Incorrect Usage of ios-runtime-headers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_incorrect_usage_of_ios-runtime-headers.md)

This path is high-risk because it relies on common developer errors when interacting with complex and potentially undocumented internal APIs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrectly Casting Objects Based on Header Definitions](./attack_tree_paths/incorrectly_casting_objects_based_on_header_definitions.md)

* **Accessing Invalid Memory Locations:** The application incorrectly assumes the type or structure of an object based on the headers, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
    * **Supply Malicious Data Triggering Incorrect Type Handling:** An attacker provides input that causes the application to misinterpret the type of an object, leading to an incorrect cast and subsequent memory access issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improperly Handling Return Values or Data Structures Defined in Headers](./attack_tree_paths/improperly_handling_return_values_or_data_structures_defined_in_headers.md)

* **Information Disclosure by Misinterpreting Data:** The application misinterprets data returned by internal APIs, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    * **Logic Errors Leading to Exploitable States:** Incorrect handling of return values can lead to flawed logic, creating exploitable conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Internal APIs in an Unsafe or Unintended Way](./attack_tree_paths/using_internal_apis_in_an_unsafe_or_unintended_way.md)

* **Triggering Undocumented Behavior with Security Implications:**  Calling internal APIs in ways not intended by Apple can lead to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior.
    * **Circumventing Security Checks by Directly Accessing Internal Functionality:** Attackers might bypass intended security mechanisms by directly invoking internal functions that lack proper checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposing Internal Data Structures or Methods Through Insecure Interfaces](./attack_tree_paths/exposing_internal_data_structures_or_methods_through_insecure_interfaces.md)

* **Leaking Sensitive Information to Unauthorized Users:**  Internal data structures or methods are inadvertently exposed through public interfaces, allowing attackers to access sensitive data.
    * **Allowing Manipulation of Internal State:** Exposed internal methods might allow attackers to directly modify the application's internal state, leading to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Side Effects of Using ios-runtime-headers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_side_effects_of_using_ios-runtime-headers.md)

This path is high-risk due to the potential for disrupting application availability and integrity through unintended consequences of runtime interactions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion by Repeatedly Invoking Runtime Operations](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion_by_repeatedly_invoking_runtime_operations.md)

* **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:**  An attacker can repeatedly trigger resource-intensive runtime operations, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unexpected State Changes due to Runtime Interactions](./attack_tree_paths/unexpected_state_changes_due_to_runtime_interactions.md)

* **Corrupting Application Data or Configuration:** Interacting with the runtime might inadvertently corrupt application data or configuration settings.
    * **Altering Application Behavior in Malicious Ways:**  Unexpected state changes can be manipulated to alter the application's behavior in ways that benefit the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Information Leaked by ios-runtime-headers](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_information_leaked_by_ios-runtime-headers.md)

This path is high-risk because the information gained can significantly aid in further attacks and reverse engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Discover Internal Class Structures and Method Signatures](./attack_tree_paths/discover_internal_class_structures_and_method_signatures.md)

* **Reverse Engineer Application Logic More Easily:** Knowledge of internal structures and methods simplifies the process of understanding the application's inner workings, making it easier to find vulnerabilities.
    * **Identify Potential Vulnerabilities in Internal Methods:**  Understanding the signatures and potential functionality of internal methods can reveal exploitable weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Obtain Sensitive Information from Runtime Data](./attack_tree_paths/obtain_sensitive_information_from_runtime_data.md)

* **Access Private Application Data:**  The runtime environment might hold sensitive application data that can be accessed through the headers.
    * **Discover Security Tokens or Credentials:**  Sensitive security tokens or credentials might be present in the runtime environment and accessible through the exposed headers.
