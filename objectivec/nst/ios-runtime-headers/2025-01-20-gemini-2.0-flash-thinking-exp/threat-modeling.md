# Threat Model Analysis for nst/ios-runtime-headers

## Threat: [Abuse of Runtime Information for Exploits](./threats/abuse_of_runtime_information_for_exploits.md)

**Description:** Attackers directly leverage the detailed information about iOS runtime structures and method signatures provided by `ios-runtime-headers` to craft more sophisticated exploits. This knowledge, gained directly from the header files, allows for more targeted attacks against vulnerabilities within the operating system or specific iOS frameworks.

**Impact:** More effective and targeted exploitation of vulnerabilities, potentially leading to privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Header files detailing iOS runtime structures, object layouts, and method signatures provided by `ios-runtime-headers`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the usage of `ios-runtime-headers` in production code.
*   If necessary, ensure the headers are only used during development or debugging and are not included in the final application binary.
*   Stay updated with iOS security patches and best practices to mitigate underlying vulnerabilities that could be exploited using this information.

## Threat: [Understanding Internal Data Structures for Memory Corruption](./threats/understanding_internal_data_structures_for_memory_corruption.md)

**Description:** Attackers analyze the header files from `ios-runtime-headers` to gain detailed knowledge of object layouts and data structures within the iOS runtime. This understanding directly assists them in crafting memory corruption exploits by revealing how data is organized in memory, making it easier to identify targets for manipulation.

**Impact:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information leaks.

**Affected Component:** Header files from `ios-runtime-headers` describing object layouts, data structures, and memory management details.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the usage of `ios-runtime-headers` in production code.
*   If necessary, ensure the headers are only used during development or debugging and are not included in the final application binary.
*   Employ memory-safe programming practices to prevent buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, and other memory corruption issues.

## Threat: [Compromised Headers (Supply Chain Risk)](./threats/compromised_headers__supply_chain_risk_.md)

**Description:** The `ios-runtime-headers` repository itself could be compromised, leading to the introduction of malicious or backdoored header files. If the application relies on these compromised headers, it could directly inherit vulnerabilities or be subject to malicious code injection during the build process due to the untrusted nature of the headers.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities or malicious code directly into the application, potentially leading to a wide range of security breaches, including data exfiltration, remote code execution, and complete application compromise.

**Affected Component:** The entire set of header files provided by the `ios-runtime-headers` repository.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise extreme caution when using third-party repositories like `ios-runtime-headers`.
*   Verify the integrity of the `ios-runtime-headers` repository and its releases by checking signatures or using other verification methods.
*   Use dependency management tools with integrity checking features to ensure the downloaded headers are the expected ones.
*   Consider using a forked and vetted version of the repository if security concerns are high, and regularly audit the forked version.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
