# Attack Surface Analysis for nst/ios-runtime-headers

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Compromise of `ios-runtime-headers`](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_compromise_of__ios-runtime-headers_.md)

*   **Description:** The `ios-runtime-headers` repository itself could be compromised, leading to the inclusion of malicious or vulnerable header files.
*   **How ios-runtime-headers Contributes:** By directly including these headers in the project's build process, the application becomes vulnerable to any malicious modifications within the repository.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor gains control of the repository and injects a header file that, when compiled, introduces a backdoor into the application.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially complete compromise of the application, including data theft, unauthorized access, and malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Verify the integrity of the repository source (e.g., using Git signatures).
        *   Pin specific commit hashes instead of relying on branches to ensure consistency.
        *   Regularly audit the included headers for unexpected changes.
        *   Consider using alternative, more officially maintained sources for header information if available and feasible.
    *   **Users:**  Indirectly, by developers implementing secure supply chain practices.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Private or Internal iOS APIs](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_private_or_internal_ios_apis.md)

*   **Description:** The headers might expose private or internal Apple APIs not intended for public use.
*   **How ios-runtime-headers Contributes:** This repository aims to provide access to a wide range of iOS runtime information, including potentially private APIs.
*   **Example:** Developers use a header exposing an internal API for accessing device identifiers in a way that bypasses standard privacy restrictions. This could be exploited by malware to track users without proper consent.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Application instability if Apple changes or removes these APIs.
    *   Security vulnerabilities if these APIs have undocumented weaknesses.
    *   Privacy violations by accessing data not intended for public access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Avoid using APIs marked as private or internal. Rely on documented and public APIs.
        *   Thoroughly research the purpose and implications of any unfamiliar header definitions.
        *   Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where private APIs might become unavailable.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential uses of private APIs.
    *   **Users:** Keep their iOS devices updated, as Apple may address vulnerabilities in private APIs.
