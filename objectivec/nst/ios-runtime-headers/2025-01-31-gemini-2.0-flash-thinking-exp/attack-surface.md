# Attack Surface Analysis for nst/ios-runtime-headers

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal iOS APIs and Structures](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_ios_apis_and_structures.md)

**Description:**  Applications using `ios-runtime-headers` gain access to internal, undocumented Objective-C runtime APIs and data structures. These APIs are not designed for public consumption and may contain hidden vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors.

**How ios-runtime-headers contributes:** The library directly provides the header files necessary to interact with these internal APIs, making them easily accessible to developers. Without `ios-runtime-headers`, accessing these APIs would be significantly more difficult, requiring significant reverse engineering effort.

**Example:**  Using an internal API to directly manipulate the memory layout of Objective-C objects. A vulnerability in this internal memory management API could be exploited by an attacker if the application relies on it, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact:**  Exploitation of vulnerabilities in internal APIs can lead to severe impacts:
*   **Memory Corruption:** Leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to functionalities or data that should be restricted, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the application or device.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Leaking sensitive internal data or application state, potentially exposing user data or application secrets.
*   **Denial of Service:** Causing the application to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting service availability.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**.  The potential for arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation through low-level runtime vulnerabilities makes this a critical risk.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Minimize Usage:**  Strictly avoid using internal APIs unless absolutely essential and there is no viable public SDK alternative.  Thoroughly justify each use case.
*   **Deep Understanding & Scrutiny:** If internal APIs are unavoidable, invest heavily in understanding their exact behavior, limitations, and security implications.  This requires reverse engineering, extensive testing, and careful analysis.
*   **Defensive Programming & Sandboxing:** Implement robust error handling, input validation, and security checks around all code interacting with internal APIs. Consider sandboxing or isolating components that use internal APIs to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Rigorous Security Audits:** Conduct frequent and in-depth security audits and code reviews specifically focusing on the usage of internal APIs. Engage security experts with experience in iOS internals and runtime security.
*   **Proactive Monitoring & Updates:**  Closely monitor iOS updates and security advisories for any changes that might affect internal APIs your application uses. Be prepared to rapidly adapt or remove reliance on these APIs if they change or are deprecated.

## Attack Surface: [Misuse of Runtime Manipulation Features](./attack_surfaces/misuse_of_runtime_manipulation_features.md)

**Description:** `ios-runtime-headers` facilitates the use of powerful Objective-C runtime features like method swizzling and dynamic method invocation.  Improper or insecure use of these features can introduce significant vulnerabilities that can be directly exploited.

**How ios-runtime-headers contributes:** The library provides the necessary headers and definitions to easily implement these runtime manipulations. This lowers the technical barrier to entry, potentially leading to misuse by developers who may not fully grasp the security implications.

**Example:**
*   **Method Swizzling Hijacking:**  Improperly implemented method swizzling, especially on security-sensitive system methods, can allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow. An attacker could exploit a race condition or logic flaw in the swizzling implementation to bypass authentication checks or inject malicious code into legitimate system processes.
*   **Unsafe Dynamic Method Invocation:**  Dynamically invoking methods based on untrusted or unsanitized user-controlled input. An attacker could craft malicious input to invoke unintended methods, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or bypassing critical security measures.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in runtime manipulation can directly lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
*   **Security Control Bypass:**  Circumventing intended security mechanisms, authentication, or authorization checks through manipulated runtime behavior.
*   **Data Tampering & Corruption:**  Modifying application data or state in unauthorized ways, leading to data integrity issues or application malfunction.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining elevated privileges or access to restricted functionalities by manipulating runtime behavior.

**Risk Severity:** **High**.  The potential for arbitrary code execution and security control bypass through misuse of runtime manipulation features constitutes a high security risk.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege & Necessity:**  Avoid using runtime manipulation features unless absolutely necessary and no safer alternative exists.  Question the necessity of each use case and explore alternative architectural or design patterns.
*   **Secure Swizzling & Dynamic Invocation Practices:** If runtime manipulation is unavoidable, implement it with extreme care and security in mind:
    *   **Strict Input Validation & Sanitization:**  For dynamic method invocation, rigorously validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks. Use whitelisting of allowed method names and input types.
    *   **Defensive Swizzling:** Implement method swizzling defensively, considering potential race conditions, re-entrancy issues, and unintended side effects. Minimize the scope of swizzling and ensure it is as localized and controlled as possible. Use synchronization mechanisms where necessary.
    *   **Security Code Reviews & Testing:**  Subject all code using runtime manipulation features to intense security code reviews and penetration testing. Focus specifically on identifying potential injection points, race conditions, and logic flaws in the runtime manipulation logic.
    *   **Runtime Security Monitoring:**  Consider implementing runtime security monitoring to detect and potentially mitigate attempts to exploit runtime manipulation vulnerabilities.
