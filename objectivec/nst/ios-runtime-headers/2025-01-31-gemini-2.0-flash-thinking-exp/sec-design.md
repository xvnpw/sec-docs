# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, 'ios-runtime-headers', aims to provide a publicly accessible repository of header files derived from the iOS runtime.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a valuable resource for iOS developers who need to interact with or understand the internal workings of the iOS runtime environment.
  - Facilitate research, development of developer tools, and deeper understanding of iOS internals within the developer community.
  - Contribute to the open-source ecosystem by making these resources freely available.

- Business Risks:
  - Misinterpretation or misuse of the provided headers could lead to unintended application behavior or instability in applications developed using these headers.
  - Potential for the headers to become outdated as iOS evolves, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates to maintain their accuracy and relevance.
  - Lack of official support or endorsement from Apple, meaning developers use these headers at their own risk and without any guarantees of compatibility or correctness.
  - Legal or ethical concerns if the headers are used to bypass security features or violate Apple's terms of service, although the headers themselves are likely derived from publicly accessible SDK components.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The 'ios-runtime-headers' project, being a repository of header files, has a limited security surface area compared to executable software projects. However, certain security considerations are still relevant.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Public GitHub repository. The project is hosted on GitHub, benefiting from GitHub's platform security features such as access controls, vulnerability scanning for the platform itself, and infrastructure security. Implemented by: GitHub platform.
  - security control: Open Source. The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the content. Implemented by: Project licensing and repository visibility.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for outdated or inaccurate headers. The headers are derived from iOS runtime, which evolves. There is a risk that the headers in the repository may not always be perfectly up-to-date with the latest iOS versions, potentially leading to inaccuracies or compatibility issues for users.
  - accepted risk: Misuse of headers by developers. Developers might use these headers in ways not intended or anticipated, potentially leading to application vulnerabilities or instability. This risk is inherent in providing access to low-level system interfaces.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Clearly defined license and usage guidelines. Explicitly state the terms of use, disclaimers, and limitations of the headers to mitigate potential misuse and legal risks. This should be documented in the repository (e.g., LICENSE and README files).
  - security control: Contribution guidelines and code review process for updates. If community contributions are accepted, establish guidelines for contributions and implement a review process to ensure the quality and integrity of header updates. Documented in: CONTRIBUTING.md file.
  - security control: Automated checks for header consistency and accuracy. Implement automated scripts or tools to verify the consistency and accuracy of the generated headers against official SDK components or runtime environments, to reduce the risk of outdated or incorrect headers. Implemented in: CI/CD pipeline (if any).

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable. The project is a public repository of header files; authentication is not a relevant security requirement for accessing or using the headers.
  - Authorization: Not applicable. Access to the repository is public; authorization is not a relevant security requirement.
  - Input Validation: Not applicable. The project primarily provides header files, which are output rather than input. Input validation is not directly applicable to the core function of the repository. However, if contribution mechanisms are in place, input validation would be relevant for contributions (e.g., ensuring file format and content integrity).
  - Cryptography: Not applicable. Cryptography is not a direct security requirement for a repository of header files. The headers themselves do not involve cryptographic operations.

# DESIGN

The 'ios-runtime-headers' project is fundamentally a data repository. Its design is centered around the organization, storage, and accessibility of iOS runtime header files.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing access to iOS runtime headers for the developer community. The primary process is the maintenance and availability of the header repository.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Data: iOS runtime header files.
  - Sensitivity: Publicly available information. Header files are derived from the publicly distributed iOS SDK. Sensitivity is considered low as these are intended for developer consumption and do not contain sensitive personal or proprietary business data. However, integrity and accuracy are important to maintain the value and trustworthiness of the repository.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended frequency of updates for the headers? Will they be updated with every new iOS release or SDK update?
  - Is there a specific process for verifying the accuracy and completeness of the headers after extraction?
  - Are there plans to expand the repository to include headers for other Apple platforms (macOS, watchOS, tvOS)?
  - Is community contribution to header updates welcomed, and if so, what is the contribution process?

- Assumptions:
  - The headers are derived from legitimate sources, such as the official iOS SDK, and are not obtained through reverse engineering or other potentially legally questionable methods.
  - The primary goal is to provide a helpful resource for the iOS developer community, and there is no malicious intent behind the project.
  - The maintainer(s) of the repository have sufficient knowledge of iOS development and the iOS runtime to ensure the headers are reasonably accurate and useful.
  - Users of the headers understand that they are using them at their own risk and are responsible for ensuring compliance with Apple's developer terms and conditions in their own projects.
