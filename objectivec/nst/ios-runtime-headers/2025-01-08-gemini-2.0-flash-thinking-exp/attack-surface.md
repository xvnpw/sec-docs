# Attack Surface Analysis for nst/ios-runtime-headers

## Attack Surface: [Enhanced Reverse Engineering and Static Analysis](./attack_surfaces/enhanced_reverse_engineering_and_static_analysis.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain a significant advantage in understanding the application's internal structure, logic, and data handling due to the availability of complete header files.
    * **How ios-runtime-headers Contributes:** Provides comprehensive definitions of classes, methods, protocols, and ivars, including private APIs and internal implementation details, making reverse engineering and static analysis significantly easier and faster.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses the headers to quickly identify the class responsible for handling user authentication and then analyzes its methods to find potential flaws in the authentication logic or password storage.
    * **Impact:**  Increased likelihood of discovering vulnerabilities, understanding proprietary algorithms, identifying sensitive data storage locations, and developing targeted exploits.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Code Obfuscation:** While headers are available, obfuscating the application's code can still make reverse engineering more challenging and time-consuming.
        * **String Encryption:** Encrypting sensitive strings and constants can hinder analysis even with header information.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Private APIs and Internal Implementation Details](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_private_apis_and_internal_implementation_details.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can leverage the knowledge of private APIs and internal workings of iOS frameworks to identify potential attack vectors or bypass security measures.
    * **How ios-runtime-headers Contributes:** Explicitly exposes the definitions and interfaces of private APIs and internal framework structures that are not intended for public use, providing attackers with insights into undocumented functionality.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses the headers to understand the parameters and expected behavior of a private API related to privilege escalation. They then craft a malicious input to exploit a flaw in that API, bypassing intended security checks.
    * **Impact:** Potential for exploiting vulnerabilities in underlying iOS frameworks, bypassing security mechanisms, and gaining unauthorized access or control.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Direct Use of Private APIs:**  While the headers expose them, avoid directly using private APIs in your application, as their behavior can change without notice and they may contain security vulnerabilities.
        * **Focus on Public Framework APIs:** Rely on well-documented and supported public APIs, which are generally more secure and stable.
