## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Headers (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_headers__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Goal:** Introduce malicious code disguised as legitimate iOS SDK headers within the `ios-runtime-headers` repository.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Add Backdoor Functionality (Subtle Code Injection):**
        *   **Description:** Introducing new methods, functions, or macros within the headers that, when the application is compiled, could introduce vulnerabilities or allow for malicious actions.
        *   **Impact:** Could lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious behavior in applications using the headers.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement rigorous code review processes, utilize static analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns in headers.
    *   **Modify Existing Headers to Inject Malicious Logic (Influencing Compilation):**
        *   **Description:** Altering existing method signatures, definitions, or macros in a way that causes unexpected and exploitable behavior when the application is built and run.
        *   **Impact:** Similar to adding backdoor functionality, this could lead to various vulnerabilities in consuming applications.
        *   **Mitigation:** Strict code review processes, automated checks for deviations from expected header structures.
    *   **Introduce Typosquatting/Similar Header Files:**
        *   **Description:** Creating files with names very similar to legitimate iOS SDK headers, hoping developers will make typos in their `#import` statements and include the malicious file.
        *   **Impact:** Could lead to the inclusion of malicious code in the application.
