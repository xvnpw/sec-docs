# Threat Model Analysis for nst/ios-runtime-headers

## Threat: [API Mismatch and Runtime Errors](./threats/api_mismatch_and_runtime_errors.md)

*   **Description:** The generated headers from `ios-runtime-headers` might not perfectly align with the specific iOS version the application is running on. This can lead to mismatches in function signatures, data structures, or the availability of certain APIs. While not a direct attack, the resulting instability can be exploited or lead to unintended behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, data corruption due to incorrect data interpretation, or denial of service directly resulting from the incorrect API interaction facilitated by the headers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Generated Header Files (inaccuracies or omissions directly from `ios-runtime-headers`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rigorous testing on all target iOS versions and devices to identify discrepancies caused by the headers.
        *   Implementing robust error handling and defensive programming practices to catch unexpected API behavior stemming from header inaccuracies.
        *   Using conditional compilation or runtime checks to handle differences between iOS versions *if* the header discrepancies necessitate it.
        *   Carefully documenting the specific iOS versions the application is tested against when using these headers.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Security Vulnerabilities in Private APIs](./threats/exploitation_of_security_vulnerabilities_in_private_apis.md)

*   **Description:** The `ios-runtime-headers` expose private APIs. An application uses one of these private APIs that contains an undiscovered security vulnerability within the iOS framework itself. An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability, accessed through the header definitions, to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or compromise the application and the device.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to device resources, remote code execution, or complete compromise of the application and potentially the device, directly enabled by the access provided through the headers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Usage of specific private APIs *exposed* by the generated headers from `ios-runtime-headers`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize reliance on private APIs exposed by `ios-runtime-headers`. Prioritize using public, well-vetted APIs.
        *   Stay informed about potential security advisories related to iOS and its frameworks, even though private APIs are less likely to be publicly documented.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization, even when interacting with seemingly "internal" APIs accessed via the headers.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when using these APIs, limiting the scope of their use.

## Threat: [Unexpected Behavior and Crashes Leading to Exploitation](./threats/unexpected_behavior_and_crashes_leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Reliance on undocumented or unstable APIs exposed by `ios-runtime-headers` can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. While not a direct attack, these crashes could leave the application in an insecure state, expose sensitive information in crash logs (potentially revealing details about the private API usage), or create opportunities for memory corruption or other vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, exposure of sensitive information related to the application's internal workings and potentially private API usage, potential for memory corruption or other exploitable conditions arising from the unstable API interactions facilitated by the headers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Usage of specific private APIs *exposed* by the generated headers from `ios-runtime-headers`, leading to unpredictable application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Extensive testing and monitoring in various scenarios to identify and address potential crashes and unexpected behavior caused by the use of APIs accessed through the headers.
        *   Robust error handling and crash reporting mechanisms that do not expose sensitive information about the private API usage.
        *   Consider using techniques like exception handling and safe memory management practices.

## Threat: [Bypassing Intended Security Mechanisms](./threats/bypassing_intended_security_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might use the exposed headers from `ios-runtime-headers` to access lower-level functionalities and potentially bypass intended security checks or sandboxing restrictions imposed by the operating system. An attacker might analyze the application to understand how these bypasses, enabled by the header access, work and exploit them.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to system resources, circumvention of security policies, directly facilitated by the access gained through the headers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific private APIs *exposed* by the generated headers from `ios-runtime-headers` used to circumvent security measures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using private APIs exposed by `ios-runtime-headers` to bypass intended security mechanisms.
        *   Prioritize using the standard, secure APIs provided by the official SDK.
        *   If bypassing is absolutely necessary (and this should be a rare exception), implement additional security controls and thoroughly document the rationale and potential risks.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Private API Access](./threats/data_leakage_through_private_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** A private API, made accessible through `ios-runtime-headers`, might provide access to sensitive user data or system information that is not intended for public access. If the application uses this API incorrectly or without proper safeguards, it could inadvertently leak this data. An attacker might target these specific API calls, now accessible due to the headers, to extract sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, privacy violations, potential regulatory compliance issues, directly resulting from the access granted by the headers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific private APIs *exposed* by the generated headers from `ios-runtime-headers` that provide access to sensitive data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when accessing data through private APIs exposed by `ios-runtime-headers`.
        *   Implement strict access controls and data sanitization measures for data accessed via these APIs.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest, especially if accessed through non-standard APIs.
        *   Regularly audit the application's use of private APIs for potential data leakage vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [App Store Rejection or Revocation](./threats/app_store_rejection_or_revocation.md)

*   **Description:** Apple has strict guidelines regarding the use of private APIs. An application using `ios-runtime-headers` and relying on the private APIs they expose is highly likely to be rejected during the App Store review process or have its existing version revoked. This is a direct consequence of using this library to access non-public APIs.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of distribution channel, negative impact on user base, wasted development effort directly attributable to the decision to use `ios-runtime-headers` for accessing private APIs.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire application's build and submission process due to the inclusion and use of headers from `ios-runtime-headers` for private API access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand and adhere to Apple's App Store guidelines regarding the use of private APIs.
        *   Avoid relying on private APIs exposed by `ios-runtime-headers` for core functionality.
        *   Have contingency plans in case the application is rejected or revoked due to private API usage facilitated by this library.
        *   Consider alternative approaches that do not involve private APIs.
