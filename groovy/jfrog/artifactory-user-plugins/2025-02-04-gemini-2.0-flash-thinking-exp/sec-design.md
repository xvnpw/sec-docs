# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Extend the functionality of JFrog Artifactory to meet diverse user needs and specific use cases.
 - Enable users to customize and adapt Artifactory to their unique workflows and environments.
 - Foster a vibrant ecosystem of extensions that enhance the value and versatility of Artifactory.
 - Provide a mechanism for users to automate tasks, integrate with other systems, and implement custom logic within Artifactory.

- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities introduced by user-developed plugins, potentially compromising the integrity and security of the Artifactory instance and its hosted artifacts.
 - Performance degradation of Artifactory due to poorly written or resource-intensive plugins, impacting overall system stability and responsiveness.
 - Compatibility issues and conflicts between different plugins or with future versions of Artifactory, leading to operational disruptions.
 - Lack of standardization and quality control in user-developed plugins, resulting in inconsistent user experiences and potential support challenges.
 - Risk of malicious plugins being introduced, either intentionally or unintentionally, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs) within Artifactory to manage user and group permissions, documented in Artifactory documentation.
 - security control: Authentication mechanisms provided by Artifactory to verify user identities, documented in Artifactory documentation.
 - security control: Secure communication channels (HTTPS) for accessing Artifactory and plugins, configured as part of Artifactory setup.
 - security control: Code review process for plugins submitted to the public repository (community driven, level of enforcement may vary).
 - security control: Plugin execution within the Artifactory JVM, leveraging Artifactory's security context (implementation details within Artifactory).

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in user-developed plugins due to the nature of community contributions and varying levels of security expertise among plugin developers.
 - accepted risk: Performance impact of plugins on Artifactory, requiring users to monitor and manage plugin resource consumption.
 - accepted risk: Compatibility issues between plugins and Artifactory versions, necessitating ongoing maintenance and updates by plugin developers.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community-driven security practices for plugin development, which may not be as rigorous as formal security audits.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated static code analysis (SAST) and dynamic code analysis (DAST) tools to scan plugins for potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
 - security control: Establish a plugin signing mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of plugins, ensuring they haven't been tampered with.
 - security control: Enforce plugin sandboxing or isolation to limit the impact of a compromised plugin on the overall Artifactory system.
 - security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of plugin activities to detect and respond to suspicious behavior.
 - security control: Provide secure coding guidelines and training for plugin developers to promote secure development practices.
 - security control: Establish a vulnerability reporting and response process for plugins, allowing users to report security issues and ensuring timely remediation.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - requirement: Plugins should operate within the authenticated user context of Artifactory, inheriting the user's permissions and roles.
  - requirement: Plugins should not introduce new authentication mechanisms that bypass or weaken Artifactory's authentication framework.
 - Authorization:
  - requirement: Plugins must respect and enforce Artifactory's authorization model, ensuring users can only access resources they are authorized to access.
  - requirement: Plugins should not grant users elevated privileges or bypass existing authorization controls.
 - Input Validation:
  - requirement: Plugins must validate all inputs received from users, external systems, or Artifactory APIs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
  - requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side (if applicable) and server-side within the plugin code.
 - Cryptography:
  - requirement: If plugins handle sensitive data or require cryptographic operations, they must use secure cryptographic libraries and follow best practices for key management and algorithm selection.
  - requirement: Plugins should avoid implementing custom cryptography and rely on well-vetted and established cryptographic libraries provided by the underlying platform or Artifactory.

- Build Process Description:
 - Developer writes plugin code and commits it to a Version Control System (e.g., GitHub).
 - A Build Automation system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes.
 - The Build Automation system performs a Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) scan on the plugin code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
 - The Build Automation system compiles and packages the plugin code into a deployable artifact (e.g., a JAR file).
 - The Plugin Artifact is then deployed to the Artifactory Instance, either manually or automatically.

- Build Process Security Controls:
 - security control: Version Control (GitHub) to track code changes and enable code review.
 - security control: Build Automation (CI/CD) to automate the build and deployment process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
 - security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the plugin code early in the development lifecycle.
 - security control: Code signing of the Plugin Artifact to ensure integrity and authenticity.
 - security control: Access control to the Build Automation system and artifact repository to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 - security control: Dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the plugin.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Artifact Management: Ensuring the secure and reliable storage, retrieval, and distribution of software artifacts.
 - Software Delivery Pipeline: Supporting the smooth and efficient flow of software releases through the organization.
 - Custom Automation within Artifactory: Enabling users to automate tasks and workflows related to artifact management and software delivery.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Artifacts: Software binaries, libraries, packages, and other digital assets stored in Artifactory. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the artifacts and may include proprietary software, intellectual property, and sensitive configuration data.
 - Metadata: Information about artifacts, such as version numbers, dependencies, and deployment history. Sensitivity is generally lower than artifacts but can still reveal valuable information.
 - Plugin Configurations: Settings and parameters for user plugins. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the configurations and may include API keys, credentials, or sensitive business logic.
 - Audit Logs: Records of user activities and system events within Artifactory and plugins. Sensitivity is moderate as logs can contain information about user behavior and potential security incidents.
