### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Credential Compromise of Authorized User [HIGH RISK PATH]

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown: Credential Compromise

The core of this attack path is the compromise of user credentials. Attackers can employ various techniques to achieve this:

*   **Phishing:**
    *   **Spear Phishing:** Targeted emails or messages disguised as legitimate communications (e.g., from Artifactory administrators, JFrog support, or colleagues) designed to trick the user into revealing their username and password. These emails might contain links to fake login pages that mimic the Artifactory login interface.
    *   **Whaling:**  Phishing attacks specifically targeting high-profile individuals within the organization who are likely to have plugin upload permissions.
*   **Password Reuse:**
    *   Users often reuse passwords across multiple online services. If a user's password is compromised on a less secure service (e.g., a breached website), attackers may attempt to use the same credentials to log in to Artifactory.
    *   Credential stuffing attacks automate this process, trying lists of compromised username/password pairs against Artifactory login pages.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:**
    *   While less likely to succeed against systems with strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms, brute-force attacks can still be attempted, especially if password policies are weak or account lockout is not properly configured.
    *   Distributed brute-force attacks can bypass rate limiting from a single IP address.
*   **Credential Stuffing Attacks:**
    *   Leveraging large databases of leaked credentials obtained from previous data breaches. Attackers automatically attempt these credentials against Artifactory login pages.
    *   These attacks are often successful due to password reuse and weak password practices.
*   **Keylogging/Malware:**
    *   If an attacker can install malware on a user's machine (e.g., through drive-by downloads, malicious email attachments, or social engineering), they can use keyloggers to capture keystrokes, including usernames and passwords entered for Artifactory.
*   **Social Engineering (Non-Phishing):**
    *   Directly contacting users (e.g., via phone or chat) and impersonating IT support or other authority figures to trick them into divulging their credentials.
*   **Insider Threat:**
    *   A malicious insider with legitimate access to user credentials (e.g., a disgruntled employee with administrative privileges) could intentionally compromise an authorized user's account.
*   **Weak Password Policies & Practices:**
    *   If Artifactory does not enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, password rotation), users may choose weak and easily guessable passwords, increasing the likelihood of compromise.
    *   Lack of user security awareness training can lead to poor password practices, such as writing down passwords or sharing them.

#### 4.2. Why High-Risk: Likelihood and Impact Assessment

*   **Medium Likelihood:**
    *   **Commonality of Credential Compromise Techniques:** Phishing, password reuse, and brute-force/credential stuffing are prevalent attack vectors used across various platforms and applications. Attackers have readily available tools and techniques for these attacks.
    *   **Human Factor:** Users are often the weakest link in security. Phishing attacks exploit human psychology, and password reuse is a common user behavior despite security recommendations.
    *   **External Threat Landscape:** The internet is rife with leaked credential databases, making credential stuffing attacks increasingly effective.
    *   **Artifactory Exposure:** Artifactory instances are often accessible from the internet, making them potential targets for automated attacks and opportunistic credential compromise attempts.
    *   **However, "Medium" is conditional:** The likelihood can be significantly reduced by implementing robust mitigation strategies (detailed below). Without these mitigations, the likelihood could be considered "High."

*   **High Impact:**
    *   **Direct Access to Plugin Upload Functionality:** Compromised credentials of an authorized user grant the attacker direct access to upload plugins. This bypasses standard security controls designed to prevent unauthorized code execution within Artifactory.
    *   **Malicious Plugin Deployment:**  A malicious plugin can be designed to perform a wide range of harmful actions, including:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data stored in Artifactory (artifacts, configurations, secrets).
        *   **System Compromise:**  Gaining control of the Artifactory server itself, potentially leading to wider infrastructure compromise.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Disrupting Artifactory services and availability.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Injecting malicious code into artifacts managed by Artifactory, impacting downstream consumers.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Artifactory or the underlying operating system to gain higher privileges.
        *   **Backdoor Installation:**  Establishing persistent access for future attacks.
    *   **Trust Relationship Exploitation:**  Plugins are often executed with elevated privileges within the Artifactory environment. A malicious plugin can abuse this trust relationship to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted.
    *   **Difficult Detection:**  Malicious plugins can be designed to be stealthy and evade detection, especially if they mimic legitimate plugin functionality or operate subtly.
    *   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack through a malicious plugin can severely damage the organization's reputation and trust with customers and partners.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Expanding on the initial list and providing more specific recommendations:

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies and Encourage Unique, Complex Passwords:**
    *   **Technical Implementation:**
        *   **Artifactory Configuration:** Configure Artifactory's security settings to enforce strong password policies:
            *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12-16 characters).
            *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
            *   Password history to prevent reuse of recent passwords.
            *   Password expiration and rotation policies (periodic password changes).
        *   **Integration with Identity Providers (IdP):** If using an external IdP (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, SAML, OAuth), leverage the IdP's password policies and ensure they are sufficiently strong.
    *   **User Education:**
        *   Provide clear guidelines and training to users on creating and managing strong, unique passwords.
        *   Emphasize the importance of not reusing passwords across different accounts.

            *   Login attempts from unusual locations or at unusual times.
            *   Rapid login attempts indicative of brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.
        *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System:** Integrate Artifactory logs with a SIEM system for centralized monitoring, alerting, and correlation of security events.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:**
        *   **Artifactory Configuration:** Configure Artifactory to implement rate limiting on login attempts to slow down brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.
        *   **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to temporarily disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. Ensure appropriate lockout durations and unlock mechanisms.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF in front of Artifactory to detect and block malicious login attempts, including credential stuffing attacks. WAFs can often identify patterns and anomalies associated with these attacks.
    *   **Threat Intelligence Feeds:**  Integrate threat intelligence feeds into security monitoring systems to identify known malicious IP addresses and patterns associated with credential compromise attempts.

*   **Implement Least Privilege Access Control:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Utilize Artifactory's RBAC features to grant plugin upload permissions only to users who absolutely require them. Avoid granting excessive privileges.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Regularly review and adjust user permissions as needed.
    *   **Separation of Duties:**  Consider separating plugin upload responsibilities from other administrative tasks to limit the potential impact of a single compromised account.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Vulnerability Assessments:**  Conduct regular vulnerability scans of the Artifactory system to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for credential compromise or plugin-related attacks.
