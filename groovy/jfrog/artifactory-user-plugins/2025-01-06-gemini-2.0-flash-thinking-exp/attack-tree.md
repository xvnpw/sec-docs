## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Plugin Upload (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_plugin_upload__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path represents the scenario where an attacker successfully uploads and executes a plugin specifically crafted for malicious purposes.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Upload Malicious Plugin:** This is the initial and crucial step where the attacker introduces their malicious code into the Artifactory environment.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws:
            *   Brute-force weak credentials of legitimate users with plugin upload permissions.
            *   Exploit known vulnerabilities in Artifactory's authentication mechanisms to bypass login.
            *   Perform session hijacking to gain access to an authenticated user's session.
        *   Exploit Plugin Upload Vulnerabilities:
            *   Bypass file type validation checks to upload disallowed file types containing malicious code.
            *   Exploit path traversal vulnerabilities in the upload process to place the malicious plugin in a sensitive location or overwrite an existing plugin.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Malicious Plugin Execution:** Once the malicious plugin is uploaded, the attacker needs to trigger its execution to carry out their intended actions.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Trigger Malicious Plugin Directly:
            *   Utilize exposed API endpoints provided by the plugin framework or Artifactory itself to directly invoke the malicious plugin.
            *   Exploit vulnerabilities in the plugin execution mechanism that allow for arbitrary plugin execution.
        *   Trigger Malicious Plugin Indirectly:
            *   Exploit vulnerabilities in other, seemingly legitimate, plugins to trigger the execution of the malicious plugin. This could involve manipulating data or calling functions within the malicious plugin.
            *   Manipulate data or events within Artifactory or the application environment that are designed to trigger certain plugins, causing the malicious plugin to be invoked unintentionally.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Existing Plugins (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_existing_plugins__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting security flaws present in plugins that are already installed within the Artifactory instance.

*   **Identify Vulnerable Plugin:** While not marked as critical, this is a necessary precursor. Attackers would use various methods to identify vulnerable plugins.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Identified Vulnerability:**  Once a vulnerable plugin is identified, the attacker attempts to leverage the specific flaw to compromise the system.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **CRITICAL NODE: Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most severe outcome, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Artifactory server.
            *   Inject malicious code through plugin parameters or data processing logic.
            *   Exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to execute code embedded in serialized data.
            *   Leverage insecure dependencies used by the plugin that contain known vulnerabilities.
        *   Path Traversal: Exploit vulnerabilities to access files and directories outside of the intended plugin scope, potentially reaching sensitive system files or application data.
        *   Information Disclosure: Exploit flaws to gain access to sensitive information stored within Artifactory, the application's environment, or the plugin's data.
        *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Force the Artifactory server to make requests to internal or external resources, potentially exposing internal services or performing actions on behalf of the server.
        *   Privilege Escalation within Artifactory: Exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges within the Artifactory instance, allowing for broader access and control.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Exploit flaws to cause the plugin or the entire Artifactory instance to crash or become unresponsive, disrupting service availability.
