# Threat Model Analysis for jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Malicious Plugin](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_malicious_plugin.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted plugin containing malicious code. Upon execution by the Artifactory plugin framework, this code runs with the privileges of the Artifactory process, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could involve installing backdoors, stealing sensitive data, or disrupting service.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Artifactory server, leading to data breaches, service outages, and potential lateral movement within the network.

**Affected Component:** Artifactory Plugin Execution Environment, Plugin API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for plugin parameters.
*   Utilize a secure coding review process for plugin development.
*   Employ a sandboxed environment for plugin execution to limit potential damage.
*   Regularly update Artifactory and the plugin framework.
*   Implement strong access controls for plugin upload and management.
*   Consider code signing for plugins to verify their origin and integrity.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Artifactory](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_artifactory.md)

**Description:** A plugin, even with initially limited privileges, exploits vulnerabilities in the Artifactory plugin API or the underlying system to gain higher privileges within the Artifactory application. This allows the plugin to access resources or perform actions it is not authorized for, such as modifying other users' permissions or accessing sensitive configuration.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive Artifactory data and functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Artifactory Plugin API, Plugin Execution Environment, Artifactory Security Model.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for plugin execution.
*   Thoroughly audit and secure the Artifactory Plugin API.
*   Implement robust authorization checks within the plugin framework.
*   Regularly review plugin permissions and access requirements.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) via Faulty Plugin](./threats/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service__via_faulty_plugin.md)

**Description:** A poorly written or intentionally malicious plugin consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the Artifactory server. This can lead to performance degradation for all users, or even a complete denial of service, making Artifactory unavailable.

**Impact:** Service disruption, impacting developers' ability to access and manage artifacts.

**Affected Component:** Artifactory Plugin Execution Environment, Server Resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement resource limits and quotas for plugin execution.
*   Monitor plugin resource consumption.
*   Provide guidelines and best practices for plugin development to avoid resource-intensive operations.
*   Implement a mechanism to quickly disable or terminate misbehaving plugins.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration through Malicious Plugin](./threats/data_exfiltration_through_malicious_plugin.md)

**Description:** A malicious plugin accesses sensitive data stored within Artifactory (artifacts, metadata, configuration, user credentials) and transmits it to an external attacker-controlled server. This could happen through network requests initiated by the plugin.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposing sensitive intellectual property, build secrets, or user information.

**Affected Component:** Artifactory Plugin Execution Environment, Network Access from Plugins.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict network access from plugins to only necessary destinations.
*   Implement monitoring for unusual network activity originating from plugin processes.
*   Enforce secure storage and access controls for sensitive data within Artifactory.
*   Educate developers on secure data handling practices within plugins.

## Threat: [Data Corruption or Manipulation by Flawed or Malicious Plugin](./threats/data_corruption_or_manipulation_by_flawed_or_malicious_plugin.md)

**Description:** A plugin, either due to a bug or malicious intent, modifies or deletes critical data within Artifactory, such as artifact metadata, access control lists, or configuration settings. This can lead to inconsistencies, build failures, or security compromises.

**Impact:** Loss of data integrity, potential build failures, and security vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Artifactory Data Storage, Plugin API (Data Modification Functions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust data validation and integrity checks within Artifactory.
*   Control and audit plugin access to data modification functions.
*   Implement versioning and backup mechanisms for critical data.
