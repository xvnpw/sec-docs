# Attack Surface Analysis for jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugin Upload and Deployment](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugin_upload_and_deployment.md)

* **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges uploads a plugin containing malicious code.
    * **How artifactory-user-plugins contributes:** The plugin mechanism allows execution of user-provided code within the Artifactory environment.
    * **Example:** An attacker uploads a plugin disguised as a utility that, upon deployment, installs a backdoor on the Artifactory server.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the Artifactory server, data breach, disruption of service, supply chain contamination if the server is used to distribute artifacts.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Implement strong authentication and authorization for plugin upload and deployment.
            * Implement strict input validation for plugin files and metadata.
            * Consider code signing for plugins to verify their origin and integrity.
        * **Users:**
            * Implement a rigorous review process for all plugins before deployment, including static and dynamic analysis.
            * Restrict plugin upload and deployment permissions to a limited set of trusted administrators.
            * Monitor plugin activity and resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Code Vulnerabilities (e.g., Injection Flaws)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_code_vulnerabilities__e_g___injection_flaws_.md)

* **Description:** Plugins developed by users contain security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or LDAP injection.
    * **How artifactory-user-plugins contributes:** The plugin mechanism executes arbitrary code, and if this code interacts with databases or external systems without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** A plugin that retrieves artifact information from a database is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to extract sensitive data.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to resources, potential for remote code execution on systems the plugin interacts with.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**
            * Follow secure coding practices (e.g., OWASP guidelines).
            * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
            * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection attacks.
            * Apply the principle of least privilege when accessing resources.
        * **Users:**
            * Provide developers with security training and resources.
            * Encourage or mandate security testing of plugins before deployment.
            * Implement a process for reporting and patching vulnerabilities in plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Execution Environment Escape](./attack_surfaces/plugin_execution_environment_escape.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability in the plugin execution environment allows a plugin to break out of its intended sandbox and gain access to the underlying system.
    * **How artifactory-user-plugins contributes:** The security of the plugin mechanism's isolation is critical; flaws can lead to privilege escalation.
    * **Example:** A plugin exploits a vulnerability in the Java Security Manager configuration used for plugin execution to execute arbitrary system commands.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the Artifactory server, access to sensitive data, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers (Artifactory Team):**
            * Implement robust sandboxing and isolation mechanisms for plugin execution.
            * Regularly audit and patch the plugin execution environment for vulnerabilities.
            * Consider using containerization or virtualization technologies for plugin isolation.
        * **Users:**
            * Stay updated with Artifactory releases and apply security patches promptly.
            * Monitor for unusual plugin behavior or resource consumption that might indicate an escape attempt.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Plugin APIs and Permissions](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_plugin_apis_and_permissions.md)

* **Description:** A malicious or vulnerable plugin abuses the APIs and permissions granted to it to perform unauthorized actions within Artifactory.
    * **How artifactory-user-plugins contributes:** Plugins are given specific permissions to interact with Artifactory's internal functionalities.
    * **Example:** A plugin with permission to manage repositories is compromised and used to delete or modify artifacts without authorization.
    * **Impact:** Data loss, corruption of repositories, disruption of build and deployment pipelines.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers (Artifactory Team):**
            * Implement a granular permission model for plugin APIs, allowing for fine-grained control.
            * Design APIs with security in mind, preventing unintended or malicious use.
            * Provide clear documentation on plugin API usage and security considerations.
        * **Users:**
            * Carefully review the permissions requested by plugins before deployment.
            * Grant plugins only the necessary permissions required for their functionality (principle of least privilege).
            * Regularly audit plugin permissions and usage.
