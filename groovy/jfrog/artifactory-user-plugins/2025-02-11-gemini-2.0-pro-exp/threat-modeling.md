# Threat Model Analysis for jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins

## Threat: [Unauthorized Repository Access via `Repositories` Interceptor](./threats/unauthorized_repository_access_via__repositories__interceptor.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Repository Access via `Repositories` Interceptor

    *   **Description:** A malicious or buggy plugin utilizes the `Repositories` interceptor (`org.artifactory.repo.Repositories`) to bypass Artifactory's access controls. The attacker could modify the `Repositories` object to grant themselves unauthorized read/write access to repositories. This is done by intercepting requests and altering effective permissions before Artifactory evaluates them.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive artifacts, potential data breaches, compromise of downstream systems. Attackers could download proprietary code, deploy malicious artifacts, or disrupt builds.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.artifactory.repo.Repositories` interceptor and related methods (e.g., `getRepository()`, `hasPermission()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Scrutinize plugins using the `Repositories` interceptor for logic that modifies permissions or bypasses checks.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the plugin's service user has minimal required permissions. Avoid broad repository access.
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize any user input influencing repository access.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable detailed Artifactory auditing; monitor for unusual repository access from plugins.
        *   **Permission Checks:** Within the plugin, re-check user permissions using Artifactory's security APIs *after* modifications to the `Repositories` object (defense-in-depth).

## Threat: [Artifact Tampering via `Storage` Interceptor](./threats/artifact_tampering_via__storage__interceptor.md)

*   **Threat:** Artifact Tampering via `Storage` Interceptor

    *   **Description:** An attacker's plugin uses the `Storage` interceptor (`org.artifactory.storage.StorageService`) to modify artifacts during upload/download. The attacker could intercept the artifact stream, inject malicious code, alter metadata, or replace the artifact. This involves manipulating the `InputStream` or `OutputStream` of the artifact.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised artifacts, leading to vulnerabilities in downstream systems. This could cause malware infections, data breaches, or instability. Altered metadata could cause build failures.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.artifactory.storage.StorageService` interceptor and related methods (e.g., `getInputStream()`, `getOutputStream()`, `storeItem()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review plugins using the `Storage` interceptor for code modifying artifact content/metadata.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Implement checksum verification (client and server-side) to detect modifications.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures to ensure artifact authenticity and integrity.
        *   **Immutable Artifacts:** Configure repositories to prevent modification/deletion of existing artifacts (where applicable).
        *   **Auditing:** Enable detailed Artifactory auditing; monitor for unusual storage operations by plugins.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via `Security` Interceptor](./threats/denial_of_service_via__security__interceptor.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via `Security` Interceptor

    *   **Description:** A malicious plugin uses the `Security` interceptor (`org.artifactory.security.SecurityService`) to cause a denial-of-service (DoS). The attacker could introduce delays, loops, or resource exhaustion within the interceptor, blocking authentication/authorization. A poorly written `authenticate()` method could consume excessive resources.
    *   **Impact:** Artifactory becomes unavailable, disrupting builds, deployments, and critical operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.artifactory.security.SecurityService` interceptor and related methods (e.g., `authenticate()`, `authorize()`, `getUser()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Review plugins using the `Security` interceptor for performance bottlenecks/resource exhaustion.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement strict timeouts for operations within the interceptor.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for the plugin's environment, if possible.
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking critical Artifactory threads.
        *   **Load Testing:** Test the plugin under heavy load to identify DoS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Consider rate limiting for plugin operations to prevent abuse.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Custom REST APIs](./threats/information_disclosure_via_custom_rest_apis.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Custom REST APIs

    *   **Description:** A plugin exposes a custom REST API endpoint that leaks sensitive information due to improper error handling, logging of sensitive data, or exposing internal Artifactory data. Attackers could access this endpoint to get credentials, API keys, configuration details, or user info.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, leading to unauthorized access, breaches, or further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom REST API endpoints within the plugin (using JAX-RS or similar).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure REST API development guidelines (input validation, output encoding, error handling).
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication/authorization for all custom API endpoints.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize data returned by the API to avoid exposing sensitive information.
        *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:** Do not log passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing of custom API endpoints.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `UserPluginService` Misuse](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__userpluginservice__misuse.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via `UserPluginService` Misuse

    *   **Description:** A plugin incorrectly uses the `UserPluginService` (`org.artifactory.plugin.PluginService`) to execute code with elevated privileges.  An attacker could exploit a vulnerability to gain access to the `PluginService` and call internal Artifactory methods or access restricted resources. This might involve exploiting how the plugin handles input or interacts with other components.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could gain administrative Artifactory access, modifying configurations, deleting data, or compromising the system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.artifactory.plugin.PluginService` and any internal Artifactory APIs accessed through it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the plugin's service user has minimal required permissions.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review plugin code interacting with `PluginService` for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate user input influencing the plugin's behavior, especially with `PluginService`.
        *   **Avoid Direct API Calls:** Use higher-level Artifactory APIs instead of directly calling internal methods via `PluginService`.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running plugins in a sandboxed environment to limit access to Artifactory.

## Threat: [Command Injection via External Process Execution](./threats/command_injection_via_external_process_execution.md)

* **Threat:** Command Injection via External Process Execution

    * **Description:** A plugin executes external commands/scripts without proper sanitization of user input. An attacker could inject malicious commands, leading to arbitrary code execution on the Artifactory server. This is especially dangerous with functions like `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` using unsanitized input.
    * **Impact:** Complete system compromise; the attacker executes code with the Artifactory service account's privileges. This leads to data theft, system destruction, or use of the server for further attacks.
    * **Affected Component:** Plugin code executing external commands/scripts (e.g., `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, `ProcessBuilder`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid External Processes:** If possible, avoid external commands. Use Artifactory's APIs or libraries.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If unavoidable, rigorously validate and sanitize all user input. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Parameterized Commands:** Use parameterized commands or APIs that prevent command injection (e.g., `ProcessBuilder` with separate arguments).
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Artifactory service with the least privilege necessary.
        * **Code Review:** Thoroughly review code executing external processes for command injection vulnerabilities.
