Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Information Disclosure via Custom REST APIs" threat for Artifactory user plugins.

## Deep Analysis: Information Disclosure via Custom REST APIs in Artifactory User Plugins

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Information Disclosure via Custom REST APIs" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities that could lead to this threat manifesting, explore potential attack vectors, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level ones already listed in the threat model.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to prevent this vulnerability.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on custom REST API endpoints implemented within Artifactory user plugins using the `artifactory-user-plugins` framework.  It covers:

*   **Code-level vulnerabilities:**  Examining common coding errors that can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Configuration-related vulnerabilities:**  Identifying misconfigurations within the plugin or Artifactory itself that could exacerbate the risk.
*   **Interaction with Artifactory internals:**  Analyzing how the plugin interacts with Artifactory's internal data and APIs, and potential risks associated with this interaction.
*   **Authentication and Authorization bypass:** Exploring ways attackers might bypass intended security controls.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Deep dive into how improper error handling and logging practices can lead to information disclosure.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the core Artifactory platform itself (outside the scope of user plugins).
*   Generic web application vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) that are not specific to the REST API context of Artifactory plugins.  (Although these are still important and should be addressed separately).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the plugin, *unless* those libraries are directly related to REST API handling or data serialization.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Example-Based):**  We will analyze hypothetical code snippets and, where possible, examine real-world examples (anonymized and generalized) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Threat Modeling (Attack Vector Analysis):**  We will systematically explore potential attack vectors that an attacker might use to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
3.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare the identified vulnerabilities against established secure coding best practices for REST APIs and Java development.
4.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review the Artifactory user plugin documentation and relevant JAX-RS documentation to identify potential areas of concern.
5.  **OWASP Top 10 and CWE Mapping:** We will map identified vulnerabilities to relevant OWASP Top 10 categories and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries to provide standardized references.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

#### 2.1. Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors

Let's break down the "Information Disclosure" threat into specific, actionable vulnerabilities and how an attacker might exploit them:

**A. Improper Error Handling (CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information, CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions)**

*   **Vulnerability:**  A custom REST API endpoint throws an exception that includes sensitive information in the error message returned to the client.  This could include stack traces, database connection strings, internal file paths, or even portions of sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker sends a malformed request (e.g., invalid input, unexpected data type) to the custom API endpoint.
    2.  The plugin code fails to handle the input properly and throws an exception.
    3.  The exception handler (or lack thereof) returns a detailed error message to the attacker, revealing sensitive information.
*   **Example (Hypothetical Groovy Code):**

    ```groovy
    @GET
    @Path("/myendpoint")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    Response myEndpoint(@QueryParam("id") String id) {
        try {
            def result = repositories.getRepository('my-repo').getFileInfo("/path/to/file/" + id)
            return Response.ok(result).build()
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // BAD:  Returns the full exception message to the client.
            return Response.status(500).entity("Error: " + e.getMessage()).build()
        }
    }
    ```
    If `id` is crafted to cause an error (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`), the error message might reveal the file path or other system information.

**B.  Logging of Sensitive Data (CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File)**

*   **Vulnerability:** The plugin logs sensitive information (passwords, API keys, request bodies containing sensitive data, etc.) to Artifactory's log files.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker triggers an action in the plugin that causes sensitive data to be logged.  This might be a normal operation or a deliberately crafted malicious request.
    2.  The attacker gains access to the Artifactory log files (e.g., through a separate vulnerability, misconfigured access controls, or social engineering).
    3.  The attacker extracts the sensitive information from the logs.
*   **Example (Hypothetical Groovy Code):**

    ```groovy
    @POST
    @Path("/config")
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    Response updateConfig(Map config) {
        // BAD: Logs the entire configuration, which might contain secrets.
        log.info("Received configuration update: " + config)
        // ... process the configuration ...
        return Response.ok().build()
    }
    ```

**C.  Exposure of Internal Artifactory Data (CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)**

*   **Vulnerability:** The plugin directly exposes internal Artifactory data or metadata through the REST API without proper sanitization or authorization checks.  This could include repository configurations, user details, or internal API endpoints.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker sends a request to the custom API endpoint designed to retrieve internal data.
    2.  The plugin code accesses the requested data from Artifactory's internal APIs or data structures.
    3.  The plugin returns the data to the attacker without proper filtering or validation.
*   **Example (Hypothetical Groovy Code):**

    ```groovy
    @GET
    @Path("/users")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    Response getAllUsers() {
        // BAD:  Directly exposes all user details, potentially including passwords or API keys.
        return Response.ok(security.getAllUsers()).build()
    }
    ```

**D.  Authentication/Authorization Bypass (CWE-287: Improper Authentication, CWE-862: Missing Authorization)**

*   **Vulnerability:** The custom API endpoint lacks proper authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthenticated or unauthorized users to access sensitive information.  This could be due to a missing `@RolesAllowed` annotation, incorrect role mapping, or a failure to validate user tokens.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker sends a request to the custom API endpoint without providing any authentication credentials or with invalid credentials.
    2.  The plugin code fails to verify the user's identity or permissions.
    3.  The plugin processes the request and returns sensitive information.
*   **Example (Hypothetical Groovy Code):**

    ```groovy
    @GET
    @Path("/admin/data")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    // BAD: Missing @RolesAllowed annotation, allowing any user to access this endpoint.
    Response getAdminData() {
        // ... retrieve sensitive admin data ...
        return Response.ok(sensitiveData).build()
    }
    ```

**E.  Data Sanitization Failure (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation, CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output)**

*   **Vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or encode data returned by the API, potentially exposing sensitive information that should have been masked or removed.  This could include internal IDs, database keys, or other data that could be used for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker sends a request to the custom API endpoint.
    2.  The plugin retrieves data from Artifactory or another source.
    3.  The plugin returns the data to the attacker without removing or masking sensitive fields.
*   **Example (Hypothetical Groovy Code):**

    ```groovy
    @GET
    @Path("/artifact/{path:.+}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    Response getArtifactInfo(@PathParam("path") String path) {
        FileInfo fileInfo = repositories.getFileInfo(path)
        // BAD: Returns the full FileInfo object, which might contain internal metadata.
        return Response.ok(fileInfo).build()
    }
    ```
    The `FileInfo` object might contain properties like `downloadUri`, `repo`, `path`, `createdBy`, `modifiedBy`, `size`, etc. Some of these, especially `createdBy` and `modifiedBy` if they contain usernames, or internal paths, could be considered sensitive.

#### 2.2. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Now, let's expand on the mitigation strategies with concrete examples and best practices:

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**

    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate *all* input received from the client, including path parameters, query parameters, request headers, and request bodies. Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good values) whenever possible.  Use regular expressions, data type checks, and length limits.
        ```groovy
        @GET
        @Path("/search")
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        Response search(@QueryParam("query") String query) {
            // Validate that the query parameter is not empty and has a maximum length.
            if (query == null || query.isEmpty() || query.length() > 255) {
                return Response.status(400).entity("Invalid query parameter").build()
            }
            // ... perform the search ...
        }
        ```
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Ensure that all data returned by the API is properly encoded for the intended output format (e.g., JSON, XML).  Use a well-established JSON library (like Jackson or Gson) to handle serialization and prevent injection vulnerabilities.  Avoid manually constructing JSON strings.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Implement a centralized error handling mechanism that catches all exceptions and returns generic error messages to the client.  Log detailed error information (including stack traces) *separately* in a secure location, but *never* include sensitive information in the error message returned to the client.
        ```groovy
        @Provider
        class GenericExceptionMapper implements ExceptionMapper<Throwable> {
            @Override
            Response toResponse(Throwable exception) {
                log.error("An unexpected error occurred", exception) // Log the full exception
                return Response.status(500).entity("An internal server error occurred").build() // Generic response
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the plugin code only has the minimum necessary permissions to access Artifactory resources.  Avoid using administrative accounts or granting excessive privileges.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**

    *   **Use Artifactory's Built-in Authentication:** Leverage Artifactory's existing authentication mechanisms (e.g., user accounts, API keys, OAuth) whenever possible.  Do not implement custom authentication schemes.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Use `@RolesAllowed` annotations (or equivalent mechanisms) to restrict access to API endpoints based on user roles.  Define granular roles with the minimum necessary permissions.
        ```groovy
        @GET
        @Path("/admin/settings")
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        @RolesAllowed("admin") // Only users with the "admin" role can access this endpoint.
        Response getAdminSettings() {
            // ...
        }
        ```
    *   **Token Validation:** If using custom tokens, validate the token's signature, expiration time, and issuer.

*   **Data Sanitization:**

    *   **Create Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):**  Define specific DTO classes to represent the data returned by the API.  Only include the fields that are necessary and safe to expose to the client.  Avoid returning entire Artifactory objects (like `FileInfo` or `User`).
        ```groovy
        class ArtifactSummary {
            String name
            String path
            long size
        }

        @GET
        @Path("/artifact/{path:.+}")
        @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
        Response getArtifactInfo(@PathParam("path") String path) {
            FileInfo fileInfo = repositories.getFileInfo(path)
            ArtifactSummary summary = new ArtifactSummary(
                name: fileInfo.name,
                path: fileInfo.path,
                size: fileInfo.size
            )
            return Response.ok(summary).build()
        }
        ```
    *   **Mask Sensitive Data:**  If you must return sensitive data (e.g., partial credit card numbers), mask or redact the sensitive portions.

*   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**

    *   **Use a Logging Framework:**  Use a proper logging framework (like SLF4J) and configure it appropriately.
    *   **Filter Sensitive Data:**  Implement logging filters or appenders to automatically remove or mask sensitive data before it is written to the logs.  Consider using regular expressions to identify and replace sensitive patterns.
    *   **Review Log Configuration:**  Regularly review your logging configuration to ensure that sensitive data is not being logged inadvertently.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**

    *   **Static Code Analysis:**  Use static code analysis tools (like SonarQube, FindBugs, or Fortify) to automatically identify potential security vulnerabilities in your plugin code.
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Use DAST tools (like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Acunetix) to scan your running Artifactory instance and identify vulnerabilities in your custom API endpoints.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools.
    * **Dependency check:** Use tools like `OWASP Dependency-Check` to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
