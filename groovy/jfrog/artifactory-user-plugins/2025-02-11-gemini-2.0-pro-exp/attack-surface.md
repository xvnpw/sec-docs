# Attack Surface Analysis for jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/code_injection.md)

*Description:* Attackers inject malicious code into the application, often through user inputs or external data sources.
*Artifactory User Plugins Contribution:* Plugins are *primary* vectors for code injection.  They provide numerous entry points if they handle user input, interact with external systems, or use dynamic code evaluation (e.g., Groovy scripts) without proper sanitization and validation.  This is a *direct* consequence of using plugins.
*Example:* A plugin that allows users to specify a Groovy script to be executed as part of a build process could be exploited to run arbitrary code on the Artifactory server.
*Impact:* Remote code execution, data breaches, complete system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation for *all* data received by the plugin, using whitelists (allow lists) whenever possible.  Reject any non-conforming input.
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Safe API Usage:** Use secure APIs for interacting with external systems and *avoid* functions that execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Evaluation:** *Minimize or eliminate* the use of dynamic code evaluation (e.g., `eval()` in Groovy). If absolutely necessary, use a *heavily restricted* sandbox environment with *minimal* privileges.  This is often very difficult to do securely.
    *   **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode all output generated by the plugin to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*Description:* Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
*Artifactory User Plugins Contribution:* Plugins that implement *custom* authentication or authorization logic *directly* introduce the risk of flaws.  This is a core risk of extending Artifactory's security model.
*Example:* A plugin designed to grant access based on a custom, improperly validated, JWT token could allow attackers to forge tokens and gain unauthorized access.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to repositories, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Leverage Artifactory's Built-in Mechanisms:** *Prioritize* using Artifactory's built-in authentication and authorization.  Avoid custom logic unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** If custom logic is required, follow *strict* secure coding practices for authentication and authorization. Use strong, well-vetted cryptographic libraries. Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular, *independent* security audits of the plugin's authentication and authorization logic.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test the plugin's security mechanisms, including *extensive* negative testing (attempting to bypass the controls).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*Artifactory User Plugins Contribution:* Plugins *directly* introduce the risk of dependency vulnerabilities because they are likely to use external libraries (JAR files).  This is inherent to plugin development.
*Example:* A plugin uses an outdated version of Apache Commons Collections with a known deserialization vulnerability.
*Impact:* Remote code execution, data breaches, system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to *automatically* scan plugin dependencies for known vulnerabilities *before deployment and continuously*.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Establish a *strict* process for keeping all plugin dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Automate this as much as possible.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for newly discovered vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.  Use vulnerability databases and alerting services.
    *   **Minimal Dependencies:** Minimize the number of external dependencies to reduce the attack surface.  Carefully evaluate the necessity of each dependency.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Plugin Deployment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_plugin_deployment.md)

*Description:* The process of deploying plugins is not secure.
*Artifactory User Plugins Contribution:* This is *directly* related to how plugins are managed and deployed.  The plugin mechanism itself creates this risk.
*Example:* An attacker with limited access to the Artifactory server uploads a malicious plugin to the `$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/plugins` directory.
*Impact:* Remote code execution, system compromise, data breaches.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Implement a *mandatory* and *rigorous* process for vetting and approving plugins *before* deployment. This *must* include code reviews, security testing, and verification of the plugin's source and developer.
    *   **Code Signing:** Use code signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of plugins.  Reject any unsigned or invalidly signed plugins.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** *Strictly* restrict access to the plugin directory (`$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/plugins`) to *only* authorized users and processes.  Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Automated Deployment:** Use automated deployment tools and pipelines to ensure that plugins are deployed consistently and securely.  Avoid manual deployments.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the deployed plugins to ensure that they haven't been tampered with.
