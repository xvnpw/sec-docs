# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom Security Manager (Plugin-Specific Policies)](./mitigation_strategies/custom_security_manager__plugin-specific_policies_.md)

1.  **Policy File Creation:** Create individual policy files (e.g., `plugin_name.policy`) for *each* user plugin within a designated directory (e.g., `$ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/security/plugins/`).  This is the core of the plugin-specific mitigation.
2.  **Granular Permission Definition:** Within each policy file, define highly specific permissions using Java's Security Manager syntax.  These permissions should be the absolute minimum required for the plugin to function.  Examples (and crucial denials):
    *   `permission java.io.FilePermission "/opt/artifactory/data/plugins/myplugin/data/*", "read,write";` (Allows read/write access *only* to the plugin's data directory).
    *   `permission java.net.SocketPermission "localhost:8081", "connect,resolve";` (Allows connecting *only* to Artifactory's internal API on localhost â€“ if needed.  Consider if network access is truly required).
    *   `permission java.util.PropertyPermission "plugin.myplugin.*", "read";` (Allows reading *only* properties prefixed with `plugin.myplugin.`).
    *   **Crucially, explicitly *deny* all other permissions.**  The policy file should *not* contain `permission java.security.AllPermission;`.  Instead, rely on the default-deny behavior of the Security Manager.
    *   Deny `java.lang.RuntimePermission "createClassLoader";` to prevent the plugin from loading arbitrary classes.
    *   Deny `java.lang.RuntimePermission "exitVM";` to prevent the plugin from shutting down Artifactory.
    *   Deny `java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";` to prevent the plugin from bypassing security checks via reflection.
    *   Carefully consider and restrict `java.lang.Thread` permissions to prevent the plugin from creating uncontrolled threads.
3.  **Artifactory Configuration:** Configure Artifactory to use the custom Security Manager and point it to the policy directory. This typically involves modifying the `artifactory.system.properties` file:
    *   `java.security.manager=default` (Enables the Security Manager).
    *   `java.security.policy==/opt/artifactory/etc/security/plugins/plugin_policy_loader.policy` (Points to a *loader* policy file).
4.  **Loader Policy:** Create a `plugin_policy_loader.policy` file that grants permission *only* to read files in the plugin policy directory.  This acts as a bootstrap and should be extremely restrictive. Example: `permission java.io.FilePermission "/opt/artifactory/etc/security/plugins/*", "read";`
5.  **Testing (Plugin-Specific):** Thoroughly test *each* plugin *individually* with its specific Security Manager policy enabled.  Monitor the Artifactory logs for `java.security.AccessControlException` errors, which indicate permission violations.  Adjust the policy file iteratively until the plugin functions correctly with the minimum necessary permissions.
6. **Regular Review:** Regularly review and update the security policies to adapt to changes in the plugins or the Artifactory environment.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (High Severity):** Prevents a malicious plugin from executing arbitrary system commands *outside* the allowed, highly restricted set.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Prevents a plugin from reading sensitive data outside its designated, explicitly permitted area.
*   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents a plugin from modifying files or data outside its explicitly permitted area.
*   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Limits a plugin's ability to consume excessive resources by restricting access to system resources.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents a plugin from gaining higher privileges within the Artifactory JVM by restricting access to sensitive APIs and operations.
*   **Network Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Restricts a plugin's ability to connect to arbitrary network hosts, allowing only explicitly permitted connections.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with correct implementation).
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Network Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. A basic Security Manager is enabled, but it uses a single, overly permissive policy file for all plugins. Granular, plugin-specific policies are *not* in place. The loader policy is implemented.

**Missing Implementation:** Plugin-specific policy files are missing. The current policy file grants `AllPermission` to all plugins, effectively disabling the Security Manager's protective capabilities. Regular policy review process is not defined.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced Plugin Logging (Within the Plugin Code)](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_plugin_logging__within_the_plugin_code_.md)

1.  **Code Modification:** Within the *plugin code itself*, add comprehensive logging statements to record all significant actions. This is *not* about general Artifactory logging, but logging *within* the plugin's Groovy code.
2.  **Log Key Events:**
    *   **Artifactory API Calls:** Log every call made to the Artifactory API, including the method called, parameters passed, and the result.  Use the `org.artifactory.api.*` interfaces to interact with Artifactory and log these interactions.
    *   **File System Access:** Log every file system read, write, or delete operation, including the full file path.
    *   **Network Connections:** Log any network connections initiated by the plugin, including the destination address, port, and protocol.
    *   **User Context:** If the plugin action is triggered by a user, log the username.
    *   **Error Handling:** Log all exceptions and errors, including stack traces (but be careful not to log sensitive information within error messages).
3.  **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) within the plugin.  This makes it easier to parse and analyze the logs later.  You can use a logging library like Logback or SLF4J within the plugin (carefully managing dependencies). Example (Groovy):
    ```groovy
    import groovy.json.JsonOutput
    import org.slf4j.Logger
    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory

    Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger("myplugin")

    def logEvent(String eventType, Map details) {
        def logData = [
            timestamp: new Date().format("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ"),
            eventType: eventType,
            details: details
        ]
        log.info(JsonOutput.toJson(logData))
    }

    // Example usage:
    logEvent("fileAccess", [path: "/path/to/file", operation: "read"])
    ```
4.  **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) to categorize log messages.
5. **Security Manager Violations:** Log any attempts by the plugin to violate the Security Manager policy.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Provides detailed visibility into data access patterns *from within the plugin*, aiding in the detection of unauthorized data retrieval.
*   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Logs file modifications performed *by the plugin*, allowing for detection and investigation of unauthorized changes.
*   **Malicious Activity (Variable Severity):** Creates a detailed audit trail of *plugin actions*, facilitating the detection and investigation of any malicious behavior originating from the plugin.
*   **Compromised Plugin Detection (High Severity):** Anomalous behavior logged *by the plugin itself* can be a strong indicator of compromise.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk remains High, but detection capability is significantly improved (specifically for actions *initiated by the plugin*).
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk remains High, but detection capability is significantly improved (specifically for actions *initiated by the plugin*).
*   **Malicious Activity:** Risk remains Variable, but detection and investigation capabilities are significantly improved.
*   **Compromised Plugin Detection:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (with effective log analysis and alerting).

**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.  Plugins currently rely on Artifactory's default logging, which is insufficient for detailed plugin activity tracking.

**Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive logging statements need to be added *within the code of each plugin*.  A structured logging format should be adopted.
