# Attack Surface Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection in Job Definitions/Script Executions](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_in_job_definitionsscript_executions.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject arbitrary commands into job definitions or scripts that Rundeck executes on the server or target nodes.

**Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's core functionality involves executing commands and scripts defined by users. This inherently creates a risk if input validation is insufficient.

**Example:** A user with job creation privileges crafts a workflow step that includes a command like `rm -rf /` within a script or as a direct command execution.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Rundeck server and potentially the target nodes, data loss, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data within job definitions and script executions.
* Use parameterized commands or secure command execution libraries where possible.
* Enforce least privilege for the user accounts under which Rundeck executes jobs.
* Consider using Rundeck's built-in script security features and sandboxing capabilities.
* Regularly review and audit job definitions for suspicious commands.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Node Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_node_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain access to the credentials Rundeck uses to connect to and execute commands on managed nodes.

**Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck stores credentials for accessing target nodes. If this storage is insecure or access controls are weak, credentials can be compromised.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to Rundeck's configuration files or database where node credentials are stored (potentially in plain text or weakly encrypted).

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed nodes, potential for lateral movement within the infrastructure, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Store node credentials securely using Rundeck's built-in credential providers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Key Storage).
* Avoid storing credentials directly in job definitions or configuration files.
* Implement strong access controls for Rundeck's credential storage.
* Regularly rotate node credentials.
* Utilize key-based authentication (SSH keys) instead of passwords where possible.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise.md)

**Description:** Rundeck's API keys, used for authentication, are exposed or stolen.

**Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck relies on API keys for programmatic access to its functionalities. Compromising these keys grants unauthorized control over Rundeck.

**Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public code repository, intercepted during network communication, or obtained through social engineering.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Rundeck's API, allowing attackers to create, modify, or execute jobs, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Treat API keys as highly sensitive secrets.
* Store API keys securely and avoid embedding them directly in code.
* Utilize environment variables or secure secret management solutions for storing API keys.
* Implement API key rotation policies.
* Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
* Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms for the API where feasible (e.g., OAuth 2.0).

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization Controls](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_controls.md)

**Description:**  Users are granted more permissions within Rundeck than necessary, allowing them to perform actions beyond their intended scope.

**Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's role-based access control (RBAC) system needs careful configuration. Misconfigured permissions can lead to privilege escalation.

**Example:** A developer is granted administrator privileges for a specific project but uses this access to modify system-level settings or access other projects.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, potential for data breaches, ability to disrupt Rundeck operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions in Rundeck.
* Regularly review and audit user permissions and role assignments.
* Utilize Rundeck's project-based access control to isolate resources and restrict access.
* Enforce separation of duties where appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Rundeck's Data Store](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_rundeck's_data_store.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as credentials or API keys, is stored insecurely within Rundeck's database or configuration files.

**Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck stores various configuration data, including potentially sensitive information. If this storage is not adequately protected, it becomes an attack target.

**Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Rundeck database and finds node credentials stored in plain text.

**Impact:** Compromise of node credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data, leading to broader infrastructure compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Utilize Rundeck's built-in credential providers for storing sensitive credentials.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the Rundeck database and configuration files.
* Implement strong access controls for the Rundeck database and configuration files.
* Regularly review and audit the security of Rundeck's data storage.
