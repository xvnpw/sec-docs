# Threat Model Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Threat: [Command Injection via Job Definitions](./threats/command_injection_via_job_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with privileges to create or modify Rundeck job definitions could inject malicious commands into script steps, inline scripts, or node filters. Upon execution, Rundeck would execute these commands on the Rundeck server or target nodes with the privileges of the Rundeck user or the specified execution context.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Rundeck server or target nodes, including data breach, system takeover, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Job Definition Subsystem, Execution Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls for job creation and modification.
    *   Regularly review job definitions for suspicious commands.
    *   Utilize secure execution modes (e.g., using script plugins with input validation).
    *   Avoid directly passing user-supplied data into command arguments.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for job options.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Job Execution Context](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_job_execution_context.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with permission to execute certain jobs could leverage misconfigured or overly permissive execution contexts to gain higher privileges on target nodes. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in scripts executed by Rundeck or abusing sudo configurations *managed through Rundeck*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access and control over target systems, potentially leading to data breaches or system disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Execution Engine, Node Executor Plugins
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring job execution contexts *within Rundeck*.
    *   Thoroughly vet and sanitize scripts executed by Rundeck.
    *   Implement robust access controls on target nodes, even for Rundeck's execution user.
    *   Regularly review and audit sudo configurations *related to Rundeck execution*.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gaining access to the Rundeck server's filesystem or database could potentially retrieve stored credentials used for connecting to target nodes or other systems *managed by Rundeck*. This could include password strings, SSH keys, or API tokens if not properly secured *within Rundeck's storage mechanisms*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to connected systems and services, potentially leading to data breaches or further compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Credential Management Subsystem, Key Storage Providers
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Rundeck's built-in Key Storage with appropriate access controls.
    *   Integrate with external secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) *supported by Rundeck*.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within Rundeck's data store.
    *   Limit access to the Rundeck server's filesystem and database.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Weak Authentication or Authorization](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_weak_authentication_or_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weak or default credentials, or vulnerabilities in Rundeck's authentication or authorization mechanisms, to gain unauthorized access to the Rundeck web interface or API.
*   **Impact:** Ability to view sensitive information, execute arbitrary jobs, modify configurations, and potentially compromise connected systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Modules, Authorization Framework, Web UI, API
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication.
    *   Disable or change default credentials immediately after installation.
    *   Implement granular access control policies based on the principle of least privilege *within Rundeck*.
    *   Regularly review and audit user permissions and roles *in Rundeck*.
    *   Keep Rundeck updated to patch known authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [API Abuse and Unauthorized Automation](./threats/api_abuse_and_unauthorized_automation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gaining access to valid Rundeck API tokens or exploiting vulnerabilities in the API could automate malicious actions, such as triggering jobs, accessing sensitive data, or modifying configurations without proper authorization.
*   **Impact:** Similar to unauthorized web UI access, potentially leading to data breaches, system disruption, or further compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** API, Authentication Modules, Authorization Framework
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store and manage API tokens *generated by Rundeck*.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for API access.
    *   Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse.
    *   Thoroughly validate API inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation or Exploitation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation_or_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with administrative privileges could install malicious plugins that introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into the Rundeck system. Alternatively, vulnerabilities in installed plugins could be exploited to compromise the Rundeck server.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Rundeck server, potentially leading to data breaches or further attacks on connected systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Plugin Management Subsystem, Loaded Plugins
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
    *   Review plugin code before installation if possible.
    *   Keep plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement restrictions on plugin installation if possible.
