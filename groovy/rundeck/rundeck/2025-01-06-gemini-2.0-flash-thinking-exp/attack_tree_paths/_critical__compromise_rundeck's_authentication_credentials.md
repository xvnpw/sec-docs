## Deep Analysis of Rundeck Authentication Credential Compromise Attack Tree Path

This analysis delves into the provided attack tree path focusing on compromising Rundeck's authentication credentials. We will examine each stage, identify potential vulnerabilities, and recommend mitigation strategies for the development team.

**Overall Goal:** The ultimate goal of this attack path is to gain unauthorized access to the Rundeck application by compromising either API keys or user account credentials. This access could then be used for malicious purposes such as:

* **Executing arbitrary commands on managed nodes.**
* **Modifying job definitions and schedules.**
* **Accessing sensitive data managed by Rundeck.**
* **Disrupting Rundeck operations.**
* **Using Rundeck as a pivot point to attack other systems.**

**Let's break down each stage of the attack tree path:**

**[CRITICAL] Compromise Rundeck's Authentication Credentials**

* **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker. Successful compromise here grants them significant control over the Rundeck instance and potentially the infrastructure it manages.
* **Impact:**  Complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Rundeck system and potentially connected infrastructure.
* **Mitigation Focus:** Implement robust security measures across all potential attack vectors to prevent credential compromise.

**[CRITICAL] Steal API Keys**

* **Description:** API keys provide programmatic access to Rundeck. Compromising these keys allows attackers to bypass traditional user authentication and interact with the Rundeck API directly.
* **Impact:** Similar to compromising user accounts, attackers can perform actions authorized by the compromised API key. This can be particularly dangerous if the key has broad permissions.
* **Mitigation Focus:** Secure storage, secure transmission, and strict access control for API keys.

    * **Identify Locations Where API Keys are Stored or Transmitted:**
        * **Description:**  Attackers need to find where API keys reside or are exchanged to steal them.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Scanning configuration files, environment variables, and code for patterns resembling API keys:** Attackers will look for common variable names (e.g., `RUNDECK_API_KEY`, `API_TOKEN`), file extensions (e.g., `.env`, `.properties`), and string patterns associated with API keys.
            * **Monitoring network traffic for API key transmission:**  If API keys are transmitted without proper encryption (e.g., over HTTP instead of HTTPS), attackers can intercept them using network sniffing tools.
        * **Vulnerabilities:**
            * **Hardcoded API keys in code or configuration files.**
            * **Storing API keys in easily accessible environment variables.**
            * **Lack of HTTPS enforcement for API communication.**
            * **Logging API keys in application logs.**
            * **Storing API keys in version control systems (especially public repositories).**
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Implement secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage API keys.**
            * **Avoid storing API keys directly in code or configuration files.**
            * **Use environment variables securely, ensuring they are not exposed in logs or easily accessible.**
            * **Enforce HTTPS for all Rundeck API communication.**
            * **Implement robust logging practices that sanitize sensitive information like API keys.**
            * **Regularly scan code repositories and configuration files for accidentally committed secrets using tools like `git-secrets` or similar.**
            * **Educate developers on secure secret management practices.**

    * **Steal Valid API Keys:**
        * **Description:** Once the location or transmission method is identified, the attacker attempts to extract the API key.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Using discovered storage locations or interception methods to obtain valid API keys:** This directly follows the previous step. If an API key is found in a configuration file, the attacker simply needs to access that file. If intercepted over the network, they will capture the transmitted key.
        * **Vulnerabilities:**
            * **Insufficient access controls on systems where API keys are stored.**
            * **Lack of encryption for stored API keys.**
            * **Weak network security allowing interception of traffic.**
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Implement strict access control policies on systems and directories where configuration files or environment variables containing API keys might reside.**
            * **Encrypt API keys at rest using appropriate encryption mechanisms.**
            * **Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict unauthorized network access and prevent traffic interception.**
            * **Use TLS/SSL certificates for all Rundeck communication.**
            * **Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious network activity.**

**[CRITICAL] Compromise User Accounts**

* **Description:**  Compromising user accounts grants access to Rundeck through the standard login mechanism. This allows attackers to operate with the permissions of the compromised user.
* **Impact:**  Attackers can perform actions authorized for the compromised user, potentially leading to significant damage depending on the user's roles and permissions.
* **Mitigation Focus:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms, robust password policies, and protection against common credential compromise techniques.

    * **Exploit Weak Password Policies or Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication:**
        * **Description:** Attackers target accounts with easily guessable passwords or where an extra layer of security (MFA) is absent.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Using common passwords or easily guessable variations:** Attackers utilize lists of common passwords or try variations based on personal information.
            * **Bypassing or circumventing the lack of multi-factor authentication:** If MFA is not enabled, attackers only need a valid username and password.
        * **Vulnerabilities:**
            * **Default or weak password policies.**
            * **Lack of enforcement of password complexity requirements.**
            * **No account lockout mechanism after multiple failed login attempts.**
            * **Absence of multi-factor authentication.**
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Enforce strong password policies:** Mandate minimum password length, complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and regular password changes.
            * **Implement account lockout policies:** Temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
            * **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):**  Require users to provide an additional verification factor (e.g., time-based one-time password, security key) beyond their password. This significantly increases the difficulty of unauthorized access.
            * **Integrate with identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, SAML) that enforce strong password policies and MFA.**
            * **Educate users about the importance of strong, unique passwords and the risks of password reuse.**

    * **Gain Access to Valid User Credentials:**
        * **Description:**  This is the culmination of the user account compromise attempts.
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Successfully using brute-forced, phished, or otherwise obtained credentials to log in to Rundeck:** This leverages the weaknesses exploited in the previous steps.
        * **Vulnerabilities:**  All the vulnerabilities mentioned in the previous steps contribute to the success of this attack vector.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Address all the mitigation strategies mentioned in the previous steps.**
            * **Implement security monitoring and alerting:** Detect unusual login patterns or failed login attempts that might indicate a brute-force or credential stuffing attack.
            * **Implement rate limiting on login attempts:**  Slow down the rate at which login attempts can be made from a single IP address to mitigate brute-force attacks.
            * **Regularly review user accounts and permissions:** Ensure that users only have the necessary access and remove inactive accounts.

**General Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Adopt a Security-First Mindset:** Integrate security considerations into every stage of the development lifecycle.
* **Implement Least Privilege:** Grant users and API keys only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the Rundeck deployment.
* **Keep Rundeck and Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Apply security patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Implement Robust Logging and Monitoring:**  Track user activity, API calls, and system events to detect suspicious behavior.
* **Incident Response Plan:**  Have a plan in place to respond effectively to security incidents.
* **Security Training for Developers:**  Educate developers on common security threats and secure coding practices.
