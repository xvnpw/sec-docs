# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular ACL Policies (Rundeck-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/granular_acl_policies__rundeck-specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Granular ACL Policies (Rundeck-Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Roles:** Define distinct roles within your organization that interact with *Rundeck* (e.g., "Database Operator," "Application Deployer," "System Monitor").  Focus on *Rundeck* actions.
        2.  **Define Permissions (Rundeck-Specific):** For each role, meticulously list the *minimum* necessary permissions *within Rundeck*.  Consider:
            *   `read`: View job definitions, node information, and logs *within Rundeck*.
            *   `run`: Execute specific jobs *within Rundeck*.
            *   `create`: Create new jobs (usually restricted to specific projects *within Rundeck*).
            *   `update`: Modify existing jobs (usually restricted to specific projects *within Rundeck*).
            *   `delete`: Delete jobs (highly restricted *within Rundeck*).
            *   `admin`: System-level administrative access to *Rundeck* (extremely restricted).
            *   Node access: Specific nodes or node filters (using *Rundeck's* tags, attributes).
            *   Project access: Specific *Rundeck* projects.
            *   Key Storage access: Specific keys or key paths *within Rundeck's Key Storage*.
        3.  **Create ACL Policies (Rundeck YAML/XML):** Translate the role-permission mappings into *Rundeck ACL policy files* (YAML or XML).  Use *Rundeck groups* to manage users with the same permissions.
        4.  **Assign Users to Groups (Rundeck UI/API):** Assign users to the appropriate *Rundeck groups* based on their roles.
        5.  **Regular Review (Rundeck-Focused):** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of *Rundeck ACL policies* and user assignments.  Adjust as roles and responsibilities change *within the context of Rundeck*.
        6.  **Audit Changes (Rundeck Audit Logs):** Track all changes to *Rundeck ACL policies* (ideally through a version control system, and monitor *Rundeck's audit logs*).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Job Execution (High Severity):** Prevents users from running jobs they shouldn't *within Rundeck*, limiting the potential damage.
        *   **Unauthorized Node Access (High Severity):** Prevents users from executing commands on nodes they shouldn't *via Rundeck*, reducing risk.
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (High Severity):** Prevents users from modifying *Rundeck's* job definitions, node configurations, or system settings.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents users from gaining access to higher-level *Rundeck* privileges.
        *   **Data Leakage (Medium Severity):** Limits access to sensitive information (e.g., *Rundeck's* logs, job output) to authorized users.

    *   **Impact:** (Same as before, but focused on the *Rundeck* context)
        *   **Unauthorized Job Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 90%).
        *   **Unauthorized Node Access:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 90%).
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 90%).
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 90%).
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., 60%).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic *Rundeck* ACL policies are in place for the "Production" and "Development" projects.  Users are assigned to *Rundeck* groups. Node access is partially restricted based on project *within Rundeck*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   *Rundeck* ACL policies are not granular enough. They grant broad `run` access within projects.
        *   Node access restrictions are not consistently enforced across all *Rundeck* projects.
        *   *Rundeck's* Key Storage access is not explicitly controlled via ACLs.
        *   Regular review process is not formalized *for Rundeck ACLs*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Credential Management (Rundeck Key Storage)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_credential_management__rundeck_key_storage_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Credential Management (Rundeck Key Storage)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Secrets:** List all sensitive data used by *Rundeck jobs*.
        2.  **Choose Key Storage Backend (Rundeck Configuration):** Select a secure Key Storage backend supported by *Rundeck* (e.g., database with encryption at rest, HashiCorp Vault - *via Rundeck's integration*).
        3.  **Configure Key Storage (rundeck-config.properties):** Configure the chosen backend in *Rundeck's configuration files*.
        4.  **Store Secrets (Rundeck UI/API):** Store all identified secrets in *Rundeck's Key Storage*, using descriptive paths and appropriate encryption settings.
        5.  **Reference Secrets in Jobs (Rundeck Syntax):** Modify job definitions to reference secrets from *Rundeck's Key Storage* using the `${key.path}` syntax.
        6.  **Restrict Access (Rundeck ACLs):** Use *Rundeck ACL policies* to restrict access to *Key Storage entries*, granting only the minimum necessary permissions.
        7.  **Rotate Keys (Backend-Specific, Managed via Rundeck):** Regularly rotate the encryption keys used by the Key Storage backend (this may be managed *through Rundeck's interface* if using an integrated secrets manager).
        8.  **Audit Access (Rundeck/Backend Logs):** Monitor access to *Rundeck's Key Storage* entries (if supported by the backend and accessible *through Rundeck*).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Credential Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents secrets from being exposed in *Rundeck's* job definitions, scripts, logs, or the *Rundeck* database.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to External Systems (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining access to external systems by stealing credentials *managed by Rundeck*.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** If using a secure Key Storage backend with encryption in transit *configured through Rundeck*, reduces risk.

    *   **Impact:** (Same as before, but focused on the *Rundeck* context)
        *   **Credential Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 95%).
        *   **Unauthorized Access to External Systems:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., 95%).
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk moderately reduced (e.g., 50%).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   *Rundeck's* built-in Key Storage is used for some secrets.
        *   Secrets are referenced in jobs using *Rundeck's* `${key.path}` syntax.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Not all secrets are stored in *Rundeck's* Key Storage.
        *   *Rundeck* ACL policies are not used to restrict access to *Key Storage entries*.
        *   Key rotation is not performed regularly *through Rundeck*.
        *   Integration with an external secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) *via Rundeck* is not implemented.

        5. **Plugin Security (Rundeck Plugin Management):**
            * Carefully vet any third-party *Rundeck plugins* before installing them *via Rundeck's plugin management interface*.
            * Ensure plugins are from trusted sources and are regularly updated *through Rundeck*.
        6. **Workflow Strategy (Rundeck Job Configuration):** Choose the appropriate workflow strategy ("node-first" or "step-first") *within Rundeck job definitions* to minimize the impact of compromised nodes.
        7. **Execution Mode (Rundeck Job Configuration):** Be mindful of the execution mode (local vs. remote) *within Rundeck job definitions*. Secure remote execution (e.g., using SSH with key-based authentication *configured within Rundeck*).
