# BUSINESS POSTURE

Rundeck is an open-source project that provides a web-based interface and a set of tools to automate operational tasks across a set of nodes. It allows users to run commands, scripts, and jobs on remote servers, and provides features like access control, scheduling, logging, and workflow management. Given its nature, the business posture can be inferred as follows:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable operational efficiency by automating routine tasks.
*   Provide a centralized platform for managing and executing operational procedures.
*   Reduce human error and improve consistency in operations.
*   Facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among operations teams.
*   Improve visibility and auditability of operational activities.
*   Support infrastructure management across diverse environments.

Business Risks:

*   Unauthorized access to Rundeck could lead to unauthorized execution of commands and jobs on managed nodes, potentially causing significant damage or data breaches.
*   Compromise of Rundeck or its underlying infrastructure could expose sensitive operational data, including credentials, configurations, and logs.
*   Misconfiguration or misuse of Rundeck could lead to unintended execution of commands or jobs, resulting in system instability or data loss.
*   Lack of proper access control and auditing could hinder compliance efforts and make it difficult to track down the source of operational issues.
*   Vulnerabilities in Rundeck or its dependencies could be exploited by attackers to gain control of managed systems.
*   Reliance on community support (for the open-source version) may lead to delays in addressing critical security issues or implementing necessary features.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (from the provided GitHub repository and general knowledge of the project):

*   security control: Authentication: Rundeck supports multiple authentication methods, including username/password, LDAP, and Active Directory. (Mentioned in documentation and source code)
*   security control: Authorization: Rundeck provides role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user permissions and limit access to specific projects, jobs, and nodes. (Mentioned in documentation and source code)
*   security control: Audit Logging: Rundeck logs user activity, including job executions, configuration changes, and authentication events. (Mentioned in documentation and source code)
*   security control: Encryption: Rundeck supports HTTPS for secure communication between the web interface and the server. Data at rest encryption depends on the underlying database and storage configuration. (Mentioned in documentation)
*   security control: Input Validation: Rundeck performs input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. (Inferred from source code and security best practices)
*   security control: API Security: Rundeck API uses tokens for authentication. (Mentioned in documentation)
*   accepted risk: Community-supported security updates: While the Rundeck community actively addresses security issues, there is no guaranteed response time for vulnerability fixes in the open-source version.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in secrets management: Rundeck relies on external tools or plugins for secure storage and management of sensitive credentials.
*   accepted risk: Security of custom scripts and commands: Rundeck executes user-provided scripts and commands, which may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code if not properly reviewed and secured.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust secrets management solution to securely store and manage credentials used by Rundeck.
*   Regularly review and update Rundeck and its dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect Rundeck from common web attacks.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Rundeck users, especially those with administrative privileges.
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate Rundeck and its managed nodes from other systems.
*   Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a robust monitoring and alerting system to detect and respond to suspicious activity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong password policies.
    *   Integration with existing enterprise identity providers (e.g., SAML, OAuth).
    *   Option for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and responsibilities.
    *   Ability to restrict access to specific projects, jobs, nodes, and actions.
    *   Support for least privilege principle.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
    *   Sanitization of user-provided data before displaying it in the web interface.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong encryption algorithms for secure communication (HTTPS).
    *   Secure storage of sensitive data, including credentials and API keys.
    *   Support for data at rest encryption.

2.  GitHub Actions workflows are triggered by commits or pull requests.
3.  The workflows perform the following steps:
    *   Checkout the code.
    *   Set up the build environment (Java, Gradle).
    *   Run unit and integration tests.
    *   Perform static code analysis using linters and code quality tools (Checkstyle, SpotBugs).
    *   Build the Rundeck WAR file and other artifacts (RPM, DEB, Docker image).
    *   Publish the artifacts to appropriate repositories (e.g., Maven Central, Docker Hub).

*   What is the expected scale of the Rundeck deployment (number of users, nodes, jobs)?
*   Are there any specific security concerns or requirements from the operations team or other stakeholders?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities discovered in Rundeck or its dependencies?
*   What external systems or services does Rundeck integrate with, and what are the security implications of those integrations?
*   What is the expected level of support and maintenance for the Rundeck deployment?
*   Are there any plans to use Rundeck in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)? If so, what are the specific security considerations for that environment?
*   What is the process for managing secrets and credentials used by Rundeck?
*   What kind of monitoring and alerting capabilities are in place for the Rundeck deployment?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization has a moderate risk appetite and prioritizes operational efficiency and security.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has basic security controls in place, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security patching.
*   DESIGN: Rundeck will be deployed in a secure environment with appropriate network segmentation and access controls. The database will be properly secured and backed up. The organization will follow security best practices for managing Rundeck and its managed nodes.
