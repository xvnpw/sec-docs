Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Authentication and Authorization Failures" attack surface for a Rundeck-based application, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Authentication and Authorization Failures in Rundeck

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, analyze, and propose mitigations for vulnerabilities related to authentication and authorization failures within a Rundeck deployment.  This goes beyond a general overview and delves into specific attack vectors, Rundeck-specific configurations, and practical security measures.  The ultimate goal is to harden the Rundeck instance against unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the authentication and authorization mechanisms *provided and managed by Rundeck itself*.  This includes:

*   **Rundeck's built-in user management:**  Local user accounts, password policies, and account lockout features.
*   **Rundeck's integration with external authentication providers:** LDAP, Active Directory, and other supported methods *as configured within Rundeck*.
*   **Rundeck's Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  The policies that define which users and groups can access which resources (projects, jobs, nodes, etc.) *within Rundeck*.
*   **Rundeck's role-based access control (RBAC):** The mapping of users to roles and the permissions associated with those roles *within Rundeck*.
*   **Rundeck's API authentication:** How API tokens and other authentication methods are handled *by Rundeck*.
* **Rundeck's session management:** How the application handles user sessions.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Network-level security (firewalls, intrusion detection systems) *unless they directly interact with Rundeck's authentication*.
*   Operating system security of the Rundeck server *except where misconfigurations directly impact Rundeck's authentication*.
*   Security of systems managed *by* Rundeck (target nodes) *except where Rundeck's authentication is used to access them*.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:** Identify specific attack scenarios related to authentication and authorization failures in Rundeck.
2.  **Configuration Review:** Analyze common Rundeck configuration settings and identify potential weaknesses.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** Research known vulnerabilities in Rundeck related to authentication and authorization.
4.  **Best Practices Review:**  Compare the identified weaknesses against established security best practices for Rundeck and general authentication/authorization principles.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified risks, prioritizing those with the highest impact and feasibility.
6.  **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest testing strategies to validate the effectiveness of the mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 2.1 Threat Modeling (Specific Attack Scenarios)

Here are some specific attack scenarios, building upon the initial description:

*   **Scenario 1: Brute-Force Attack on Local User Account:** An attacker attempts to guess the password of a local Rundeck user account by repeatedly submitting login attempts.  Rundeck's default configuration (if not hardened) might not have sufficient rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms.
*   **Scenario 2: Credential Stuffing Attack:** An attacker uses a list of compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from a data breach) to attempt to gain access to Rundeck accounts.  This is particularly effective if users reuse passwords across multiple services.
*   **Scenario 3: Weak Default Admin Password:**  The default `admin` account is not disabled or its password is not changed after installation, allowing an attacker to gain immediate administrative access.
*   **Scenario 4: LDAP Injection:** If Rundeck is integrated with LDAP, an attacker might attempt to inject malicious LDAP queries to bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access.  This exploits vulnerabilities in how Rundeck handles LDAP input.
*   **Scenario 5: ACL Misconfiguration (Overly Permissive):**  An ACL policy is too broad, granting a low-privileged user access to projects, jobs, or nodes they should not be able to access.  For example, a user in the "developers" group might be able to execute jobs on production servers.
*   **Scenario 6: ACL Misconfiguration (Logic Flaw):**  A subtle flaw in the ACL logic allows a user to perform actions they are not explicitly granted.  This could be due to an error in how Rundeck interprets the ACL rules.
*   **Scenario 7: Insecure API Token Management:**  API tokens are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text in scripts or configuration files) or are not properly revoked when a user leaves the organization.  An attacker who obtains an API token can bypass the web interface and directly interact with the Rundeck API.
*   **Scenario 8: Session Hijacking:** An attacker intercepts a valid user session (e.g., through a cross-site scripting vulnerability or network sniffing) and impersonates the user. This could be due to weak session management practices in Rundeck, such as predictable session IDs or lack of HTTPS enforcement.
*   **Scenario 9: Authentication Bypass via Plugin Vulnerability:** A vulnerability in a third-party Rundeck plugin (especially authentication-related plugins) allows an attacker to bypass the standard authentication process.
*   **Scenario 10: Privilege Escalation via Job Definition:** A user with limited job creation privileges crafts a malicious job definition that exploits a vulnerability in Rundeck or a connected system to gain elevated privileges. This leverages the user's *authorized* access to job creation to achieve *unauthorized* code execution.
* **Scenario 11: Weak Password Reset Mechanism:** The password reset functionality in Rundeck is vulnerable, allowing an attacker to reset a user's password without proper authorization (e.g., through predictable security questions or weak email verification).
* **Scenario 12: Insufficient Audit Logging:** Rundeck's audit logging for authentication and authorization events is inadequate, making it difficult to detect and investigate security incidents.

### 2.2 Configuration Review (Potential Weaknesses)

*   **`rundeck-config.properties`:**
    *   `rundeck.security.useHMacRequestTokens=false`:  Disables HMAC request tokens, making the API more vulnerable to replay attacks.
    *   `rundeck.security.apiCookieAccess.enabled=true`: Allows API access via cookies, which can be more vulnerable to certain attacks than API tokens.
    *   Weak or default settings for LDAP/AD integration (e.g., insecure connection strings, lack of TLS).
    *   Absence of configuration for rate limiting or account lockout.
*   **`jaas-loginmodule.conf`:** Misconfiguration of JAAS modules can lead to authentication bypasses or weaknesses.
*   **ACL Policy Files (`.aclpolicy`):**
    *   Overly permissive `by:` clauses (e.g., granting access to `group: *`).
    *   Incorrectly defined `context:` clauses (e.g., granting access to the wrong project or environment).
    *   Use of `allow: [read, run]` when only `read` is necessary.
    *   Lack of regular review and updates to ACL policies.
*   **Role Definitions:**  Roles with excessive permissions assigned.
*   **User Accounts:**  Presence of unused or default accounts.

### 2.3 Vulnerability Analysis (Known Vulnerabilities)

*   **CVE Research:** Regularly search the CVE database (e.g., [https://cve.mitre.org/](https://cve.mitre.org/)) for vulnerabilities related to "Rundeck" and "authentication" or "authorization."  Pay close attention to the affected versions and the vulnerability details.
*   **Rundeck Security Advisories:** Monitor the official Rundeck website and GitHub repository for security advisories and patches.
*   **Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities:**  If using third-party plugins, research their security history and known vulnerabilities.

### 2.4 Best Practices Review

*   **OWASP Top 10:**  Review the OWASP Top 10 web application security risks, paying particular attention to those related to authentication and authorization (e.g., Broken Authentication, Broken Access Control).
*   **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**  Consult NIST guidelines and best practices for access control and identity management.
*   **CIS Benchmarks:**  If available, use CIS Benchmarks for the underlying operating system and any related technologies (e.g., LDAP servers).

### 2.5 Mitigation Recommendations (Specific and Actionable)

1.  **Disable Default Admin Account:** Immediately after installation, create a new administrative user with a strong, unique password and MFA enabled.  Then, *disable* the default `admin` account.  Do not simply rename it.
2.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Configure Rundeck to enforce strong password policies for local users:
    *   Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters).
    *   Complexity requirements (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password history (prevent reuse of recent passwords).
    *   Regular password expiration (e.g., every 90 days).
3.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA for *all* Rundeck users, especially those with administrative privileges.  Rundeck supports various MFA methods; choose one that is appropriate for your environment.
4.  **Implement Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:** Configure Rundeck (or a reverse proxy in front of Rundeck) to:
    *   Limit the number of failed login attempts within a specific time period.
    *   Temporarily lock out accounts after a certain number of failed attempts.
    *   Implement CAPTCHA or other challenges to deter automated attacks.
5.  **Secure LDAP/AD Integration:** If using LDAP or Active Directory:
    *   Use secure connection protocols (e.g., LDAPS, StartTLS).
    *   Validate server certificates.
    *   Use strong credentials for the Rundeck service account that connects to the directory service.
    *   Regularly update the Rundeck integration components.
    *   Sanitize and validate all input from LDAP to prevent LDAP injection attacks.
6.  **Principle of Least Privilege (ACLs and Roles):**
    *   Carefully design ACL policies to grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit ACL policies and user roles.
    *   Use the `by:` clause to restrict access based on group membership or specific usernames.
    *   Use the `context:` clause to limit access to specific projects, jobs, and nodes.
    *   Avoid using overly broad wildcards (e.g., `*`) in ACL policies.
    *   Use a "deny-by-default" approach: explicitly grant access only where needed.
7.  **Secure API Token Management:**
    *   Generate unique API tokens for each user and application.
    *   Store API tokens securely (e.g., using a secrets management system).
    *   Revoke API tokens when users leave the organization or when tokens are compromised.
    *   Use short-lived API tokens whenever possible.
    *   Enable HMAC request tokens (`rundeck.security.useHMacRequestTokens=true`).
    *   Disable API access via cookies if not absolutely necessary (`rundeck.security.apiCookieAccess.enabled=false`).
8.  **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure that all communication with the Rundeck server is encrypted using HTTPS.  Disable HTTP access.
9.  **Session Management:**
    *   Use strong, randomly generated session IDs.
    *   Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.
    *   Implement session timeouts.
    *   Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against session hijacking attacks.
10. **Regularly Update Rundeck and Plugins:** Keep Rundeck and all installed plugins up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.
11. **Audit Logging:** Enable detailed audit logging for authentication and authorization events.  Regularly review the audit logs to detect suspicious activity.  Consider integrating Rundeck's logs with a centralized logging and monitoring system (e.g., SIEM).
12. **Password Reset Security:** Implement a secure password reset mechanism that requires strong verification (e.g., multi-factor authentication, email verification with short-lived tokens).
13. **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., LDAP injection, command injection).

### 2.6 Testing Recommendations

1.  **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing of the Rundeck instance, focusing on authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.
2.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in Rundeck and its dependencies.
3.  **Automated Security Testing:** Integrate security testing into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities during development.
4.  **ACL Policy Testing:** Create test cases to verify that ACL policies are working as expected.  Test both positive cases (allowed access) and negative cases (denied access).
5.  **Brute-Force and Credential Stuffing Testing:** Simulate brute-force and credential stuffing attacks to test the effectiveness of rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
6.  **Session Management Testing:** Test for session hijacking vulnerabilities, such as predictable session IDs and lack of HTTPS enforcement.
7.  **API Token Testing:** Test the security of API token management, including token generation, storage, and revocation.
8. **Fuzz testing:** Use fuzz testing techniques to test input validation.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the "Authentication and Authorization Failures" attack surface in Rundeck. By implementing the recommended mitigations and regularly testing the security of the system, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Remember to prioritize mitigations based on your specific environment and risk assessment.
