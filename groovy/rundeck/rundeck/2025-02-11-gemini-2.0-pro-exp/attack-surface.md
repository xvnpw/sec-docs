# Attack Surface Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Failures](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_failures.md)

*Description:* Weaknesses in how Rundeck authenticates users and authorizes their actions.
*Rundeck Contribution:* Rundeck provides its own authentication mechanisms (local users, LDAP, Active Directory integration) and authorization controls (roles, ACLs).  Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in these *Rundeck-provided* components create the attack surface.
*Example:* An attacker uses a default or easily guessed password to gain administrative access to the Rundeck web interface.  Alternatively, a flaw in Rundeck's ACL logic allows a low-privileged user to execute a job they shouldn't have access to.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of the Rundeck server and potentially all connected nodes.  Ability to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and disrupt operations.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce complex passwords, minimum lengths, and regular password changes *within Rundeck*.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all Rundeck users, especially administrators, using Rundeck's supported mechanisms.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions *within Rundeck*.  Regularly review and audit user roles and ACLs *within Rundeck*.
    *   **Disable Default Accounts:** Remove or disable the default `admin` account *in Rundeck* after creating a new administrative user with a strong password and MFA.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:** Implement measures *within Rundeck* (or through a tightly integrated proxy) to prevent brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.
    *   **Secure Authentication Integrations:** If using LDAP or Active Directory *with Rundeck*, ensure secure configurations and keep Rundeck's integration components up-to-date.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic audits of Rundeck's authentication and authorization configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/command_injection.md)

*Description:* The ability for an attacker to inject malicious commands into job definitions or parameters *within Rundeck*, leading to arbitrary code execution on target nodes.
*Rundeck Contribution:* Rundeck's core function is executing commands on remote nodes.  The way jobs are *defined within Rundeck* and how user input *to Rundeck* is handled directly impacts the risk of command injection.
*Example:* A job definition *within Rundeck* uses unsanitized user input to construct a shell command.  An attacker provides input like `"; rm -rf / #"` to delete the root filesystem.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of target nodes.  Data loss, system disruption, and potential lateral movement within the network.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Strictly validate and sanitize *all* user input used in job definitions *within Rundeck*.  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible, allowing only known-good characters and patterns.
    *   **Parameterized Commands:** Use parameterized commands or APIs provided by the node executor (e.g., SSH, WinRM) *as configured within Rundeck* instead of constructing commands by string concatenation.
    *   **Avoid Shell Commands:** If possible, use direct API calls or safer alternatives to shell commands *within Rundeck job definitions*.
    *   **Code Review:** Implement a code review process for all job definitions *within Rundeck*, focusing on security.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies and Plugins (Rundeck-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies_and_plugins__rundeck-specific_.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Rundeck itself or installed *Rundeck plugins*.
*Rundeck Contribution:* This is entirely within Rundeck's domain.  Vulnerabilities in the core Rundeck software or in third-party plugins *specifically designed for Rundeck* are the concern.
*Example:* A vulnerable version of a Java library *used by Rundeck* is exploited to gain remote code execution on the Rundeck server.  Or, a malicious third-party *Rundeck plugin* steals API keys.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from denial-of-service to complete server compromise.
*Risk Severity:* High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Keep Rundeck Updated:** Regularly update *Rundeck* to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Only install *Rundeck plugins* from trusted sources.  Thoroughly review the source code of plugins (if available) before deploying them.  Keep *Rundeck plugins* updated.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform regular vulnerability scans *specifically targeting the Rundeck server and its installed plugins*.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information (Rundeck-Managed)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information__rundeck-managed_.md)

*Description:* Leakage of sensitive data (passwords, API keys, credentials) through *Rundeck's* job output, logs, or insecure *Rundeck* configurations.
*Rundeck Contribution:* Rundeck handles and potentially displays sensitive information during job execution and in logs *that it manages*. The way *Rundeck* is configured to manage and protect this information is crucial.
*Example:* A job script echoes a database password to the console, and this output is captured in the *Rundeck job log*, which is accessible to users with lower privileges *within Rundeck*.
*Impact:* Compromise of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to other systems and data.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *    **Secrets Management (Integrated with Rundeck):** Use a secrets management solution, ideally one with a Rundeck plugin or integration, to store and retrieve sensitive information. Do *not* hardcode secrets in job definitions or *Rundeck's* configuration files.
    *   **Log Redaction (Within Rundeck):** Configure *Rundeck* to redact sensitive information from logs. Use regular expressions or other mechanisms to identify and mask sensitive patterns *within Rundeck's logging configuration*.
    *   **Secure Storage (Rundeck's Data):** Ensure that *Rundeck's* data storage (database, configuration files) is properly secured and encrypted.
    *   **Access Control (Within Rundeck):** Restrict access to job output and logs *within Rundeck* based on user roles and permissions.
