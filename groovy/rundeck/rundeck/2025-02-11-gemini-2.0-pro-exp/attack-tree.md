## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Rundeck Features/Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_rundeck_featuresconfiguration.md)

This branch represents attacks that leverage legitimate Rundeck features or misconfigurations, rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Weak/Default Credentials [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_weakdefault_credentials__hr_.md)

This is a high-risk attack vector because many systems are deployed with default credentials or use easily guessable passwords.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (If default creds are unchanged or weak passwords are used)
    *   **Impact:** High (Administrative access)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Automated tools readily available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected through failed login attempt monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Brute-Force Creds on Rundeck Login [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_brute-force_creds_on_rundeck_login__hr_.md)

This attack involves systematically trying different username and password combinations until a valid one is found.
    *   **Description:** An attacker uses automated tools to repeatedly attempt to log in to the Rundeck web interface, trying different combinations of usernames and passwords.  They might start with common usernames (e.g., "admin," "rundeck") and try a large number of passwords.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce a strong password policy (length, complexity, and regular changes).
        *   Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.  This slows down brute-force attacks significantly.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).  This makes brute-force attacks much more difficult, even if the password is compromised.
        *   Monitor login logs for suspicious activity (e.g., a large number of failed login attempts from a single IP address).
        *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rate limiting capabilities to block or throttle requests from suspicious sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Dictionary Attack on Rundeck Login [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_dictionary_attack_on_rundeck_login__hr_.md)

This attack uses a pre-compiled list of common passwords (a "dictionary") to try against known or guessed usernames.
    *   **Description:** Similar to a brute-force attack, but instead of trying all possible combinations, the attacker uses a list of common passwords, phrases, or leaked credentials.  This is often more efficient than a pure brute-force attack.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Same mitigations as for brute-force attacks (strong password policy, account lockout, MFA, login monitoring, WAF).
        *   Educate users about the importance of choosing strong, unique passwords and avoiding common phrases or dictionary words.
        *   Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.
        *   Regularly audit user accounts and passwords for weak or compromised credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized RCE on Rundeck Server/Node [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_rce_on_rundeck_servernode__cn_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and, by definition, a critical node.  Achieving RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Rundeck server or a managed node, leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within the network.  All paths in this threat model ultimately lead to this node.
