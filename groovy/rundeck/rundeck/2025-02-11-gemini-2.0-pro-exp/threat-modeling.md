# Threat Model Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Execution via API](./threats/unauthorized_job_execution_via_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Job Execution via API

    *   **Description:** An attacker, without proper authentication or authorization, uses the Rundeck API to trigger the execution of existing jobs. The attacker might obtain an API token through theft, prediction, or by exploiting a vulnerability that bypasses authentication. They then craft API calls to `/api/{version}/job/{id}/run` or similar endpoints. This is a *direct* threat to Rundeck because it targets the core API functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands on connected nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or service disruption. The attacker could leverage existing jobs to perform actions they wouldn't normally be authorized to do.
    *   **Rundeck Component Affected:** API (`/api/*` endpoints, specifically those related to job execution), Authentication and Authorization mechanisms (token validation, ACL checks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong API token management: short-lived tokens, regular rotation, strict scope limitations (project-specific, read-only where possible).
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks for *every* API call.  Do not rely solely on token presence; verify user permissions against the requested action and job.
        *   Monitor API usage for anomalous patterns (e.g., unusual job execution frequency, requests from unexpected IP addresses).
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attempts targeting the API.

## Threat: [Job Definition Tampering via Web UI](./threats/job_definition_tampering_via_web_ui.md)

*   **Threat:** Job Definition Tampering via Web UI

    *   **Description:** An attacker with some level of access (perhaps a low-privileged user or through a compromised account) modifies an existing job definition through the Rundeck Web UI. They could alter the command to be executed, change script contents, or modify input options to inject malicious code. This directly targets Rundeck's job management functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of attacker-controlled commands on target nodes, leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious actions. The impact depends on the privileges of the Rundeck user on the target nodes.
    *   **Rundeck Component Affected:** Web UI (job definition editor), Job Management module (specifically the functions responsible for saving and updating job definitions), ACL enforcement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict ACLs within Rundeck, limiting who can modify job definitions.  Use the principle of least privilege.  Separate roles for job creators, editors, and executors.
        *   Implement a workflow for job definition changes, requiring approval from a designated authority before changes are applied.
        *   Use version control (e.g., Git integration) for job definitions to track changes, facilitate rollbacks, and provide an audit trail.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on all fields within the job definition editor to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure via Key Storage Misconfiguration](./threats/credential_exposure_via_key_storage_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** Credential Exposure via Key Storage Misconfiguration

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive credentials stored in Rundeck's Key Storage due to misconfiguration or weak access controls. This could involve exploiting a vulnerability in the Key Storage implementation, gaining access to the underlying storage mechanism (e.g., the database or filesystem), or leveraging overly permissive ACLs. This is a direct threat to Rundeck's built-in secrets management.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of credentials used to access managed nodes, databases, or other systems. This could lead to widespread system compromise and data breaches.
    *   **Rundeck Component Affected:** Key Storage module (all functions related to storing, retrieving, and managing secrets), ACL enforcement for Key Storage access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a strong encryption method for Key Storage (e.g., AES-256 with a robust key management system).
        *   Implement strict ACLs on Key Storage access, limiting who can view, modify, or use stored credentials.  Use the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly audit Key Storage configurations and access logs.
        *   Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) integrated with Rundeck for enhanced security and auditing capabilities.
        *   Ensure the underlying storage mechanism for Key Storage (database or filesystem) is properly secured and protected from unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Plugin Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_plugin_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Plugin Vulnerability

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Rundeck plugin (e.g., a custom script plugin, a notification plugin, or a workflow step plugin) to gain elevated privileges within Rundeck or on a managed node. The vulnerability could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Rundeck user or the user account used to run the plugin. This directly targets Rundeck's plugin extensibility mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to Rundeck resources, potentially escalating to full administrative control or gaining root access on managed nodes.
    *   **Rundeck Component Affected:** Plugin framework, Specific vulnerable plugin, Security context in which the plugin executes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all Rundeck plugins before deploying them.  Pay particular attention to custom-developed plugins.
        *   Run plugins with the least privilege necessary.  Avoid running plugins as the Rundeck user or as root on managed nodes.
        *   Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a sandbox environment for running plugins to isolate them from the core Rundeck system and limit the impact of any vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor plugin activity for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [Log Tampering to Conceal Activity](./threats/log_tampering_to_conceal_activity.md)

* **Threat:** Log Tampering to Conceal Activity
    * **Description:** An attacker with access to the Rundeck server, either through a compromised account or by exploiting a vulnerability, modifies or deletes Rundeck's execution logs. This is done to cover their tracks after performing malicious actions, hindering incident response and forensic analysis. This directly targets Rundeck's logging functionality.
    * **Impact:** Loss of crucial audit trails, making it difficult or impossible to determine the scope of a security breach, identify the attacker, or reconstruct the sequence of events.
    * **Rundeck Component Affected:** Logging module (all functions related to writing, storing, and managing execution logs), File system access controls (for the log file location, if logs are stored locally).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement centralized, secure logging: Send logs to a remote, write-only syslog server or a dedicated log management system (e.g., Splunk, ELK stack). This makes it significantly harder for an attacker to tamper with logs without detection.
        * Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) on Rundeck log files (if stored locally) to detect unauthorized modifications.
        * Restrict access to the Rundeck server's filesystem, limiting who can directly access log files.
        * Regularly review and archive logs to ensure their integrity and availability. Implement log rotation policies.
