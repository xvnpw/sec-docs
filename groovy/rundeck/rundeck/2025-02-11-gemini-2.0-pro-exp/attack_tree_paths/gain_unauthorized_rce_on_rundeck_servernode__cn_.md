Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on gaining unauthorized Remote Code Execution (RCE) on a Rundeck server or node.

## Deep Analysis of "Gain Unauthorized RCE on Rundeck Server/Node"

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, analyze, and document the specific vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and preconditions that could lead to an attacker achieving unauthorized Remote Code Execution (RCE) on a Rundeck server or a node managed by Rundeck.  We aim to understand *how* an attacker could realistically achieve this goal, not just *that* it's possible.  This understanding will inform mitigation strategies and security hardening efforts.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the Rundeck application and its associated components, including:

*   **Rundeck Server:** The core application server, including its web interface, API, and backend processes.
*   **Rundeck Nodes:**  Machines managed by Rundeck, where jobs are executed.  This includes various operating systems and configurations.
*   **Rundeck Plugins:**  Extensions that add functionality to Rundeck, including both official and third-party plugins.
*   **Rundeck Configuration:**  Settings and configurations that control Rundeck's behavior, including authentication, authorization, and network access.
*   **Underlying Infrastructure:**  While not the primary focus, we will consider vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system, Java runtime environment, and network infrastructure that could be leveraged to achieve RCE *through* Rundeck.
* **Authentication and Authorization mechanisms:** How users and systems authenticate to Rundeck, and how permissions are granted and enforced.
* **Data Input and Validation:** How Rundeck handles user-supplied data, including job definitions, parameters, and input from external sources.
* **External Integrations:** How Rundeck interacts with other systems, such as source control repositories, cloud providers, and monitoring tools.

We *exclude* attacks that are entirely outside the scope of Rundeck's control, such as physical attacks on the server hardware or social engineering attacks that do not involve exploiting Rundeck's functionality.  However, we *will* consider social engineering that leverages Rundeck features (e.g., tricking an administrator into running a malicious job).

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will review publicly available vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, etc.), security advisories from Rundeck, and security research publications to identify known vulnerabilities that could lead to RCE.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  We will perform targeted code reviews of critical areas of the Rundeck codebase (identified through vulnerability research and threat modeling) to identify potential vulnerabilities that may not yet be publicly known.  This will focus on areas like input validation, authentication, authorization, and plugin handling.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques (e.g., STRIDE, PASTA) to systematically identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities.  This will help us think like an attacker and uncover less obvious attack paths.
4.  **Configuration Analysis:**  We will analyze common Rundeck configurations and identify misconfigurations or weak settings that could increase the risk of RCE.
5.  **Penetration Testing (Conceptual):**  While we won't perform live penetration testing as part of this analysis, we will conceptually outline potential penetration testing scenarios that could be used to validate the identified vulnerabilities.
6.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will analyze the dependencies of Rundeck (libraries, frameworks, etc.) to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be inherited.
7. **Review of Rundeck Documentation:** Examine official documentation for best practices, security recommendations, and potential areas of misconfiguration.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

The attack tree path is simply stated as: "Gain Unauthorized RCE on Rundeck Server/Node [CN]".  This is the *end goal*.  To perform a deep analysis, we need to break this down into sub-goals and potential attack vectors.  Here's a structured analysis, building upon the methodology:

**A.  Potential Attack Vectors (Sub-Goals leading to RCE):**

We can categorize potential attack vectors into several broad categories:

1.  **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **CVE Exploitation:**  Searching for and exploiting known CVEs in Rundeck itself, its plugins, or its dependencies.  This is the most direct path.  Examples might include:
        *   **CVE-2023-XXXXX:** (Hypothetical) A vulnerability in a specific Rundeck plugin that allows for arbitrary code execution due to improper input validation.
        *   **CVE-2022-YYYYY:** (Hypothetical) A vulnerability in a library used by Rundeck that allows for remote code execution via a crafted HTTP request.
        *   **CVE-2018-11776:** (Real) Apache Struts vulnerability, which affected older versions of Rundeck. This highlights the importance of dependency analysis.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploitation:**  Discovering and exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Rundeck or its dependencies.  This is less likely but more impactful.

2.  **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**

    *   **Weak Credentials:**  Brute-forcing, credential stuffing, or guessing default/weak passwords for Rundeck accounts (especially administrator accounts).
    *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Exploiting flaws in Rundeck's authentication mechanism to gain access without valid credentials.  This could involve manipulating session tokens, exploiting misconfigured SSO integrations, or bypassing authentication checks altogether.
    *   **Authorization Bypass:**  Exploiting flaws in Rundeck's authorization mechanism to gain elevated privileges.  This could involve escalating privileges from a low-privileged user account to an administrator account, or bypassing access controls to execute jobs or access resources that should be restricted.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing a valid user's session token (e.g., through XSS or network sniffing) to impersonate that user.
    *   **Misconfigured ACLs:** Exploiting overly permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) that grant unauthorized users access to sensitive functionality or resources.

3.  **Job Definition Manipulation:**

    *   **Malicious Job Injection:**  Tricking an administrator into creating or importing a malicious job definition that contains attacker-controlled code.  This could involve social engineering, exploiting vulnerabilities in job import functionality, or compromising a source control repository where job definitions are stored.
    *   **Job Parameter Manipulation:**  Modifying the parameters of an existing job to inject malicious code.  This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in input validation or exploiting trust relationships between Rundeck and other systems.
    *   **Command Injection:**  Injecting shell commands into job steps or parameters that are executed on the Rundeck server or nodes.  This is a classic attack vector that relies on insufficient input sanitization.
    *   **Script Injection:** Similar to command injection, but specifically targeting scripting languages used within Rundeck jobs (e.g., Groovy, Python, etc.).

4.  **Plugin Exploitation:**

    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Installation:**  Installing a malicious or vulnerable third-party plugin that contains code execution vulnerabilities.  This could involve tricking an administrator into installing a plugin from an untrusted source, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the plugin installation process.
    *   **Exploiting Plugin Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting known or unknown vulnerabilities in installed plugins (both official and third-party).  This is a significant attack surface, as plugins often have access to sensitive data and system resources.

5.  **Exploiting Underlying Infrastructure:**

    *   **OS Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system of the Rundeck server or nodes to gain a foothold and then leverage that access to compromise Rundeck.
    *   **Java Runtime Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) used by Rundeck.
    *   **Network Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting network vulnerabilities (e.g., weak firewall rules, exposed services) to gain access to the Rundeck server or nodes and then exploit Rundeck-specific vulnerabilities.

**B.  Detailed Analysis of Specific Attack Scenarios (Examples):**

Let's elaborate on a few of the above attack vectors with more specific scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: CVE Exploitation (Struts Example):**

    *   **Attacker Goal:** Gain RCE on the Rundeck server.
    *   **Precondition:** Rundeck server is running an outdated version vulnerable to a known Struts vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2018-11776).
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker scans the internet for Rundeck instances.
        2.  Attacker identifies a vulnerable instance using version fingerprinting or by attempting to exploit the Struts vulnerability.
        3.  Attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that exploits the Struts vulnerability.
        4.  The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Rundeck server.
        5.  Attacker gains a shell on the server and can now execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update Rundeck and its dependencies to the latest versions.  Implement a vulnerability scanning and patching process.

*   **Scenario 2: Job Parameter Manipulation (Command Injection):**

    *   **Attacker Goal:** Execute arbitrary commands on a Rundeck node.
    *   **Precondition:** Attacker has access to a Rundeck account with permission to modify job parameters, but not necessarily to create new jobs.  The job uses a parameter in a shell command without proper sanitization.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker identifies a job that uses a parameter in a shell command (e.g., a job that runs `ls -l ${directory}`).
        2.  Attacker modifies the `directory` parameter to inject a malicious command (e.g., `${directory}; whoami;`).
        3.  When the job runs, the injected command is executed on the node (e.g., `ls -l /some/path; whoami;`).
        4.  Attacker receives the output of the `whoami` command, confirming code execution.
        5.  Attacker can now inject more complex commands to further compromise the node.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all job parameters.  Use parameterized commands or APIs instead of directly constructing shell commands.  Avoid using user-supplied input directly in shell commands.

*   **Scenario 3: Malicious Plugin Installation:**

    *   **Attacker Goal:** Gain RCE on the Rundeck server.
    *   **Precondition:** Attacker can convince a Rundeck administrator to install a malicious plugin.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Attacker creates a malicious Rundeck plugin that contains a backdoor or code execution vulnerability.
        2.  Attacker distributes the plugin through a seemingly legitimate channel (e.g., a fake forum post, a compromised website).
        3.  Attacker uses social engineering to convince a Rundeck administrator to install the plugin.
        4.  Once the plugin is installed and activated, the attacker can trigger the backdoor or exploit the vulnerability to gain RCE.
    *   **Mitigation:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (e.g., the official Rundeck plugin repository).  Carefully review the source code of any third-party plugins before installing them.  Implement a plugin approval process.

*   **Scenario 4: Authentication Bypass via Misconfigured SSO:**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Gain access to Rundeck as an administrator.
    *   **Precondition:** Rundeck is configured to use Single Sign-On (SSO), but the SSO integration is misconfigured, allowing for user impersonation or bypassing authentication checks.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1. Attacker researches common SSO misconfigurations for the specific SSO provider used by Rundeck.
        2. Attacker identifies a misconfiguration, such as a weak secret key, a vulnerability in the SSO protocol implementation, or a lack of proper validation of user attributes.
        3. Attacker crafts a malicious SSO request or response that exploits the misconfiguration.
        4. Rundeck accepts the malicious request/response and grants the attacker access, potentially with administrator privileges.
    * **Mitigation:** Follow best practices for configuring SSO integrations. Regularly review and audit SSO configurations. Use strong secrets and ensure proper validation of user attributes.

**C.  Key Considerations and Questions:**

*   **Rundeck API:**  The Rundeck API is a powerful interface that can be used to manage jobs, nodes, and other resources.  Vulnerabilities in the API or its authentication mechanisms could be exploited to gain RCE.
*   **Data Storage:**  How Rundeck stores job definitions, execution logs, and other data is crucial.  Vulnerabilities in data storage mechanisms (e.g., SQL injection) could be exploited to gain access to sensitive data or to modify job definitions.
*   **Orchestration Tools:** Rundeck often integrates with other orchestration tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet).  Vulnerabilities in these integrations could be exploited to gain access to Rundeck or the managed nodes.
*   **Cloud Environments:**  If Rundeck is deployed in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), vulnerabilities in the cloud provider's services or misconfigurations of cloud resources could be exploited to gain access to Rundeck.
* **Least Privilege:** Are Rundeck users and service accounts configured with the principle of least privilege? Overly permissive accounts increase the impact of a successful attack.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Are adequate logging and monitoring mechanisms in place to detect and respond to suspicious activity?

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

Gaining unauthorized RCE on a Rundeck server or node is a critical security risk. This deep analysis has identified numerous potential attack vectors, ranging from exploiting known vulnerabilities to manipulating job definitions and bypassing authentication.

**Key Recommendations:**

*   **Patching and Updates:**  Implement a robust vulnerability management program to ensure that Rundeck, its plugins, and its dependencies are regularly updated to the latest versions.
*   **Secure Configuration:**  Follow Rundeck's security best practices and harden the configuration of the Rundeck server and nodes.  This includes using strong passwords, configuring secure authentication mechanisms, and implementing least privilege access controls.
*   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, including job parameters, API requests, and plugin configurations.
*   **Plugin Security:**  Only install plugins from trusted sources and carefully review the security of any third-party plugins.
*   **Threat Modeling and Penetration Testing:**  Regularly conduct threat modeling and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
* **Code Review:** Conduct regular security-focused code reviews, especially of areas handling user input, authentication, and authorization.
* **Dependency Management:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Enforce the principle of least privilege for all users and service accounts.
* **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Rundeck server and nodes from other parts of the network to limit the impact of a successful attack.

By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized RCE on their Rundeck deployments and protect their critical infrastructure. This is an ongoing process, and continuous vigilance is required to stay ahead of evolving threats.
