Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on brute-force attacks against Rundeck's login interface.

## Deep Analysis of Rundeck Brute-Force Attack (2.1.1)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat posed by brute-force attacks against the Rundeck login interface (attack tree path 2.1.1), identify specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level mitigations already listed.  We aim to provide the development team with the information needed to harden the application against this specific attack vector.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the brute-force attack vector targeting the Rundeck web interface's login mechanism.  It does *not* cover other attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, session hijacking) or attacks against underlying infrastructure (e.g., SSH attacks on the Rundeck server itself).  The scope includes:

*   **Rundeck's authentication mechanisms:**  How Rundeck handles user authentication, including password storage, session management, and any built-in protection mechanisms.
*   **Potential weaknesses:**  Identifying any aspects of Rundeck's login process that could make it more susceptible to brute-force attacks.
*   **Exploitation techniques:**  Understanding how attackers might use tools and techniques to automate and optimize brute-force attacks.
*   **Mitigation strategies:**  Proposing specific, detailed, and practical mitigation strategies, including configuration changes, code modifications, and integration with external security tools.
* **Impact Analysis:** Understanding the potential impact of successful brute-force.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Examine the relevant sections of the Rundeck codebase (available on GitHub) related to authentication and login.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Password hashing algorithms used.
    *   Account lockout implementation (if any).
    *   Rate limiting mechanisms (if any).
    *   Session management practices.
    *   Error handling related to login failures.
    *   Any custom authentication logic.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Set up a test instance of Rundeck and perform controlled brute-force attacks using tools like Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder, or custom scripts.  This will help to:
    *   Verify the effectiveness of existing security measures.
    *   Identify any unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   Measure the time required to successfully brute-force a weak password.
    *   Test the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.

3.  **Documentation Review:**  Consult Rundeck's official documentation, security advisories, and community forums to identify any known vulnerabilities or best practices related to login security.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consider the attacker's perspective, including their motivations, resources, and potential attack strategies.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Based on the findings from the above steps, provide specific and actionable recommendations for mitigating the risk of brute-force attacks.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.1 Brute-Force Creds on Rundeck Login

**2.1.  Understanding the Attack**

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker targets the Rundeck web interface's login form, typically located at `/user/login`.
*   **Attack Method:**  The attacker uses automated tools (e.g., Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder, Medusa, Ncrack) to submit a large number of login requests with different username and password combinations.
*   **Attack Goal:**  To gain unauthorized access to the Rundeck instance, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary jobs, access sensitive data, or compromise the underlying system.
*   **Attacker Resources:**  The attacker needs a list of potential usernames (which can be guessed, obtained from other breaches, or enumerated if Rundeck reveals usernames on failed login attempts) and a password list (e.g., a dictionary of common passwords, a list of leaked passwords, or a generated list of all possible combinations).  They also need a tool to automate the attack.
* **Impact:** Successful brute-force can lead to:
    *   **Data breaches:** Access to sensitive data stored within Rundeck or accessible through Rundeck jobs.
    *   **System compromise:** Execution of malicious jobs that could compromise the Rundeck server or other systems.
    *   **Reputational damage:** Loss of trust and credibility.
    *   **Financial losses:** Costs associated with incident response, data recovery, and potential legal liabilities.
    *   **Operational disruption:** Downtime of Rundeck and any systems it manages.

**2.2.  Potential Weaknesses (Based on Initial Assessment and Common Vulnerabilities)**

Before diving into the code, here are some potential weaknesses that are common in web applications and could make Rundeck vulnerable:

*   **Weak Password Hashing:**  If Rundeck uses a weak or outdated hashing algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA1), it might be possible to crack passwords relatively quickly, even if they are complex.  Ideally, Rundeck should use a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt.
*   **Lack of Account Lockout:**  If Rundeck doesn't implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts, an attacker can continue trying different passwords indefinitely.
*   **Insufficient Rate Limiting:**  Even with account lockout, an attacker might be able to try a large number of passwords *before* the lockout is triggered.  Rate limiting can restrict the number of login attempts allowed from a single IP address or user within a given time period.
*   **Predictable Session IDs:**  If session IDs are predictable, an attacker might be able to hijack a valid session even without knowing the password.
*   **Username Enumeration:**  If the login form provides different error messages for invalid usernames and invalid passwords, an attacker can use this to determine which usernames exist on the system. This significantly reduces the search space for brute-force attacks.  The application should return a generic "Invalid username or password" message.
*   **Lack of CAPTCHA or Similar Mechanisms:**  CAPTCHAs can help to distinguish between human users and automated bots, making brute-force attacks more difficult.
*   **Default Credentials:**  If default credentials (e.g., admin/admin) are not changed after installation, the system is highly vulnerable.
*   **Cleartext Transmission of Credentials:** Although HTTPS is mentioned, it's crucial to verify that credentials are *never* transmitted in cleartext, even during internal communication or logging.

**2.3.  Code Review (Hypothetical Examples - Requires Access to Rundeck Source)**

This section would contain specific code snippets and analysis.  Since I don't have direct access to the Rundeck codebase at this moment, I'll provide *hypothetical* examples to illustrate the process.

**Example 1: Password Hashing (Good)**

```java
// Hypothetical Rundeck code (GOOD)
import org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder;

public class AuthenticationService {

    private BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder(12); // Work factor of 12

    public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (user != null && passwordEncoder.matches(password, user.getPasswordHash())) {
            // Authentication successful
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Analysis:** This code uses `BCryptPasswordEncoder` with a work factor of 12, which is a good practice.  BCrypt is a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm that is resistant to brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

**Example 2: Password Hashing (Bad)**

```java
// Hypothetical Rundeck code (BAD)
import java.security.MessageDigest;

public class AuthenticationService {

    public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (user != null) {
            String hashedPassword = hashPassword(password);
            if (hashedPassword.equals(user.getPasswordHash())) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private String hashPassword(String password) {
        try {
            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5"); // BAD: Using MD5
            byte[] hashBytes = md.digest(password.getBytes());
            // Convert bytes to hex string...
            return hexString;
        } catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            // Handle exception...
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

**Analysis:** This code uses MD5 for password hashing, which is a *very bad* practice.  MD5 is a weak and broken hashing algorithm that is highly vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily cracked using readily available tools.

**Example 3: Account Lockout (Good)**

```java
// Hypothetical Rundeck code (GOOD)
public class AuthenticationService {
    private static final int MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS = 5;
    private static final long LOCKOUT_DURATION = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes

    public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (user != null) {
            if (user.isLocked()) {
                if (System.currentTimeMillis() - user.getLastFailedLoginAttempt() < LOCKOUT_DURATION) {
                    // Account is locked
                    return false;
                } else {
                    // Reset failed attempts and unlock
                    user.setFailedLoginAttempts(0);
                    user.setLocked(false);
                }
            }

            if (passwordEncoder.matches(password, user.getPasswordHash())) {
                // Authentication successful, reset failed attempts
                user.setFailedLoginAttempts(0);
                userRepository.save(user);
                return true;
            } else {
                // Authentication failed, increment failed attempts
                user.setFailedLoginAttempts(user.getFailedLoginAttempts() + 1);
                user.setLastFailedLoginAttempt(System.currentTimeMillis());
                if (user.getFailedLoginAttempts() >= MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS) {
                    user.setLocked(true);
                }
                userRepository.save(user);
                return false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Analysis:** This code implements account lockout after 5 failed login attempts.  The account is locked for 30 minutes.  This is a good basic implementation.

**Example 4:  Lack of Rate Limiting (Bad)**

```java
// Hypothetical Rundeck code (BAD - No Rate Limiting)
@PostMapping("/user/login")
public String login(@RequestParam String username, @RequestParam String password) {
    // ... authentication logic ...
}
```

**Analysis:** This code snippet (representing a typical login endpoint) shows *no* rate limiting.  An attacker could send thousands of requests per second without any restrictions.

**2.4. Dynamic Analysis (Testing)**

This section would describe the results of actual brute-force tests against a test instance of Rundeck.  Examples:

*   **Test 1:  Weak Password, No Lockout:**  Using Hydra with a small dictionary of common passwords, we were able to successfully brute-force a user account with the password "password123" in under 1 second.
*   **Test 2:  Strong Password, No Lockout:**  Using Hydra with a large dictionary, we were unable to brute-force a user account with a strong password (12 characters, mixed-case, numbers, symbols) within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 24 hours).
*   **Test 3:  Weak Password, Lockout Enabled:**  After 5 failed login attempts, the account was successfully locked.  Further attempts were rejected.
*   **Test 4:  Rate Limiting Test:**  We configured a rate limit of 10 login attempts per minute per IP address.  Using Burp Suite Intruder, we observed that requests exceeding this limit were blocked with a 429 (Too Many Requests) status code.

**2.5. Mitigation Recommendations (Detailed and Actionable)**

Based on the analysis (including hypothetical code review and dynamic testing), here are specific recommendations:

1.  **Strong Password Hashing:**
    *   **Ensure:** Rundeck uses a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt with a sufficient work factor (e.g., cost factor of 12 or higher for bcrypt).
    *   **Action:**  If a weak algorithm is used, migrate to a stronger one.  This will require re-hashing all existing passwords.  Provide a mechanism for users to update their passwords, triggering the re-hashing process.

2.  **Account Lockout:**
    *   **Ensure:**  Implement account lockout after a configurable number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).
    *   **Action:**  Add code to track failed login attempts, lock accounts, and unlock them after a configurable lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes).  Consider using a persistent storage mechanism (e.g., database) to track failed attempts and lockout status.

3.  **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **Ensure:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of login attempts per IP address and/or per user within a given time period.
    *   **Action:**
        *   **Option 1 (Built-in):**  Add code to track login attempts per IP address and/or user, and reject requests exceeding the configured limit.  Use a suitable data structure (e.g., a sliding window counter) to efficiently track attempts.
        *   **Option 2 (External - WAF):**  Configure a Web Application Firewall (WAF) like ModSecurity, AWS WAF, or Cloudflare to enforce rate limiting rules.  This is often the preferred approach as it offloads the rate limiting logic from the application.
        *   **Option 3 (External - Reverse Proxy):** Configure rate limiting in a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.

4.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Ensure:**  Implement MFA using a standard protocol like TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) or WebAuthn.
    *   **Action:**  Integrate with an MFA provider (e.g., Google Authenticator, Duo Security, Authy) or implement a custom MFA solution.  Make MFA mandatory for all users or at least for administrative accounts.

5.  **Username Enumeration Prevention:**
    *   **Ensure:**  The login form returns a generic error message ("Invalid username or password") regardless of whether the username exists or the password is incorrect.
    *   **Action:**  Modify the error handling logic in the authentication code to return a consistent error message.

6.  **CAPTCHA (Optional, but Recommended):**
    *   **Ensure:**  Implement a CAPTCHA mechanism (e.g., reCAPTCHA) to deter automated attacks.
    *   **Action:**  Integrate a CAPTCHA library and add the CAPTCHA challenge to the login form.

7.  **Session Management:**
    *   **Ensure:**  Session IDs are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator and are sufficiently long to prevent brute-force guessing.
    *   **Action:**  Review the session management configuration and code to ensure best practices are followed.  Use HTTPS for all communication to protect session cookies.  Implement session timeout and invalidation mechanisms.

8.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Ensure:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Action:**  Schedule regular security assessments, including both automated vulnerability scanning and manual penetration testing.

9. **Monitor Login Logs:**
    * **Ensure:** Login attempts, successes, and failures are logged.
    * **Action:** Configure logging to capture relevant information (timestamp, IP address, username, success/failure status). Implement a system for monitoring these logs and alerting on suspicious activity (e.g., a large number of failed login attempts from a single IP address). Consider using a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system for centralized log management and analysis.

10. **Default Credentials:**
    * **Ensure:** Rundeck installation process forces the change of default credentials.
    * **Action:** Modify the installation scripts or documentation to require the administrator to set a strong password during the initial setup.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful brute-force attacks against the Rundeck login interface and improve the overall security of the application. This detailed analysis provides a roadmap for hardening the application against this specific threat.
