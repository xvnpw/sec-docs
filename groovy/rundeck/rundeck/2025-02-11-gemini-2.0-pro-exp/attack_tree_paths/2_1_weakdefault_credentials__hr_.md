# Rundeck Security Analysis: Weak/Default Credentials Attack Path

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack vector (node 2.1 in the broader attack tree) against a Rundeck deployment.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific vulnerabilities related to weak or default credentials within the Rundeck context.
*   Identify the potential impact of a successful attack exploiting this vector.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
*   Provide clear guidance to the development and operations teams on implementing these mitigations.
*   Establish monitoring and detection capabilities to identify attempted or successful exploitation.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following aspects of a Rundeck deployment:

*   **Rundeck Server Authentication:**  This includes the primary web interface login, API authentication, and any other authentication mechanisms used to access the Rundeck server itself.
*   **User Accounts:**  All user accounts configured within Rundeck, including administrative and non-administrative accounts.
*   **Integration Points (Potentially):**  While the primary focus is on Rundeck's internal authentication, we will *briefly* consider how weak credentials in *integrated systems* (e.g., a poorly secured database used for user authentication) could indirectly impact Rundeck's security.  However, a full analysis of integrated systems is outside the scope of this specific path analysis.
* **Default Configuration:** Analysis of default configuration of Rundeck, regarding credentials.

This analysis *excludes* the security of the nodes managed *by* Rundeck.  While Rundeck can be used to manage credentials on those nodes, that's a separate attack surface.  This analysis is solely about gaining unauthorized access *to* the Rundeck server itself.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We'll use the provided attack tree path as a starting point and expand upon it with specific scenarios relevant to Rundeck.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We'll examine Rundeck's documentation, configuration options, and known vulnerabilities related to authentication and credential management.  We'll also consider common attack patterns.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** We'll determine the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:** We'll propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified risks.  These will include both preventative and detective controls.
5.  **Documentation and Communication:**  The findings and recommendations will be clearly documented and communicated to the development and operations teams.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1 Weak/Default Credentials

### 2.1 Threat Modeling & Scenarios

Given the attack tree path's description, we can expand on the threat scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Default Admin Credentials:**  An attacker attempts to log in to the Rundeck web interface using the default `admin/admin` credentials (or any other well-known default credentials documented for Rundeck or its underlying components).
*   **Scenario 2: Brute-Force Attack:** An attacker uses automated tools (e.g., Hydra, Burp Suite Intruder) to systematically try common usernames and passwords against the Rundeck login page or API.  This targets weak passwords chosen by users.
*   **Scenario 3: Credential Stuffing:** An attacker uses credentials obtained from data breaches (available on the dark web) to attempt to log in to Rundeck.  This exploits password reuse across different services.
*   **Scenario 4: Social Engineering:** An attacker tricks a legitimate Rundeck user into revealing their credentials through phishing emails, phone calls, or other social engineering techniques.  This bypasses technical controls.
*   **Scenario 5: Configuration File Leak:** An attacker gains access to a server hosting Rundeck (through a separate vulnerability) and finds configuration files containing hardcoded credentials or weak encryption keys.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis

Rundeck, like many applications, is vulnerable to weak/default credential attacks if not properly configured.  Key areas of concern include:

*   **Default `admin` Account:**  Rundeck historically shipped with a default `admin` account.  While best practices strongly recommend changing this immediately after installation, it's a common oversight.  The documentation explicitly warns about this.
*   **JAAS Realm Configuration:** Rundeck uses JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) for authentication.  The default configuration often uses a simple `PropertyFileLoginModule` that stores usernames and passwords in a plaintext file (`realm.properties`).  This file is a prime target for attackers.
*   **Weak Password Policies:**  If Rundeck is not configured to enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, account lockout after failed attempts), users may choose weak, easily guessable passwords.
*   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Without MFA, a compromised password grants full access.  Rundeck supports plugins for MFA (e.g., Duo Security), but it's not enabled by default.
*   **API Authentication:**  The Rundeck API uses authentication tokens.  If these tokens are generated with weak secrets or are not properly protected, they can be compromised.
* **Unencrypted communication:** If Rundeck is not configured to use HTTPS, credentials can be intercepted in transit.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

A successful attack exploiting weak/default credentials can have severe consequences:

*   **Complete System Compromise:**  An attacker with administrative access to Rundeck can execute arbitrary commands on managed nodes, potentially compromising the entire infrastructure.
*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can access sensitive data stored within Rundeck (e.g., job definitions, execution logs, node configurations) or on managed nodes.
*   **Operational Disruption:**  Attackers can modify or delete jobs, causing significant disruption to automated processes and workflows.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Data breaches and system compromises can lead to violations of regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).
* **Lateral Movement:** Attacker can use Rundeck to move laterally within the network.

### 2.4 Mitigation Recommendations

To mitigate the risks associated with weak/default credentials, we recommend the following:

**Preventative Controls:**

1.  **Immediate Password Change:**  **Immediately** change the default `admin` password (and any other default accounts) to a strong, unique password upon initial Rundeck installation.  This is the *absolute first step*.
2.  **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:** Configure Rundeck to enforce strong password policies:
    *   Minimum length (at least 12 characters, preferably 16+).
    *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password history (prevent reuse of recent passwords).
    *   Account lockout after a configurable number of failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts).  Include a lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes).
3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for all Rundeck user accounts, especially administrative accounts.  Use a supported plugin (e.g., Duo Security, Google Authenticator) or integrate with an existing MFA solution.
4.  **Secure JAAS Configuration:**
    *   **Avoid `PropertyFileLoginModule` in production:**  This is highly discouraged for production environments.
    *   **Use a more secure authentication backend:**  Consider using:
        *   LDAP/Active Directory integration.
        *   Database-backed authentication (with proper password hashing).
        *   A dedicated identity provider (e.g., Keycloak, Okta).
    *   **If `PropertyFileLoginModule` *must* be used (e.g., for testing),** ensure the `realm.properties` file:
        *   Is stored outside the web root.
        *   Has strict file permissions (readable only by the Rundeck user).
        *   Uses strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt).  Rundeck supports various hashing algorithms.
5.  **Secure API Token Generation:**  Ensure API tokens are generated using strong random secrets and are stored securely.  Consider using short-lived tokens and implementing token revocation mechanisms.
6.  **HTTPS Enforcement:**  Always use HTTPS for all Rundeck communication to prevent credential interception.  Obtain and install a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Rundeck configuration and infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
8. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that users only have the minimum necessary permissions.

**Detective Controls:**

1.  **Failed Login Attempt Monitoring:**  Configure Rundeck and/or the underlying operating system to log failed login attempts.  Monitor these logs for suspicious activity (e.g., a high number of failed attempts from a single IP address).
2.  **Audit Logging:**  Enable comprehensive audit logging within Rundeck to track user actions and configuration changes.  This can help identify unauthorized access or modifications.
3.  **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns that may indicate brute-force attacks or credential stuffing attempts.
4.  **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Rundeck logs with a SIEM system to centralize security monitoring and alerting.  Configure alerts for suspicious login activity.

### 2.5 Documentation and Communication

*   **Update Installation Documentation:**  The Rundeck installation documentation should clearly emphasize the importance of changing default credentials and configuring strong authentication.
*   **Security Training:**  Provide security training to all Rundeck users and administrators, covering topics such as password security, social engineering awareness, and the importance of reporting suspicious activity.
*   **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate the secure configuration of Rundeck and ensure consistency across deployments.
*   **Regularly review and update security policies and procedures.**

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack vector against Rundeck and offers actionable recommendations to mitigate the associated risks. By implementing these recommendations, the development and operations teams can significantly enhance the security of their Rundeck deployment.
