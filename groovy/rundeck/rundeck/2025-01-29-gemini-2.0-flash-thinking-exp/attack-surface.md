# Attack Surface Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Attack Surface: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Job Definitions](./attack_surfaces/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__in_job_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected and stored within Rundeck job definitions (e.g., in descriptions, script content). When users interact with these job definitions, the malicious script executes in their browser.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's design allows users to define jobs with rich text fields and script content.  Insufficient input sanitization within Rundeck's codebase makes these fields vulnerable to storing XSS payloads.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a job with a description containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When an administrator views this job within the Rundeck UI, the alert box pops up, demonstrating XSS. In a real attack, this could be used to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the administrator within Rundeck.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise within Rundeck, data theft from Rundeck UI, unauthorized actions within Rundeck, potential compromise of systems managed by Rundeck if the XSS can be used to modify job execution workflows.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization (Rundeck Development/Configuration):**  Rundeck developers should implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided data in job definitions, especially descriptions, script content, and option values. Users configuring Rundeck jobs should be aware of this risk and avoid pasting untrusted content.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Rundeck Configuration):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy in Rundeck's web server configuration to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of XSS.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (Rundeck Administration):** Conduct regular security audits of Rundeck configurations and job definitions to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on Job Execution](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__on_job_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in Rundeck user's browser into sending unauthorized requests to the Rundeck server, performing actions like executing jobs or modifying configurations without the user's knowledge.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's web interface and API expose actions like job execution and system management via HTTP requests. If Rundeck's framework lacks or improperly implements CSRF protection, these actions become vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a user a link to a malicious website. When the user, who is logged into Rundeck, visits the site, JavaScript on the malicious site sends a request to the Rundeck server to execute a predefined job. This could lead to unauthorized actions on managed systems via Rundeck.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized job execution via Rundeck, system compromise through Rundeck actions, data manipulation via Rundeck, denial of service by triggering resource-intensive jobs through Rundeck.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **CSRF Tokens (Rundeck Development/Configuration):** Rundeck developers should implement and enforce CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens) for all state-changing requests in Rundeck's web UI and API. Users should ensure CSRF protection is enabled and properly configured in Rundeck.
    *   **SameSite Cookie Attribute (Rundeck Configuration):** Configure Rundeck session cookies with the `SameSite` attribute set to `Strict` or `Lax` in the web server configuration to prevent CSRF attacks originating from cross-site requests.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication Bypass via Weak API Keys](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_bypass_via_weak_api_keys.md)

*   **Description:** Rundeck's API relies on API keys for authentication. Weakly generated, easily guessable, or exposed API keys can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Rundeck API.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's API key mechanism is a core authentication method. Weaknesses in Rundeck's API key generation, management, or enforcement directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker brute-forces API keys or finds a default API key documented online or in default configurations. Using this key, they can access the Rundeck API and perform actions like executing jobs, retrieving sensitive data managed by Rundeck, or modifying Rundeck configurations.
*   **Impact:** Full unauthorized API access to Rundeck, unauthorized job execution via API, data breaches of information accessible via Rundeck API, system compromise through API actions, denial of service via API abuse.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong API Key Generation (Rundeck Development/Configuration):** Rundeck developers should ensure API keys are generated using cryptographically secure random number generators and are sufficiently long and complex. Users should utilize Rundeck's features to generate strong keys and avoid default or weak keys.
    *   **Secure API Key Storage (Rundeck Administration/Configuration):** Rundeck administrators should store API keys securely, ideally using a dedicated secrets management system or encrypted storage. Avoid storing keys in plaintext in Rundeck configuration files.
    *   **API Key Rotation (Rundeck Administration):** Implement a policy for regular API key rotation within Rundeck to limit the lifespan of potentially compromised keys.
    *   **Least Privilege API Keys (Rundeck Administration):** Grant API keys only the necessary permissions required for their intended purpose within Rundeck's RBAC system, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Secure Transmission (General Security Practice):**  Always transmit API keys over HTTPS when interacting with the Rundeck API to prevent interception.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection in Job Execution](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_in_job_execution.md)

*   **Description:**  User-controlled input, passed as job options or parameters within Rundeck job definitions, is not properly sanitized by Rundeck and is directly incorporated into commands executed by Rundeck on target nodes. This allows attackers to inject malicious commands.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's fundamental purpose is to execute commands. If Rundeck's job execution engine or default job steps do not adequately sanitize inputs before command execution, it directly creates a command injection vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A Rundeck job definition takes a "hostname" option. An attacker provides an input like ``; rm -rf / #`` as the hostname through the Rundeck UI or API. If the job script, as interpreted by Rundeck, directly uses this input in a command without sanitization, the malicious command `rm -rf /` could be executed on the target node by Rundeck.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on target nodes managed by Rundeck, system compromise of managed nodes, data breaches on managed nodes, denial of service on managed nodes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (Rundeck Development/Job Definition):** Rundeck developers should provide robust input sanitization and validation mechanisms within Rundeck itself. Users defining jobs must thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input within job definitions before using it in commands. Use allowlists and escape special characters appropriate for the shell or command interpreter being used within Rundeck jobs.
    *   **Parameterization and Prepared Statements (Rundeck Job Definition):**  Where possible within Rundeck job definitions, use parameterized commands or prepared statements to separate commands from data, preventing injection. Utilize Rundeck's features for secure option handling.
    *   **Least Privilege Execution (Rundeck Configuration/System Administration):** Configure Rundeck and job executions to run with the least privileges necessary. Use dedicated service accounts with restricted permissions for Rundeck and its job executions.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices in Plugins (Rundeck Plugin Development):**  Ensure Rundeck plugins are developed with secure coding practices in mind, paying particular attention to input validation and command construction within plugin code.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Job Definitions (Rundeck Administration):** Regularly review and audit Rundeck job definitions for potential command injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Plugin Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_plugin_management.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities related to how Rundeck manages plugins, specifically if Rundeck allows installation from untrusted sources without proper verification, leading to the risk of malicious plugins.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's plugin architecture, while designed for extensibility, can become a vulnerability if Rundeck's plugin management features do not enforce security. Allowing installation of unverified plugins directly contributes to this risk.
*   **Example:** An administrator, through Rundeck's plugin management interface, installs a plugin from an unofficial repository that contains malicious code. This plugin, running within Rundeck's context, could then be used to compromise the Rundeck server or managed nodes.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise of the Rundeck instance, remote code execution on the Rundeck server, data breaches of Rundeck data, denial of service of Rundeck, privilege escalation within the Rundeck system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Official Plugin Repository (Rundeck Configuration/Administration):** Configure Rundeck to primarily use plugins from Rundeck's official plugin repository or trusted, verified sources. Restrict or disable installation from arbitrary sources if possible.
    *   **Plugin Verification (Rundeck Development/Configuration):** Rundeck developers should implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of plugins before installation (e.g., digital signatures, checksums). Rundeck administrators should utilize these features if available.
    *   **Plugin Security Audits (Rundeck Administration/Plugin Selection):** Conduct security audits of plugins, especially those from third-party sources, before deployment in Rundeck. Prioritize plugins from reputable sources.
    *   **Plugin Vulnerability Scanning and Updates (Rundeck Administration):** Regularly scan installed Rundeck plugins for known vulnerabilities and promptly apply updates and patches provided by plugin developers or the Rundeck community.
    *   **Least Privilege Plugin Installation (Rundeck Administration):** Restrict plugin installation within Rundeck to authorized administrators only through Rundeck's access control mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Rundeck stores sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys, SSH keys) in a way that is not sufficiently secure *within Rundeck's data storage mechanisms*, such as plaintext or using weak encryption provided by Rundeck itself.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's need to manage and store credentials for accessing managed nodes and external systems means its internal credential storage mechanisms are a direct part of its attack surface. Weaknesses in Rundeck's credential storage implementation are critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Rundeck server's filesystem or database and finds credentials stored in plaintext in Rundeck's internal data files or a weakly encrypted database managed by Rundeck. These credentials, managed by Rundeck, can then be used to access managed systems or other resources.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of managed systems accessed via Rundeck-stored credentials, data breaches of credentials stored within Rundeck, lateral movement within the network using compromised credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Credential Vault Integration (Rundeck Configuration):** Integrate Rundeck with a dedicated, external credential vault or secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk). Configure Rundeck to retrieve credentials from the vault instead of storing them internally. This offloads credential security to a dedicated system.
    *   **Strong Encryption (Rundeck Development/Configuration):** If direct storage within Rundeck is unavoidable, Rundeck developers should ensure strong encryption algorithms and robust key management practices are used to protect stored credentials *within Rundeck*. Users should verify that Rundeck is configured to use the strongest available encryption options. Avoid weak or outdated encryption methods offered by Rundeck.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Credential Storage (Rundeck Administration):** Regularly audit Rundeck's credential storage mechanisms to ensure they are secure and compliant with security best practices. Verify that Rundeck's configuration aligns with secure credential storage.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Credential Access (Rundeck Administration):** Restrict access to stored credentials within Rundeck to only authorized Rundeck components and administrators through Rundeck's access control features.
