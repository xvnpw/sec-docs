# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) within Rundeck](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__within_rundeck.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) *within Rundeck*.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rundeck Authentication Chain:** Modify Rundeck's authentication configuration (e.g., `realm.properties`, JAAS configuration, or external authentication provider settings *within Rundeck*) to include an MFA mechanism. This typically involves adding an MFA provider as a required step after primary username/password authentication *within Rundeck's authentication flow*.
    2.  **Utilize Rundeck's Plugin Ecosystem (if needed):** If integrating with a specific MFA provider not natively supported, leverage Rundeck's plugin ecosystem to install and configure an appropriate authentication plugin *within Rundeck*.
    3.  **Enforce MFA Policy in Rundeck:** Configure Rundeck to mandate MFA for all users or specific roles, ensuring that access to Rundeck resources is protected by an additional authentication factor *as enforced by Rundeck*.
    4.  **User Enrollment Guidance (Rundeck Context):** Provide users with instructions on how to enroll their accounts for MFA *within the context of Rundeck's authentication system*, referencing any specific Rundeck configurations or plugins used.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Compromise (High Severity):** Mitigates unauthorized access to Rundeck due to stolen or phished Rundeck usernames and passwords by requiring an additional factor *enforced by Rundeck*.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Makes brute-force password attacks against Rundeck logins significantly less effective as an additional factor is required *by Rundeck*.
*   **Impact:** **Significantly Reduces** the risk of unauthorized Rundeck access from compromised credentials and brute-force attacks *specifically targeting Rundeck logins*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** MFA is implemented for administrator accounts accessing the production Rundeck instance *through Rundeck's configured authentication*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA is not yet enforced for regular user accounts or for access to the development and staging Rundeck instances *within Rundeck's authentication system*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Rundeck Features](./mitigation_strategies/implement_granular_role-based_access_control__rbac__using_rundeck_features.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) *using Rundeck's RBAC features*.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Custom Roles in Rundeck:** Create custom roles *within Rundeck's RBAC system* that precisely reflect the required permissions for different user groups accessing Rundeck resources (projects, jobs, nodes, keys, executions).
    2.  **Assign Least Privilege Permissions in Rundeck:** For each custom role *defined in Rundeck*, grant only the minimum necessary permissions for Rundeck resources *using Rundeck's RBAC configuration*. Utilize Rundeck's permission model to restrict access to specific projects, jobs, nodes, keys, and actions.
    3.  **Project-Based RBAC in Rundeck:**  Utilize Rundeck's project-based access control *feature*. Define separate projects *within Rundeck* for different teams or environments and assign roles *within each Rundeck project*.
    4.  **Resource-Level ACLs in Rundeck:**  Implement resource-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) *within Rundeck* for sensitive jobs, nodes, or keys to further restrict access within projects *using Rundeck's ACL configuration*.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Roles in Rundeck:** Periodically review and update roles and permissions *configured within Rundeck* to ensure they remain aligned with user responsibilities and security best practices *within the Rundeck environment*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Jobs (High Severity):** Prevents Rundeck users from accessing or executing jobs they are not authorized to *within Rundeck's permission model*, including jobs that manage critical systems or sensitive data.
    *   **Lateral Movement within Rundeck (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of Rundeck account compromise by restricting users' access to only necessary Rundeck resources *through Rundeck's RBAC*, preventing them from moving laterally to other Rundeck projects or functionalities.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Rundeck (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of Rundeck users gaining elevated privileges beyond their intended roles *within Rundeck's RBAC system*.
*   **Impact:** **Significantly Reduces** the risk of unauthorized access, lateral movement, and privilege escalation *within the Rundeck platform*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Project-based RBAC is implemented *in Rundeck*, separating production and development jobs. Basic custom roles (`job_developer`, `operator`) are defined in production *within Rundeck's RBAC*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular resource-level ACLs are not fully implemented *within Rundeck*. Custom roles are not consistently applied across all projects and environments *in Rundeck*. Roles need further refinement *in Rundeck's configuration* to adhere to the principle of least privilege more strictly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Job Definition Review and Approval Process *for Rundeck Jobs*](./mitigation_strategies/implement_job_definition_review_and_approval_process_for_rundeck_jobs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Job Definition Review and Approval Process *specifically for Rundeck Job Definitions*.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Version Control for Rundeck Job Definitions:** Store Rundeck job definitions in a version control system (e.g., Git) alongside application code, treating them as code artifacts *related to Rundeck configuration*.
    2.  **Code Review Workflow for Rundeck Jobs:** Establish a code review workflow for all new or modified Rundeck job definitions. This focuses on the *content and configuration of Rundeck jobs* and can be integrated into existing development workflows.
    3.  **Designated Reviewers for Rundeck Jobs:** Assign designated reviewers with security and operational expertise to specifically review Rundeck job definitions before they are deployed to Rundeck instances. Reviewers should focus on *Rundeck job logic, permissions, and potential security implications*.
    4.  **Automated Checks for Rundeck Jobs (Optional):** Implement automated checks (e.g., linters, security scanners) specifically designed to identify potential issues in Rundeck job definitions before review, focusing on *Rundeck job syntax, security best practices, and potential vulnerabilities*.
    5.  **Approval Gate for Rundeck Job Deployment:**  Require explicit approval from reviewers before Rundeck job definitions are deployed to Rundeck. This approval gate is specifically for *Rundeck job deployments*.
    6.  **Deployment Process for Rundeck Jobs:**  Define a controlled deployment process for pushing approved Rundeck job definitions to Rundeck instances (e.g., using Rundeck's API or configuration management tools), ensuring *secure and managed deployment of Rundeck jobs*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Job Injection (High Severity):** Prevents the introduction of malicious or unauthorized jobs *into Rundeck* that could compromise systems or data *via Rundeck execution*.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration of Rundeck Jobs (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of deploying poorly configured or error-prone Rundeck jobs that could cause operational issues or security vulnerabilities *within the Rundeck managed environment*.
    *   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities in Rundeck Jobs (Medium Severity):** Helps identify and prevent command injection vulnerabilities *within Rundeck job definitions* during the review process.
*   **Impact:** **Significantly Reduces** the risk of malicious job injection into Rundeck and **Moderately Reduces** the risk of accidental misconfiguration and command injection vulnerabilities *within Rundeck jobs*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Rundeck job definitions are stored in Git. A basic code review process is in place for major Rundeck job changes in production.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The code review process is not consistently enforced for all Rundeck job changes, especially minor updates. Automated checks and a formal approval gate are not yet implemented *for Rundeck job deployments*. The deployment process for Rundeck jobs is still partially manual.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Rundeck Key Storage and External Key Vault Integration *within Rundeck*](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_rundeck_key_storage_and_external_key_vault_integration_within_rundeck.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Rundeck Key Storage and Integrate with an External Key Vault *specifically within Rundeck*.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Migrate Credentials to Rundeck Key Storage:** Identify all credentials (passwords, SSH keys, API tokens) currently stored directly in Rundeck job definitions, scripts, or Rundeck configuration files. Migrate these credentials to *Rundeck's built-in Key Storage feature*.
    2.  **Evaluate External Key Vaults for Rundeck Integration:** Assess and select an appropriate external key vault solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) based on your organization's requirements and *Rundeck's integration capabilities*.
    3.  **Integrate Rundeck with Key Vault using Plugins:** Configure Rundeck to integrate with the chosen external key vault. This *requires installing a Rundeck plugin designed for key vault integration* and configuring authentication and access to the key vault *within Rundeck's plugin settings*.
    4.  **Store Credentials in Key Vault via Rundeck Integration:** Migrate credentials from Rundeck's Key Storage to the external key vault *through the Rundeck-key vault integration*.
    5.  **Reference Credentials in Rundeck Jobs using Key Storage Lookup:** Update Rundeck job definitions and scripts to reference credentials from the key vault using *Rundeck's credential lookup mechanisms* (e.g., `${keyvault:secret/path}`), leveraging the key vault integration.
    6.  **Implement Key Rotation and Auditing via Key Vault (Rundeck Context):** Leverage the key vault's features for credential rotation, access control, and auditing *as integrated with Rundeck*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure in Rundeck Job Definitions (High Severity):** Prevents credentials from being directly embedded in Rundeck job definitions, reducing the risk of accidental exposure in version control or Rundeck backups *of job definitions*.
    *   **Centralized Credential Management for Rundeck (Medium Severity):** Provides a centralized and secure location for managing credentials *used by Rundeck jobs*, improving security and simplifying credential rotation and auditing *within the Rundeck context*.
    *   **Unauthorized Credential Access via Rundeck (Medium Severity):** External key vaults often offer more robust access control and auditing features compared to Rundeck's built-in Key Storage, enhancing security *for credentials used by Rundeck*.
*   **Impact:** **Significantly Reduces** the risk of credential exposure in Rundeck jobs and **Moderately Reduces** the risk of unauthorized credential access and improves overall credential management *for Rundeck*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Rundeck's built-in Key Storage is used for some SSH keys *within Rundeck*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Credentials are still partially stored in Rundeck configuration files and job definitions. Integration with an external key vault *via a Rundeck plugin* is not yet implemented. Credential rotation and comprehensive auditing *within Rundeck's credential management* are not in place.
