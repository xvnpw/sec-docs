  - Enhance auditability and control over operational processes.
  - Provide a centralized platform for managing and executing operational workflows across diverse environments.

- Most important business risks:
  - Operational disruption due to misconfigured or malicious automation workflows.
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data through Rundeck.
  - Data breaches or leaks due to insecure handling of credentials and sensitive information within automation workflows.
  - System downtime or performance degradation caused by resource exhaustion or mismanaged automation jobs.
  - Compliance violations if Rundeck is not properly secured and audited, especially in regulated industries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
  - Automated operational tasks and workflows. Disruption of these processes can lead to service outages, delays in incident response, and increased manual effort.
  - Access to managed infrastructure and applications. Unauthorized access through Rundeck can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and operational disruption.
  - Credential management for automation. Compromised credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to managed systems.
  - Auditability and compliance of operational processes. Lack of proper auditing can lead to compliance violations and difficulty in incident investigation.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Credentials and secrets stored in Key Storage. These are highly sensitive as they provide access to managed systems.
  - Audit logs and job execution history. Sensitive as they may contain information about operational activities and potential security incidents.
  - Rundeck configuration data, including job definitions and project settings. Sensitive as misconfiguration can lead to security vulnerabilities or operational issues.
  - Data processed within automation workflows. Sensitivity depends on the specific workflows, but may include sensitive application data, infrastructure configurations, or user information.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the expected scale of Rundeck deployment (number of users, jobs, managed nodes)?
  - What are the specific compliance requirements for Rundeck deployment (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?
  - What is the organization's risk tolerance for operational disruptions and security incidents?
  - What existing security infrastructure and tools are available for integration with Rundeck (e.g., WAF, IdP, SIEM, secrets management)?
  - What is the process for managing and updating Rundeck and its dependencies?

- Assumptions:
  - Rundeck will be deployed in a typical enterprise environment with a need for high availability and security.
  - The organization has a dedicated operations team and development teams who will use Rundeck.
  - Security is a high priority for the organization, and they are willing to invest in security controls for Rundeck.
  - Rundeck will be integrated with existing monitoring and logging systems.
  - The organization has a process for managing user identities and access control.
