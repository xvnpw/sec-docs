### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Weak Passwords (leading to Insecure ACLs/Jobs)

This attack path begins with the exploitation of weak passwords, a fundamental vulnerability in many systems, including Rundeck.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Brute-Force and Dictionary Attacks

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage automated tools to systematically try numerous password combinations against Rundeck user accounts. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting every possible combination of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) within a defined length.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:**  Using lists of commonly used passwords, leaked password databases, and variations of dictionary words.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:**  Utilizing compromised credentials from other breaches, assuming users reuse passwords across services.

*   **Rundeck Context:** Rundeck's user authentication mechanism, if not properly secured, can be vulnerable to these attacks.  Default configurations or lack of enforced password policies can significantly increase the likelihood of success.  The Rundeck API and web UI are potential entry points for authentication attempts.

*   **Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability here is the **lack of strong password policies and potentially missing account lockout mechanisms** in the Rundeck configuration. If users are allowed to set simple passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", company name) and there are no limits on failed login attempts, brute-force and dictionary attacks become highly effective.

#### 4.2. Impact: Initial User-Level Access

*   **Description:** Successful password cracking grants the attacker valid credentials for a Rundeck user account.  The level of access initially gained depends on the permissions assigned to this specific user account.

*   **Rundeck Context:**  Even with seemingly limited user-level access, attackers gain a foothold within the Rundeck system. This access allows them to:
    *   **Authenticate to the Rundeck Web UI and API:**  Enabling interaction with Rundeck functionalities.
    *   **View Projects and Jobs (potentially):** Depending on the user's assigned roles and ACLs, they might be able to view project and job information.
    *   **Execute Jobs (potentially):**  Again, depending on permissions, they might be able to execute jobs they have access to.
    *   **Explore Rundeck Configuration:**  Potentially gain insights into Rundeck's setup, projects, jobs, and infrastructure.

*   **Initial Impact Severity:** While initially appearing limited, user-level access is a critical stepping stone for further exploitation. It provides attackers with an insider's perspective and the ability to probe for further vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Exploiting Insecure ACLs

*   **Description:** Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Rundeck govern user permissions for projects, jobs, nodes, and other resources.  **Insecure ACLs are overly permissive**, granting broader access than necessary, violating the principle of least privilege.

*   **Rundeck Context:** If ACLs are not meticulously configured and reviewed, compromised user accounts can inherit excessive permissions.  For example:
    *   **Overly Broad Project Access:**  An ACL might grant `read`, `run`, or even `admin` access to a project to a wide group of users, including the compromised account.
    *   **Wildcard Permissions:**  Using wildcards (`*`) excessively in ACL rules can unintentionally grant broad permissions.
    *   **Default Permissive ACLs:**  If default ACLs are not tightened, they might be too permissive out-of-the-box.

*   **Exploitation Mechanism:**  With user-level access gained through weak passwords, attackers can leverage insecure ACLs to:
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Projects:** Access projects they were not intended to access.
    *   **View Sensitive Job Definitions and Logs:**  Examine job configurations and execution logs, potentially revealing secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.
    *   **Execute Unauthorized Jobs:** Run jobs within projects they gained unauthorized access to, potentially impacting systems managed by Rundeck.
    *   **Modify ACLs (if permissions allow):** In the worst-case scenario, if the compromised user has sufficient permissions (due to insecure ACLs), they might even be able to modify ACLs to further escalate their privileges or grant access to other malicious actors.

*   **Impact Amplification:** Insecure ACLs significantly amplify the impact of weak passwords.  What starts as limited user-level access can quickly escalate to unauthorized access to critical resources and functionalities within Rundeck.

#### 4.4. Exploiting Insecure Job Definitions

*   **Description:** Rundeck jobs define automated tasks. **Insecure job definitions** contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers with sufficient permissions.

*   **Rundeck Context:**  Even if ACLs are reasonably well-configured, vulnerabilities in job definitions themselves can be exploited by compromised users who have *legitimate* access to modify or create jobs within their permitted scope. Examples of insecure job definitions include:
    *   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities:** Jobs that construct commands using user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands.
    *   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities:** Jobs that execute scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Python scripts) where user-controlled parameters are not properly validated, leading to script injection.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials or Secrets:** Jobs that contain hardcoded passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information directly within the job definition, making them accessible to anyone who can view or modify the job.
    *   **Overly Permissive Node Filters:** Jobs that target a broad range of nodes, potentially including sensitive systems, without proper justification or access control.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** Jobs that accept user input without validation, allowing attackers to manipulate job behavior or trigger unintended actions.

*   **Exploitation Mechanism:**  Compromised users, even with initially limited access, can exploit insecure job definitions to:
    *   **Modify Existing Jobs:** Inject malicious commands or scripts into jobs they have permission to edit.
    *   **Create New Malicious Jobs:**  Create new jobs with malicious payloads designed to execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate data, or disrupt operations on managed systems.
    *   **Escalate Privileges on Managed Nodes:**  Use Rundeck jobs to execute commands on managed nodes with the privileges of the Rundeck user or the user context under which the job is executed, potentially gaining root or administrator access on target systems.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Modify jobs to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data from managed systems or Rundeck itself.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Create or modify jobs to consume excessive resources on Rundeck or managed systems, leading to service disruption.

*   **Impact Amplification (Again):** Insecure job definitions, combined with even basic user-level access, provide a powerful mechanism for attackers to execute malicious actions on the systems managed by Rundeck. This can lead to significant damage and compromise beyond the Rundeck platform itself.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to address the "Weak Passwords (leading to Insecure ACLs/Jobs)" attack path:

*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    *   **Complexity Requirements:** Mandate passwords with a minimum length, and a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   **Password History:** Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
    *   **Regular Password Changes:**  Encourage or enforce periodic password resets (while balancing usability and security – consider modern password management best practices which sometimes advise against frequent forced changes).
    *   **Rundeck Configuration:**  Utilize Rundeck's authentication configuration options to enforce password policies. If Rundeck's built-in mechanisms are insufficient, consider integrating with external identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth 2.0, SAML) that offer robust password policy enforcement.

*   **Implement Account Lockout Policies:**
    *   **Failed Login Attempt Threshold:** Configure Rundeck to automatically lock user accounts after a certain number of consecutive failed login attempts.
    *   **Lockout Duration:** Define the duration for which an account remains locked.
    *   **Unlock Mechanism:**  Provide a secure mechanism for users to unlock their accounts (e.g., password reset, administrator intervention).
    *   **Rundeck Configuration:**  Leverage Rundeck's authentication settings to implement account lockout policies.

*   **Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Enhanced Security:** MFA adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.
    *   **MFA Options:** Explore Rundeck's MFA capabilities and consider implementing options like:
        *   Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) via authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
        *   Push notifications to mobile devices.
        *   Hardware security keys (U2F/FIDO2).
    *   **Rundeck Integration:**  Investigate Rundeck plugins or integrations with identity providers that support MFA.

*   **Regularly Review and Tighten ACLs (Principle of Least Privilege):**
    *   **ACL Audit:** Conduct periodic audits of Rundeck ACLs to identify and rectify overly permissive rules.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks. Avoid broad wildcard permissions and default permissive settings.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement RBAC to manage user permissions more effectively. Define roles with specific sets of permissions and assign users to roles based on their responsibilities.
    *   **Documentation and Training:**  Provide clear documentation and training to Rundeck administrators on how to configure and maintain secure ACLs.
    *   **Automated ACL Management (if feasible):** Explore tools or scripts to automate ACL management and ensure consistency and adherence to security policies.

*   **Secure Job Definitions:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied parameters in job definitions to prevent command and script injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:**  Never hardcode credentials or secrets directly into job definitions. Utilize Rundeck's Key Storage or external secret management solutions to securely manage and inject secrets into jobs.
    *   **Least Privilege for Job Execution:**  Configure jobs to execute with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running jobs as root or administrator unless absolutely required.
    *   **Regular Job Definition Review:**  Periodically review job definitions for potential security vulnerabilities and ensure they adhere to secure coding practices.
    *   **Code Review for Job Definitions:** Implement code review processes for new and modified job definitions to identify and address security issues before deployment.

*   **Security Awareness Training:**
    *   Educate Rundeck users and administrators about the importance of strong passwords, phishing attacks, and other social engineering techniques that attackers might use to obtain credentials.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing of the Rundeck instance to identify and address vulnerabilities, including those related to weak passwords and access control.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Weak Passwords (leading to Insecure ACLs/Jobs)" attack path represents a significant security risk to Rundeck environments.  While weak passwords are the initial entry point, the true danger lies in the potential for attackers to leverage this initial compromise to exploit insecure ACLs and job definitions, leading to widespread system compromise.

Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly enforcing strong password policies, implementing MFA, rigorously reviewing and tightening ACLs, and securing job definitions, is crucial to effectively defend against this attack path and strengthen the overall security posture of the Rundeck platform.  A layered security approach, combining these mitigations, will provide the most robust defense. Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and ongoing security awareness training are also essential for maintaining a secure Rundeck environment.
