```

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known Rundeck CVEs [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_rundeck_cves__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers scan for publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific Rundeck versions. They utilize public exploit code or develop their own to target unpatched Rundeck instances.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Rundeck server, potentially granting full system compromise and control over managed applications and infrastructure.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement a robust patch management process. Regularly update Rundeck and its dependencies to the latest versions to address known vulnerabilities. Utilize vulnerability scanners to proactively identify and remediate CVEs.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__default_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to Rundeck using default administrator or user credentials (e.g., `admin`/`admin`, `rundeck`/`rundeck`). This is often a first step in reconnaissance.
*   **Impact:** If default credentials are not changed, attackers gain immediate administrative access to Rundeck. This allows them to control all Rundeck functionalities, including job execution, node management, and configuration, leading to full application compromise.
*   **Mitigation:** Immediately change all default Rundeck administrator and user passwords during initial setup. Enforce strong password policies and consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Weak Passwords (leading to Insecure ACLs/Jobs) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__weak_passwords__leading_to_insecure_aclsjobs___high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to brute-force or use dictionary attacks to guess weak passwords for Rundeck user accounts.
*   **Impact:** Successful password cracking grants attackers user-level access to Rundeck. While initially limited, this access can be leveraged to:
    *   **Exploit Insecure ACLs:** If ACLs are overly permissive, compromised user accounts can gain unauthorized access to sensitive projects and jobs.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Job Definitions:**  Compromised users might be able to modify or create jobs with malicious payloads if permissions are not properly restricted.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies, including complexity requirements and regular password changes. Implement account lockout policies to limit brute-force attempts. Consider MFA for enhanced account security. Regularly review and tighten ACLs to follow the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Insecure Access Control Lists (ACLs) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__insecure_access_control_lists__acls___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigured or overly permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) within Rundeck. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to projects, jobs, nodes, or API endpoints beyond their intended permissions.
*   **Impact:**  Insecure ACLs can lead to:
    *   **Data Exposure:** Access to sensitive project configurations, job definitions, or execution logs.
    *   **Unauthorized Job Execution:** Ability to run or modify jobs, potentially leading to malicious actions on managed nodes.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to administrative functionalities if ACLs are severely misconfigured.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring ACLs. Regularly review and audit ACL configurations to ensure they are correctly applied and restrict access to only necessary users and roles. Use role-based access control (RBAC) effectively.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Command Injection in Job Steps [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/5__command_injection_in_job_steps__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious commands into job steps, typically through job parameters or configuration fields that are not properly sanitized or validated. Rundeck then executes these injected commands on the Rundeck server or target nodes during job execution.
*   **Impact:** Command injection can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Rundeck server or managed nodes. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.
*   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all inputs to job steps, including parameters and configuration fields. Avoid directly using user-supplied input in shell commands or scripts without proper escaping and sanitization. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where applicable. Implement security code reviews for job definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Insecure Script Execution (e.g., Shell Script Injection) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__insecure_script_execution__e_g___shell_script_injection___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to command injection, but specifically targets scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Python scripts) executed by Rundeck jobs. Attackers inject malicious code into these scripts, often by manipulating input variables or configuration.
*   **Impact:** Script injection can also lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Rundeck server or target nodes, with similar consequences as command injection.
*   **Mitigation:**  Apply the same input sanitization and validation principles as for command injection. Carefully review and audit job scripts for potential injection points. Avoid dynamically generating scripts based on untrusted input. Use secure coding practices when writing job scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Inject Malicious Jobs [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/7__inject_malicious_jobs__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers, having gained some level of access to Rundeck (e.g., through compromised credentials or ACL exploitation), create new jobs or modify existing jobs to execute malicious commands or scripts on managed nodes.
*   **Impact:**  Malicious job injection allows attackers to perform a wide range of actions on target nodes, including:
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromising additional systems within the network.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from managed nodes.
    *   **System Disruption:**  Causing denial of service or other disruptions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attempting to gain higher privileges on target nodes.
*   **Mitigation:**  Strictly control job creation and modification permissions using Rundeck's ACLs. Implement change management processes for job definitions. Monitor job activity and audit logs for suspicious job creation or modifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. API Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/8__api_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Rundeck API that allow them to inject malicious commands or code through API requests. This can occur if API endpoints do not properly validate or sanitize input parameters.
*   **Impact:** API injection can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Rundeck server, potentially granting full control over the Rundeck instance and managed applications.
*   **Mitigation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input parameters to Rundeck API endpoints. Implement secure API development practices, including input validation, output encoding, and authorization checks. Conduct regular API security testing and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Social Engineering/Phishing Targeting Rundeck Users [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/9__social_engineeringphishing_targeting_rundeck_users__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails, to trick Rundeck administrators or users into revealing their credentials or performing malicious actions (e.g., clicking malicious links that lead to credential harvesting or running malicious jobs).
*   **Impact:** Successful phishing attacks can compromise user accounts, granting attackers access to Rundeck functionalities based on the compromised user's permissions. This can lead to any of the attacks described above, depending on the level of access gained.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive security awareness training for all Rundeck users, focusing on phishing and social engineering threats. Conduct phishing simulations to test user awareness. Deploy email security solutions to filter phishing emails. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce the impact of compromised credentials.
