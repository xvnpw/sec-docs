## Threat Model: Compromising Application via Rundeck - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** To compromise application utilizing Rundeck by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Rundeck itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Rundeck [CRITICAL]**
    * **Exploit Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL]**
        * **Leverage known authentication bypass vulnerabilities (if any)**
        * **Exploit misconfigurations leading to authentication bypass**
    * **Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        * **Command Injection [CRITICAL]**
            * **Inject malicious commands into job definitions or API calls**
    * **Exploit Known CVEs [CRITICAL]**
        * **Leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific Rundeck version**
* **Abuse Rundeck Features for Malicious Purposes [CRITICAL - Gateway to many high-impact actions]**
    * **Execute Arbitrary Commands on Target Systems [CRITICAL]**
        * **Create and execute malicious jobs**
        * **Modify existing jobs to include malicious commands**
    * **Access Sensitive Information**
        * **Retrieve stored credentials (passwords, API keys) [CRITICAL]**
    * **Exfiltrate Data**
        * **Create jobs that transfer sensitive data to attacker-controlled systems**
    * **Modify Application Infrastructure**
        * **Execute commands that alter the configuration or state of managed systems**
* **Compromise Rundeck's Configuration and Data**
    * **Access Rundeck Keystore [CRITICAL]**
        * **Retrieve stored secrets and credentials**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Leverage known authentication bypass vulnerabilities (if any):** Attackers exploit publicly known flaws in the Rundeck authentication mechanism to bypass the login process without valid credentials. This often involves using readily available exploit code.
    * **Exploit misconfigurations leading to authentication bypass:** Attackers take advantage of insecure configurations, such as default credentials not being changed, weak password policies, or improperly configured authentication modules, to gain unauthorized access.

* **Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Command Injection [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Inject malicious commands into job definitions or API calls:** Attackers insert malicious operating system commands into input fields that Rundeck uses to execute commands on managed systems. This allows them to run arbitrary code on the target servers.

* **Exploit Known CVEs [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific Rundeck version:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that affect the specific version of Rundeck being used. This often involves using existing exploit code or tools targeting these known weaknesses.

* **Abuse Rundeck Features for Malicious Purposes [CRITICAL - Gateway to many high-impact actions]:** This category represents the misuse of Rundeck's intended functionality to achieve malicious goals.

* **Execute Arbitrary Commands on Target Systems [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Create and execute malicious jobs:** Attackers, after gaining some level of access, create new Rundeck jobs that contain malicious commands designed to compromise target systems.
    * **Modify existing jobs to include malicious commands:** Attackers with sufficient privileges modify existing, legitimate Rundeck jobs to include malicious commands that will be executed during the job's normal run.

* **Access Sensitive Information:**
    * **Retrieve stored credentials (passwords, API keys) [CRITICAL]:** Attackers attempt to access Rundeck's secure storage mechanisms (like the Key Storage) to retrieve stored credentials used for accessing managed systems or other services. This provides them with valuable credentials for further attacks.

* **Exfiltrate Data:**
    * **Create jobs that transfer sensitive data to attacker-controlled systems:** Attackers create Rundeck jobs designed to extract sensitive data from managed systems and transfer it to systems under their control.

* **Modify Application Infrastructure:**
    * **Execute commands that alter the configuration or state of managed systems:** Attackers use Rundeck's command execution capabilities to make changes to the configuration or operational state of the systems it manages, potentially disrupting services or creating backdoors.

* **Access Rundeck Keystore [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Retrieve stored secrets and credentials:** Attackers directly target Rundeck's keystore, which is designed to securely store sensitive information. Successful access to the keystore grants them access to all stored secrets and credentials, leading to widespread compromise.
