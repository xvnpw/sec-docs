# Threat Model Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Threat: [Malicious Job Definition Injection](./threats/malicious_job_definition_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Job Definition Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker with `job_create` or `job_admin` privileges crafts or modifies a job definition to include malicious commands. This could involve injecting shell commands into script steps, using malicious script plugins, or manipulating job options to execute arbitrary code on Rundeck nodes during job execution.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of Rundeck nodes, unauthorized access to systems and data, data breaches, denial of service, lateral movement within the network by leveraging compromised nodes.
*   **Affected Rundeck Component:** Job Definition Subsystem, Job Execution Engine, Script Plugins, Job Option Handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict Access Control Lists (ACLs) to limit `job_create` and `job_admin` privileges to only highly trusted users.
    *   Enforce code review for all job definitions, especially those created by less trusted users.
    *   Sanitize and validate all job options and inputs before using them in job steps.
    *   Utilize secure scripting practices within job definitions, avoiding direct shell command execution where possible and using parameterized commands.
    *   Regularly audit job definitions for suspicious or unauthorized changes.
    *   Consider using restricted execution modes or sandboxing for job execution environments (if available through plugins or custom configurations).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Execution](./threats/unauthorized_job_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Job Execution
*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to execute jobs they are not authorized to run. This could be due to ACL misconfigurations, vulnerabilities in authentication, or privilege escalation attempts within Rundeck.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed systems, potential data breaches by executing jobs that access sensitive information, disruption of services by triggering unintended jobs.
*   **Affected Rundeck Component:** Access Control List (ACL) System, Authentication System, Job Execution Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement and regularly review a robust Access Control List (ACL) system, ensuring jobs are only executable by authorized users and roles.
    *   Utilize strong authentication mechanisms and enforce strong password policies for Rundeck users.
    *   Regularly audit ACL configurations for misconfigurations and overly permissive rules.
    *   Monitor job execution attempts and flag unauthorized execution attempts for investigation.
    *   Implement least privilege principles for user roles and permissions within Rundeck.

## Threat: [Insecure Job Step Plugins](./threats/insecure_job_step_plugins.md)

*   **Impact:** Node compromise, Rundeck server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the plugin vulnerability and execution context.
*   **Affected Rundeck Component:** Plugin System, Job Step Plugins (both built-in and external).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct security audits and penetration testing of custom plugins before deployment.
    *   Implement plugin whitelisting to restrict the use of only approved plugins.
    *   Monitor plugin activity and investigate any suspicious behavior.
    *   For custom plugins, follow secure coding practices and perform thorough vulnerability assessments.

## Threat: [Job Option Parameter Injection](./threats/job_option_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Job Option Parameter Injection
*   **Description:** Job options, user-provided parameters, are not properly sanitized and validated. Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., shell commands) into job options, which is then executed on Rundeck nodes when the job runs.
*   **Impact:** Command injection on Rundeck nodes, unauthorized access to systems and data, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Affected Rundeck Component:** Job Option Handling, Job Execution Engine, Script Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all job options.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce secure communication protocols for all node communication (e.g., SSH with key-based authentication, HTTPS for WinRM).
    *   Use strong encryption and authentication mechanisms for node communication.
    *   Regularly review and update node communication configurations to ensure security best practices are followed.
    *   Monitor node communication channels for suspicious activity.
    *   Avoid using insecure or deprecated communication protocols.

## Threat: [Node Executor Vulnerabilities](./threats/node_executor_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Node Executor Vulnerabilities

    *   Use automated tools to validate ACL configurations and detect potential bypasses.
    *   Enforce separation of duties and role-based access control within Rundeck.
    *   Thoroughly test ACL rules to ensure they function as intended and prevent unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Authentication Weaknesses](./threats/authentication_weaknesses.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Weaknesses
*   **Description:** Weak authentication mechanisms or vulnerabilities in Rundeck's authentication system allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the Rundeck web UI or API. This could include default credentials, weak password policies, vulnerabilities in authentication plugins (LDAP, Active Directory), or session hijacking.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Rundeck, ability to create/modify/execute jobs, manage nodes, and potentially compromise managed infrastructure.
*   **Affected Rundeck Component:** Authentication System, User Management, Web UI, API.
