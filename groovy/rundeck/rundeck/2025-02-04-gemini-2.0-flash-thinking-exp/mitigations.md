## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement in Rundeck](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__enforcement_in_rundeck.md)

*   Description:
    *   Step 1: Choose a supported MFA plugin or authentication module for Rundeck (e.g., Google Authenticator plugin, Duo Security plugin, SAML/OAuth 2.0 integration with an MFA-enabled Identity Provider).
    *   Step 2: Install and configure the chosen MFA plugin within Rundeck. This typically involves modifying Rundeck configuration files like `rundeck-config.properties` or using the Rundeck UI for plugin management.
    *   Step 3: Enable MFA requirement for specific user roles or all users within Rundeck through the plugin's configuration or Rundeck's authentication settings.
    *   Step 4: Guide Rundeck users on how to set up MFA for their Rundeck accounts using the chosen method.
    *   Step 5: Regularly review and maintain the MFA plugin and configuration within Rundeck to ensure continued security.

*   Threats Mitigated:
    *   **Unauthorized Rundeck Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized login to Rundeck due to compromised usernames and passwords.
    *   **Credential-Based Attacks on Rundeck (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk from password reuse, credential stuffing, and phishing attacks targeting Rundeck logins.
