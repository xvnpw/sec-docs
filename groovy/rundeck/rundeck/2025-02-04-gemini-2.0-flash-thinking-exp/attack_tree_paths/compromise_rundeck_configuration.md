### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Rundeck Configuration

#### 3.1. Insecure Credentials Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Rundeck configuration files stored on the server's filesystem to extract sensitive credentials. This access could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting web application vulnerabilities, gaining SSH access due to weak server security, or insider threats.

*   **Critical Nodes:**

    *   **Locate Rundeck configuration files:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers will start by probing common locations where Rundeck configuration files are typically stored. This includes:
            *   Rundeck installation directory (often under `/etc/rundeck` or `/opt/rundeck`).
            *   User home directories if Rundeck is configured to load configurations from there.
            *   Environment variables that might point to configuration file locations.
            *   Default configuration file names like `rundeck-config.properties`, `realm.properties`, `jaas-auth.conf`, `project.properties`, and potentially plugin-specific configuration files.
        *   **Attacker Techniques:** Attackers might use techniques like:
            *   **Directory traversal vulnerabilities:** If the Rundeck application itself has vulnerabilities, attackers might exploit them to browse the filesystem and locate configuration files.
            *   **Information disclosure vulnerabilities:**  Errors or debug logs might inadvertently reveal file paths.
            *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** In certain scenarios, SSRF could be used to access local files.
            *   **Compromised web server or application server:** If the underlying web server (e.g., Jetty, Tomcat) or application server is compromised, attackers can directly access the filesystem.
            *   **SSH/RDP access:** If attackers gain access to the server via SSH or RDP (due to weak credentials or vulnerabilities), they can directly browse the filesystem.

    *   **Extract stored credentials (e.g., database passwords, API keys, node credentials):**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Once configuration files are located, attackers will parse their content to identify and extract sensitive information.  This often involves:
            *   **Searching for keywords:** Attackers will look for keywords commonly associated with credentials, such as `password`, `db.password`, `apiKey`, `sshPrivateKey`, `username`, `auth.token`, etc.
            *   **Decoding/Decrypting:**  While plaintext storage is the most critical issue, credentials might be stored in weakly encoded or encrypted formats. Attackers will attempt to reverse these (e.g., simple base64 decoding, easily reversible encryption).
            *   **Analyzing file formats:** Understanding the file format (e.g., properties files, XML, YAML) helps attackers parse the files correctly and extract values associated with credential keys.
        *   **Types of Credentials Targeted:**
            *   **Database credentials:**  For Rundeck's internal database or external databases it connects to.
            *   **API keys:** For integrations with other systems (e.g., cloud providers, monitoring tools).
            *   **Node credentials:** SSH keys, passwords, or WinRM credentials used to connect to managed nodes.
            *   **Service account credentials:** Credentials used by Rundeck to interact with other services.
            *   **LDAP/Active Directory credentials:** If Rundeck is configured to authenticate against LDAP/AD, the bind credentials might be stored in configuration.

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Security Mistake:** Storing credentials in configuration files, especially in plaintext or easily reversible formats, is a fundamental security flaw. It violates the principle of least privilege and significantly increases the risk of credential compromise.
    *   **Impact of Compromised Credentials:**
        *   **Database Access:** Database credentials grant direct access to Rundeck's data, potentially allowing attackers to modify data, extract sensitive information about jobs and executions, or even gain administrative control over Rundeck itself.
        *   **API Access:** Compromised API keys can allow attackers to impersonate Rundeck or integrated systems, leading to unauthorized actions, data breaches, or service disruptions.
        *   **Node Access:** Node credentials are particularly critical. If compromised, attackers can gain direct access to managed servers, bypassing Rundeck's intended control mechanisms. This can lead to full server compromise, data breaches, and lateral movement within the infrastructure.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised credentials can be reused to access other systems and services if the same credentials are used elsewhere (credential reuse).

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Eliminate Storing Credentials in Configuration Files:**  This is the most critical step.  Never store sensitive credentials directly in configuration files.
    *   **Utilize Secure Credential Stores:**
        *   **Rundeck Key Storage:** Leverage Rundeck's built-in Key Storage feature to securely store credentials. Key Storage supports encryption and access control.
        *   **External Secret Management Systems (Vault, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, CyberArk):** Integrate Rundeck with dedicated secret management systems. These systems provide robust security features like encryption, access control, auditing, and secret rotation. Rundeck has plugins and mechanisms to integrate with these systems.
    *   **Environment Variables:** If direct file storage cannot be completely avoided for certain configurations, use environment variables to inject sensitive values at runtime. Ensure environment variables are managed securely and not logged or exposed inadvertently.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes that need access to credentials.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review Rundeck configurations and credential storage practices to identify and remediate any insecure configurations.
    *   **File System Permissions:**  Restrict access to Rundeck configuration files using appropriate file system permissions. Ensure only the Rundeck process and authorized administrators have read access.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:**  Encrypt the filesystem where Rundeck configuration files are stored to protect against offline attacks if storage media is compromised.

#### 3.2. Weak Authentication and Authorization Configuration - Default Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to the Rundeck web interface or API using commonly known default usernames and passwords that are often set during initial installation and not changed by administrators.

*   **Critical Nodes:**

    *   **Attempt default Rundeck credentials:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers will use lists of default credentials commonly associated with Rundeck and related technologies (like Jetty or Spring Boot if applicable).  Common default usernames for Rundeck include: `admin`, `rundeck`, `user`, `rundeckuser`. Default passwords are often `admin`, `rundeck`, `password`, `rundeckuser`, or the username itself.
        *   **Automated Tools:** Attackers use automated tools and scripts to quickly try these default credentials against the Rundeck login page or API endpoints. Tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or custom scripts can be used for this purpose.
        *   **Login Pages and API Endpoints:** Attackers will target both the web login page (typically `/user/login`) and API endpoints that might be vulnerable to authentication bypass or default credential usage.

    *   **Gain initial access with default credentials:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** If default credentials are still active, attackers will successfully authenticate and gain access to Rundeck. The level of access depends on the default user's role and permissions. In many cases, default accounts have administrative privileges, granting full control over Rundeck.
        *   **Immediate Exploitation:** Once initial access is gained, attackers can immediately start exploiting Rundeck's functionalities for malicious purposes, such as:
            *   **Creating malicious jobs:** To execute arbitrary commands on managed nodes.
            *   **Modifying existing jobs:** To inject malicious steps into legitimate workflows.
            *   **Accessing sensitive data:** Viewing job logs, execution history, and potentially accessing stored credentials within Rundeck (if insecurely stored as described in 3.1).
            *   **Privilege escalation:** If the default account doesn't have full admin privileges, attackers might attempt to escalate privileges by exploiting other vulnerabilities within Rundeck or the underlying system.

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Basic but Effective:**  Using default credentials is a very basic attack vector, but surprisingly effective because administrators often overlook or forget to change them after installation, especially in development or test environments that later become production-facing.
    *   **Initial Foothold:** Successful exploitation of default credentials provides attackers with an initial foothold within the Rundeck environment. This foothold can then be used to launch more sophisticated attacks.
    *   **Lack of Basic Security Hygiene:**  Failure to change default credentials indicates a lack of basic security hygiene and awareness, which often points to other potential security weaknesses in the deployment.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Change Default Credentials Immediately:**  The most critical mitigation is to **immediately change all default usernames and passwords** during the initial Rundeck setup process. This should be a mandatory step in any deployment checklist.
    *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement strong password policies for all Rundeck user accounts, including complexity requirements, minimum length, and password expiration.
    *   **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks. After a certain number of failed login attempts, temporarily lock the account.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all Rundeck user accounts, especially administrative accounts. This adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Periodically audit Rundeck configurations and conduct penetration testing to identify and remediate any remaining default credentials or weak authentication configurations.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate administrators and users about the importance of changing default credentials and using strong passwords.
    *   **Automated Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate the initial configuration of Rundeck, including setting strong initial passwords and disabling default accounts if possible.

#### 3.3. Weak Authentication and Authorization Configuration - Weak Passwords [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to crack weak passwords of Rundeck user accounts using brute-force or dictionary attacks. This can be done against the login page or API endpoints.

*   **Critical Nodes:**

    *   **Attempt brute-force or dictionary attacks on Rundeck user accounts:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers utilize automated password cracking tools like Hydra, Medusa, or Burp Suite Intruder.
            *   **Brute-force attacks:** Try all possible combinations of characters within a defined length. Effective against short and simple passwords.
            *   **Dictionary attacks:** Use lists of commonly used passwords, words, and phrases. Effective against passwords based on dictionary words or common patterns.
            *   **Hybrid attacks:** Combine dictionary words with numbers, symbols, and character substitutions.
        *   **Targeting Login Forms and APIs:** Attacks can be directed at:
            *   **Web Login Form:** Attackers automate login attempts against the Rundeck web login page.
            *   **API Endpoints:** Some API endpoints might be vulnerable to password guessing if not properly protected by rate limiting or other security measures.
        *   **Credential Stuffing:** If attackers have obtained lists of compromised usernames and passwords from other breaches, they might attempt to use these credentials to log in to Rundeck (credential stuffing).

    *   **Gain access with cracked passwords:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** If users choose weak passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "companyname", pet names, birthdays), password cracking tools can successfully crack them relatively quickly.
        *   **User Privileges:** The level of access gained depends on the privileges of the compromised user account. If an administrator account is compromised, the attacker gains full control. Even with lower-privileged accounts, attackers can still perform unauthorized actions, escalate privileges, or use the account as a stepping stone for further attacks.

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **User Responsibility:** Weak passwords are often a result of users choosing easily guessable passwords or reusing passwords across multiple accounts.
    *   **Readily Available Tools:** Password cracking tools are widely available and easy to use, making this attack vector accessible even to less sophisticated attackers.
    *   **Impact of Weak Passwords:** Weak passwords are a significant security vulnerability and can lead to unauthorized access to Rundeck and potentially the entire managed infrastructure.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies (as mentioned in 3.2):** Implement and enforce robust password policies, including complexity, length, and expiration.
    *   **Password Complexity Requirements:** Mandate the use of a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in passwords.
    *   **Minimum Password Length:** Enforce a minimum password length (e.g., 14 characters or more).
    *   **Password Expiration and Rotation:** Consider implementing password expiration policies to force users to change passwords regularly.
    *   **Password Strength Meter:** Integrate a password strength meter into the Rundeck user interface during password creation and change to guide users in choosing strong passwords.
    *   **Account Lockout Policies (as mentioned in 3.2):** Implement account lockout policies to mitigate brute-force attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts to slow down brute-force attacks against login forms and API endpoints.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (as mentioned in 3.2):** MFA significantly reduces the risk of password-based attacks.
    *   **Password Auditing Tools:** Periodically use password auditing tools to check for weak passwords within Rundeck user accounts.
    *   **Security Awareness Training (as mentioned in 3.2):** Educate users about the importance of choosing strong, unique passwords and avoiding password reuse.

#### 3.4. Weak Authentication and Authorization Configuration - Overly Permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in Rundeck Access Control Lists (ACLs) to gain unauthorized privileges. This allows them to perform actions they are not intended to be authorized for, potentially leading to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to Rundeck functionalities and managed nodes.

*   **Critical Nodes:**

    *   **Analyze Rundeck ACL configuration:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers will examine the Rundeck ACL configuration to understand the current access permissions. This involves:
            *   **Accessing ACL Files:**  ACL definitions in Rundeck are typically stored in files (e.g., `realm.properties`, `jaas-auth.conf`, project-specific ACL files). Attackers might attempt to access these files directly if they have filesystem access (as described in 3.1).
            *   **Using Rundeck API (if authenticated):** If attackers have gained initial access (e.g., through default credentials or weak passwords), they can use the Rundeck API to inspect the effective ACL policies for different users, roles, and resources.
            *   **Observing Application Behavior:**  Attackers might try to perform various actions within Rundeck and observe the responses to understand their current permissions and identify potential gaps or overly permissive rules.

    *   **Identify overly permissive ACLs granting excessive privileges to users/roles:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers look for common misconfigurations in ACLs that grant broader permissions than intended. Examples include:
            *   **Wildcard Permissions:** Overuse of wildcards (`*`) in resource or action definitions, granting access to a wider range of resources or actions than necessary. For example, `resource: job:*:*` might grant access to all jobs, including sensitive ones.
            *   **Broad Role Assignments:** Assigning overly powerful roles (e.g., `admin`, `ops`) to users who don't require such extensive privileges.
            *   **Missing or Incomplete ACL Rules:**  Lack of specific deny rules can lead to implicit allow rules based on broader, less restrictive policies.
            *   **Conflicting ACL Rules:** Complex ACL configurations can have conflicting rules, and the effective permissions might not be what administrators intended.
            *   **Permissions Creep:** Over time, as Rundeck evolves and new features are added, ACLs might not be updated accordingly, leading to users retaining permissions they no longer need.

    *   **Exploit excessive privileges to perform unauthorized actions:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Once overly permissive ACLs are identified, attackers can leverage these excessive privileges to:
            *   **Privilege Escalation:**  A user with limited initial privileges can exploit overly permissive ACLs to gain higher-level privileges, potentially reaching administrative access.
            *   **Unauthorized Job Execution:** Execute jobs they are not supposed to run, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or triggering malicious actions on managed nodes.
            *   **Data Exfiltration:** Access job logs, execution history, or other Rundeck data they are not authorized to view, potentially leading to data breaches.
            *   **Configuration Tampering:** Modify Rundeck configurations, jobs, or nodes, potentially disrupting operations or creating backdoors.
            *   **Node Compromise:**  If ACLs allow unauthorized job execution on nodes, attackers can use this to compromise managed nodes.

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Complexity of ACLs:** Rundeck ACLs can be complex to configure and manage, especially in large deployments with many users, roles, and projects. This complexity increases the risk of misconfigurations.
    *   **Human Error:** ACL misconfigurations are often due to human error during setup or changes to the ACL policies.
    *   **Significant Impact:** Overly permissive ACLs can have a significant impact, allowing attackers to bypass intended access controls and gain unauthorized access to critical Rundeck functionalities and managed infrastructure.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (for ACLs):** Design ACLs based on the principle of least privilege. Grant users and roles only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
    *   **Regular ACL Reviews and Audits:** Periodically review and audit Rundeck ACL configurations to identify and correct any overly permissive rules or misconfigurations.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC effectively. Define roles with specific sets of permissions and assign users to roles based on their job functions. Avoid granting individual users direct permissions whenever possible.
    *   **Granular Permissions:** Utilize Rundeck's granular permission system to define precise permissions for different resources and actions. Avoid using broad wildcards unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Testing and Validation of ACLs:** Thoroughly test and validate ACL configurations after any changes to ensure they are working as intended and do not introduce unintended permissions.
    *   **Centralized ACL Management:**  If managing ACLs across multiple Rundeck instances or projects, consider using centralized ACL management tools or approaches to ensure consistency and reduce errors.
    *   **Documentation of ACL Policies:**  Document the rationale behind ACL policies and the intended permissions for different roles and users. This helps in understanding and maintaining the ACL configuration over time.
    *   **Automated ACL Management (Infrastructure as Code):**  Manage ACL configurations as code using tools like Ansible or Rundeck's own API. This allows for version control, automated deployment, and easier auditing of ACL changes.
    *   **Security Training for ACL Administrators:** Provide specific security training to administrators responsible for configuring and managing Rundeck ACLs, emphasizing best practices and common pitfalls.

#### 3.5. Misconfigured Node Execution Settings [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in how Rundeck connects to and executes commands on managed nodes. This can involve weak SSH keys, shared credentials, overly broad access permissions, or insecure communication protocols. Exploiting these misconfigurations can allow attackers to bypass Rundeck's intended access controls and gain direct, unauthorized access to managed nodes.

*   **Critical Nodes:**

    *   **Analyze node execution configuration (e.g., SSH keys, WinRM credentials):**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers will examine how Rundeck is configured to connect to managed nodes. This includes:
            *   **Node Definitions:** Inspecting node definitions in Rundeck to understand the configured connection methods (SSH, WinRM, etc.) and credential types.
            *   **Credential Storage for Nodes:** Investigating how node credentials are stored within Rundeck (Key Storage, plugins, etc.).  Attackers will look for insecure storage practices as described in 3.1.
            *   **SSH Key Management:** Analyzing how SSH keys are managed for node access. Are weak keys used? Are keys shared across multiple nodes? Are keys properly protected?
            *   **WinRM Configuration:** If WinRM is used, attackers will check for weak WinRM credentials, insecure authentication methods (e.g., Basic Auth), and overly permissive WinRM configurations.
            *   **Execution Mode Configuration:** Examining Rundeck's execution modes (e.g., SSH, script, local) and any associated security settings.

    *   **Identify misconfigurations (e.g., weak keys, shared credentials, overly broad access):**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers will look for specific misconfigurations that weaken node security:
            *   **Weak SSH Keys:** Using short SSH key lengths (e.g., less than 2048 bits for RSA), outdated key algorithms (e.g., DSA), or default/well-known private keys.
            *   **Shared Credentials:** Reusing the same SSH keys or WinRM credentials across multiple nodes. If one node is compromised, all nodes using the same credentials are at risk.
            *   **Overly Broad Access Permissions:** Granting Rundeck or the Rundeck user account excessive permissions on managed nodes. For example, running Rundeck jobs as `root` or `Administrator` on managed nodes is highly risky.
            *   **Insecure Communication Protocols:** Using insecure protocols like Telnet or unencrypted HTTP for node communication (though less common, misconfigurations can happen).
            *   **Lack of Host Key Verification:** Disabling or improperly configuring SSH host key verification, which can allow man-in-the-middle attacks.
            *   **Permissive Firewall Rules:**  Overly permissive firewall rules allowing unrestricted access to SSH or WinRM ports on managed nodes from the Rundeck server or wider network.

    *   **Exploit misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to managed nodes:**
        *   **Deep Dive:** Attackers leverage identified misconfigurations to directly access managed nodes, bypassing Rundeck's intended control:
            *   **SSH Key Compromise:** If weak or shared SSH keys are used, attackers can potentially crack weak keys or compromise one node and use the shared key to access others.
            *   **WinRM Credential Theft:** If WinRM credentials are weak or insecurely stored, attackers can steal them and use them to directly access Windows nodes.
            *   **Bypassing Rundeck ACLs:** By gaining direct access to nodes, attackers can bypass Rundeck's ACLs and perform actions outside of Rundeck's control.
            *   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised nodes can be used as a launching point for lateral movement within the network to attack other systems.
            *   **Data Breaches and System Disruption:** Direct node access can lead to data breaches, system disruption, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **Node Configuration is Critical:** Secure node configuration is paramount for maintaining the security of the entire managed infrastructure. Misconfigurations in node execution settings can negate the security benefits of Rundeck's access controls.
    *   **Bypassing Rundeck's Security:** Exploiting node execution misconfigurations allows attackers to bypass Rundeck's intended security boundaries and directly access managed infrastructure.
    *   **High Impact:** Successful exploitation of these misconfigurations can have a very high impact, leading to full compromise of managed nodes and potentially the entire infrastructure.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   **Use Strong SSH Keys:** Generate and use strong SSH keys (at least 2048 bits RSA or 256 bits ECDSA/EdDSA) for node access. Use strong key algorithms.
    *   **Dedicated SSH Keys per Node (or Node Group):** Avoid sharing SSH keys across multiple nodes. Generate unique SSH keys for each node or group of nodes with similar security requirements.
    *   **Secure SSH Key Storage (Rundeck Key Storage):** Store SSH private keys securely within Rundeck's Key Storage or an external secret management system.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Node Permissions):** Grant Rundeck and the Rundeck user account only the minimum necessary permissions on managed nodes. Avoid running Rundeck jobs as `root` or `Administrator` unless absolutely required and with extreme caution. Use sudo or similar mechanisms to elevate privileges only when needed and for specific commands.
    *   **WinRM Security Best Practices:** If using WinRM, follow WinRM security best practices:
        *   Use HTTPS for WinRM communication.
        *   Use strong WinRM credentials and store them securely.
        *   Configure WinRM authentication methods securely (e.g., Negotiate with Kerberos).
        *   Restrict WinRM access to authorized sources.
    *   **Host Key Verification:** Enable and properly configure SSH host key verification to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Regularly Rotate Node Credentials:** Implement a process for regularly rotating SSH keys and WinRM credentials used for node access.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalling:** Segment the network and use firewalls to restrict access to SSH and WinRM ports on managed nodes. Allow access only from authorized sources (e.g., Rundeck server).
    *   **Security Audits of Node Configurations:** Periodically audit Rundeck node configurations and managed node security settings to identify and remediate any misconfigurations.
    *   **Automated Node Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools to automate the secure configuration of managed nodes, including SSH key management, WinRM settings, and user permissions.

By addressing these mitigation strategies for each sub-path within the "Compromise Rundeck Configuration" attack tree, organizations can significantly strengthen the security of their Rundeck deployments and reduce the risk of successful attacks. Regular security assessments and ongoing vigilance are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
