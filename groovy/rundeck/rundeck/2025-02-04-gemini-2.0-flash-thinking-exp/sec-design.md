    - requirement: Granular role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to specific projects, jobs, and resources.
    - requirement: Policy-based authorization to enforce fine-grained access control based on attributes and context.
    - requirement: Least privilege principle should be applied when assigning permissions to users and roles.
  - Input Validation:
