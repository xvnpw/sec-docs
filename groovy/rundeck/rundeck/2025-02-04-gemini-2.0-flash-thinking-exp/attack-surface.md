# Attack Surface Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Attack Surface: [ACL Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/acl_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) grant unauthorized users or roles access to sensitive Rundeck resources, including administrative functions, projects, jobs, and nodes. This allows for actions beyond their intended privileges.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's authorization model is entirely based on ACLs. The complexity of ACL rules and the potential for administrative errors in their configuration directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An administrator mistakenly grants the `project_user` role `run` access to all jobs in the `admin` project. This allows regular users to execute administrative jobs, potentially leading to system-wide changes or access to sensitive infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive administrative functions and data, ability to execute arbitrary jobs in restricted contexts, potential for full system compromise if administrative access is gained.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict ACL Management:** Implement a rigorous process for defining, reviewing, and approving ACL changes.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the minimum necessary permissions to users and roles. Avoid overly permissive wildcard rules.
    *   **Regular ACL Audits:** Conduct frequent audits of ACL configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or unintended access grants.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Leverage roles effectively to simplify ACL management and ensure consistent permission assignments.
    *   **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test ACL configurations in a non-production environment before deploying them to production.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection in Job Definitions](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_in_job_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise when user-controlled input (like job options or node attributes) is improperly sanitized and directly incorporated into commands or scripts executed within Rundeck job definitions. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands that Rundeck executes on the server or managed nodes.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's core purpose is to execute commands and scripts defined in jobs. The flexibility to use dynamic variables within job steps, without proper input handling, directly enables command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A job step executes a shell script using a job option named `target_host`. An attacker provides a malicious value for `target_host` like ``; touch /tmp/pwned #``. Rundeck executes this, resulting in the execution of `touch /tmp/pwned` on the target node, demonstrating arbitrary command execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Rundeck server or managed nodes, full compromise of Rundeck infrastructure and managed systems, data breaches, denial of service, lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it in commands or scripts within job definitions.
    *   **Parameterized Commands/Functions:** Utilize parameterized commands or secure functions that prevent command injection instead of directly constructing commands from strings.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:** Minimize or eliminate the use of string concatenation to build commands dynamically.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Job Execution:** Execute jobs with the lowest necessary user privileges to limit the impact of potential command injection.
    *   **Secure Scripting Practices:** Enforce secure coding practices in all scripts used within Rundeck jobs, avoiding shell command execution where safer alternatives exist.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credential Management Leading to Exposure](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credential_management_leading_to_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Weak practices in handling credentials within Rundeck, such as storing them in plaintext within job definitions or configuration files, or unintentionally exposing them in job logs or outputs, can lead to unauthorized access to managed systems and sensitive data.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck manages credentials for accessing nodes and external systems. While Rundeck offers secure key storage, improper usage or bypassing these mechanisms directly introduces the risk of credential exposure.
*   **Example:** An administrator hardcodes an SSH private key directly into a job definition script step instead of using Rundeck's Key Storage. This plaintext key is then inadvertently included in job execution logs, making it accessible to users with access to job history.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed nodes and external systems, lateral movement, data breaches, compromise of infrastructure relying on the exposed credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity and scope of access granted by the exposed credentials).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Rundeck Key Storage:** Enforce the use of Rundeck's Key Storage for all credentials and strictly prohibit storing credentials in plaintext in job definitions or configuration files.
    *   **Credential Masking:** Enable and properly configure credential masking in Rundeck to prevent sensitive credentials from appearing in logs and job outputs.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of credentials used by Rundeck and managed through its Key Storage.
    *   **Access Control for Key Storage:** Restrict access to Rundeck's Key Storage to only authorized users and roles.
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Review logging configurations to ensure sensitive information is not inadvertently logged, even with masking enabled.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugins Leading to System Compromise](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugins_leading_to_system_compromise.md)

*   **Description:**  Rundeck's plugin architecture, while extending functionality, introduces risks if installed plugins contain security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities in plugins can lead to system compromise, including remote code execution within the Rundeck server context.
*   **Rundeck Contribution:** Rundeck's plugin system allows for third-party extensions. The security of these plugins is not directly controlled by the Rundeck core team, making vulnerable plugins a direct attack surface for Rundeck deployments.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable third-party plugin used for integrating with a specific cloud provider contains a remote code execution vulnerability. Installing and enabling this plugin exposes the Rundeck instance to this vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Rundeck server by exploiting the plugin.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Rundeck server, full compromise of the Rundeck instance, potential access to Rundeck's data and managed nodes, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the nature and exploitability of the plugin vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources. Prioritize plugins that are actively maintained and have a good security track record.
    *   **Plugin Security Audits:** Conduct security reviews or audits of plugins before deployment, especially for plugins from less-known or unverified sources.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:**  Grant plugins only the minimum necessary permissions required for their functionality. Review plugin permissions requests carefully.
    *   **Plugin Monitoring:** Monitor plugin activity and logs for any suspicious behavior that might indicate a compromised plugin.
