* **Execution Engine:**
    * Responsible for the actual execution of the steps defined within a Job.
    * Establishes connections to target nodes using configured plugins (e.g., SSH, WinRM).
    * Executes commands or scripts on remote nodes within a defined security context.
    * Manages the execution context, including environment variables and working directories.
    * Streams execution logs back to the Core Engine for persistence and display.
* **Data Store:**
    * Persistently stores Rundeck's operational data and configuration.
    * Includes Job definitions, execution history and logs, user and role information, project configurations, node definitions, and system settings.
    * Typically implemented using a relational database system like H2 (for small deployments), MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
    * Data at rest may contain sensitive information requiring appropriate encryption.
* **Authentication and Authorization Module:**
    * Manages user identities and authenticates users attempting to access Rundeck.
    * Supports various authentication mechanisms, including local user accounts, LDAP, Active Directory, PAM, and potentially OAuth 2.0.
