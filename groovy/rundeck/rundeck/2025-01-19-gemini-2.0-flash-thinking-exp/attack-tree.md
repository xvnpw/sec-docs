## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Rundeck](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rundeck.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete security failure.
Success at this node signifies that the attacker has leveraged vulnerabilities within Rundeck to impact the managed application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Rundeck](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_rundeck.md)

This is a critical gateway. Once an attacker gains unauthorized access, they can leverage Rundeck's functionalities for malicious purposes.
Mitigation at this node is crucial to prevent a wide range of subsequent attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on bypassing Rundeck's authentication mechanisms.
*   **Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on User Credentials:** Exploiting weak or default passwords.
*   **Exploit Known Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Leveraging publicly known flaws in Rundeck's authentication.
*   **Default Credentials:** Exploiting the failure to change default usernames and passwords.
Success here grants the attacker initial access to Rundeck.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unprotected API Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unprotected_api_endpoints.md)

This path involves directly accessing Rundeck's API without proper authentication or authorization.
Attackers can potentially execute commands, retrieve data, or modify configurations depending on the exposed endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Rundeck Functionality for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_rundeck_functionality_for_malicious_purposes.md)

This node represents the exploitation of Rundeck's intended features (like job execution and credential management) to harm the managed application.
Successful attacks at this node have a direct and significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Commands on Managed Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_commands_on_managed_nodes.md)

This path leverages Rundeck's core functionality to run commands on remote systems.
*   **Inject Malicious Commands into Job Definitions:** Inserting malicious commands into job parameters or script steps.
*   **Modify Existing Jobs to Execute Malicious Commands:** Altering existing jobs to include malicious steps.
*   **Utilize Stored Credentials for Malicious Execution:** Using compromised credentials stored in Rundeck to execute commands.
Success here can lead to complete compromise of the managed nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Stored Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_stored_credentials.md)

This path focuses on gaining access to the credentials stored within Rundeck.
Successful retrieval of these credentials can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users or services and gain access to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_plugins.md)

This path involves uploading and installing malicious plugins into Rundeck.
Successful upload can grant the attacker complete control over the Rundeck instance and potentially the managed infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Credential Storage](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_credential_storage.md)

This is a critical vulnerability. If Rundeck's credential storage is compromised, attackers can gain access to sensitive credentials used to manage the application's infrastructure.
This can lead to widespread compromise and lateral movement.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credentials Stored in Plain Text](./attack_tree_paths/credentials_stored_in_plain_text.md)

This is a critical configuration flaw where sensitive credentials are stored without any encryption.
This makes it trivial for an attacker with access to the Rundeck server or its configuration files to retrieve these credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overly Permissive Access Controls](./attack_tree_paths/overly_permissive_access_controls.md)

While not a direct attack, this configuration weakness significantly increases the attack surface.
It allows lower-skilled attackers or compromised accounts to perform actions they shouldn't, increasing the likelihood of other attacks.
