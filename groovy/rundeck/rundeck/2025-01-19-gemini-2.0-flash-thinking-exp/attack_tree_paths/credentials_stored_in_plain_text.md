### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Credentials Stored in Plain Text

**Attack Tree Path:** Credentials Stored in Plain Text

**Description:** This is a critical configuration flaw where sensitive credentials required for Rundeck's operation or for jobs executed by Rundeck are stored without any encryption or proper protection. This makes it trivially easy for an attacker with sufficient access to the Rundeck server or its configuration files to retrieve these credentials.

**Likelihood:**  The likelihood of this vulnerability existing depends on the security awareness and practices of the team configuring and maintaining the Rundeck instance. While modern security practices strongly discourage storing credentials in plain text, it can still occur due to:

* **Legacy configurations:**  Older configurations might not have been updated to use secure credential storage.
* **Developer oversight:**  Accidental inclusion of credentials in configuration files during development or testing.
* **Lack of awareness:**  Insufficient understanding of security best practices regarding credential management.
* **Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configuring Rundeck or its plugins, leading to plain text storage.

**Impact:** The impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability is **severe**. An attacker gaining access to plain text credentials can:

* **Gain unauthorized access to other systems:**  If the credentials are used to access databases, APIs, or other services, the attacker can compromise those systems.
* **Escalate privileges within Rundeck:**  Credentials for administrative accounts or accounts with broad permissions could allow the attacker to take full control of the Rundeck instance.
* **Execute arbitrary commands:**  If job definitions contain plain text credentials for accessing target systems, the attacker can modify jobs or create new ones to execute malicious commands.
* **Steal sensitive data:**  Access to databases or other systems through compromised credentials can lead to the theft of confidential information.
* **Disrupt services:**  By manipulating Rundeck configurations or jobs, the attacker can disrupt critical services managed by Rundeck.
* **Lateral movement:**  Compromised credentials can be used to move laterally within the network, potentially gaining access to more sensitive systems.

**Attack Vectors:** An attacker could gain access to plain text credentials through various means:

* **Compromised Rundeck Server:** If the Rundeck server itself is compromised (e.g., through an operating system vulnerability, weak SSH credentials), the attacker can directly access the file system and configuration files.
* **Access to Rundeck Configuration Files:** Attackers might gain access to configuration files through:
    * **Compromised user accounts:**  If an attacker compromises an account with access to the server or version control system where configurations are stored.
    * **Insider threat:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access to the server or configuration files.
    * **Vulnerable version control system:** If Rundeck configurations are stored in a vulnerable version control system.
    * **Misconfigured access controls:**  Incorrectly configured file permissions allowing unauthorized access.
* **Backup Files:**  Plain text credentials might be present in unencrypted backup files of the Rundeck server or its configuration.
* **Memory Dump:** In certain scenarios, an attacker might be able to obtain a memory dump of the Rundeck process, potentially revealing plain text credentials.
* **Environment Variables (Less likely but possible):** While Rundeck encourages secure storage, if credentials are inadvertently passed as plain text environment variables, they could be exposed.

**Affected Components:**

* **Rundeck Configuration Files:**  Specifically files like `rundeck-config.properties`, `jaas-login.conf`, project configuration files, and potentially plugin configuration files.
* **Job Definitions:**  If job definitions directly embed credentials in plain text within script steps or node executor configurations.
* **Key Storage (If Misused):** While Rundeck offers a secure key storage mechanism, if it's not used correctly and credentials are "stored" as plain text within the key storage (which defeats its purpose), it falls under this category.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Utilize Rundeck's Key Storage:**  This is the primary recommended approach. Rundeck provides a secure key storage mechanism for storing credentials. All sensitive credentials should be stored here and referenced by jobs and configurations.
* **Implement Secrets Management Solutions:** Integrate Rundeck with dedicated secrets management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc. These tools provide robust encryption, access control, and auditing for sensitive information.
* **Avoid Embedding Credentials in Job Definitions:**  Instead of directly embedding credentials in job scripts, use Rundeck's key storage or secrets management integration to retrieve them securely at runtime.
* **Secure Configuration Files:** Ensure Rundeck configuration files have appropriate file permissions, restricting access to only necessary users and processes.
* **Encrypt Configuration Files at Rest:**  Consider encrypting the file system where Rundeck configuration files are stored.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of Rundeck configurations and job definitions to identify any instances of plain text credential storage.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to Rundeck users and service accounts.
* **Secure Backup Practices:** Ensure backups of the Rundeck server and its configuration are encrypted.
* **Educate Development and Operations Teams:**  Train teams on secure credential management practices and the risks associated with storing credentials in plain text.
* **Implement Code Reviews:**  For any custom plugins or integrations, implement code reviews to ensure secure credential handling.
* **Use Environment Variables Securely (If Necessary):** If environment variables are used for credentials, ensure they are managed securely and not exposed in logs or other accessible locations. Consider using secrets management tools even for environment variables.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Configuration Audits:** Regularly scan Rundeck configuration files for patterns that might indicate plain text credentials (e.g., `password=`, `apiKey=`, etc.). Automated tools can assist with this.
* **Log Analysis:** Monitor Rundeck logs for any suspicious activity related to configuration file access or attempts to retrieve credentials.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM on Rundeck configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications.
* **Security Scanning Tools:** Utilize security scanning tools that can identify potential instances of plain text credential storage.
* **Access Control Monitoring:** Monitor access attempts to Rundeck configuration files and the server itself.
* **Regular Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities like plain text credential storage.

**Example Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1:** A database password for Rundeck's internal database is stored in plain text within the `rundeck-config.properties` file. An attacker compromises the Rundeck server and gains access to this file, allowing them to access the Rundeck database.
* **Scenario 2:** An API key for a cloud service is directly embedded in a job definition as a script argument. An attacker with access to the Rundeck UI or the job definition files can retrieve this API key.
* **Scenario 3:** Credentials for a remote server are stored in plain text within a node executor configuration. An attacker gaining access to the Rundeck server can retrieve these credentials and potentially pivot to the remote server.

**Conclusion:**

Storing credentials in plain text within a Rundeck environment represents a significant security risk. The ease of exploitation and the potential for severe impact necessitate immediate attention and remediation. Implementing robust mitigation strategies, primarily leveraging Rundeck's key storage or integrating with a dedicated secrets management solution, is crucial. Continuous monitoring and regular security audits are essential to prevent and detect this critical vulnerability. Failure to address this issue can lead to significant security breaches, data loss, and service disruption.
