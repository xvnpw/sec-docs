# Threat Model Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Threat: [Command Injection in Job Execution](./threats/command_injection_in_job_execution.md)

- Description: An attacker with permissions to create or modify job definitions crafts a job step that includes shell commands. When the job is executed, these commands are run on the Rundeck server or target nodes with the privileges of the Rundeck user. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, install malware, or compromise the system.
  - Impact: Full compromise of the Rundeck server or target nodes, data breach, denial of service.
  - Affected Component: Execution Engine - Script Executioner
  - Risk Severity: Critical
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Implement strict input validation on all job definition fields, especially those used in script execution.
    - Use parameterized commands or APIs where possible to avoid direct command construction.
    - Enforce the principle of least privilege for the Rundeck user.
    - Regularly review and audit job definitions for suspicious commands.
    - Consider using secure execution plugins that provide sandboxing or command whitelisting.

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Storage](./threats/insecure_credential_storage.md)

- Description: Rundeck stores credentials for accessing target nodes. If these credentials are not properly encrypted or are stored in a way that is easily accessible, an attacker gaining access to the Rundeck server could retrieve these credentials. This allows the attacker to access and potentially compromise the target nodes.
  - Impact: Compromise of target nodes, data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
  - Affected Component: Core - Credential Management Module
  - Risk Severity: Critical
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Utilize Rundeck's built-in credential storage mechanisms with strong encryption.
    - Integrate with secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    - Avoid storing credentials directly in job definitions or configuration files.
    - Implement strong access controls to restrict who can view or manage credentials within Rundeck.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via API Vulnerabilities](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_api_vulnerabilities.md)

- Description: Vulnerabilities in the Rundeck API endpoints could allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and execute API calls without proper authorization. This could allow them to create, modify, or execute jobs, manage nodes, or access sensitive information.
  - Impact: Unauthorized access to Rundeck functionality, potential for system compromise and data manipulation.
  - Affected Component: API - Authentication and Authorization Layer
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Keep Rundeck updated to the latest version to patch known API vulnerabilities.
    - Implement strong authentication mechanisms for API access (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    - Enforce proper authorization checks on all API endpoints.
    - Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Web UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_the_web_ui.md)

- Description: An attacker injects malicious client-side scripts into web pages served by the Rundeck UI. When other users view these pages, the malicious scripts are executed in their browsers, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect them to malicious sites.
  - Impact: Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the Rundeck interface.
  - Affected Component: Web UI - Rendering Engine
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all user-supplied data displayed in the Rundeck UI.
    - Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    - Regularly scan the Rundeck UI for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/insecure_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

- Description: Rundeck's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. However, vulnerabilities in third-party or custom-developed plugins could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code within the Rundeck environment.
  - Impact: Compromise of the Rundeck server, potential for lateral movement to connected systems.
  - Affected Component: Core - Plugin Management System
  - Risk Severity: High
  - Mitigation Strategies:
    - Only install plugins from trusted sources.
    - Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Conduct security reviews of custom-developed plugins.
    - Consider using plugin sandboxing mechanisms if available.
