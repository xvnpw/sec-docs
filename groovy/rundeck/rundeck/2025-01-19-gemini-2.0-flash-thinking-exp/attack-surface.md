# Attack Surface Analysis for rundeck/rundeck

## Attack Surface: [Job Definition Manipulation Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/job_definition_manipulation_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers with sufficient privileges can modify job definitions to inject malicious commands or scripts that will be executed on target nodes managed by Rundeck.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes:** Rundeck's core functionality revolves around defining and executing jobs on remote systems. The ability to define arbitrary script steps or command-line executions directly introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a job definition to include a script step that downloads and executes a reverse shell on a target server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of target nodes, data breach, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls (RBAC) to limit who can create and modify job definitions.
        *   Enforce code review processes for all job definition changes.
        *   Utilize Rundeck's built-in security features like script security and command filters to restrict allowed commands and scripts.
        *   Regularly audit job definitions for suspicious or unauthorized changes.
        *   Consider using pre-defined, parameterized job templates to limit the scope of user input.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Rundeck's API authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to Rundeck's functionalities.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes:** Rundeck exposes a powerful API for automation and integration. Weaknesses in securing this API can grant attackers significant control over Rundeck and its managed nodes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a default API token or exploits a flaw in the authentication process to access and trigger jobs or retrieve sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to execute arbitrary commands on managed nodes, disruption of automation workflows.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong API token management practices (rotation, secure storage).
        *   Utilize robust authentication methods (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
        *   Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict API access based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Ensure the API is only accessible over HTTPS.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in installed Rundeck plugins (official or third-party) to compromise the Rundeck server or managed nodes.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes:** Rundeck's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but also introduces a dependency on the security of these plugins.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the Rundeck server, leading to remote code execution on the Rundeck instance itself.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Rundeck server, potential compromise of managed nodes if the plugin interacts with them, data breach.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install necessary plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all installed plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly review installed plugins and their permissions.
        *   Consider using a plugin vetting process before installation.
        *   Monitor plugin activity for suspicious behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage and Handling of Node Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_and_handling_of_node_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Rundeck stores credentials for accessing managed nodes. If this storage or the handling of these credentials during job execution is insecure, attackers could steal or misuse them.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes:**  Rundeck's core function requires managing credentials to interact with remote systems. The security of this credential management is paramount.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Rundeck server's configuration files and retrieves plaintext credentials used for SSH access to target nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to managed nodes, potential lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Rundeck's built-in Key Storage feature for secure credential management.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in job definitions or configuration files.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for node access credentials.
        *   Regularly rotate node access credentials.
        *   Implement strong access controls for the Rundeck server and its configuration files.
