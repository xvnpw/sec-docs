*   **Attack Surface:** Job Definition Injection
    *   **Description:** Malicious users with job creation or editing privileges can inject arbitrary commands or scripts within Rundeck job definitions. This can occur in script steps, inline scripts, node filters, or other configurable fields.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rundeck's core functionality of defining and executing jobs, which inherently involves running scripts or commands, creates opportunities for injection if the platform doesn't rigorously sanitize user-provided input within job configurations. The flexibility offered in defining job steps and using variables amplifies this risk.
    *   **Example:** A user creates a job step with an inline script that includes a variable like `${option.hostname}`. If Rundeck doesn't sanitize the hostname option, an attacker could input a value like ``; rm -rf / #` leading to command execution on the Rundeck server or target node.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Rundeck server or target nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization within Rundeck:** Rundeck developers should implement strict input sanitization for all user-provided input used in job definitions, especially within script steps, node filters, and option values.
        *   **Secure Variable Handling:** Rundeck should provide secure mechanisms for variable substitution that prevent command injection, rather than directly embedding user-provided variables in commands.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege within Rundeck:** Rundeck's access control mechanisms should be used to grant job creation and editing privileges only to trusted users.
        *   **Code Review of Job Definitions:** Encourage users to regularly review job definitions for potential injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Workflow Step Injection
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Rundeck processes workflow steps can allow for the injection of malicious commands or scripts. This can occur in various workflow step types, especially those involving script execution or external command calls.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rundeck's workflow engine, designed to orchestrate sequences of actions, introduces injection points if the platform doesn't adequately sanitize configuration options within workflow steps that involve executing commands or scripts.
    *   **Example:** A workflow step in Rundeck uses a script executioner and takes a filename as an option. If Rundeck doesn't sanitize this input, an attacker could provide a filename like ``; cat /etc/passwd #` to read sensitive files on the target node.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Rundeck server or target nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization within Rundeck Workflow Engine:** Rundeck developers should ensure robust input sanitization for all input used in workflow step configurations, particularly for steps involving script execution or external command calls.
        *   **Secure Step Configuration Design:** Rundeck's design should encourage workflow steps that minimize the need for direct user input in command execution, favoring pre-defined actions or scripts.
        *   **Parameterization within Workflow Steps:** Rundeck should facilitate the use of parameterized commands or secure methods for passing arguments to scripts and external commands within workflow steps.

*   **Attack Surface:** Plugin Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Rundeck plugins can introduce security flaws. Malicious or poorly written plugins can lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service within the Rundeck environment.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rundeck's plugin architecture, while providing extensibility, inherently increases the attack surface. The security of the Rundeck instance becomes dependent on the security of all installed plugins, which are often developed by third parties. Rundeck's plugin loading and execution mechanisms need to be robust to prevent malicious plugins from causing harm.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written Rundeck plugin might not properly sanitize user input, leading to a command injection vulnerability when the plugin is used in a job step within Rundeck.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Rundeck server, information disclosure, denial of service, or compromise of integrated systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Plugin Loading and Execution:** Rundeck developers should implement secure mechanisms for loading and executing plugins, potentially including sandboxing or permission controls.
        *   **Plugin Verification and Signing:** Rundeck could implement mechanisms for verifying the authenticity and integrity of plugins.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins within Rundeck:** Rundeck should allow administrators to grant plugins only the necessary permissions to perform their intended functions.

*   **Attack Surface:** API Authentication and Authorization Bypass
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Rundeck's API authentication mechanisms or authorization logic could allow unauthorized access to Rundeck functionalities. This could enable attackers to execute jobs, access sensitive data, or modify configurations through the Rundeck API.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rundeck provides a comprehensive API for automation and integration. Weaknesses in the design or implementation of Rundeck's API authentication and authorization mechanisms directly expose significant functionality to unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in Rundeck's API token generation or validation process could allow an attacker to forge valid API tokens and gain unauthorized access to the Rundeck API.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Rundeck functionalities, including job execution, data access, and configuration modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong API Authentication within Rundeck:** Rundeck developers should enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the API, such as API keys with proper rotation policies or OAuth 2.0.
        *   **Robust API Authorization:** Rundeck's API should implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict API access based on user roles and permissions.
        *   **Secure API Token Management within Rundeck:** Rundeck should provide secure mechanisms for generating, storing, and managing API tokens.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Credential Storage
    *   **Description:** Insecure storage of credentials used for connecting to target nodes or external systems within Rundeck can lead to credential theft. This includes vulnerabilities in Rundeck's built-in key storage mechanisms.
    *   **How Rundeck Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Rundeck's need to store credentials for managing remote systems makes its credential storage a critical attack surface. Vulnerabilities in how Rundeck stores and manages these credentials directly expose them to potential theft.
    *   **Example:** Credentials for accessing target nodes are stored in plain text in Rundeck's configuration files or database due to a lack of proper encryption by Rundeck.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of target nodes and other systems, potentially leading to data breaches and further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage within Rundeck:** Rundeck developers should ensure that the built-in key storage uses strong encryption algorithms and secure storage practices.
        *   **Secure Integration with External Credential Stores:** When integrating with external credential stores, Rundeck should ensure secure communication and authentication protocols are used.
        *   **Avoid Direct Storage in Job Definitions:** Rundeck should strongly encourage and facilitate referencing credentials securely from configured credential stores rather than embedding them directly in job definitions.
