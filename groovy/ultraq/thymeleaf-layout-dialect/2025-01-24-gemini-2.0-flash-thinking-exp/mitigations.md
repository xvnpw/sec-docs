# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Control Layout Template Paths](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_control_layout_template_paths.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strictly Control Layout Template Paths
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all places** in the application code where layout templates are selected or specified when using `layout:decorate` or similar attributes provided by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    2.  **Replace dynamic path construction** based on user input with a static or whitelisted approach for layout template paths used with `layout:decorate`. Avoid directly using user-provided data to build layout paths.
    3.  **Implement a whitelist** of allowed layout template names or paths that can be used with `layout:decorate`. The application should only accept layout template names from this predefined list.
    4.  **Parameterize layout template selection** within the application logic. Use configuration files, enums, or dedicated code structures to manage allowed layout template choices for `layout:decorate`.
    5.  **Regularly review and update** the whitelist of allowed layout templates to ensure it remains secure and aligned with application requirements when using `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Template Injection (High Severity):** Attackers could manipulate user input to specify arbitrary layout templates via `layout:decorate`, potentially including malicious templates. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Layouts (Medium Severity):** Attackers might gain access to layout templates that are not intended for public use through manipulated `layout:decorate` paths, potentially revealing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Template Injection:** High Risk Reduction - Effectively eliminates the primary vector for template injection via layout path manipulation in `layout:decorate`.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Layouts:** Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the chance of accidental or intentional access to unintended layouts through `layout:decorate` path manipulation.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Layout template selection in controllers is currently based on a configuration file (`application.properties`) which acts as a partial whitelist.
    *   Implemented in: `src/main/java/com/example/web/controllers/BaseController.java` - layout name for `layout:decorate` is retrieved from configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit validation or enforcement of the whitelist within the Thymeleaf template processing itself when `layout:decorate` is used. Need to add checks to ensure only whitelisted layout names are actually used, even if configuration is bypassed.
    *   Missing in: Thymeleaf configuration and template resolvers specifically for `layout:decorate`. Need to add a custom template resolver that enforces the whitelist for layout paths used in `layout:decorate`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Layout Templates as First-Class Citizens](./mitigation_strategies/secure_layout_templates_as_first-class_citizens.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Layout Templates as First-Class Citizens
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Treat layout templates used with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect` with the same security rigor** as regular Thymeleaf templates. Do not assume they are inherently safe because they are "layouts".
    2.  **Include layout templates in security code reviews and static analysis.** Use security scanning tools to analyze layout templates for potential vulnerabilities, just like regular templates, especially considering their role in `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    3.  **Apply input validation and output encoding** within layout templates. If layout templates handle dynamic content (e.g., passed from controllers or fragments, and used within layout sections defined by `layout:fragment`), ensure proper sanitization and encoding to prevent XSS.
    4.  **Minimize complex logic in layout templates.** Keep layout templates focused on presentation and structure within the context of `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`'s layout mechanism. Move complex data processing to backend services or Thymeleaf processors.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Layout templates, if not properly secured, can become injection points for XSS vulnerabilities, especially if they handle dynamic content or include user-controlled data within layout sections defined by `layout:fragment`.
    *   **Template Injection (Medium Severity):** While less direct than path manipulation, vulnerabilities within layout templates themselves could be exploited for template injection if they process user-controlled data unsafely, particularly within layout sections.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces XSS risks by ensuring layout templates used with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect` are treated as potential attack vectors and secured accordingly.
    *   **Template Injection:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the likelihood of template injection vulnerabilities originating from within layout templates themselves when used with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic output encoding (`th:text`, `th:utext`) is used in some layout templates.
    *   Implemented in:  `src/main/resources/templates/layouts/default.html`, `src/main/resources/templates/layouts/admin.html` - basic encoding in common elements within layouts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No systematic security code reviews specifically targeting layout templates used with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    *   Static analysis tools are not configured to specifically scan layout templates for vulnerabilities in the context of `thymeleaf-layout-dialect` usage.
    *   Input validation within layout templates is inconsistent and needs to be standardized, especially for content intended for layout sections.
    *   Missing in: Security review process, static analysis configuration, input validation logic in layout templates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Isolate Layout Logic](./mitigation_strategies/isolate_layout_logic.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Isolate Layout Logic
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze layout templates** used with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect` and identify any complex data processing, business logic, or direct database access within them.
    2.  **Refactor complex logic out of layout templates.** Move this logic to backend services, controllers, or custom Thymeleaf processors.
    3.  **Keep layout templates focused on presentation and structure.** They should primarily handle the arrangement of content and basic display logic as intended by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    4.  **Use Thymeleaf processors or controllers to prepare data** for layout templates. Pass pre-processed and sanitized data to layout sections for rendering.
    5.  **Limit the use of Thymeleaf utility objects and expressions** within layout templates, especially those that could potentially execute arbitrary code or access sensitive resources, to maintain simplicity in layouts managed by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Template Injection (Medium Severity):** Complex logic in layouts increases the attack surface for template injection. Reducing complexity in layouts managed by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect` makes them less vulnerable.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):** Overly complex layouts might inadvertently expose internal application logic or data structures.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):** Complex logic in layouts could potentially be exploited to cause performance issues or DoS if not handled efficiently.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Template Injection:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the attack surface and complexity within layouts managed by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`, making them less prone to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low Risk Reduction - Minimizes the risk of unintentional information leakage through overly complex layout logic in layouts.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Low Risk Reduction - Improves performance and reduces the potential for DoS attacks related to inefficient layout processing.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Layout templates are generally focused on presentation, but some still contain minor data formatting logic.
    *   Implemented in: General architectural style of the application favors backend logic over template logic, which aligns with best practices for using layout dialects.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal review or refactoring effort specifically aimed at isolating logic from layout templates used with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    *   Need to conduct a dedicated review of layout templates to identify and move any remaining complex logic to appropriate backend components, especially considering the intended role of layouts in `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    *   Missing in: Dedicated code refactoring task, guidelines for developers on layout template design specifically for `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Fragment Inclusion Paths](./mitigation_strategies/secure_fragment_inclusion_paths.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Fragment Inclusion Paths
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all instances** of fragment inclusion (`th:insert`, `th:replace`, `th:include`) in Thymeleaf templates, including layout templates and regular templates that are used in conjunction with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    2.  **Avoid dynamic construction of fragment paths** based on user input within templates that are part of the layout structure defined by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`. Do not allow user-provided data to directly determine which fragment is included.
    3.  **Implement a whitelist** of allowed fragment paths or names. Only include fragments from this predefined list within the layout structure.
    4.  **Use parameterized fragment inclusion** where possible, passing data as arguments rather than constructing paths dynamically, especially within layouts.
    5.  **Regularly review and update** the whitelist of allowed fragment paths to ensure it remains secure and aligned with application requirements when used within the context of `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Template Injection (High Severity):** Similar to layout template paths, manipulating fragment inclusion paths within layouts can lead to template injection by including malicious or unintended fragments.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Fragments (Medium Severity):** Attackers might gain access to fragments that are not intended for public use through manipulated fragment inclusion paths in layouts, potentially revealing sensitive information or application logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Template Injection:** High Risk Reduction - Effectively eliminates template injection risks related to fragment path manipulation within layouts managed by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Fragments:** Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the chance of unauthorized fragment inclusion within layouts.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Fragment paths are generally statically defined within templates, including layouts.
    *   Implemented in: Thymeleaf templates across the application, including layouts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No explicit whitelist or validation of fragment paths specifically within the context of layouts used by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`. Reliance is primarily on static path definitions, which could be vulnerable if developers inadvertently introduce dynamic path construction in layouts.
    *   Missing in: Thymeleaf configuration, custom template resolvers, validation logic in template processing specifically for fragment inclusion within layouts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize Fragment Arguments Carefully](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_fragment_arguments_carefully.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterize Fragment Arguments Carefully
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review all fragment inclusions** where arguments are passed using `th:with` or similar mechanisms within templates used with `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
    2.  **Treat fragment arguments as potential user input.** Apply input validation and sanitization to all fragment arguments, even if they appear to originate from within the application, especially when used in layouts.
    3.  **Encode fragment arguments appropriately** when they are used within the fragment template to prevent XSS. Use Thymeleaf's output encoding mechanisms (`th:text`, `th:utext`, etc.) when displaying fragment arguments, particularly in layouts.
    4.  **Avoid passing sensitive data directly as fragment arguments** if possible, especially in layouts. Consider passing identifiers or keys instead and retrieving sensitive data within the fragment using secure backend calls.
    5.  **Document and enforce secure data handling practices** for fragment arguments within development guidelines, specifically addressing the use of fragments within layouts managed by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Unsanitized fragment arguments can be injected with malicious scripts, leading to XSS vulnerabilities when the fragment is rendered, especially if these fragments are part of layouts.
    *   **Data Injection (Medium Severity):** Improperly handled fragment arguments could be exploited for data injection attacks, depending on how the fragment processes the arguments, particularly in the context of layouts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces XSS risks by ensuring fragment arguments are properly sanitized and encoded, especially when used within layouts.
    *   **Data Injection:** Medium Risk Reduction - Mitigates data injection risks by promoting secure handling of fragment arguments, particularly in layouts.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic output encoding is used in some fragments, but input validation for fragment arguments is inconsistent, including fragments used in layouts.
    *   Implemented in: Some fragments use output encoding.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic input validation for fragment arguments is missing, especially for fragments used within layouts. Need to implement validation logic in controllers or Thymeleaf processors before passing data to fragments.
    *   No clear guidelines or enforcement of secure data handling for fragment arguments, specifically addressing fragments in layouts.
    *   Missing in: Input validation logic in controllers/processors, development guidelines, code review checklists, specifically for fragments used in layouts.
