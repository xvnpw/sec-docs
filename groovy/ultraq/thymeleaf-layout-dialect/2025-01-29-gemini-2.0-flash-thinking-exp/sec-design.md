# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary goal of the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect project is to simplify and enhance web page layout management for developers using the Thymeleaf templating engine in Java web applications.
  - It aims to improve code reusability, reduce development time, and increase the maintainability of web application front-ends by providing a flexible and intuitive layout mechanism.
  - By offering a well-structured approach to template inheritance and composition, the project seeks to empower developers to create more organized and efficient Thymeleaf templates.

- Business Risks:
  - Dependency Vulnerabilities: As a third-party library, there is a risk of vulnerabilities within the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect itself or its dependencies. Exploits in these areas could compromise applications that rely on the library.
  - Integration Issues: Incorrect or insecure integration of the library into web applications could introduce vulnerabilities. Misconfiguration or misuse of the dialect by developers could lead to unintended security consequences.
  - Template Injection: If the library does not properly handle template inputs or user-provided data within templates, it could be susceptible to template injection attacks, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or server-side code execution in applications using it.
  - Availability and Maintainability: Reliance on an open-source project carries a risk of project abandonment or lack of timely security updates if vulnerabilities are discovered. This could impact the long-term security and stability of applications using the library.
  - Reputation Damage: If vulnerabilities are found and exploited in applications due to flaws in the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect, it could negatively impact the reputation of both the library and the organizations using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Reliance on Thymeleaf's built-in security features. Thymeleaf itself is designed with security in mind, including protection against XSS and other template-related vulnerabilities. (Documented in Thymeleaf documentation).
  - security control: Standard Java web application security practices are expected to be in place in applications using this library. This includes measures like input validation, output encoding, authentication, and authorization implemented at the application level. (Application specific).
  - security control: Dependency management practices in place for applications using the library, such as using dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle) and potentially dependency vulnerability scanning. (Application specific, build process).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Risks associated with using third-party open-source libraries. This includes the potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities and reliance on the community for maintenance and security updates.
  - accepted risk: Risk of developer error in integrating and using the library securely within applications. Developers need to be trained and aware of secure coding practices when using templating engines and libraries.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning for the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect library and its dependencies in applications that use it. This will help identify and address known vulnerabilities promptly. (Build process, application deployment).
  - recommended security control: Conduct regular security code reviews of the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect project itself, focusing on template processing logic and input handling to identify potential vulnerabilities. (Project development lifecycle).
  - recommended security control: Provide clear and comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for developers using the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect, emphasizing secure template development and integration. (Project documentation).
  - recommended security control: Establish a process for reporting and responding to security vulnerabilities in the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect project. This includes having a security contact, a vulnerability disclosure policy, and a plan for releasing security patches. (Project maintenance).

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect library itself. Authentication is handled at the application level in web applications that use this library.
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect library itself. Authorization is handled at the application level in web applications that use this library to control access to application features and data rendered in templates.
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: The Thymeleaf Layout Dialect should handle template inputs and directives in a way that prevents template injection vulnerabilities. It should not introduce new pathways for injecting malicious code through its features.
    - security requirement: When processing template fragments and layouts, the library should avoid insecurely evaluating or interpreting user-provided data that could be embedded within templates.
  - Cryptography:
    - Not directly applicable to the core functionality of the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect library. Cryptographic operations are typically handled at the application level for securing data and communication. However, if the library were to introduce features that involve handling sensitive data or communication, appropriate cryptographic measures would need to be considered.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect library itself, the critical business process is the development, maintenance, and distribution of a secure and reliable library that developers can confidently use in their web applications.
  - For organizations using the library, the critical business processes are the development and operation of their web applications, which may rely on the layout functionality provided by this library to deliver their services and functionalities to end-users.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - For the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect library project, the primary data to protect is the source code of the library itself. This code is publicly available on GitHub, but maintaining its integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications is important.
  - For applications using the library, the data being processed and rendered within Thymeleaf templates is the data to protect. The sensitivity of this data depends on the specific application. It can range from publicly accessible content to highly sensitive personal or financial information. The library itself does not directly handle sensitive data, but vulnerabilities in the library could potentially expose data processed by applications using it.
