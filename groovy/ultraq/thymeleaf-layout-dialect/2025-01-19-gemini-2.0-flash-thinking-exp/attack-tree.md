## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Layout Injection -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Layout](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_layout_injection_-_server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_layout.md)

**Attacker Goal:** To achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the layout name or path used in the `layout:decorate` attribute to inject a malicious Thymeleaf expression.

**Mechanism:** If the application directly uses user-controlled input within the `layout:decorate` attribute without proper sanitization, the injected expression will be evaluated by the Thymeleaf engine.

**Example:** An attacker might craft a request with a layout name like `${T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('malicious_command')}`.

**Critical Node: Application Evaluates the Expression:** This is the crucial step where the injected code is executed. Mitigation efforts must focus on preventing this evaluation for untrusted input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Fragment Injection -> Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in Fragment Inclusion](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_fragment_injection_-_server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_fragment_inclusion.md)

**Attacker Goal:** To achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the fragment name or expression used in the `layout:insert` or `layout:replace` attributes to inject a malicious Thymeleaf expression.

**Mechanism:** Similar to SSTI in layout injection, if user-controlled input is directly used within these attributes, the injected expression will be evaluated.

**Example:** An attacker might craft a request with a fragment inclusion like `layout:insert="${T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('malicious_command')}"`.

**Critical Node: Application Evaluates the Expression:**  Again, preventing the evaluation of untrusted input is key to mitigating this threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Layout Attribute Processing -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Attribute Values](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_layout_attribute_processing_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized__8934bdb1.md)

**Attacker Goal:** To execute malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the value of a layout attribute (e.g., `layout:title`, custom attributes).

**Mechanism:** If the application renders this attribute value in the HTML response without proper encoding, the browser will execute the injected JavaScript.

**Example:** An attacker might provide an attribute value like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

**Critical Node: Application Renders Attribute Value Without Proper Encoding:** This is the critical point where the application fails to sanitize the output, allowing the malicious script to be executed. Proper output encoding (escaping) is essential to prevent this.
