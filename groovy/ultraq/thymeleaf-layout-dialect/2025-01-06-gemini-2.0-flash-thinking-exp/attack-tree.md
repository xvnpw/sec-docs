# Attack Tree Analysis for ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect

Objective: Compromise application by exploiting weaknesses within `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Objective:** Compromise application by exploiting weaknesses within `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized control over the application's content and/or execution flow through manipulation of Thymeleaf layouts and fragments managed by `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.

**Sub-Tree:**

* Attack: Compromise Application via thymeleaf-layout-dialect **(Critical Node)**
    * Exploit Template Injection **(Critical Node)**
        * Via layout:decorate attribute **(Critical Node)**
            * Inject malicious template path **(Critical Node)**
                * Achieve Arbitrary File Read (Information Disclosure)
                * Achieve Server-Side Code Execution (Remote Code Execution) **(Critical Node)**
            * Inject malicious Thymeleaf expressions within path
                * Achieve Server-Side Code Execution (Remote Code Execution) **(Critical Node)**
        * Via dynamically generated fragment content **(Critical Node)**
            * Inject malicious Thymeleaf expressions within fragment content **(Critical Node)**
                * Achieve Server-Side Code Execution (Remote Code Execution) **(Critical Node)**
                * Access sensitive data (Information Disclosure)
    * Exploit Path Traversal **(Critical Node)**
        * Via layout:decorate attribute **(Critical Node)**
            * Inject path traversal sequences **(Critical Node)**
                * Access files outside intended layout directory
                    * Read configuration files (Information Disclosure)
                    * Read source code (Information Disclosure)
