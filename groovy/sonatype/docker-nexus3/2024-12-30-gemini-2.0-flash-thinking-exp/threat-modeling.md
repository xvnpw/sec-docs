Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving `sonatype/docker-nexus3`:

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Dependencies within the Image
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities present in the operating system packages or Java libraries included within the `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image. This could involve sending crafted requests or exploiting network services exposed by the container.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Nexus server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the instance, access sensitive data, or pivot to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Image Layers (Operating System, Java Runtime Environment, Nexus application dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly rebuild the Docker image using the latest `sonatype/docker-nexus3` base image to incorporate security updates.
        *   Implement automated vulnerability scanning of the Docker image during the build process.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Software Included in the Image
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially compromise the official `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image or a custom-built image based on it, injecting malicious software such as backdoors, cryptominers, or data exfiltration tools. This could happen if the build process is compromised or if a malicious actor gains access to the image registry.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Nexus instance and potentially the underlying host system, unauthorized access to stored artifacts, data exfiltration, and disruption of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire Docker Image.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use official Docker images from trusted sources like Docker Hub or Sonatype's official repositories.
        *   Implement image signing and verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the image.
        *   Regularly scan running containers for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Outdated Software within the Image
    *   **Description:** If the `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image is not updated regularly, it may contain outdated versions of the Nexus Repository Manager software itself, which could have known, unpatched vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the instance.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerable dependencies, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nexus Repository Manager application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a process for regularly updating the `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image to the latest stable version.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories from Sonatype to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configurations
    *   **Description:** The default configuration of the Nexus instance within the Docker image might include default administrative credentials or overly permissive access controls. An attacker could exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Nexus repository, allowing the attacker to view, modify, or delete artifacts, create new users, or change configurations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nexus Web UI, Nexus Security Realm.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change all default administrative credentials upon deployment.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms within Nexus.

*   **Threat:** Repository Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to a Nexus repository could upload malicious or compromised artifacts (e.g., libraries, Docker images) with the intention of tricking developers or automated build processes into using them.
    *   **Impact:** Supply chain attacks, introduction of malware into development environments or production systems, potentially leading to widespread compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nexus Repository Manager (specific repositories).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and authentication for write access to repositories.
        *   Utilize checksum verification and signature validation for artifacts.
        *   Implement artifact scanning for vulnerabilities and malware before allowing them into repositories.

*   **Threat:** Proxy Repository Abuse
    *   **Description:** If Nexus is configured as a proxy for external repositories, an attacker could potentially manipulate the proxy settings or compromise the upstream repositories, leading to the distribution of malicious artifacts through the Nexus instance.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to repository poisoning, leading to supply chain attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nexus Proxy Repositories, Nexus HTTP Client.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure proxy repositories and only proxy trusted sources.
        *   Implement artifact caching and validation to prevent fetching malicious content repeatedly.

*   **Threat:** Nexus API Abuse
    *   **Description:** The Nexus API, if not properly secured, could be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as creating users, modifying repositories, or downloading artifacts. This could be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the API itself or by gaining access to valid API credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Nexus instance, data breaches, manipulation of the repository.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nexus REST API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Nexus API using authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Implement rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.
        *   Regularly update the Nexus instance to patch API vulnerabilities.
