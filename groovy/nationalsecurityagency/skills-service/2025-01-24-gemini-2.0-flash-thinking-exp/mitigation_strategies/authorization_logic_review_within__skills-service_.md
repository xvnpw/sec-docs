Conduct privilege audits to identify and remove unnecessary permissions.  Default to deny access and explicitly grant permissions.
*   **Threat Mitigation Mapping:**  Mitigates Privilege Escalation by preventing users from gaining unnecessary permissions. Reduces Unauthorized Data Access and Data Manipulation by limiting the scope of access even if authorization is bypassed in some areas.  Minimizes Information Disclosure by restricting access to sensitive information to only those who absolutely need it.
*   **Impact:** High impact. Principle of Least Privilege is a core security principle that significantly reduces the potential damage from security breaches.

#### 4.5. Step 5: Document Authorization Model

*   **Description:** Clearly document the authorization model of `skills-service`, including roles, permissions, and how they are enforced in the code. This helps with understanding and maintaining the security model of `skills-service`.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Improves understanding, maintainability, and consistency of the authorization model.  Facilitates onboarding of new developers, security audits, and future modifications to the authorization logic.  Reduces the risk of misconfigurations and errors due to lack of clarity.
    *   **Feasibility:**  Feasible and essential for any non-trivial application.  Requires effort to create and maintain documentation but provides significant long-term benefits.
    *   **Potential Challenges:**  Keeping documentation up-to-date with code changes is crucial but can be challenging.  Requires a commitment to documentation as part of the development process.  Documentation needs to be clear, concise, and easily accessible to relevant stakeholders.
    *   **Best Practices:**  Document roles, permissions, access control policies, data access rules, and enforcement mechanisms.  Use diagrams, flowcharts, and clear language.  Integrate documentation into the development workflow and version control system.  Regularly review and update documentation to reflect code changes.
*   **Threat Mitigation Mapping:** Indirectly supports mitigation of all threats by improving the overall security posture and reducing the likelihood of errors and misconfigurations in authorization logic.  Facilitates better code reviews and testing.
*   **Impact:** Medium impact. Documentation itself doesn't directly prevent attacks, but it significantly improves the effectiveness of other mitigation steps and reduces the long-term risk of authorization vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6. Step 6: Regularly Review and Update Authorization Logic

*   **Description:** As the `skills-service` application evolves, regularly review and update the authorization logic to ensure it remains consistent with security requirements and business needs.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Ensures that authorization logic remains effective and relevant over time.  Addresses the evolving threat landscape and changes in application functionality.  Prevents security drift and maintains a strong security posture.
    *   **Feasibility:**  Feasible and crucial for long-term security.  Requires establishing a process for regular reviews and allocating resources for updates.
    *   **Potential Challenges:**  Requires ongoing commitment and resources.  Prioritizing security reviews amidst other development tasks can be challenging.  Keeping up with evolving security best practices and threat landscape requires continuous learning.
    *   **Best Practices:**  Incorporate authorization reviews into regular security audits and code review processes.  Trigger reviews when significant changes are made to application functionality, user roles, or security requirements.  Stay informed about new authorization vulnerabilities and best practices.  Use threat modeling to identify potential authorization risks associated with new features.
*   **Threat Mitigation Mapping:**  Maintains the effectiveness of mitigation against all listed threats over time.  Prevents regressions and ensures that authorization logic adapts to changes in the application and threat environment.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High impact over the long term. Regular reviews are essential for maintaining the effectiveness of authorization and preventing security degradation as the application evolves.
