        *   **Broken Authentication:** Weak password policies, predictable session IDs, insecure password recovery mechanisms.
        *   **Broken Access Control:**  Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation, insecure direct object references, missing function-level access control.
    *   **DAST Effectiveness:** **High**. DAST tools can simulate various attack scenarios to identify these flaws by manipulating requests and analyzing responses.

*   **Server Configuration Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium (exposed by `skills-service`)**
    *   **Analysis:** DAST can detect some server configuration vulnerabilities that are exposed through the application's responses and headers. This includes:
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposing sensitive information in headers (e.g., server version, debugging information).
        *   **Insecure HTTP Headers:** Missing security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy).
        *   **Directory Listing:**  Accidental exposure of directory contents.
    *   **DAST Effectiveness:** **Medium**. DAST is not as comprehensive as dedicated infrastructure vulnerability scanners for server configuration issues. However, it can identify vulnerabilities that are directly exploitable through the web application interface.

*   **Runtime Injection Flaws - Severity: High (in `skills-service`)**
    *   **Analysis:** DAST excels at finding runtime injection flaws, such as:
        *   **SQL Injection:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries.
        *   **Command Injection:**  Executing arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **LDAP Injection, XML Injection, etc.:**  Similar injection flaws in other technologies.
    *   **DAST Effectiveness:** **High**. DAST tools actively inject malicious payloads into application inputs and observe the responses to detect injection vulnerabilities. This is a core strength of DAST.

*   **Business Logic Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium (in `skills-service`)**
    *   **Analysis:** DAST can sometimes uncover business logic vulnerabilities, which are flaws in the application's design and workflow. This includes:
        *   **Price Manipulation:**  Exploiting flaws in pricing logic.
        *   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Bypassing business rules through unexpected inputs.
        *   **Workflow Bypass:**  Circumventing intended application flows.
    *   **DAST Effectiveness:** **Medium**. DAST's effectiveness for business logic vulnerabilities is more limited compared to other vulnerability types. It depends on the tool's ability to understand application workflows and the tester's skill in crafting specific test cases. Manual exploration and more advanced DAST techniques (like API fuzzing) can improve detection.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: Medium (especially reflected and DOM-based XSS in `skills-service`)**
    *   **Analysis:** DAST is particularly effective at finding reflected and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Reflected XSS:**  Malicious scripts are reflected back to the user in the response.
        *   **DOM-based XSS:**  Vulnerabilities arise from client-side JavaScript manipulating the DOM based on attacker-controlled input.
    *   **DAST Effectiveness:** **Medium to High**. DAST tools can inject payloads designed to trigger XSS and detect if they are successfully executed in the browser. While SAST is better for stored XSS, DAST complements it well for reflected and DOM-based XSS.
