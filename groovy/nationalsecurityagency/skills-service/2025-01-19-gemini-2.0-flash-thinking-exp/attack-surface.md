# Attack Surface Analysis for nationalsecurityagency/skills-service

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected or Weakly Protected API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_or_weakly_protected_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization controls, allowing unauthorized access and manipulation of skill data.
    *   **How Skills-Service Contributes:** Exposes REST API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting skill information. If these endpoints are not secured, attackers can directly interact with the skill data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could send a `DELETE` request to `/skills/{id}` without proper authentication, resulting in the deletion of a legitimate skill entry.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive skill data, data breaches, data manipulation, and potential disruption of services relying on accurate skill information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, JWT, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce granular authorization controls to restrict access based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Validate authentication tokens on every API request.
        *   Regularly review and update authentication and authorization configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Skill Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_skill_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** The service accepts user-provided data for skill names, descriptions, or other attributes. If not properly sanitized and validated, attackers can inject malicious payloads.
    *   **How Skills-Service Contributes:**  Provides endpoints for creating and updating skill data, making it a direct entry point for potentially malicious input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a malicious script into the "description" field of a skill. If this description is displayed in another application without proper sanitization, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Alternatively, they could inject SQL code into a skill name if input is not sanitized before database interaction.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against applications consuming the skill data, potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities if data is directly used in database queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all data received by the service.
        *   Sanitize and encode user-provided data before storing it in the database.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in consuming applications to mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive information, such as database credentials or API keys, is stored insecurely.
    *   **How Skills-Service Contributes:**  The service needs to store credentials to access the database and potentially other services.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials hardcoded in the application code or stored in plain text in configuration files.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the skills service and potentially other connected systems if database credentials or API keys are exposed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code.
        *   Store sensitive data in secure configuration management systems or secrets managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest.
        *   Implement proper access controls to configuration files and secrets.
