# Threat Model Analysis for nationalsecurityagency/skills-service

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the `skills-service` Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_the__skills-service__library.md)

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the `skills-service` Library
    * **Description:** The `skills-service` library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, authentication bypass, insecure deserialization) that could be exploited by attackers. Attackers could leverage these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the `skills-service` data, manipulate its functionality, or potentially compromise the application server.
    * **Impact:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could have severe consequences, potentially leading to data breaches, complete compromise of the `skills-service`, or even the application itself.
    * **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the `skills-service` depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly monitor for security advisories and updates for the `skills-service` library on its GitHub repository and other relevant security sources.
        * Implement a process for promptly updating the dependency to the latest stable version when security patches are released.
        * Consider using static analysis tools or software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan the `skills-service` code for known vulnerabilities (although this might be challenging for a third-party library).

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `skills-service` Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__skills-service__dependencies.md)

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `skills-service` Dependencies
    * **Description:** The `skills-service` library likely relies on other third-party libraries (dependencies). These dependencies could contain their own security vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities indirectly through the `skills-service`.
    * **Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities in the `skills-service` itself, this could lead to various security breaches and compromises.
    * **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency used by `skills-service`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools (part of SCA) to identify known vulnerabilities in the `skills-service`'s dependencies.
        * Regularly update the `skills-service` dependency to benefit from updates to its own dependencies that include security fixes.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Skill Data (due to `skills-service` flaws)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_skill_data__due_to__skills-service__flaws_.md)

* **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Skill Data (due to `skills-service` flaws)
    * **Description:** The `skills-service` itself might have flaws in its access control mechanisms or data retrieval logic that allow unauthorized users to access sensitive skill data directly through the service's API, bypassing the application's intended access controls.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information could violate privacy regulations, damage reputation, or provide attackers with valuable insights for further attacks.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `skills-service` API endpoints for retrieving skill data.
        * `skills-service` data storage.
        * `skills-service` authorization logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is involved)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and understand the access control mechanisms implemented within the `skills-service`.
        * If possible, configure the `skills-service` to enforce strict access controls based on the principle of least privilege.
        * Monitor access logs for the `skills-service` for suspicious activity.
        * Report any suspected access control vulnerabilities to the `skills-service` maintainers.
