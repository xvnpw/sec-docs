## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses in Skills Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_validation_weaknesses_in_skills_data.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses in Skills Data
  Attack Vectors:
    * SQL Injection (if skills-service uses SQL):
      - How: Injecting malicious SQL queries through input fields to manipulate the database.
      - Impact: Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially leading to full application compromise.
      - Mitigation: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements, enforce strict input validation and sanitization.
    * Command Injection (if skills-service processes skills data in OS commands):
      - How: Injecting malicious commands into input fields that are later executed by the server's operating system.
      - Impact: Full control over the skills-service server, allowing for data theft, malware installation, or further attacks.
      - Mitigation: Avoid executing OS commands based on user input, use secure alternatives, implement strict input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Skills-Service API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_in_skills-service_api.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Skills-Service API
  Attack Vectors:
    * Exploit Weak or Default Credentials:
      - How: Using easily guessable or default usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access.
      - Impact: Full administrative control over the skills-service, allowing for data manipulation, service disruption, or further attacks.
      - Mitigation: Enforce strong password policies, disable default accounts, implement multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Skills-Service Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_skills-service_dependencies.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Skills-Service Dependencies
  Attack Vectors:
    * Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries or frameworks used by skills-service:
      - How: Leveraging publicly known security flaws in third-party components used by the skills-service.
      - Impact: Remote code execution on the skills-service server, leading to full compromise.
      - Mitigation: Regularly update dependencies, implement vulnerability scanning, follow secure development practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Breach of Skills Data Storage](./attack_tree_paths/data_breach_of_skills_data_storage.md)

Critical Node: Data Breach of Skills Data Storage
  Attack Vectors:
    * Direct access to the database server due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the database software itself.
    * Insider threats.
    * Cloud storage misconfigurations (if applicable).
  - Impact: Complete access to all skills data, potentially including sensitive information, leading to privacy violations and reputational damage.
  - Mitigation: Implement strong database access controls, encrypt data at rest, regularly patch database software, secure cloud storage configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if skills-service uses serialization)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_skills-service_uses_serialization_.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if skills-service uses serialization)
  Attack Vectors:
    * Inject malicious serialized objects:
      - How: Crafting malicious data in serialized formats (like JSON or Pickle in Python) that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
      - Impact: Remote code execution on the skills-service server, leading to full compromise.
      - Mitigation: Avoid deserializing untrusted data, use secure serialization libraries, implement integrity checks.
