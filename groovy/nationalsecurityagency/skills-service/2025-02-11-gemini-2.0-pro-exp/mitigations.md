## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Skill Validation and Sandboxing (Skills-Service Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_skill_validation_and_sandboxing__skills-service_focused_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Skill Validation and Sandboxing (Skills-Service Focused)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define a Skill Manifest (within `skills-service`):**  The `skills-service` itself should enforce a schema (JSON or YAML) defining allowed libraries, system calls, resource limits, and metadata for skills. This manifest is *internal* to the service's operation.
        2.  **Static Analysis (Integrated into `skills-service`):** The `skills-service`, upon receiving a skill, should *internally* perform static analysis using tools like Bandit (Python) or appropriate linters. This is *not* just a CI/CD step, but a core function of the service before accepting a skill.
        3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Sandboxing within `skills-service`):** The `skills-service` must have a built-in sandboxing capability.  Before making a skill available, it executes the skill within this isolated environment (Docker + gVisor, or a similar robust solution). This sandbox is managed and controlled by the `skills-service`.
        4.  **Resource Limits (Enforced by `skills-service`):** The `skills-service` enforces CPU, memory, network, and disk I/O limits on each running skill, using the sandbox's capabilities.
        5.  **Skill Execution Engine (within `skills-service`):** The core logic for executing skills, managing their lifecycle (start, stop, status), and handling input/output resides within the `skills-service`. This engine enforces the sandboxing and resource limits.
        6.  **Rejection/Approval Logic (within `skills-service`):**  The `skills-service` itself makes the decision to accept or reject a skill based on the analysis results. This logic is part of the service's code.
        7. **Regular Re-validation (Scheduled by `skills-service`):** The `skills-service` has an internal scheduler or mechanism to periodically re-validate existing skills, repeating the analysis steps.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Skill Execution (Code Injection/RCE):** Severity: **Critical**.  Directly prevents malicious code execution *within the context of the `skills-service`*.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via Skills:** Severity: **High**. Sandboxing and resource limits controlled by `skills-service` restrict exfiltration.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** Severity: **High**. `skills-service` enforces resource limits.
        *   **Skill Interaction Vulnerabilities (Indirectly):** Severity: **Medium**. Isolation managed by `skills-service` reduces impact.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Skill Execution:** Risk reduced by >90% (within the `skills-service` context).
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced by 70-80% (as controlled by `skills-service`).
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced by 80-90% (against the `skills-service` itself).
        *   **Skill Interaction Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by 50-60% (through `skills-service` managed isolation).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic Docker containerization for skill execution (within `skills-service/executor.py`).
        *   Simple resource limits (CPU and memory) set via Docker Compose (but this is *external* to the service's core logic).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Skill Manifest (Internal Enforcement):**  `skills-service` does not internally define and enforce a skill manifest.
        *   **Integrated Static Analysis:** Static analysis is currently only in CI/CD, not within the `skills-service` itself.
        *   **gVisor or Equivalent:**  `skills-service` relies on basic Docker, which is insufficient.
        *   **Dynamic Analysis (Built-in):** No dynamic analysis or behavioral monitoring is part of the `skills-service`.
        *   **Re-validation Scheduler:** No internal mechanism for re-validating skills.
        *   **Rejection/Approval Logic:** The acceptance/rejection is currently manual, not automated within the service.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Skill Interaction Control (within `skills-service`)](./mitigation_strategies/skill_interaction_control__within__skills-service__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Skill Interaction Control (within `skills-service`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Inter-Skill Communication Protocols (within `skills-service`):** If skills are allowed to interact, the `skills-service` must define and enforce secure communication protocols.  This could involve:
            *   A message queue managed by `skills-service`.
            *   A well-defined API exposed by `skills-service` for inter-skill communication.
            *   Restricted shared memory areas managed by `skills-service`.
        2.  **Input Validation (Enforced by `skills-service`):** The `skills-service` *must* mediate all communication between skills and rigorously validate data passed between them.  This is a core responsibility of the service.
        3.  **Sandboxing for Interacting Skills (Managed by `skills-service`):**  Even interacting skills should be isolated in separate sandboxes, with communication channels controlled by the `skills-service`.
        4. **Access Control for Inter-Skill Communication:** The `skills-service` should implement access control mechanisms to determine which skills are allowed to communicate with each other. This could be based on skill metadata or a predefined interaction matrix.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Skill Interaction Vulnerabilities:** Severity: **Medium**. This is the primary mitigation.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Skill Interaction Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced by 60-70% (by controlling and validating inter-skill communication).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Skills can potentially communicate directly via shared network resources (due to basic Docker networking).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Defined Inter-Skill Communication Protocols:** No formal protocols are defined or enforced by `skills-service`.
        *   **Input Validation (Between Skills):** `skills-service` does not mediate or validate inter-skill communication.
        *   **Controlled Sandboxing for Interacting Skills:**  `skills-service` does not manage separate sandboxes for interacting skills.
        *   **Access Control for Inter-Skill Communication:** No access control mechanisms are in place.
