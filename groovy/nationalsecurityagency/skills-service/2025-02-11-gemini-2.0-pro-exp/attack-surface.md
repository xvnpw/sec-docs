# Attack Surface Analysis for nationalsecurityagency/skills-service

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Skill Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_skill_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands through the skill definition mechanism. This is the *core* attack vector, inherent to the service's design.
    *   **How skills-service contributes:** The service's *primary function* is to execute user-defined skills, making it inherently vulnerable to malicious input. This is a direct consequence of the service's purpose.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A skill definition includes a command to execute a shell script: `command: "bash /tmp/malicious.sh"`.
        *   A skill definition uses a templating feature to access system environment variables: `description: "User info: {{ system.env.SECRET_KEY }}"`.
        *   A skill definition attempts to write to a restricted file: `output_file: "/etc/passwd"`.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data exfiltration, system compromise, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement a whitelist-based approach, allowing *only* specific, pre-approved commands, functions, and data structures within skill definitions. Reject *any* input that doesn't conform to the whitelist. This is paramount.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Execute skills within a *highly restricted* environment (e.g., a container with *minimal* privileges, a chroot jail, or a dedicated virtual machine).  Limit access to the file system, network, and system calls *severely*. Use technologies like `seccomp` (Secure Computing Mode) to restrict system calls at the kernel level.
        *   **Code Review:**  Mandatory, rigorous code review of *all* skill definitions before deployment, *especially* if submitted by untrusted users.  This is a critical human-in-the-loop control.
        *   **Language Restrictions:** If feasible, use a *restricted*, domain-specific language (DSL) for skill definitions that *inherently* limits expressiveness and *prevents* arbitrary code execution.  *Avoid* general-purpose scripting languages.
        *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** If skill results are displayed or used elsewhere, ensure proper output encoding/escaping to prevent secondary injection vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS).

## Attack Surface: [2. Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/2__resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft skill definitions designed to consume excessive system resources, leading to a denial of service. This is a direct attack on the service's execution capabilities.
    *   **How skills-service contributes:** The service executes skills, which can *directly* consume arbitrary amounts of resources if not limited. This is an inherent risk of executing user-provided code.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A skill definition contains an infinite loop: `while true; do echo "looping"; done`.
        *   A skill definition allocates a huge array: `data: [1] * 1000000000`.
        *   A skill definition makes numerous network requests in a tight loop.
        *   A skill definition creates many temporary files without deleting them.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), system instability, unavailability of the service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** *Strictly* enforce resource limits on *all* skill executions. This includes CPU time, memory usage, disk space, network bandwidth, and the number of processes. Use containerization (e.g., Docker, with resource limits) or system-level tools (e.g., `ulimit`, `cgroups`) for enforcement.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement *mandatory* timeouts for *all* skill executions to prevent them from running indefinitely.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which users can submit *or* execute skills to prevent abuse. This is a crucial preventative measure.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Continuously monitor resource usage and set up *immediate* alerts for potential DoS attacks (e.g., exceeding resource thresholds).

## Attack Surface: [3. Skill Definition Tampering](./attack_surfaces/3__skill_definition_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to *modify* existing skill definitions, injecting malicious code or altering their behavior. This directly targets the service's stored skill data.
    *   **How skills-service contributes:** The service *relies on* stored skill definitions, which become a direct target for tampering. The service's functionality depends on the integrity of these definitions.
    *   **Example:**
        *   An attacker gains access to the database and modifies a legitimate skill definition to include a malicious command.
        *   An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the API to overwrite a skill definition file.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to Malicious Skill Injection (RCE, data exfiltration, etc.), but with the added risk of affecting existing, previously trusted skills. This can be a *covert* attack.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Access Control:** Implement *strict* access control to the storage location of skill definitions (database, file system, etc.). *Only* authorized users and services should have *write* access. This is fundamental.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Use cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures to *verify the integrity* of skill definitions. *Detect any unauthorized modifications immediately*.
        *   **Auditing:** Log *all* changes to skill definitions, including *who* made the change and *when*. This provides an audit trail for investigation.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to skill definitions and allow for rollback to previous, known-good versions.

## Attack Surface: [4. API Abuse (Directly Related to Skills)](./attack_surfaces/4__api_abuse__directly_related_to_skills_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the API *specifically to submit malicious skills or trigger unauthorized skill executions*. This focuses on API calls directly related to the core skill functionality.
    *   **How skills-service contributes:** The service exposes an API *for managing and executing skills*, and this API becomes a direct attack surface for manipulating the core functionality.
    *   **Example:**
        *   An attacker bypasses authentication and submits malicious skill definitions through the API.
        *   An attacker uses the API to trigger excessive skill executions, leading to a DoS.
        *  An attacker uses API to list all available skills and their definitions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, DoS, system compromise (through malicious skill execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement *robust* authentication for *all* API endpoints related to skill submission and execution. Use strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or API keys/tokens with *secure* management.
        *   **Authorization (RBAC/ABAC):** Enforce *fine-grained* authorization using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Restrict access to specific API functions (e.g., submitting skills, executing skills) and resources (e.g., specific skill types) based on user roles and attributes.
        *   **Input Validation:** *Rigorously* validate *all* API inputs related to skill definitions and execution parameters. Use a *whitelist* approach whenever possible. This is crucial for preventing injection attacks through the API.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate of API requests, *especially* for skill submission and execution endpoints, to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
        *   **Secure Communication (TLS):** Use TLS/SSL with strong ciphers and protocols to encrypt *all* API communication.
