## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities in skills-service Code (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_skills-service_code__high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents the attacker directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the `skills-service` codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Input Validation Failure (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_input_validation_failure__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This is the most critical vulnerability category, as it's the foundation for many other attacks.
        *   **Description:** The `skills-service` fails to properly validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code or commands.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strict input validation using whitelisting (allowing only known-good input).
            *   Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection.
            *   Use secure coding practices for NoSQL databases to prevent NoSQL injection.
            *   Sanitize all output to prevent XSS.
            *   Disable external entity processing in XML parsers to prevent XXE.
            *   Avoid executing external commands; if necessary, use a whitelist and sanitize input.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 SQL Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_sql_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that are executed by the `skills-service` database.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Data exfiltration, modification, deletion)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2 NoSQL Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_nosql_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** The attacker crafts malicious NoSQL queries that are executed by the `skills-service` database (if a NoSQL database is used).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Data exfiltration, modification, deletion)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_command_injection.md)

*   **Action:** Inject OS commands through user-supplied input.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.3 Broken Access Control (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_3_broken_access_control__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The `skills-service` has flaws in how it enforces access control to resources (e.g., skills, user data, API endpoints).  An attacker can access resources they shouldn't be able to.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC).
            *   Thoroughly test all access control logic.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege (users and services should only have the minimum necessary permissions).
        *   **Action:** Exploit flaws in access control enforcement.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The `skills-service` relies on third-party libraries or frameworks that have known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly update all dependencies to the latest secure versions.
            *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerable components.
            *   Have a process for rapidly patching vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.1 Vulnerable Libraries/Frameworks (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_1_vulnerable_librariesframeworks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** Exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party code.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Variable (Low to Very High, depending on the specific vulnerability)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Public exploits may be available)
            *   **Skill Level:** Variable (Novice to Expert)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exfiltration (After Compromise) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exfiltration__after_compromise___high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents the actions an attacker takes *after* successfully compromising the `skills-service` instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Direct Database Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_direct_database_access__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains direct access to the `skills-service` database, bypassing the application's intended access controls. This could be through compromised credentials, SQL injection, or other vulnerabilities.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Restrict database access to only authorized services and users.
            *   Use strong database credentials and rotate them regularly.
            *   Implement database auditing to detect unauthorized access.
        *   **Action:** Use compromised credentials or vulnerabilities to query the database directly.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 API Abuse (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_api_abuse__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses compromised API keys, exploits vulnerabilities in the API, or bypasses authentication to access sensitive data through the `skills-service` API.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Secure API key management (strong keys, secure storage, regular rotation).
            *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
            *   Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse.
            *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
        *   **Action:** Use compromised API keys or exploit API vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
