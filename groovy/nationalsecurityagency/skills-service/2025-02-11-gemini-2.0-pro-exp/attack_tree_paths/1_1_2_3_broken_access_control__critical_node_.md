# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Broken Access Control in skills-service

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors related to Broken Access Control (BAC) within the `skills-service` application.  We aim to identify specific weaknesses, assess their exploitability, and propose concrete, actionable remediation steps beyond the high-level mitigations already listed in the attack tree.  This analysis will inform development and security teams about the precise risks and guide them in prioritizing security efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack tree path **1.1.2.3 Broken Access Control**.  We will consider the following aspects within the `skills-service` context:

*   **Resource Types:**  Skills data (definitions, metadata, execution code), user data (profiles, roles, permissions), API endpoints (both internal and external), and any administrative interfaces.
*   **Access Control Mechanisms:**  Existing RBAC implementation (if any), authentication mechanisms, authorization checks, session management, and any custom access control logic.
*   **Potential Attack Vectors:**  Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, unauthorized modification of data, unauthorized execution of skills, and bypassing of intended access restrictions.
*   **Codebase:**  We will assume access to the `skills-service` codebase for static analysis and potential dynamic testing.  We will focus on areas related to access control logic.
*   **Dependencies:** We will consider the security of third-party libraries and services used by `skills-service` that might impact access control.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors (e.g., injection, XSS) unless they directly contribute to or are a consequence of broken access control.

### 1.3 Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  A thorough examination of the `skills-service` source code, focusing on:
    *   Identification of all access control checks (e.g., `@PreAuthorize`, custom authorization logic).
    *   Analysis of how roles and permissions are defined, assigned, and enforced.
    *   Examination of API endpoint security annotations and configurations.
    *   Review of session management and authentication flows.
    *   Identification of potential vulnerabilities like hardcoded credentials, insecure defaults, and logic errors.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  If feasible, we will perform dynamic testing, including:
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities using various attack techniques.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Providing unexpected or malformed inputs to API endpoints to identify potential access control bypasses.
    *   **Role-Based Testing:**  Creating different user roles with varying permissions and testing their access to resources.

3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack scenarios and assess their likelihood and impact.

4.  **Dependency Analysis:**  We will analyze the dependencies of `skills-service` to identify any known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that could lead to broken access control.

5.  **Documentation Review:**  We will review any existing documentation related to the `skills-service` architecture, security design, and access control policies.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2.3 Broken Access Control

### 2.1 Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Scenarios

Based on the description and common BAC vulnerabilities, we can hypothesize several potential issues within `skills-service`:

*   **Inadequate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation:**
    *   **Insufficient Granularity:** Roles might be too broad, granting users more permissions than necessary.  For example, a "user" role might have access to modify other users' skills, which should be restricted to an "admin" or "skill_manager" role.
    *   **Incorrect Role Assignment:**  Logic errors in the code could lead to users being assigned incorrect roles, granting them unintended access.
    *   **Missing Role Checks:**  Some API endpoints or functionalities might not have proper role checks, allowing any authenticated user (or even unauthenticated users) to access them.
    *   **Role Hierarchy Issues:** If a role hierarchy is implemented, there might be flaws in how inheritance is handled, leading to unexpected privilege escalation.

*   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):**
    *   `skills-service` likely uses identifiers (IDs) to refer to skills, users, and other resources.  If these IDs are predictable and not properly validated, an attacker could manipulate them to access resources they shouldn't have access to.  For example, changing a skill ID in a URL parameter might allow access to another user's private skill.
    *   Example: `/api/skills/123` (attacker changes to `/api/skills/456` to access another skill).

*   **Path Traversal:**
    *   If `skills-service` allows users to specify file paths or resource names, an attacker might use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../`) to access files or directories outside the intended scope. This could expose sensitive configuration files or even allow the execution of arbitrary code.
    *   Example:  If a skill can be loaded from a file, an attacker might try `/api/loadSkill?path=../../etc/passwd`.

*   **API Endpoint Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:**  Some API endpoints might be unintentionally exposed without proper authentication or authorization checks.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  Lack of proper input validation on API parameters could allow attackers to inject malicious data or bypass access control checks.
    *   **Rate Limiting Issues:**  Absence of rate limiting could allow attackers to brute-force IDs or perform other attacks that rely on sending a large number of requests.

*   **Session Management Weaknesses:**
    *   **Predictable Session IDs:**  If session IDs are predictable, an attacker could hijack another user's session and gain their privileges.
    *   **Insufficient Session Timeout:**  Long session timeouts could increase the window of opportunity for session hijacking.
    *   **Improper Session Invalidation:**  Failure to properly invalidate sessions after logout or role changes could allow attackers to continue using old sessions.

*   **Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalation:**
    * **Horizontal:** Accessing data or functionality of another user at the *same* privilege level.  (e.g., User A accessing User B's skills).
    * **Vertical:** Gaining access to data or functionality of a *higher* privilege level. (e.g., a regular user gaining administrator privileges).

* **Default Credentials or Configuration:**
    * The application might be deployed with default administrator credentials or insecure default configurations that allow unauthorized access.

### 2.2 Code Review Focus Areas (Examples)

During the code review, we would pay close attention to the following:

*   **Spring Security Annotations (if used):**  Examine `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, `@Secured`, and `@RolesAllowed` annotations to ensure they are correctly applied and enforce the intended access control policies.
*   **Custom Authorization Logic:**  Analyze any custom code that implements authorization checks, looking for potential logic errors, bypasses, and vulnerabilities.
*   **Database Queries:**  Examine database queries that retrieve or modify data, ensuring that they include appropriate WHERE clauses to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.  Look for SQL injection vulnerabilities that could be used to bypass access control.
*   **API Endpoint Definitions:**  Review the definitions of all API endpoints, paying attention to the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the associated security configurations.
*   **Session Management Configuration:**  Examine the configuration of session management, including session ID generation, timeout settings, and invalidation mechanisms.
*   **Error Handling:**  Ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information that could be used to bypass access control.
*   **Configuration Files:** Review configuration files for any hardcoded credentials, insecure default settings, or exposed API keys.

### 2.3 Dynamic Testing Scenarios

We would perform the following dynamic tests:

*   **Role-Based Testing:** Create multiple user accounts with different roles and permissions.  Attempt to access resources and perform actions that should be restricted to specific roles.
*   **IDOR Testing:**  Identify all API endpoints that use IDs to refer to resources.  Attempt to modify these IDs to access resources belonging to other users or to access resources that should be inaccessible.
*   **Path Traversal Testing:**  Identify any API endpoints or functionalities that allow users to specify file paths or resource names.  Attempt to use path traversal techniques to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
*   **API Fuzzing:**  Send malformed or unexpected inputs to API endpoints to identify potential vulnerabilities and bypasses.
*   **Session Hijacking Testing:**  Attempt to hijack another user's session by guessing or stealing their session ID.
*   **Privilege Escalation Testing:**  Attempt to escalate privileges from a low-privilege user account to a higher-privilege account.

### 2.4 Remediation Steps (Beyond High-Level Mitigations)

In addition to the high-level mitigations listed in the attack tree, we recommend the following specific remediation steps:

1.  **Implement Fine-Grained RBAC:**
    *   Define clear and granular roles with specific permissions for each resource and action.
    *   Use a role hierarchy to simplify management and avoid redundancy.
    *   Ensure that all API endpoints and functionalities are protected by appropriate role checks.

2.  **Prevent IDOR:**
    *   Use indirect object references (e.g., UUIDs) instead of predictable IDs.
    *   Implement robust access control checks to verify that the user is authorized to access the requested resource, regardless of the ID.
    *   Use a mapping table to associate user-specific identifiers with internal resource IDs.

3.  **Prevent Path Traversal:**
    *   Sanitize and validate all user-supplied file paths or resource names.
    *   Use a whitelist approach to allow only specific characters and patterns.
    *   Avoid using user input directly in file system operations.

4.  **Secure API Endpoints:**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    *   Validate all input parameters to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

5.  **Strengthen Session Management:**
    *   Use a secure random number generator to create unpredictable session IDs.
    *   Set appropriate session timeouts.
    *   Invalidate sessions properly after logout or role changes.
    *   Use HTTPS to protect session cookies from interception.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

7.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Regularly update all dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    *   Use a dependency scanning tool to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

8.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure that all users and services have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

9. **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    * Implement robust input validation on all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    * Use output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which could be used to bypass access control.

10. **Secure Configuration Management:**
    * Store sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) securely, outside of the codebase.
    * Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
    * Avoid hardcoding credentials or using default passwords.

By implementing these remediation steps, the `skills-service` can significantly reduce its risk of broken access control vulnerabilities.  Continuous monitoring and testing are crucial to ensure the ongoing security of the application.
