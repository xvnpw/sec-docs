Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on NoSQL Injection against the NSA's `skills-service`.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1.2 NoSQL Injection

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the risk, impact, and mitigation strategies for NoSQL Injection vulnerabilities within the `skills-service` application, specifically focusing on the scenario where an attacker crafts malicious NoSQL queries.  This analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to prevent this attack vector.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **Target Application:**  The `skills-service` application (https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency/skills-service).  We will assume, for the purpose of this analysis, that a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB, Cassandra) is used for data storage.  If the service *doesn't* use a NoSQL database, this entire analysis is irrelevant.  **This is a critical assumption that needs to be verified with the development team.**
*   **Attack Vector:** NoSQL Injection, specifically through the crafting of malicious queries.  We will not cover other injection types (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) or other attack vectors (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
*   **Attack Tree Path:** 1.1.1.2 (as provided).
*   **Components:**  We will consider the interaction between the `skills-service` application code (primarily Python, based on the GitHub repository), the NoSQL database driver/library used, and the NoSQL database itself.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential entry points for NoSQL injection within the `skills-service` application.  This involves reviewing the code (where possible) and understanding how user input is handled and used in database queries.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine common NoSQL injection techniques and how they might be applied to the `skills-service`.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the potential consequences of a successful NoSQL injection attack.
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Provide specific, actionable recommendations to prevent or mitigate NoSQL injection vulnerabilities.
5.  **Detection Strategies:**  Outline methods for detecting attempted or successful NoSQL injection attacks.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1.2 NoSQL Injection

#### 4.1 Threat Modeling (Identifying Entry Points)

Based on a review of the `skills-service` GitHub repository, and assuming a NoSQL database is used, potential entry points for NoSQL injection include:

*   **Search Functionality:**  If the application allows users to search for skills or related data, the search input field is a prime target.  The application likely constructs a NoSQL query based on the user's search terms.
*   **Filtering/Sorting:**  If users can filter or sort results based on various criteria, these filter/sort parameters could be manipulated to inject malicious code.
*   **User Input in API Calls:**  The `skills-service` likely exposes APIs for interacting with the data.  Any API endpoint that accepts user input as part of a query is a potential vulnerability.  This includes `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and even `GET` requests (if query parameters are used to construct database queries).
*   **Data Import/Export:** If the application allows importing or exporting data, the imported data could contain malicious NoSQL code that is executed when processed.
* **Indirect Input:** Data that is not directly entered by the user, but is retrieved from other sources (e.g., another service, a database, a file) and then used in a NoSQL query, could also be a source of injection.

**Code Review (Hypothetical Example - MongoDB with PyMongo):**

Let's imagine a simplified (and vulnerable) code snippet within `skills-service` that uses PyMongo to query a MongoDB database:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client.skills_db
skills_collection = db.skills

def search_skills(search_term):
    # VULNERABLE CODE: Directly using user input in the query
    results = skills_collection.find({"name": {"$regex": search_term}})
    return list(results)

user_input = request.args.get('search')  # Get search term from URL parameter
found_skills = search_skills(user_input)
```

This code is vulnerable because it directly uses the `search_term` (obtained from user input) in the `$regex` operator.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Common NoSQL Injection Techniques)

Several techniques can be used for NoSQL injection, depending on the specific database and driver/library used.  Here are some common examples, focusing on MongoDB (a popular NoSQL choice):

*   **Logical Operators ($where, $expr):**  Attackers can inject JavaScript code into `$where` or `$expr` clauses to bypass intended logic.  For example:
    *   `search_term = '"; return true; //'`  This would cause the `$regex` to always return true, bypassing any filtering.
    *   `search_term = '"; db.users.drop(); //'`  This could attempt to drop an entire collection (if the database user has sufficient privileges).

*   **Bypassing Type Checking:**  If the application expects a specific data type (e.g., an integer) but doesn't properly validate it, an attacker might inject a string containing a malicious query.

*   **Exploiting Driver-Specific Features:**  Some drivers might have features or quirks that can be exploited.  For example, some drivers might allow passing arbitrary options to the database, which could be abused.

*   **Time-Based Attacks:**  Similar to SQL injection, attackers can use time-based techniques to infer information about the database structure or data.  This involves crafting queries that take longer to execute based on certain conditions.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can craft queries that are extremely resource-intensive, causing the database to become unresponsive.  This could involve using complex regular expressions or forcing the database to scan a large number of documents.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

A successful NoSQL injection attack against `skills-service` could have severe consequences:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers could retrieve sensitive data about skills, potentially including classified information or details about national security capabilities.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers could alter skill data, adding false information, modifying existing entries, or deleting critical data.  This could disrupt operations or mislead decision-makers.
*   **Data Deletion:**  Attackers could delete entire collections or databases, causing significant data loss and service disruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In some cases, NoSQL injection could be used to gain higher privileges within the database or even the underlying operating system.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers could render the `skills-service` unavailable by overloading the database with malicious queries.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the NSA and erode trust in its systems.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendations

The following recommendations are crucial for preventing NoSQL injection vulnerabilities:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for each input field.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.  This is the most effective defense.
    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that input data matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce reasonable length limits on input fields to prevent excessively long queries.
    *   **Escape Special Characters:**  If you must allow special characters, properly escape them according to the database driver's documentation.  However, whitelisting is generally preferred.

*   **Parameterized Queries (or Equivalent):**
    *   **Use Parameterized Queries:**  If the NoSQL database and driver support parameterized queries (similar to prepared statements in SQL), use them.  This separates the query logic from the data, preventing injection.
    *   **Use Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) or Object-Document Mappers (ODMs):**  ORMs/ODMs (e.g., MongoEngine for MongoDB) often provide built-in protection against injection by abstracting away the query construction process.  However, ensure the ORM/ODM is properly configured and used securely.

*   **Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   **Database User Permissions:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the `skills-service` has only the minimum necessary privileges.  It should not have permission to drop collections, create users, or perform other administrative tasks.
    *   **Application-Level Permissions:**  Implement application-level authorization checks to ensure that users can only access and modify data they are authorized to see.

*   **Avoid Dynamic Query Construction:**
    *   **Minimize Dynamic Queries:**  Avoid constructing queries dynamically based on user input whenever possible.  Use pre-defined queries or query builders that are less susceptible to injection.

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on database interactions and input handling.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform regular penetration testing, including attempts to exploit NoSQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Use a WAF:**  Deploy a WAF to filter out malicious requests, including those containing potential NoSQL injection payloads.  Configure the WAF with rules specific to NoSQL injection.

*   **Keep Software Up-to-Date:**
    *   **Database Driver/Library:**  Regularly update the NoSQL database driver/library to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Database Server:**  Keep the NoSQL database server itself up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Application Framework:** Update the application framework (e.g., Flask, Django) to the latest version.

* **Error Handling:**
    * **Generic Error Messages:** Avoid displaying detailed error messages to the user, as these can reveal information about the database structure or query logic.

#### 4.5 Detection Strategies

Detecting NoSQL injection attempts can be challenging, but here are some strategies:

*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   **Configure IDS/IPS:**  Configure an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for patterns associated with NoSQL injection attacks.  This may require custom rules based on the specific database and application.

*   **Log Analysis:**
    *   **Database Logs:**  Monitor database logs for unusual queries, errors, or slow query execution times.  Look for queries that contain unexpected characters or patterns.
    *   **Application Logs:**  Log all user input and database interactions.  Analyze these logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Logs:**
    *   **Monitor WAF Logs:**  Review WAF logs for blocked requests that match NoSQL injection patterns.

*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    *   **Use a SIEM:**  Implement a SIEM system to aggregate and correlate logs from various sources (database, application, WAF, IDS/IPS).  This can help identify complex attack patterns.

*   **Honeypots:**
    *   **Deploy Honeypots:**  Consider deploying honeypots (decoy systems) to attract attackers and gather information about their techniques.

### 5. Conclusion

NoSQL injection is a serious threat to the `skills-service` application, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption.  By implementing the mitigation recommendations outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and robust monitoring are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.  The most critical first step is to **verify whether a NoSQL database is actually used**. If not, this analysis is not applicable. If it is, input validation and parameterized queries (or their equivalent) are the most important defenses.
