# Project Design Document: Skills Service

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared By:** AI Architecture Expert

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design for the Skills Service project, based on the repository found at [https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service). This document aims to clearly outline the system's architecture, components, data flow, and deployment considerations. It will serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities. This revision includes more detailed descriptions and expands on security considerations.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the Skills Service is to provide a centralized platform for managing and accessing information about individual skills. Key objectives include:

*   Providing a well-defined and documented RESTful API for interacting with skill data.
*   Allowing for the complete lifecycle management of skill records: creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD).
*   Supporting a rich set of attributes for each skill, such as name, description, categories, and potentially proficiency levels or associated resources.
*   Offering robust mechanisms for searching and filtering skills based on various criteria, including keywords, categories, and other relevant attributes.
*   Ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security through appropriate validation and access controls.
*   Being designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of deployment in a cloud environment.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

The Skills Service adopts a microservices architecture, separating concerns into distinct, independently deployable units. This approach promotes modularity, scalability, and resilience. The core components are:

*   **API Gateway:**  The single entry point for all external requests, responsible for routing, authentication, authorization, and potentially rate limiting and request transformation.
*   **Skills Service:** The core business logic component responsible for managing skill data. It handles CRUD operations, search functionality, and data validation.
*   **Database:**  A persistent storage layer optimized for storing and retrieving skill data.
*   **Authentication Service (Assumed):** While not explicitly detailed in the provided repository, a separate authentication service is assumed for securely verifying the identity of clients and issuing access tokens.

## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1. API Gateway

*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Reverse Proxy and Routing:**  Directs incoming requests to the appropriate backend service (primarily the Skills Service) based on defined routes and rules.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization Enforcement:**  Verifies the identity of the client using tokens provided in the request and ensures they have the necessary permissions to access the requested resources. This involves communication with the Authentication Service.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**  Protects the backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive requests, ensuring fair usage and preventing denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Request and Response Transformation:**  May modify request headers or bodies before forwarding them to the backend, and similarly transform responses before sending them back to the client.
    *   **TLS Termination:**  Handles the encryption and decryption of HTTPS traffic, ensuring secure communication between clients and the service.
    *   **API Composition (Potentially):** In more complex scenarios, the API Gateway might aggregate responses from multiple backend services.
*   **Technology:**  Likely an off-the-shelf API Gateway solution such as Kong, Tyk, Ambassador, or a cloud-managed service like AWS API Gateway, Azure API Management, or Google Cloud API Gateway. Alternatively, a lightweight proxy like Nginx or Traefik with added authentication plugins could be used.

### 4.2. Skills Service

*   **Functionality:**
    *   **RESTful API Endpoints:** Exposes well-defined endpoints for managing skill data, adhering to RESTful principles (e.g., `/skills` for collections, `/skills/{id}` for individual resources).
    *   **CRUD Operations Implementation:**  Provides logic for creating new skill records, retrieving existing ones (individually or in lists), updating existing records, and deleting records from the database.
    *   **Search and Filtering Logic:**  Implements functionality to search and filter skills based on various criteria specified in the request parameters (e.g., name, description keywords, categories). This might involve database queries or dedicated search indexing technologies.
    *   **Data Validation and Sanitization:**  Ensures that incoming data conforms to defined schemas and constraints, preventing invalid data from being persisted and mitigating injection attacks.
    *   **Business Logic Implementation:**  Enforces any specific business rules related to skill management, such as constraints on skill names or relationships between skills.
    *   **Data Transformation (Potentially):** May transform data between the API layer and the data storage layer.
*   **Technology:** Based on the repository, likely implemented using Python and a framework like FastAPI or Flask. Consideration for asynchronous processing might lead to the use of libraries like `asyncio`.
*   **Data Model (Conceptual):**
    *   `skill_id` (UUID or Integer, Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
    *   `name` (String, Required, Indexed for Search)
    *   `description` (String, Indexed for Search)
    *   `category` (String, Optional, for categorization and filtering)
    *   `created_at` (Timestamp, Automatically Generated)
    *   `updated_at` (Timestamp, Automatically Updated)
    *   `related_skills` (Array/List of Skill IDs, for representing relationships)
    *   `proficiency_levels` (JSON or structured data, if tracking proficiency)

### 4.3. Database

*   **Functionality:**  Provides persistent, reliable, and scalable storage for skill data. It should support efficient querying and indexing for search operations.
*   **Technology:**  Likely a relational database such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or potentially a cloud-managed database service like Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, or Google Cloud SQL. The provided repository suggests PostgreSQL, which is a strong choice for structured data.
*   **Schema:**  Will contain a table (or set of tables if relationships are complex) to store skill records, mapping to the data model described above. Consideration for indexing strategies to optimize search performance is important.

### 4.4. Authentication Service (Assumed)

*   **Functionality:**
    *   **User/Application Authentication:** Verifies the identity of users or applications attempting to access the Skills Service, typically through username/password credentials or API keys.
    *   **Token Issuance:**  Issues secure access tokens (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens) upon successful authentication. These tokens are used by clients to authenticate subsequent requests to the API Gateway.
    *   **Token Verification and Validation:**  Provides mechanisms for the API Gateway to verify the authenticity and validity of access tokens presented by clients. This includes checking the signature, expiration time, and issuer of the token.
    *   **Authorization Information Provision:**  May provide information about the roles and permissions associated with an authenticated user or application, allowing the API Gateway to make authorization decisions.
    *   **User Management (Potentially):**  May include functionalities for managing user accounts, such as registration, password reset, and profile management.
*   **Technology:**  Could be a dedicated identity provider (IdP) like Keycloak, Auth0, Okta, or a cloud-managed service like AWS Cognito, Azure Active Directory, or Google Cloud Identity Platform. A custom-built service using frameworks like Spring Security or Django OAuth Toolkit is also possible.
