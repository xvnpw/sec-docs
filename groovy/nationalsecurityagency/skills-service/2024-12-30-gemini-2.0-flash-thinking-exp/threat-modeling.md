### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving skills-service

This document outlines high and critical threats directly involving the `skills-service` (https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service).

*   **Threat:** Data Integrity Compromise - Unauthorized Modification of Skill Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within the `skills-service`* to directly modify skill data, user endorsements, or other managed information. This could involve using SQL injection *in the `skills-service`*, API manipulation of the service's endpoints, or exploiting access control flaws *within the service*.
    *   **Impact:** Inaccurate skill profiles, misrepresentation of user capabilities, potential for biased decision-making in applications relying on this data, and loss of trust in the system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database (skill data tables, endorsement tables) *managed by the `skills-service`*, API endpoints for data modification *provided by the `skills-service`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints *of the `skills-service`* that modify data.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements *within the `skills-service`'s database interactions* to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Enforce strict access controls and authorization mechanisms *within the `skills-service`* to limit data modification to authorized users and processes.
        *   Implement data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, hashing) *within the `skills-service`* to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Regularly audit database access and modifications *within the `skills-service`*.

*   **Threat:** Access Control Bypass - Unauthorized Data Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication or authorization mechanisms *within the `skills-service`* to gain unauthorized access to sensitive skill data or administrative functions. This could involve exploiting authentication flaws, session hijacking *within the service*, or privilege escalation vulnerabilities *within the service*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data (skills, endorsements) managed by the `skills-service`, potential for unauthorized data modification or deletion, and compromise of the `skills-service` itself.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module *of the `skills-service`*, Authorization module *of the `skills-service`*, API endpoints for data retrieval *provided by the `skills-service`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) *within the `skills-service`*.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions *within the `skills-service`*.
        *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations *of the `skills-service`*.
        *   Implement secure session management practices to prevent session hijacking *within the `skills-service`*.
        *   Conduct penetration testing *of the `skills-service`* to identify and address access control vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** API Injection Attacks
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or commands through the `skills-service`'s API endpoints due to insufficient input validation *within the service*. This could include SQL injection *targeting the `skills-service`'s database*, command injection *on the `skills-service`'s server*, or cross-site scripting (XSS) if the API returns data that is rendered in a web browser.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach *of the `skills-service`'s data*, unauthorized data modification, remote code execution on the `skills-service` server, or compromise of user sessions if XSS is successful.
    *   **Affected Component:** All API endpoints *of the `skills-service`* that accept user input.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all API endpoints *of the `skills-service`*.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions *within the `skills-service`*.
        *   Avoid constructing dynamic SQL queries from user input *within the `skills-service`*.
        *   Encode output data properly to prevent XSS vulnerabilities *in the `skills-service`'s API responses*.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests *to the `skills-service`*.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks *used by the `skills-service`*. This could be achieved by targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies *of the `skills-service`*.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution *on the `skills-service` server*, denial of service *of the `skills-service`*, data breach *of the `skills-service`'s data*, or other forms of compromise depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** All components *within the `skills-service`* relying on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all dependencies *used by the `skills-service`*.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies *of the `skills-service`* for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Promptly update vulnerable dependencies *of the `skills-service`* to patched versions.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring security advisories related to used dependencies *of the `skills-service`*.

*   **Threat:** Configuration Exploitation - Insecure Settings
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits insecure default configurations or misconfigurations *within the `skills-service`*. This could involve exploiting exposed administrative interfaces *of the `skills-service`*, default credentials, or overly permissive access rules *within the service*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the `skills-service`, potential for complete compromise of the service and its data, and the ability to manipulate the service's behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration files *of the `skills-service`*, deployment settings, administrative interfaces *of the `skills-service`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices for configuring the `skills-service`.
        *   Disable or secure any unnecessary administrative interfaces *of the `skills-service`*.
        *   Change default credentials immediately upon deployment *of the `skills-service`*.
        *   Regularly review and audit configuration settings *of the `skills-service`*.
        *   Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage and enforce consistent configurations *for the `skills-service`*.

*   **Threat:** Data Privacy Violation - Unauthorized Disclosure of PII
    *   **Description:** If the `skills-service` stores Personally Identifiable Information (PII), vulnerabilities *within the service* could lead to unauthorized access or disclosure of this data. This could be through direct database access, API vulnerabilities *in the `skills-service`*, or insecure data handling practices *within the service*.
    *   **Impact:** Legal and regulatory penalties, reputational damage, loss of user trust, and potential harm to individuals whose data is exposed.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database (user data tables) *managed by the `skills-service`*, API endpoints *of the `skills-service`* returning user information, data storage mechanisms *within the `skills-service`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the amount of PII stored by the `skills-service`.
        *   Implement strong encryption for PII at rest and in transit *within the `skills-service`*.
        *   Enforce strict access controls to PII *within the `skills-service`*.
        *   Comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
        *   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures *for the `skills-service`*.
