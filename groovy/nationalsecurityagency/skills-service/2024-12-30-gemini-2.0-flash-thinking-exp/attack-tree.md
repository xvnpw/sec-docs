## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the integrated `skills-service`.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Vulnerabilities in skills-service Directly
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in skills-service
        *   **CRITICAL NODE** Bypass Authentication to Access/Modify Skills Data
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Exploit Default Credentials (if any exist)
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Exploit Weak Password Policy (if applicable)
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (e.g., insecure API endpoints)
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities in skills-service
        *   **CRITICAL NODE** SQL Injection
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Inject Malicious SQL Queries to Access/Modify/Delete Data
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Exploit Insecure API Design or Implementation
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Parameter Tampering
            *   Modify API Parameters to Achieve Unauthorized Actions
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
            *   Access or Modify Skills Data Belonging to Other Users
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Lack of Input Validation
            *   Send Malicious or Unexpected Input to Cause Errors or Exploits
*   **HIGH RISK PATH** Manipulate Skills Data to Compromise Application Logic
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Inject Malicious Skills Data
        *   Insert Skills with Malicious Payloads (e.g., XSS, code injection)
*   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE** Exploit Insecure Communication Between Application and skills-service
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
        *   Intercept and Modify Communication Between Application and skills-service
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Steal Authentication Tokens/Credentials
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Modify API Requests/Responses
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH** Inject Malicious Data

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Vulnerabilities in skills-service Directly**
    *   This encompasses attacks that directly target weaknesses within the `skills-service` application itself, without necessarily involving the application that uses it.

*   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in skills-service**
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: Bypass Authentication to Access/Modify Skills Data:**
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Default Credentials (if any exist):** Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default usernames and passwords that might not have been changed.
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Weak Password Policy (if applicable):** Attackers leverage weak password requirements to crack user passwords through brute-force or dictionary attacks.
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (e.g., insecure API endpoints):** Attackers exploit flaws in the authentication logic, such as unprotected API endpoints or incorrect session management, to gain access without proper credentials.

*   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities in skills-service**
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: SQL Injection:**
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Malicious SQL Queries to Access/Modify/Delete Data:** Attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields or API parameters, which is then executed by the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.

*   **HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Insecure API Design or Implementation**
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Parameter Tampering:** Attackers manipulate API parameters (e.g., user IDs, skill IDs) in requests to perform actions they are not authorized to do, such as accessing or modifying other users' data.
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Attackers guess or enumerate predictable object identifiers (e.g., database IDs) in API requests to access resources belonging to other users without proper authorization.
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Lack of Input Validation:** Attackers send unexpected or malicious input to API endpoints, which, due to insufficient validation, can cause errors, application crashes, or even lead to exploitable vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or injection attacks.

*   **HIGH RISK PATH: Manipulate Skills Data to Compromise Application Logic**
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Skills Data:** Attackers insert crafted skills data containing malicious payloads, such as JavaScript code for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or code intended for server-side execution, which can then be executed when the application processes or displays this data.

*   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Insecure Communication Between Application and skills-service**
    *   **HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Steal Authentication Tokens/Credentials:** Attackers intercept communication between the application and `skills-service` to steal authentication tokens or credentials, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Modify API Requests/Responses:** Attackers intercept and alter API requests sent by the application or responses from the `skills-service` to manipulate data or application behavior.
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Data:** Attackers inject malicious data into the communication stream between the application and `skills-service`, potentially leading to code execution or other forms of compromise.
