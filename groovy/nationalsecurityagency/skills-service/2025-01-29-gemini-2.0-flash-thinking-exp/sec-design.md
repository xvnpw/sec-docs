    - Requirement: Implement input validation on both client-side and server-side.
    - Requirement: Sanitize and encode user inputs before displaying them in the application.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage cryptographic keys.
    - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement: Consider encrypting sensitive data fields in the database.
