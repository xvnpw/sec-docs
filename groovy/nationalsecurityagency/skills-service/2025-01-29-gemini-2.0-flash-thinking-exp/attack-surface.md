# Attack Surface Analysis for nationalsecurityagency/skills-service

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:**  API endpoints within `skills-service` that lack proper input validation are susceptible to injection attacks and unexpected behavior, compromising data integrity and system security.
*   **skills-service Contribution:** `skills-service`'s API endpoints for managing skills, users, and requests are designed to process user-provided data. Insufficient validation in these endpoints directly creates input validation vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A malicious actor injects a crafted payload into the `description` field when creating a new skill via the `/skills` API. If `skills-service` fails to sanitize this input, it could lead to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when other users view the skill description, or potentially SQL Injection if the description is used in database queries without proper parameterization.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, remote code execution (in severe cases), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), denial of service, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation for all API endpoints in `skills-service`. Validate data type, format, length, and allowed characters.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/ORM:** Utilize parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks for all database interactions within `skills-service` to prevent SQL Injection.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Encode output data properly before rendering it in any context (even if primarily an API, consider potential frontend consumption) to prevent XSS.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing specifically focusing on input validation flaws in `skills-service` APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Logic Flaws within skills-service](./attack_surfaces/authorization_logic_flaws_within_skills-service.md)

*   **Description:**  Deficiencies in `skills-service`'s authorization logic can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform actions beyond their intended privileges, leading to security breaches and data compromise.
*   **skills-service Contribution:** `skills-service` is responsible for enforcing access control based on user roles and permissions. Flaws in its implementation of authorization checks directly lead to authorization bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A standard user, by manipulating API requests to the `/admin/users` endpoint (intended for administrators only) or exploiting logic flaws in the user role verification within `skills-service`, is able to retrieve or modify administrative user accounts, gaining elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, complete account takeover, violation of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design and implement authorization logic in `skills-service` based on the principle of least privilege. Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Centralized Authorization:**  Enforce authorization checks consistently across all API endpoints and functionalities within `skills-service`.
        *   **Thorough Testing:**  Conduct rigorous testing of authorization logic, including negative testing and edge cases, to identify and fix bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Perform periodic security audits of the authorization implementation in `skills-service` to ensure its effectiveness and identify potential weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  `skills-service` relies on external libraries and frameworks. Using vulnerable versions of these dependencies introduces significant security risks that can be directly exploited to compromise the application and its underlying infrastructure.
*   **skills-service Contribution:** `skills-service`, like most modern applications, depends on numerous libraries (e.g., Spring Boot, database drivers, security libraries).  Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of `skills-service`.
*   **Example:**  A critical remote code execution vulnerability is discovered in an older version of the Spring Boot framework used by `skills-service`. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting `skills-service`, potentially gaining full control of the system and its data.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service, malware injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Implement a robust dependency management process for `skills-service`. Maintain a clear inventory of all dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning tools into the development pipeline to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Proactively update dependencies to the latest stable and patched versions. Prioritize security updates and apply them promptly.
        *   **Patch Management:** Establish a clear patch management process for addressing dependency vulnerabilities in `skills-service`.

## Attack Surface: [API Rate Limiting and Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity Potential)](./attack_surfaces/api_rate_limiting_and_denial_of_service__dos___high_severity_potential_.md)

*   **Description:**  While often considered medium, lack of rate limiting on resource-intensive API endpoints in `skills-service` can be exploited for high severity Denial of Service attacks, especially if critical business functions rely on the service.
*   **skills-service Contribution:** `skills-service` likely exposes API endpoints for searching, filtering, and processing skills and user data. If these operations are resource-intensive and lack rate limiting, they become targets for DoS attacks against `skills-service`.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the `/skills/search` API endpoint of `skills-service` with a large volume of complex search requests. Without rate limiting, this overwhelms the application server and database, causing performance degradation or complete service outage, impacting users who rely on `skills-service` for critical skill management functions.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, business disruption, reputational damage, potential financial loss if `skills-service` supports critical operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be Critical depending on business impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on all public and potentially resource-intensive API endpoints in `skills-service`.
        *   **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Consider using adaptive rate limiting techniques to dynamically adjust limits based on traffic patterns and system load.
        *   **Resource Optimization:** Optimize API performance and database queries within `skills-service` to handle legitimate load efficiently and reduce susceptibility to DoS.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting for API traffic anomalies and potential DoS attacks targeting `skills-service`.
