## Deep Analysis of RBAC Bypass Attack Path in skills-service Application

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "RBAC Bypass" attack path within the context of the `nationalsecurityagency/skills-service` application. This analysis aims to:

*   **Identify potential vulnerabilities:**  Pinpoint weaknesses in the application's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation that could allow attackers to bypass intended authorization mechanisms.
*   **Understand attack vectors:**  Detail the specific methods an attacker could employ to exploit these vulnerabilities, focusing on the "Role Manipulation in JWT" and "Insecure API Endpoint Authorization" paths.
*   **Assess risk and impact:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of a successful RBAC bypass, considering the criticality of the affected functionalities and data within the `skills-service` application.

### 2. Scope of Analysis

This deep analysis is specifically scoped to the following attack tree path:

**4. RBAC Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Role Manipulation in JWT [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> Modify JWT claims to elevate privileges (if signature not properly verified) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Focus:  Analyzing vulnerabilities related to JWT (JSON Web Token) handling, specifically signature verification and claim validation, that could lead to privilege escalation.

This analysis will **not** cover other potential attack paths within the broader attack tree for `skills-service` unless they directly relate to and inform the understanding of the RBAC bypass path.  We will assume a general understanding of RBAC principles and JWT usage in web applications.  Direct code review of the `skills-service` repository is outside the scope of this analysis, but we will consider common vulnerabilities and best practices relevant to the technologies likely used in such an application.

### 4. Deep Analysis of RBAC Bypass Attack Path

#### 4.1. Introduction to RBAC Bypass

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a fundamental security mechanism used to manage user access to resources and functionalities within an application. It operates on the principle of assigning roles to users and then granting permissions to those roles. RBAC bypass attacks aim to circumvent these controls, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions they are not intended to have.

A successful RBAC bypass can have severe consequences, potentially leading to:

*   **Data breaches:** Access to sensitive data intended only for authorized roles.
*   **Privilege escalation:**  Gaining administrative or higher-level privileges, allowing for complete control over the application.
*   **System compromise:**  Manipulation of critical system configurations or functionalities.
*   **Reputational damage:**  Loss of user trust and damage to the organization's reputation.

Therefore, securing RBAC implementation is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the `skills-service` application.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector 1: Role Manipulation in JWT [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> Modify JWT claims to elevate privileges (if signature not properly verified) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

##### 4.2.1. Detailed Explanation

This attack vector targets applications that use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication and authorization, where user roles or permissions are encoded within the JWT claims.  The vulnerability lies in the potential for attackers to manipulate these claims if the JWT signature verification is weak or completely bypassed.

**How JWTs are typically used in RBAC:**

1.  Upon successful user authentication, the `skills-service` application (or an authentication service) generates a JWT.
2.  This JWT contains claims, including information about the user's identity and assigned roles (e.g., `"roles": ["user"]` or `"roles": ["admin", "user"]`).
3.  The JWT is digitally signed by the server using a secret key or a private key (in the case of asymmetric algorithms like RSA). This signature ensures the integrity and authenticity of the JWT.
4.  The JWT is then sent to the client (e.g., browser or application) and stored (e.g., in local storage or cookies).
5.  For subsequent requests to protected API endpoints, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`).
6.  The `skills-service` backend receives the JWT, **verifies the signature** to ensure it hasn't been tampered with, and then extracts the claims, including the roles, to determine the user's authorization level.

**Vulnerability:** **Weak or Bypassed JWT Signature Verification**

If the `skills-service` application:

*   **Does not properly verify the JWT signature:**  This is a critical flaw. If signature verification is skipped or implemented incorrectly, the backend will trust any JWT, even if it's been modified by an attacker.
*   **Uses a weak or easily guessable signing key:**  If the secret key used to sign JWTs is weak (e.g., a default key, easily brute-forced, or exposed), an attacker could potentially forge valid JWTs.
*   **Implements "alg: none" vulnerability:**  In some JWT libraries, setting the `alg` (algorithm) header to "none" can bypass signature verification altogether. This is a known vulnerability if not handled correctly.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Obtain a valid JWT:** An attacker first needs to obtain a legitimate JWT, typically by creating a regular user account and logging in to the `skills-service` application.
2.  **Decode the JWT:** JWTs are base64 encoded. The attacker decodes the JWT to inspect its header and payload, which contains the claims, including roles.
3.  **Modify the "roles" claim:** The attacker modifies the "roles" claim in the JWT payload to elevate their privileges. For example, changing `"roles": ["user"]` to `"roles": ["admin"]`.
4.  **Remove or tamper with the signature (if verification is weak):**
    *   **If signature verification is bypassed:** The attacker might not need to worry about the signature at all.
    *   **If "alg: none" vulnerability exists:** The attacker might change the `alg` header to "none" and remove the signature part of the JWT.
    *   **If weak key is used:** The attacker might attempt to forge a new signature using the weak key (though this is more complex).
5.  **Re-encode the modified JWT:** The attacker re-encodes the modified header and payload (and potentially a manipulated signature or no signature) back into a JWT format.
6.  **Send the modified JWT:** The attacker uses this modified JWT in subsequent requests to the `skills-service` API, hoping to access privileged endpoints or functionalities.
7.  **Successful RBAC Bypass:** If the backend does not properly verify the signature, it will accept the modified JWT and grant the attacker elevated privileges based on the manipulated "roles" claim.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** High, especially if developers are unaware of JWT security best practices or use vulnerable libraries/configurations.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full RBAC bypass, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise, and privilege escalation.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong JWT Signature Verification:**
    *   **Mandatory Signature Verification:** Ensure that JWT signature verification is always enabled and correctly implemented on the backend for all protected endpoints.
    *   **Robust JWT Library:** Use a well-vetted and actively maintained JWT library that handles signature verification securely.
    *   **Algorithm Enforcement:** Explicitly specify and enforce a strong and secure signing algorithm (e.g., RS256, ES256) and avoid using weak algorithms or allowing "alg: none".
*   **Secure Key Management:**
    *   **Strong Secret Key:** Use a strong, randomly generated secret key for HMAC algorithms (like HS256) or a secure private key for asymmetric algorithms (like RS256).
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement a key rotation strategy to periodically change the signing key.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Store the signing key securely, avoiding hardcoding it in the application code or storing it in easily accessible locations. Use environment variables, secure vaults, or dedicated key management systems.
*   **JWT Validation Best Practices:**
    *   **Expiration Claim (exp):**  Always use and validate the `exp` (expiration time) claim to limit the lifespan of JWTs and reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.
    *   **Issuer Claim (iss) and Audience Claim (aud):**  Consider using `iss` and `aud` claims to further restrict the JWT's validity to specific issuers and audiences, preventing token reuse in unintended contexts.
    *   **Claim Validation:**  Beyond signature verification, validate other critical claims in the JWT payload, such as `iss`, `aud`, and `exp`, to ensure the JWT is valid and intended for the current application.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential JWT-related vulnerabilities.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector 2: Insecure API Endpoint Authorization [HIGH-RISK PATH] -> Access admin/privileged endpoints without proper roles (due to flawed authorization logic) [HIGH-RISK PATH]

##### 4.3.1. Detailed Explanation

This attack vector exploits vulnerabilities in the API endpoint authorization logic within the `skills-service` application. It focuses on scenarios where privileged API endpoints, intended for administrators or users with specific roles, are not adequately protected by RBAC, allowing unauthorized access.

**Typical API Endpoint Authorization in RBAC:**

1.  When a request is made to a protected API endpoint, the `skills-service` backend needs to determine if the user making the request has the necessary roles or permissions to access that endpoint.
2.  This authorization check typically happens after successful authentication (e.g., JWT verification).
3.  The backend retrieves the user's roles (e.g., from the JWT claims or a user session).
4.  Authorization logic is implemented to check if the user's roles match the required roles for accessing the specific API endpoint.
5.  If the user has the necessary roles, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied (typically with a 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized response).

**Vulnerability: Flawed Authorization Logic or Missing Authorization Checks**

Insecure API endpoint authorization can arise from several common flaws:

*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** Developers might forget to implement authorization checks for certain API endpoints, especially newly added or less frequently used ones. This leaves these endpoints completely unprotected.
*   **Incorrect Authorization Logic:** The authorization logic itself might be flawed. For example:
    *   **Using incorrect role names:**  Checking for the wrong role name in the user's roles list.
    *   **Logical errors in conditional statements:**  Using incorrect `OR` instead of `AND` conditions, or vice versa, leading to unintended access grants.
    *   **Bypassable authorization middleware:**  Authorization middleware might be incorrectly configured or bypassed due to routing errors or misconfigurations.
*   **Overly Permissive Default Authorization:**  Default authorization rules might be too permissive, granting access to more users than intended.
*   **Role Confusion or Mismanagement:**  Roles might be poorly defined, inconsistently applied, or mismanaged, leading to unintended access grants.
*   **"Security by Obscurity" Fallacy:**  Relying on the assumption that attackers won't find privileged endpoints because they are not publicly documented or easily discoverable. Attackers can use techniques like API endpoint enumeration and fuzzing to discover hidden endpoints.

**Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Endpoint Discovery:** The attacker attempts to discover privileged API endpoints. This can be done through:
    *   **Documentation Review:** Examining API documentation (if available) for hints of admin or privileged endpoints.
    *   **Code Analysis (if possible):**  Analyzing client-side code (e.g., JavaScript) or decompiled application code to identify API endpoint URLs.
    *   **API Fuzzing and Enumeration:**  Using automated tools to probe for API endpoints by trying common patterns, wordlists, and brute-forcing URL paths.
2.  **Attempt Access to Privileged Endpoints:** Once potential privileged endpoints are identified (e.g., `/admin/users`, `/api/settings`, `/api/admin/`), the attacker attempts to access them using a regular user account (or even without authentication if authentication is also flawed, though this analysis focuses on RBAC bypass).
3.  **Bypass Authorization Check (if vulnerable):** If the authorization logic is flawed or missing for the targeted endpoint, the attacker will successfully access the endpoint despite not having the required roles.
4.  **Exploit Privileged Functionality:**  Upon gaining unauthorized access, the attacker can exploit the privileged functionality exposed by the endpoint. This could include:
    *   **Data manipulation:** Modifying sensitive data, configurations, or user accounts.
    *   **Privilege escalation:**  Creating new admin accounts or granting themselves admin roles through the API.
    *   **System disruption:**  Performing actions that disrupt the application's functionality or availability.

**Risk Assessment:**

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High, depending on the development team's security awareness and testing practices. Missing authorization checks are a common vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical.  Unauthorized access to privileged functionalities can lead to significant data breaches, system compromise, and privilege escalation.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Robust Authorization Middleware/Framework:**
    *   **Centralized Authorization Logic:** Implement a centralized authorization middleware or framework that enforces RBAC consistently across all API endpoints.
    *   **Declarative Authorization:**  Use declarative authorization mechanisms (e.g., annotations, configuration files) to define required roles for each endpoint, making it easier to manage and audit authorization rules.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Design authorization rules based on the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum necessary permissions to each role.
*   **Thorough Authorization Checks for All Endpoints:**
    *   **Mandatory Authorization Enforcement:** Ensure that authorization checks are explicitly implemented and enforced for **every** API endpoint, especially those handling sensitive data or privileged operations.
    *   **Code Reviews and Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security audits to verify that authorization checks are correctly implemented and consistently applied across the application.
    *   **Automated Security Testing:**  Incorporate automated security testing tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis) into the development pipeline to detect missing or flawed authorization checks.
*   **Role and Permission Management:**
    *   **Clear Role Definitions:**  Clearly define roles and their associated permissions.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control Design:**  Carefully design the RBAC model to align with the application's functionalities and security requirements.
    *   **Regular Role Review and Updates:**  Periodically review and update roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with evolving business needs and security threats.
*   **API Endpoint Security Best Practices:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation for all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities that could indirectly bypass authorization.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**  Implement rate limiting and throttling to mitigate brute-force attacks aimed at discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in API endpoints.
    *   **API Gateway:**  Consider using an API gateway to centralize security controls, including authentication and authorization, and to provide an additional layer of defense for API endpoints.
