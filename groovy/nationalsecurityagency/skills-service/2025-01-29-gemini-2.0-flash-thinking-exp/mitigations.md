# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nationalsecurityagency/skills-service

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Skills Data *Interacting with skills-service*](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_skills_data_interacting_with_skills-service.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Define Validation Rules for skills-service API:**  Establish clear rules for all skill-related input fields that will be sent to the `skills-service` API (e.g., skill name, description, categories). These rules should align with the expected data format and constraints of the `skills-service` API.
    2.  **Implement Client-Side and Server-Side Validation Before API Calls:** Perform input validation on both the client-side (for user feedback) and, crucially, on the server-side *before* making requests to the `skills-service` API. This ensures data sent to the service is valid and prevents unexpected behavior or errors.
    3.  **Sanitize Input Before Sending to skills-service:** Sanitize input data to neutralize potentially harmful characters or code *before* sending it to the `skills-service` API. This helps prevent injection attacks that might be triggered within the `skills-service` if it has vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Handle Validation Errors from skills-service API:** Implement error handling to gracefully manage validation errors returned by the `skills-service` API. Provide informative feedback to the user and log these errors for debugging and monitoring.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Injection Attacks Exploiting skills-service (e.g., if skills-service has vulnerabilities related to input handling) - Severity: High (depending on skills-service vulnerabilities)
        *   Data Integrity Issues within skills-service - Severity: Medium
        *   Unexpected Behavior in skills-service due to malformed input - Severity: Medium
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) against skills-service through malformed input - Severity: Medium
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Injection Attacks Exploiting skills-service: High (Significantly reduces risk, depending on skills-service vulnerabilities)
        *   Data Integrity Issues within skills-service: Medium (Reduces risk)
        *   Unexpected Behavior in skills-service: Medium (Reduces risk)
        *   DoS against skills-service: Medium (Reduces risk)
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic client-side input length validation using JavaScript on skill name field in the user interface before sending data that *will eventually* be used with `skills-service`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Server-side validation *specifically before calling the skills-service API* is completely missing. No input sanitization is performed before sending data to `skills-service`. Validation rules are not comprehensively defined for all skill-related fields used with `skills-service` API. Error handling for validation errors *returned by the skills-service API* is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Authentication and Authorization for skills-service Integration](./mitigation_strategies/api_authentication_and_authorization_for_skills-service_integration.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Utilize skills-service Authentication Mechanisms:**  Understand and correctly implement the authentication mechanisms supported by the `skills-service` API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0 if supported).
    2.  **Secure API Credential Management for skills-service:** Securely manage API keys or tokens required to authenticate with the `skills-service` API. Avoid hardcoding credentials and use secure storage mechanisms like environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration.
    3.  **Implement Application-Level Authorization for skills-service Actions:**  Implement authorization checks within your application to control which users or roles are permitted to perform specific actions *via the skills-service API* (e.g., create skills, update skills, delete skills). This adds a layer of access control beyond the authentication provided by `skills-service` itself.
    4.  **Regularly Review and Rotate skills-service API Credentials:**  Establish a process for periodically reviewing and rotating API keys or other credentials used to access the `skills-service` API. This limits the window of opportunity if credentials are compromised.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to skills-service API - Severity: High
        *   Data Breaches via skills-service API - Severity: High
        *   Data Manipulation in skills-service by Unauthorized Users - Severity: High
        *   API Abuse of skills-service - Severity: Medium
