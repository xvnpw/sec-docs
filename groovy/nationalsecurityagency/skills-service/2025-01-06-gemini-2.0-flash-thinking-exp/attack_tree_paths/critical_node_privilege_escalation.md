## Deep Analysis of Privilege Escalation Attack Path in skills-service

This analysis delves into the "Privilege Escalation" attack path within the context of the `skills-service` application (https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency/skills-service). We will explore potential attack vectors, their impact, and mitigation strategies, providing actionable insights for the development team.

**Understanding the Target: `skills-service`**

The `skills-service` application, based on its GitHub repository, appears to be a system for managing and tracking employee skills and training. This likely involves various user roles with different levels of access and permissions. Understanding the application's architecture, user roles, and authorization mechanisms is crucial for analyzing privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

**Attack Tree Path: Privilege Escalation - Deep Dive**

**Goal:** To gain higher privileges within the `skills-service` application than initially granted.

**Impact:** As stated, successful privilege escalation allows attackers to bypass intended authorization controls. This can lead to:

* **Data Manipulation:** Modifying sensitive user data, skill records, training information, or even system configurations.
* **Data Deletion:** Removing critical data, potentially disrupting operations or causing data loss.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Accessing information or functionalities intended for higher-level users or administrators.
* **Lateral Movement:** Using the elevated privileges as a stepping stone to compromise other parts of the system or connected infrastructure.
* **Account Takeover:** Gaining full control over privileged accounts, leading to complete system compromise.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Potentially disrupting the service by manipulating critical resources or configurations.

**Potential Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

To achieve privilege escalation in `skills-service`, attackers could exploit various vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors, categorized for clarity:

**1. Authentication and Authorization Flaws:**

* **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**
    * **Scenario:** An attacker with low-level privileges can manipulate user IDs or resource identifiers in API requests to access or modify resources belonging to users with higher privileges (e.g., updating the skill profile of an administrator).
    * **Example:** An API endpoint like `/api/users/{userId}/skills` might not properly validate if the authenticated user has the authority to modify the skills of the target `userId`.
* **Broken Access Control:**
    * **Scenario:** The application fails to enforce proper authorization checks at various levels (e.g., API endpoints, business logic). An attacker might be able to access administrative functionalities by directly calling their corresponding URLs or API endpoints, even without proper authentication for that role.
    * **Example:** An administrative panel might be accessible via `/admin` without sufficient authentication checks, allowing a regular user to gain access.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Bypass:**
    * **Scenario:**  Flaws in the implementation of the RBAC system could allow attackers to manipulate their assigned roles or permissions.
    * **Example:**  If user roles are stored in cookies or local storage and not properly validated server-side, an attacker could modify these values to assume a higher-level role.
* **Missing or Weak Authentication:**
    * **Scenario:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process itself.
    * **Example:** Default credentials for administrative accounts, easily guessable passwords, or lack of multi-factor authentication could allow attackers to gain initial access with elevated privileges.
* **Session Hijacking/Fixation:**
    * **Scenario:** Stealing or manipulating the session of a privileged user.
    * **Example:**  Using cross-site scripting (XSS) to steal the session cookie of an administrator and then using that cookie to impersonate them.

**2. Input Validation and Injection Vulnerabilities:**

* **SQL Injection:**
    * **Scenario:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize user inputs used in database queries, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database and potentially grant themselves administrative privileges.
    * **Example:**  Exploiting a vulnerable search functionality to inject SQL commands that update the user's role in the database.
* **Command Injection:**
    * **Scenario:** If the application executes system commands based on user input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.
    * **Example:**  Exploiting a feature that allows administrators to run scripts by injecting commands that create new administrative users.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Scenario:** Injecting malicious scripts into the application that are executed in the browsers of other users, potentially including administrators. This can be used to steal credentials or manipulate the application on behalf of the victim.
    * **Example:**  Injecting a script that, when viewed by an administrator, sends their session cookie to the attacker.

**3. Vulnerabilities in Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries:**

* **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Scenario:** The `skills-service` might rely on third-party libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain elevated privileges.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable version of a web framework might have a known privilege escalation exploit.

**4. Misconfigurations:**

* **Default Configurations:**
    * **Scenario:**  Using default configurations for security settings that are not secure (e.g., default passwords, overly permissive file permissions).
* **Overly Permissive Roles or Permissions:**
    * **Scenario:**  Roles or permissions might be configured in a way that grants more access than necessary, allowing users to perform actions they shouldn't.
* **Failure to Secure API Endpoints:**
    * **Scenario:**  API endpoints intended for internal use or administrative tasks might be exposed without proper authentication or authorization.

**5. Logical Flaws in Business Logic:**

* **Race Conditions:**
    * **Scenario:** Exploiting timing vulnerabilities in the application's logic to manipulate state and gain unauthorized privileges.
* **Data Manipulation through Unexpected Flows:**
    * **Scenario:**  Finding unconventional ways to interact with the application that bypass intended authorization checks and lead to privilege escalation.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

Let's consider a scenario involving **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**:

1. **Low-Privilege User:** An attacker has a regular user account on `skills-service`.
2. **Identify Potential Vulnerability:** They observe API requests related to user profile updates. They notice a pattern like `/api/users/{userId}/profile`.
3. **Attempt IDOR:** The attacker intercepts a legitimate request to update their own profile and changes the `userId` in the request to the ID of an administrator.
4. **Missing Authorization Check:** The server-side code fails to verify if the authenticated user has the authority to modify the profile of the specified `userId`.
5. **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker successfully modifies the administrator's profile, potentially changing their password or adding themselves to administrative roles, thus achieving privilege escalation.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent privilege escalation, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Implement Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies, consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    * **Secure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a well-defined RBAC system and rigorously enforce it.
    * **Regularly Review and Audit Permissions:** Ensure that permissions are appropriate and haven't become overly permissive over time.
* **Secure API Design and Implementation:**
    * **Proper Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs on the server-side to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Authorization Checks at Every Level:** Implement authorization checks for every API endpoint and business logic function.
    * **Avoid Insecure Direct Object References:** Implement robust authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they are authorized for. Use indirect references or access control lists (ACLs).
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Follow Secure Coding Guidelines:** Adhere to established secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities.
    * **Regular Security Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential security flaws.
    * **Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):** Utilize automated tools to identify vulnerabilities in the codebase and during runtime.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update all third-party libraries and frameworks to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Configuration Management:**
    * **Avoid Default Credentials:** Change all default passwords and configurations.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege for System Access:** Limit access to the underlying operating system and infrastructure.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify misconfigurations and potential vulnerabilities.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Comprehensive Logging:** Log all significant security events, including authentication attempts, authorization failures, and access to sensitive resources.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Implement a SIEM system to collect, analyze, and correlate security logs to detect suspicious activity.
    * **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and prevent malicious activity.
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * **Educate Developers:** Train developers on common web application vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
    * **Educate Users:**  Train users on security best practices, such as using strong passwords and recognizing phishing attempts.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

Identifying privilege escalation attempts requires careful monitoring and analysis:

* **Monitor for Unusual Account Activity:** Look for logins from unusual locations, failed login attempts followed by successful logins, or changes to user roles and permissions.
* **Analyze Audit Logs:** Review audit logs for suspicious API calls, unauthorized access attempts, or modifications to sensitive data.
* **Alert on Authorization Failures:** Configure alerts for repeated authorization failures, which could indicate an attacker probing for vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor System Logs:** Look for unusual processes running with elevated privileges or attempts to access sensitive files.
* **Implement Honeypots:** Deploy honeypots to attract attackers and detect unauthorized access attempts.

**Conclusion:**

The "Privilege Escalation" attack path represents a significant threat to the `skills-service` application. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing robust security measures, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful exploitation. This analysis provides a starting point for a deeper security assessment and highlights the importance of a layered security approach encompassing secure coding practices, robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and continuous monitoring.
