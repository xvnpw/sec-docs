# Attack Surface Analysis for nationalsecurityagency/skills-service

## Attack Surface: [I. Input Validation Vulnerabilities on Skill Data](./attack_surfaces/i__input_validation_vulnerabilities_on_skill_data.md)

**Description:** The service might not adequately validate data provided when creating or updating skills (e.g., skill name, description).

**How Skills-Service Contributes:** Endpoints designed to receive skill data are potential entry points for malicious input. If the service doesn't enforce restrictions on data types, length, or allowed characters, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker could submit a skill name containing a very long string, potentially causing buffer overflows or denial-of-service. Alternatively, they could inject special characters that could be misinterpreted by downstream systems or cause unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Data corruption, denial-of-service, potential for stored cross-site scripting (if skill data is displayed elsewhere without sanitization), or exploitation of backend systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation: Define and enforce rules for all input fields (data type, length, allowed characters, format).
*   Use allow-lists instead of deny-lists: Specify what is allowed rather than trying to block all malicious input.
*   Sanitize input: Remove or escape potentially harmful characters before processing or storing the data.
*   Regularly review and update validation rules: Ensure they are comprehensive and adapt to new potential attack vectors.

## Attack Surface: [II. API Endpoint Security (Lack of Authentication/Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/ii__api_endpoint_security__lack_of_authenticationauthorization_.md)

**Description:** API endpoints for managing skills might lack proper authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**How Skills-Service Contributes:** If endpoints for creating, reading, updating, or deleting skills are accessible without verifying the identity or permissions of the requester, unauthorized actions can be performed.

**Example:** An attacker could directly call the API endpoint to create a new skill with malicious content or delete existing legitimate skills without being logged in or having the necessary privileges.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification or deletion, information disclosure, potential for abuse of the service's functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication: Verify the identity of the user or application making the request (e.g., using API keys, OAuth 2.0).
*   Implement fine-grained authorization: Control access to specific endpoints and actions based on user roles or permissions.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege: Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications.
*   Secure API keys and tokens: Protect credentials from unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [III. Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/iii__mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The service might directly map request parameters to internal data objects without proper filtering, allowing attackers to modify unintended fields.

**How Skills-Service Contributes:** If the API for creating or updating skills directly binds request data to the Skill object without explicitly defining which fields are allowed to be modified, attackers can inject additional parameters.

**Example:** An attacker might send a request to update a skill, including an unexpected parameter like `isAdmin=true`, potentially granting themselves administrative privileges if this field exists and is not properly protected.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, unauthorized modification of sensitive attributes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Define specific DTOs for API requests to explicitly specify which fields are allowed to be updated.
*   Avoid direct binding of request parameters to entity objects: Manually map the allowed fields from the request to the entity.
*   Use allow-lists for request parameters: Only process parameters that are explicitly expected.

## Attack Surface: [IV. Insecure Deserialization (If Applicable)](./attack_surfaces/iv__insecure_deserialization__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If the service deserializes untrusted data (e.g., from API requests or external sources) without proper safeguards, it can lead to remote code execution.

**How Skills-Service Contributes:** If the service accepts serialized objects as input for skill data or related operations, and these objects are not properly validated before deserialization, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the service, executes arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing untrusted data if possible: Prefer safer data formats like JSON.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use safe deserialization methods: Implement robust input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
*   Use serialization libraries with known security best practices: Keep these libraries up-to-date.
*   Implement security measures like sandboxing: Limit the impact of potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
