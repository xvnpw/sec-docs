## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Skills-Service](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_skills-service.md)

This entire branch is considered high-risk as it encompasses direct attacks against the `skills-service`, potentially leading to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [***CRITICAL NODE*** Code Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_code_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

Successful exploitation of code injection flaws (SQL Injection, Command Injection, OS Command Injection via Dependencies) provides a direct path to compromising the `skills-service`, potentially leading to data breaches or complete system takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_sql_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL queries through skill data fields (e.g., name, description) that are not properly sanitized before being used in database queries.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to the `skills-service` database, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. Could potentially be used to gain access to other parts of the system if database credentials are not properly isolated.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_command_injection.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious operating system commands into skill data fields that are used in calls to system functions.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution on the `skills-service` server, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** OS Command Injection via Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_os_command_injection_via_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known command injection vulnerabilities present in third-party libraries or frameworks used by the `skills-service`.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to direct command injection, leading to remote code execution on the `skills-service` server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication and Authorization Issues](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_and_authorization_issues.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in the authentication mechanism (e.g., weak password policies, default credentials, vulnerabilities in authentication logic) to gain unauthorized access to the `skills-service`.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Ability to perform actions as any user, including accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive skill data.

## Attack Tree Path: [***CRITICAL NODE*** Privilege Escalation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_privilege_escalation.md)

Gaining higher privileges within the `skills-service` allows attackers to bypass authorization controls and perform actions they are not intended to, potentially leading to data manipulation, deletion, or further system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Insecure Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_insecure_data_handling.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Insufficient Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_insufficient_input_validation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Providing malicious input data (e.g., crafted strings, scripts) in skill-related fields that are not properly validated or sanitized.
    *   **Potential Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts that are executed in the context of users of the integrating application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
        *   **Buffer Overflows/Memory Corruption:** Causing crashes or potentially achieving code execution on the `skills-service` server by providing overly large or specially crafted input.
        *   **Bypassing Security Checks:**  Crafting input to circumvent security filters and access restricted functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the `skills-service` deserializes data, injecting malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution on the `skills-service` server.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks used by the `skills-service`.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from denial of service to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploit Integration Points](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_integration_points.md)

This branch focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between the integrating application and the `skills-service`.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Communication](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_communication.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting communication between the integrating application and the `skills-service` (if not properly secured with HTTPS) to eavesdrop on sensitive data or manipulate requests and responses.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Exposure of API keys, sensitive skill data, or the ability to alter data being exchanged, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Exploiting Trust Relationships](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_trust_relationships.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The integrating application blindly trusts data received from the `skills-service` without proper validation or sanitization. Attackers inject malicious content through the `skills-service` that is then processed by the integrating application.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the integrating application, leading to client-side attacks against its users.
