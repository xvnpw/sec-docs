# Threat Model Analysis for nationalsecurityagency/skills-service

## Threat: [Malicious Skill Data Injection](./threats/malicious_skill_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the `skills-service` codebase or API to inject malicious or crafted skill data into the system. This could involve adding fake skills, modifying existing skill descriptions with harmful content (e.g., cross-site scripting payloads), or altering relationships between skills.

**Impact:** The injected malicious data could be displayed to users of applications consuming the `skills-service`, leading to cross-site scripting attacks, misinformation, or manipulation of application logic that relies on the skill data. It could also damage the integrity of the skill database within the `skills-service`.

**Affected Component:** Skill Data Storage Module within the `skills-service`, API endpoints for skill creation/modification provided by the `skills-service`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received by the `skills-service` API code.
* Enforce strict data type and format constraints for skill data within the `skills-service`.
* Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection if a relational database is used by the `skills-service`.
* Implement proper authorization and authentication mechanisms within the `skills-service` to restrict who can create or modify skill data.
* Regularly audit and monitor the skill data stored within the `skills-service` for anomalies or suspicious entries.

## Threat: [Skills Service API Abuse leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/skills_service_api_abuse_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could flood the `skills-service` API endpoints with a large number of requests, potentially overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. This could be done through automated scripts or botnets targeting the `skills-service` API.

**Impact:** Applications relying on the `skills-service` would experience degraded performance or complete outage, disrupting their functionality and potentially impacting users.

**Affected Component:** API Gateway/Load Balancer of the `skills-service`, API endpoints provided by the `skills-service`, underlying application server hosting the `skills-service`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on the `skills-service` API endpoints code to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
* Implement request throttling and queuing mechanisms within the `skills-service`.
* Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the `skills-service` to detect and block malicious traffic patterns.
* Implement robust resource monitoring and alerting for the `skills-service` to detect and respond to DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Skills Service Data Tampering](./threats/skills_service_data_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has gained unauthorized access by exploiting vulnerabilities within the `skills-service` could modify or delete existing skill data within the `skills-service`.

**Impact:** This could lead to inaccurate information being displayed by consuming applications, potentially causing incorrect decisions or workflow disruptions. It could also damage the integrity and reliability of the skill data within the `skills-service`.

**Affected Component:** Skill Data Storage Module within the `skills-service`, API endpoints for data modification/deletion provided by the `skills-service`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization controls within the `skills-service`.
* Implement audit logging of all data modification and deletion operations within the `skills-service`.
* Consider implementing data integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) within the `skills-service` to detect unauthorized modifications.
* Implement regular data backups and recovery procedures for the `skills-service` data.
