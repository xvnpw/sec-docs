**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Input Manipulation (High-Risk Path)**
    *   **Inject Malicious Dockerfile Commands (Critical Node):** Buildstep relies on the application providing a Dockerfile. An attacker could potentially influence the content of this Dockerfile. By injecting malicious commands, they can execute arbitrary code during the build process. This could involve downloading and running scripts, modifying application files, or installing backdoors.
        *   **Download and execute malicious scripts (e.g., using `RUN curl|wget -O- | bash`) (Critical Node):** The attacker injects commands into the Dockerfile that download and execute malicious scripts from an external source during the build process.
        *   **Modify application code or configuration during build (Critical Node):** The attacker injects commands into the Dockerfile that directly modify the application's source code or configuration files during the build process, introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors.
        *   **Install backdoors or persistence mechanisms in the built image (Critical Node):** The attacker injects commands into the Dockerfile to install backdoors or persistence mechanisms that will allow them to regain access to the application after it is deployed.
    *   **Supply Malicious Context Files:** The build context includes files that are copied into the Docker image. An attacker could introduce malicious files into this context.
        *   **Overwrite legitimate application files with malicious versions (Critical Node):** The attacker includes files in the build context that have the same names as legitimate application files, causing the malicious versions to overwrite the originals during the build process.
        *   **Introduce backdoors or malicious code into the final image (Critical Node):** The attacker includes files containing backdoors or other malicious code within the build context, which will then be included in the final Docker image.

*   **Exploit Buildstep Execution Environment (High-Risk Path)**
    *   **Compromise Build Environment Dependencies (Critical Node):** The build environment relies on various components like the Docker engine and base images. Vulnerabilities in these components could be exploited during the build process.
        *   **Docker Engine version used by Buildstep (Critical Node):** A known vulnerability in the Docker Engine used by Buildstep could allow for container escape, giving the attacker access to the Buildstep server's host system.
        *   **Base images used in the build process (Critical Node):** The base images used in the Dockerfile might contain known vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit during the build process or after the application is deployed.
    *   **Exploit Buildstep Server Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):** The Buildstep server itself is a piece of software that could have vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could give the attacker direct control over the Buildstep server.
        *   **Insecure API endpoints or authentication mechanisms (Critical Node):** Vulnerabilities in the Buildstep server's API endpoints or authentication mechanisms could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the server's functionality.
        *   **Command injection vulnerabilities in Buildstep's processing logic (Critical Node):** A command injection vulnerability in how Buildstep processes input could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Buildstep server.

*   **Compromise Buildstep Server Directly (High-Risk Path)**
    *   **Exploit Infrastructure Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):** If the infrastructure hosting the Buildstep server is vulnerable, an attacker could gain access to the server directly, bypassing the Buildstep application logic.
        *   **Weak access controls or misconfigurations (Critical Node):** Weak firewall rules, open ports, or other misconfigurations in the infrastructure hosting the Buildstep server could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Unpatched operating system or network services (Critical Node):** Known vulnerabilities in the operating system or network services running on the Buildstep server could be exploited to gain access.
    *   **Exploit Buildstep Credentials (Critical Node):** If the credentials used to access the Buildstep server are weak or compromised, an attacker could gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Weak or compromised passwords (Critical Node):** Using weak, default, or previously compromised passwords for Buildstep server accounts could allow an attacker to gain access through brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.
