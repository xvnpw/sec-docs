* **Dependency Manipulation and Injection**
    * **Description:** Attackers can introduce malicious or vulnerable code into the application by compromising dependencies used by the project.
    * **How Shadow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Shadow directly fetches and bundles all project dependencies (including transitive ones) into a single JAR. This process can inadvertently include compromised dependencies if they exist in configured repositories or if dependency confusion attacks are successful.
    * **Example:** An attacker publishes a malicious library with the same name as an internal dependency. During the Shadow task, this malicious library is downloaded and included in the final JAR, potentially overwriting the legitimate internal dependency.
    * **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the nature of the injected dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools (like dependencyCheck) to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies before building with Shadow.
        * **Repository Security:** Ensure the security and integrity of configured Maven repositories. Use trusted and verified repositories.
        * **Dependency Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies (e.g., using checksum verification).
        * **Dependency Locking:** Use dependency locking mechanisms (like Gradle's dependency locking) to ensure consistent dependency versions across builds and prevent unexpected changes.
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

* **Build Process Manipulation via Shadow Configuration**
    * **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the build process by altering the Shadow plugin's configuration or the build script itself.
    * **How Shadow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Shadow's behavior is heavily influenced by its configuration in the `build.gradle` file. If this file is compromised, an attacker can manipulate Shadow's tasks to include malicious files, exclude security measures, or alter the output JAR in harmful ways.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `build.gradle` file and modifies the Shadow configuration to include an additional, malicious JAR file during the merging process.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code, bypassing security checks, data exfiltration, or disruption of the application's functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Build Environment:** Protect the build environment (including the machine running the build and the source code repository) from unauthorized access.
        * **Build Script Security:** Treat the `build.gradle` file as critical infrastructure and apply appropriate access controls and version control.
        * **Input Validation:** If any external input influences the build process or Shadow configuration, ensure proper validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes involved in the build process.
