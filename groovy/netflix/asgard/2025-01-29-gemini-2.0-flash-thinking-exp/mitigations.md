# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Asgard IAM Role](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_asgard_iam_role.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Asgard Actions:**  Document all AWS services and actions Asgard needs to perform (e.g., EC2 instance management, Auto Scaling group operations, ELB configuration, S3 access for deployments).
    2.  **Create a Custom IAM Policy:**  Instead of using broad AWS managed policies, create a custom IAM policy specifically tailored to Asgard's identified actions.
    3.  **Grant Only Necessary Permissions:** Within the custom policy, grant only the *minimum* required permissions for each action. Use specific resource ARNs whenever possible instead of wildcards (`*`). For example, instead of `ec2:*`, use `ec2:DescribeInstances` and `ec2:RunInstances` with specific resource constraints.
    4.  **Attach Policy to Asgard Instance Role:**  Attach this custom IAM policy to the IAM role assigned to the EC2 instance(s) running Asgard.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Refine:** Periodically review the IAM policy and Asgard's actual usage. Remove any permissions that are no longer needed and further restrict permissions if possible.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to AWS Resources (High Severity):** If Asgard's instance is compromised, an attacker with the instance role could potentially access and control a wide range of AWS resources if the role is overly permissive.
    *   **Lateral Movement in AWS Environment (High Severity):**  A compromised Asgard instance with excessive permissions could be used as a stepping stone to attack other AWS resources and services within the environment.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):**  Overly permissive IAM roles could allow a compromised Asgard instance to access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in AWS services like S3 or databases.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to AWS Resources: Significantly Reduces
    *   Lateral Movement in AWS Environment: Significantly Reduces
    *   Data Breach: Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Asgard instance role is configured, but initial policy is based on a broader managed policy and needs refinement to least privilege.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed review and restriction of the current IAM policy to the absolute minimum required permissions. Implementation of a process for regular IAM policy reviews and updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Specific Resource Constraints in IAM Policies](./mitigation_strategies/use_specific_resource_constraints_in_iam_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Target Resources:** For each permission granted in the Asgard IAM policy, determine the specific AWS resources (e.g., specific EC2 instances, Auto Scaling groups, S3 buckets) that Asgard needs to manage.
    2.  **Replace Wildcards with ARNs:** In the IAM policy, replace wildcard resource specifications (`Resource: "*"`) with specific Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the identified target resources. For example, instead of `Resource: "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*"`, use `Resource: "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"` for a specific instance or `Resource: "arn:aws:autoscaling:us-west-2:123456789012:autoScalingGroup:*/autoScalingGroupName/my-asg"` for an Auto Scaling group.
    3.  **Apply to All Applicable Permissions:**  Apply resource constraints to all IAM policy statements where resource-level permissions are supported by the AWS service.
    4.  **Test Policy Changes:** Thoroughly test any changes to IAM policies in a non-production environment to ensure Asgard continues to function correctly with the restricted permissions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Modification of Unintended Resources (Medium Severity):** Without resource constraints, a compromised Asgard instance could potentially modify or delete AWS resources outside of its intended scope of management.
    *   **Accidental Damage to Critical Infrastructure (Medium Severity):**  Human error or misconfiguration within Asgard could lead to unintended actions on critical AWS resources if permissions are too broad.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Modification of Unintended Resources: Moderately Reduces
    *   Accidental Damage to Critical Infrastructure: Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some resource constraints are used for critical resources, but not consistently applied across all permissions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematic review and implementation of resource constraints for all applicable permissions in the Asgard IAM policy.  Standardization of resource naming conventions to facilitate ARN specification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement IAM Policy Conditions](./mitigation_strategies/implement_iam_policy_conditions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Contextual Restrictions:** Determine if there are contextual factors that can further restrict Asgard's actions, such as source IP ranges, time of day, or resource tags.
    2.  **Define IAM Policy Conditions:**  Add conditions to the Asgard IAM policy to enforce these restrictions. For example:
        *   `Condition: { IpAddress: { "aws:SourceIp": ["<internal_CIDR_range>"] } }` to restrict actions to originate from within your internal network.
        *   `Condition: { StringEquals: { "ec2:ResourceTag/Environment": "Production" } }` to limit actions to resources tagged with "Environment: Production".
    3.  **Apply Relevant Conditions:** Apply appropriate conditions to IAM policy statements based on the identified contextual restrictions and the specific actions being permitted.
    4.  **Test Condition Effectiveness:**  Thoroughly test the IAM policy conditions to ensure they are working as expected and do not inadvertently block legitimate Asgard operations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access from External Networks (Medium Severity):** Conditions like `aws:SourceIp` can prevent unauthorized access if Asgard is compromised but the attacker is outside the allowed IP range.
    *   **Accidental or Malicious Actions in Wrong Environments (Medium Severity):** Resource tag conditions can help prevent actions in unintended environments (e.g., accidentally deploying to production from a development Asgard instance).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access from External Networks: Moderately Reduces
    *   Accidental or Malicious Actions in Wrong Environments: Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. IAM policies currently lack conditional restrictions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Identify relevant contextual restrictions and implement corresponding IAM policy conditions. Focus initially on `aws:SourceIp` and resource tag conditions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secrets Management for AWS Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/secrets_management_for_aws_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Hardcoding AWS Credentials in Asgard Configuration:** Never hardcode AWS access keys and secret keys directly into Asgard's configuration files or codebase.
    2.  **Utilize Instance Roles for AWS Authentication:** Rely on the IAM role attached to the EC2 instance running Asgard for authentication with AWS services. This eliminates the need to manage long-term credentials within Asgard itself.
    3.  **If Credentials are Required in Configuration (Less Recommended):**
        *   **Encrypt Configuration Files:** If you must store credentials in configuration files, ensure these files are encrypted at rest using appropriate encryption mechanisms.
        *   **Securely Store Configuration Files:** Store configuration files in a secure location with restricted access, limiting who can read or modify them.
        *   **Implement Credential Rotation (If Applicable):** If you are managing credentials outside of instance roles, establish a process for regular rotation of these credentials.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Hardcoded Credentials (High Severity):**  Storing AWS credentials in configuration files or code is a major security vulnerability.
    *   **Credential Theft (High Severity):** If configuration files containing credentials are compromised, attackers can gain direct access to AWS resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Hardcoded Credentials: Significantly Reduces
    *   Credential Theft: Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented. Asgard is configured to use instance roles for AWS authentication. No explicit credentials are used in configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  None. This mitigation is fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Asgard Updated to the Latest Version](./mitigation_strategies/keep_asgard_updated_to_the_latest_version.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for checking for and applying Asgard updates (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
    2.  **Monitor Asgard Release Notes:** Subscribe to Asgard release announcements or monitor the project's GitHub repository for new releases and security patches.
    3.  **Test Updates in Non-Production:** Before applying updates to production Asgard instances, thoroughly test them in a staging or development environment to ensure compatibility and stability.
    4.  **Apply Updates Promptly:** Once updates are tested and validated, apply them to production Asgard instances as soon as possible, especially security-related updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated software is vulnerable to known security exploits. Keeping Asgard updated patches these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Some vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause denial of service. Updates often address these issues.
    *   **Data Breach (Medium Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in Asgard could potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data managed through Asgard.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduces
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Moderately Reduces
    *   Data Breach: Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Updates are applied, but not on a strict schedule and testing process is not fully formalized.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a formal update schedule and testing process for Asgard updates. Implement automated notifications for new Asgard releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Asgard Access](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_asgard_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable MFA in Authentication Provider:** Configure your authentication provider (e.g., Okta, Active Directory, Google Workspace, or Asgard's built-in authentication if used) to enforce MFA for all users accessing Asgard.
    2.  **Configure Asgard to Utilize MFA:** Ensure Asgard is configured to integrate with your authentication provider and enforce MFA during the login process.
    3.  **User Education:** Educate all Asgard users about the importance of MFA and guide them through the MFA setup process.
    4.  **Regular MFA Enforcement Audits:** Periodically audit user accounts to ensure MFA is enabled and enforced for all authorized users.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** MFA significantly reduces the risk of account takeover due to compromised passwords (e.g., phishing, password reuse, brute-force attacks).
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Asgard (High Severity):** MFA makes it much harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access to the Asgard web interface and its functionalities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Account Takeover: Significantly Reduces
    *   Unauthorized Access to Asgard: Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for administrators, but not yet enforced for all regular users.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce MFA for all Asgard users.  Develop user onboarding documentation that includes MFA setup instructions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Asgard](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__within_asgard.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define User Roles:** Identify different user roles within your organization that will interact with Asgard (e.g., administrators, developers, operators, read-only users).
    2.  **Map Roles to Asgard Permissions:**  For each user role, define the specific actions and resources they need to access within Asgard.  Utilize Asgard's RBAC features to map these permissions to roles.
    3.  **Assign Users to Roles:** Assign users to the appropriate roles based on their responsibilities.
    4.  **Regularly Review Role Assignments:** Periodically review user role assignments and adjust them as needed based on changes in user responsibilities or organizational structure.
    5.  **Audit RBAC Configuration:** Regularly audit the RBAC configuration within Asgard to ensure it is correctly implemented and aligned with the principle of least privilege.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Actions by Internal Users (Medium Severity):** RBAC prevents users from performing actions they are not authorized to perform, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious misconfigurations or disruptions.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):**  Properly configured RBAC limits the potential impact of privilege escalation vulnerabilities within Asgard, as users are restricted to their assigned roles.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Actions by Internal Users: Moderately Reduces
    *   Privilege Escalation: Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic roles are defined, but granular permissions within roles need further refinement. Role assignments are not regularly reviewed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Refine RBAC roles to be more granular and aligned with least privilege. Implement a process for regular review and update of user role assignments and RBAC configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Comprehensive Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_comprehensive_audit_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Asgard Audit Logging:** Enable all relevant audit logging features within Asgard. This should include logs for user logins, actions performed within the UI, API calls, and configuration changes.
    2.  **Centralized Log Collection:** Configure Asgard to send its audit logs to a centralized log management system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, AWS CloudWatch Logs).
    3.  **Log Retention Policy:** Define and implement a log retention policy to ensure audit logs are stored for an appropriate period for security investigations and compliance purposes.
    4.  **Log Integrity Protection:** Consider measures to protect the integrity of audit logs, such as log signing or secure storage mechanisms.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lack of Visibility into Security Incidents (High Severity):** Without audit logs, it is difficult to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents affecting Asgard.
    *   **Non-Compliance with Security Policies (Medium Severity):** Audit logs are often required for compliance with security policies and regulations.
    *   **Difficulty in Identifying Root Cause of Issues (Medium Severity):** Audit logs can be crucial for troubleshooting operational issues and identifying the root cause of problems.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Lack of Visibility into Security Incidents: Significantly Reduces
    *   Non-Compliance with Security Policies: Moderately Reduces
    *   Difficulty in Identifying Root Cause of Issues: Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic Asgard logs are enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs, but comprehensive audit logging configuration and log integrity measures are missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enable comprehensive audit logging within Asgard, including all relevant event types. Implement log integrity protection measures. Define and enforce a log retention policy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Scan Dependencies for Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_scan_dependencies_for_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Asgard Dependencies:** Create a list of all libraries and dependencies used by Asgard (including both frontend and backend dependencies).
    2.  **Implement Dependency Scanning Tooling:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into your development and deployment pipeline. These tools can automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependency Scanning).
    3.  **Automate Scanning Process:** Automate the dependency scanning process to run regularly (e.g., daily or with each code commit).
    4.  **Vulnerability Remediation Process:** Establish a process for reviewing and remediating identified vulnerabilities. Prioritize high-severity vulnerabilities and promptly update vulnerable dependencies to patched versions.
    5.  **Monitor Vulnerability Databases:** Stay informed about newly disclosed vulnerabilities in Asgard's dependencies by monitoring security advisories and vulnerability databases.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in Asgard's dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):** Compromised dependencies can introduce malicious code into Asgard.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduces
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Dependency scanning is not currently part of the development or deployment process for Asgard.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement dependency scanning tooling and integrate it into the CI/CD pipeline. Establish a vulnerability remediation process.
