# Threat Model Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Threat: [Weak Asgard User Authentication](./threats/weak_asgard_user_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to brute-force default credentials, exploit weak password policies, or bypass authentication mechanisms if MFA is not enabled. This could be done through automated scripts or manual attempts to guess usernames and passwords.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Asgard, allowing attackers to deploy malicious applications, modify infrastructure configurations, or exfiltrate sensitive information about the AWS environment and applications.
*   **Affected Asgard Component:** User Authentication Module, Login Functionality
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies requiring complex passwords and regular password changes.
    *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Asgard user accounts.
    *   Disable or change default credentials if any exist.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking in Asgard](./threats/session_hijacking_in_asgard.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept network traffic to steal Asgard session cookies if HTTPS is not enforced or if session management is weak. This could be done through man-in-the-middle attacks on insecure networks or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the client's browser or network.
*   **Impact:** Session takeover, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and perform actions on their behalf, including deploying malicious code, changing configurations, or accessing sensitive information.
*   **Affected Asgard Component:** Session Management Module, HTTP Communication
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication with Asgard using TLS certificates.
    *   Implement secure session management practices, including short session timeouts and secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
    *   Consider using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS on the client side.

## Threat: [Compromised AWS Credentials Used by Asgard](./threats/compromised_aws_credentials_used_by_asgard.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the server or container running Asgard could potentially extract stored AWS credentials if they are not securely managed. This could involve accessing configuration files, environment variables, or memory dumps.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the AWS account managed by Asgard, allowing attackers to perform any action within the AWS environment, including data breaches, service disruption, resource hijacking, and financial loss.
*   **Affected Asgard Component:** AWS API Interaction Module, Credential Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing long-term AWS credentials directly within Asgard's configuration or code.
    *   Utilize IAM roles for EC2 instances or containers running Asgard to provide temporary credentials.
    *   If access keys are necessary, store them securely using secrets management services and rotate them regularly.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the IAM permissions granted to Asgard's credentials.

## Threat: [Insecure Deployment Pipelines Managed by Asgard](./threats/insecure_deployment_pipelines_managed_by_asgard.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the deployment pipeline managed by Asgard, for example by gaining access to the source code repository, build server, or artifact storage. This could allow them to inject malicious code or configurations into application deployments.
*   **Impact:** Deployment of compromised applications, introduction of malware or vulnerabilities into the production environment, potential supply chain attacks affecting deployed applications and their users.
*   **Affected Asgard Component:** Deployment Pipeline Module, Build and Release Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the entire deployment pipeline, including source code repositories, build processes, and artifact storage with strong access controls and security scanning.
    *   Implement code review and security scanning in the deployment pipeline to detect and prevent malicious code injection.
    *   Use trusted and verified base images and dependencies for application deployments.
    *   Implement change management and approval processes for deployments managed by Asgard.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Asgard Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_asgard_code.md)

*   **Description:** Asgard itself might contain vulnerabilities in its code, such as code injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, or other common web application vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise Asgard.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Asgard could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service against Asgard, and potentially compromise of managed applications and their data.
*   **Affected Asgard Component:** Core Asgard Application Code, Web UI, API Endpoints
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the Asgard application to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow secure coding practices during any customization or extension of Asgard.
    *   Stay informed about any reported vulnerabilities in Asgard and apply necessary patches or mitigations if available from the open-source community. Due to Asgard's maintenance status, community-driven security efforts are crucial. Consider contributing to or leveraging community security initiatives.
