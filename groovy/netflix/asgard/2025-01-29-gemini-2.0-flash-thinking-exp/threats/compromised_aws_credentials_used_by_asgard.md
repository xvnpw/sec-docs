    *   The most effective mitigation is to avoid storing long-term AWS credentials within Asgard altogether.
    *   Leverage IAM roles associated with the EC2 instances or containers running Asgard. This provides temporary, automatically rotated credentials to the application, eliminating the need for static access keys.
    *   Configure Asgard to assume the IAM role of the instance/container it's running on to interact with AWS services.

*   **2. Implement Secrets Management Services (If Access Keys are Absolutely Necessary):**
    *   If IAM roles are not feasible in certain scenarios, utilize dedicated secrets management services like:
        *   **AWS Secrets Manager:** AWS-native service for securely storing and rotating secrets.
        *   **HashiCorp Vault:**  Open-source secrets management solution.
        *   **CyberArk, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager:** Other enterprise-grade secrets management options.
    *   Store access keys securely within the chosen secrets management service.
    *   Configure Asgard to retrieve credentials programmatically from the secrets management service at runtime, instead of storing them locally.

*   **3. Regular Credential Rotation (If Access Keys are Used):**
    *   Implement a policy for regular rotation of access keys stored in secrets management services.
    *   Automate the rotation process to minimize manual intervention and reduce the risk of human error.
    *   Shorten the lifespan of access keys to limit the window of opportunity for attackers if keys are compromised.

*   **4. Apply the Principle of Least Privilege (IAM Policies):**
    *   Grant the IAM role or access keys used by Asgard only the minimum necessary permissions required to perform its intended functions.
    *   Restrict access to specific AWS resources and actions based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly review and refine IAM policies to ensure they remain aligned with Asgard's actual needs and minimize potential blast radius in case of compromise.

*   **5. Secure Storage and Encryption (If Local Storage is Unavoidable - Discouraged):**
    *   If, against best practices, credentials must be stored locally (e.g., in configuration files), ensure they are:
        *   **Encrypted at Rest:** Use strong encryption algorithms to encrypt the files containing credentials.
        *   **Access Controlled:** Restrict file system permissions to only allow the Asgard process and authorized administrators to access these files.
