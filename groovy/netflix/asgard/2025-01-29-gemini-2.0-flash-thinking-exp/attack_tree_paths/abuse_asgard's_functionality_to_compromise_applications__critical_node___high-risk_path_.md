            *   **Impact:** High.  New applications deployed with weak security groups are immediately exposed to potential attacks.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium, if the deployment process doesn't enforce secure security group configurations.
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   **Default Secure Security Groups:** Define secure default security group configurations for new deployments.
                *   **Mandatory Security Group Review for New Deployments:**  Require a security review and approval of security group configurations for all new application deployments.
                *   **Automated Security Group Generation:** Automate the generation of security groups based on application requirements and security policies, minimizing manual configuration errors.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Modify Load Balancer Rules via Asgard [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Use Asgard to misconfigure load balancer rules, exposing internal services or bypassing security controls. [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate load balancer rules through Asgard to expose internal services that should not be publicly accessible, or to bypass existing security controls like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).
            *   **Impact:** High. Exposing internal services can lead to direct compromise of backend systems and data. Bypassing security controls negates intended security measures.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium, if load balancer management within Asgard is not strictly controlled and monitored.
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   **Load Balancer Configuration Templates:** Use predefined and secure load balancer configuration templates.
