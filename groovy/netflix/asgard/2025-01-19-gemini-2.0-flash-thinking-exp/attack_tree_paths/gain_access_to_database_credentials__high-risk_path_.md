### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Gain Access to Database Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]

This attack path represents a critical security risk as successful compromise of database credentials can lead to:

* **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
* **Data manipulation:** Modification or deletion of critical data.
* **Service disruption:**  Potential for attackers to disrupt the application's functionality.
* **Privilege escalation:**  Using database access to potentially gain further access to the system.

Let's analyze each attack vector in detail:

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Finding hardcoded credentials in Asgard's code or configuration files.

* **Description:** This involves an attacker gaining access to Asgard's codebase or configuration files and discovering database credentials directly embedded within them.
* **Potential Locations:**
    * **Source Code:**  Credentials might be accidentally hardcoded in Java files, especially during development or testing phases.
    * **Configuration Files:**  Credentials could be stored in plain text or weakly encrypted within configuration files like `application.properties`, `application.yml`, or custom configuration files.
    * **Environment Variables (Misuse):** While environment variables are a better practice than hardcoding, if not managed securely or if default values are used, they can still be a vulnerability.
    * **Deployment Scripts:** Credentials might be present in deployment scripts used for setting up the application.
* **Likelihood:**  The likelihood of this depends on the development team's security awareness and practices. Poor coding practices and lack of secure configuration management increase the likelihood. Using secrets management tools significantly reduces this risk.
* **Impact:**  High. Direct access to database credentials grants immediate and complete access to the database.
* **Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Eliminate Hardcoding:**  Strictly avoid hardcoding credentials in the codebase. Implement code review processes to catch such instances.
    * **Secure Configuration Management:** Utilize secure configuration management tools or techniques like:
        * **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like database credentials in environment variables, ensuring proper access control and secure storage of the environment where the application runs.
        * **Secrets Management Tools:** Integrate with dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and retrieve credentials.
        * **Externalized Configuration:**  Store configuration outside the application package, making it easier to manage and secure.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and configuration files to identify and remediate any hardcoded credentials.
    * **Version Control Security:** Ensure that version control systems are properly secured to prevent unauthorized access to historical versions of the code where credentials might have been present.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities to access the server's filesystem where credentials might be stored.

* **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Asgard application or the underlying server infrastructure to gain unauthorized access to the filesystem where configuration files or other files containing credentials might be located.
* **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Path Traversal:** Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Critical vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to filesystem access.
    * **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  Vulnerabilities allowing attackers to include local files, potentially including configuration files containing credentials.
    * **Insecure File Permissions:**  If configuration files containing credentials have overly permissive file permissions, attackers gaining access to the server (even with limited privileges initially) might be able to read them.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks used by Asgard could be exploited to gain filesystem access.
* **Likelihood:**  The likelihood depends on the security posture of the application and the underlying infrastructure. Regularly patching systems, implementing secure coding practices, and using robust access controls are crucial.
* **Impact:** High. Successful filesystem access can expose sensitive configuration files and potentially other sensitive data.
* **Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like path traversal, RCE, and LFI. This includes proper input validation, output encoding, and avoiding insecure functions.
    * **Regular Security Patching:**  Keep the Asgard application, its dependencies, and the underlying operating system and server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and processes. Restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
    * **Secure File Permissions:**  Ensure that configuration files containing sensitive information have restrictive file permissions, limiting access to only authorized users and processes.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block common web application attacks, including those that could lead to filesystem access.
    * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor for malicious activity and potentially block attempts to access sensitive files.
    * **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct regular vulnerability scans of the application and infrastructure to identify and remediate potential weaknesses.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Using techniques like SQL injection (if applicable) to extract credentials from the database.

* **Description:** If Asgard directly interacts with the database using SQL queries, attackers might exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities to execute malicious SQL code. This could be used to extract user credentials (if stored in the database) or potentially even database user credentials.
* **Potential Scenarios:**
    * **Direct SQL Queries:** If Asgard constructs SQL queries dynamically based on user input without proper sanitization or parameterization, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection.
    * **Stored Procedures (Vulnerable):** If stored procedures are used and are themselves vulnerable to SQL injection, attackers could exploit them.
* **Likelihood:** The likelihood depends on how Asgard interacts with the database. Modern frameworks often provide mechanisms to prevent SQL injection (e.g., parameterized queries/prepared statements). However, developer errors can still introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:** High. Successful SQL injection can lead to the extraction of sensitive data, including user credentials and potentially database credentials.
* **Mitigation Strategies:
    * **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database. This prevents user input from being directly interpreted as SQL code.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in SQL queries.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (Database):** Grant database users only the necessary privileges. Avoid using overly permissive database accounts for application connections.
    * **Database Activity Monitoring:** Implement database activity monitoring to detect suspicious SQL queries and potential injection attempts.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block SQL injection attempts.
    * **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing and security assessments to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Avoid Dynamic SQL Construction:** Minimize the use of dynamic SQL construction. If necessary, ensure it is done with extreme caution and proper escaping/parameterization.
