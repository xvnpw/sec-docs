The "OR" condition indicates that either of the listed attack vectors can independently lead to the compromise of an account.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Tricking users into revealing their credentials through phishing attacks.

**4.2.1. Description:**

Phishing attacks involve deceiving users into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords. In the context of Asgard, this could involve attackers creating fake login pages that mimic the legitimate Asgard interface or sending emails that appear to be from Asgard administrators or trusted sources. These emails might contain links to the fake login pages or request users to directly provide their credentials.

**4.2.2. Technical Analysis (Asgard Context):**

* **Targeting Asgard Login Page:** Attackers would likely create a replica of the Asgard login page. This requires understanding the visual design and potentially the underlying HTML/CSS structure of the actual login page.
* **Email Spoofing:** Attackers might attempt to spoof email addresses to make the phishing emails appear legitimate. This can be challenging but is often attempted.
* **Link Manipulation:**  Phishing emails would contain links that redirect users to the fake login page. These links might be disguised using URL shortening services or by embedding them within seemingly innocuous text.
* **Credential Harvesting:** Once a user enters their credentials on the fake page, the attacker captures this information.
* **Exploiting Asgard Functionality:** With compromised credentials, attackers can then log into the real Asgard application and perform actions based on the compromised user's permissions. This could include accessing sensitive infrastructure details, modifying configurations, or even triggering deployments.

**4.2.3. Impact Assessment:**

A successful phishing attack leading to account compromise can have severe consequences:

* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers gain access to Asgard's functionalities and data.
* **Data Breach:** Sensitive information about infrastructure, deployments, and potentially user data could be exposed.
* **System Manipulation:** Attackers could modify configurations, disrupt services, or even deploy malicious code.
* **Loss of Trust:**  A successful attack can damage the organization's reputation and erode trust in Asgard.
* **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the data accessed, the breach could lead to regulatory penalties.

**4.2.4. Threat Actor Profiling:**

This attack vector is commonly employed by a wide range of threat actors, including:

* **Cybercriminals:** Motivated by financial gain, they might sell access or use it for further malicious activities.
* **Nation-State Actors:**  Could target Asgard to gain intelligence or disrupt critical infrastructure.
* **Disgruntled Employees:**  May use compromised accounts for sabotage or data exfiltration.

**4.2.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enforce MFA for all Asgard users. This adds an extra layer of security even if credentials are compromised.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about phishing tactics and how to identify suspicious emails and websites.
* **Email Security Measures:** Implement robust email filtering and anti-phishing solutions to detect and block malicious emails.
* **Link Analysis and Sandboxing:**  Employ tools that analyze links in emails before users click on them and sandbox suspicious attachments.
* **Browser Security Extensions:** Encourage the use of browser extensions that help detect and block phishing attempts.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular audits of Asgard's security configurations and user access controls.
* **Phishing Simulations:**  Conduct simulated phishing attacks to assess user awareness and identify areas for improvement.
* **Monitoring for Suspicious Login Attempts:** Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual login patterns or attempts from unfamiliar locations.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches to attempt login (credential stuffing).

**4.3.1. Description:**

Credential stuffing attacks leverage the fact that many users reuse the same username and password combinations across multiple online services. Attackers obtain lists of compromised credentials from data breaches on other platforms and then systematically attempt to log into Asgard using these credentials.

**4.3.2. Technical Analysis (Asgard Context):**

* **Automated Login Attempts:** Attackers typically use automated tools and scripts to rapidly attempt logins with large lists of credentials.
* **Targeting Asgard Login Endpoint:** The primary target is the Asgard login endpoint.
* **Bypassing Basic Security Measures:** Attackers may employ techniques to bypass basic rate limiting or IP blocking measures.
* **Successful Login:** If a user has reused their credentials and those credentials are in the attacker's list, the login attempt will succeed.

**4.3.3. Impact Assessment:**

The impact of successful credential stuffing is similar to that of a successful phishing attack:

* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers gain access to Asgard's functionalities and data.
* **Data Breach:** Sensitive information could be exposed.
* **System Manipulation:** Attackers could modify configurations or disrupt services.
* **Account Lockouts (Side Effect):**  While not the primary goal, repeated failed login attempts can lead to legitimate user account lockouts, causing disruption.

**4.3.4. Threat Actor Profiling:**

Credential stuffing attacks are often carried out by:

* **Cybercriminals:**  Looking for accounts with valuable access or data.
* **Script Kiddies:**  Using readily available tools and lists of compromised credentials.

**4.3.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  As with phishing, MFA is a highly effective countermeasure against credential stuffing.
* **Password Complexity Requirements:** Enforce strong password policies that require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Password Rotation Policies:** Encourage or enforce regular password changes.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement robust rate limiting on the Asgard login endpoint to slow down or block automated login attempts.
* **Account Lockout Policies:** Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts. However, be mindful of potential denial-of-service attacks targeting account lockouts.
* **CAPTCHA or Similar Challenges:** Implement CAPTCHA or other challenge-response mechanisms to differentiate between human users and automated bots.
* **IP Blocking and Geolocation Filtering:**  Block suspicious IP addresses or traffic originating from known malicious locations.
* **Compromised Credential Monitoring:**  Utilize services that monitor for compromised credentials and notify users if their credentials have been found in data breaches. Encourage users to change their passwords on Asgard if their credentials have been compromised elsewhere.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Implement systems that analyze login patterns and flag suspicious activity, such as logins from unusual locations or devices.
