        * **Injection Attacks:**
            * **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in database queries to execute malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches or complete database takeover.
            * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially stealing credentials or performing actions on their behalf.
            * **Command Injection:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities where user input is used to construct system commands, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        * **Insecure Deserialization:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Asgard handles serialized data, potentially leading to remote code execution.
        * **Security Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured security settings in the web server, application server, or Asgard itself (e.g., exposed administrative interfaces, default settings).
        * **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks used by Asgard that haven't been patched.
        * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Tricking authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the Asgard application.
    * **Attack Scenarios:**
        * An attacker identifies an SQL injection vulnerability in a search function and uses it to dump user credentials.
        * An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability to inject a keylogger script, capturing administrator credentials.
        * An attacker finds a publicly known vulnerability in a specific version of a library used by Asgard and exploits it for remote code execution.
    * **Potential Impact:**
        * **Complete control over the Asgard application:** Ability to manage deployments, access sensitive configuration data, and potentially manipulate underlying infrastructure.
        * **Data breaches:** Access to sensitive information about deployments, infrastructure, and potentially user credentials.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crashing the Asgard application or making it unavailable.
        * **Lateral movement:** Using the compromised Asgard instance as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Development Practices:** Implement secure coding guidelines, perform regular code reviews, and conduct static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST).
        * **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs and encode outputs to prevent injection attacks.
        * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong password policies, enforce MFA, and implement robust role-based access control (RBAC).
