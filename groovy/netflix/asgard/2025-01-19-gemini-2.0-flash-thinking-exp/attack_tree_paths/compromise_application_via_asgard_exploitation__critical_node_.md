* **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in Asgard's API endpoints to execute unauthorized actions or extract sensitive information.
* **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    * **API Injection Flaws (e.g., Command Injection, Code Injection):**  Injecting malicious code into API requests that is then executed by the Asgard server.
    * **Broken Authentication/Authorization on API Endpoints:**  Accessing API endpoints without proper authentication or with insufficient authorization.
    * **Excessive Data Exposure:** API endpoints returning more data than necessary, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    * **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  Overwhelming the API with requests, leading to denial-of-service or enabling brute-force attacks.
    * **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  Manipulating API parameters to access resources belonging to other users or applications.
    * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Tricking authenticated users into making unintended API requests.
* **Impact:**  Direct manipulation of application infrastructure, deployment, or configuration; data breaches; denial of service.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all API requests.
    * Enforce strict authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
