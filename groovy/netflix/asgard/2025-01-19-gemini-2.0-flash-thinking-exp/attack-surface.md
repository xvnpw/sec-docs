# Attack Surface Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage or Management of AWS Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_or_management_of_aws_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** AWS credentials (access keys and secret keys) required for Asgard to interact with AWS services are stored insecurely, making them vulnerable to theft or exposure.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard needs these credentials to function and manage AWS resources. The way Asgard stores and handles these credentials directly impacts this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** AWS credentials stored in plain text in Asgard's configuration files or database, accessible to unauthorized users or through a configuration vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the AWS account managed by Asgard, allowing attackers to create, modify, or delete resources, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize AWS IAM roles for EC2 instances running Asgard instead of storing long-term credentials.
        *   If direct credential storage is necessary, use secure secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault and integrate Asgard with them.
        *   Encrypt stored credentials at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement strict access controls to Asgard's configuration files and data stores.
        *   Regularly rotate AWS credentials used by Asgard.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection through Asgard's Interface](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_through_asgard's_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Asgard's code allow attackers to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system or AWS CLI through user-supplied input fields.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard takes user input to manage AWS resources (e.g., instance names, tags, scripts). If this input is not properly sanitized before being used in system calls or AWS CLI commands, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious instance name containing shell commands that are executed on the Asgard server when Asgard attempts to interact with that instance.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Asgard server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and the ability to further compromise the AWS environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
        *   Avoid directly executing shell commands based on user input.
        *   Utilize parameterized commands or SDK functions that prevent command injection.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the Asgard application's operating system user.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization Controls within Asgard](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_controls_within_asgard.md)

*   **Description:** Asgard's internal authorization mechanisms are flawed, allowing users to perform actions they are not intended to, potentially leading to unauthorized management of AWS resources.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard implements its own user roles and permissions. Vulnerabilities in this implementation can allow privilege escalation or access to sensitive functionalities.
    *   **Example:** A user with read-only access to EC2 instances in Asgard is able to perform actions like terminating instances due to a flaw in Asgard's authorization logic.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of AWS resources, potential data breaches, and disruption of services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust and well-tested role-based access control (RBAC) system within Asgard.
        *   Regularly review and audit Asgard's authorization rules and user permissions.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for Asgard users.
        *   Consider integrating Asgard's authorization with AWS IAM policies for a more centralized approach.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Asgard](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_asgard.md)

*   **Description:** Asgard's functionality allows an attacker to make requests to internal or external resources that Asgard has access to, potentially bypassing security controls.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard interacts with AWS APIs and potentially other internal services via URLs. If user-controlled input influences these URLs without proper validation, it can lead to SSRF.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a parameter in Asgard that causes it to make a request to an internal metadata service, exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential information disclosure, and the ability to pivot to other systems within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all URLs and hostnames used by Asgard.
        *   Use allow-lists (whitelists) for allowed destination hosts and protocols.
        *   Disable or restrict unnecessary network access from the Asgard server.
        *   Consider using a proxy server for outbound requests to add an extra layer of security.
