# Threat Model Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Threat: [Compromised Asgard Credentials](./threats/compromised_asgard_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to valid Asgard login credentials (username and password). This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, malware, or insider threats. The attacker can then log into Asgard as a legitimate user.

**Impact:** The attacker can perform any action the compromised user is authorized to do within Asgard, potentially leading to unauthorized resource manipulation, data breaches, service disruption, or financial loss due to resource misuse.

**Affected Asgard Component:** Authentication Module, User Session Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for Asgard users.
*   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Asgard logins.
*   Regularly review and revoke unnecessary Asgard user accounts.
*   Monitor Asgard login activity for suspicious patterns.
*   Educate users about phishing and social engineering attacks.

## Threat: [Insufficient Asgard User Permissions](./threats/insufficient_asgard_user_permissions.md)

**Description:** Asgard users are granted overly broad permissions, allowing them to perform actions beyond their required scope. An attacker who compromises such an account (or a malicious insider) can exploit these excessive permissions.

**Impact:**  Users can unintentionally or maliciously modify critical infrastructure, leading to service outages, security vulnerabilities, or data loss. For example, a developer might accidentally terminate a production instance if they have overly broad termination rights.

**Affected Asgard Component:** Authorization Module, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning Asgard roles and permissions.
*   Regularly review and audit Asgard user roles and permissions.
*   Define granular roles based on specific job functions and responsibilities.
*   Use Asgard's built-in permission management features effectively.

## Threat: [Malicious Instance Manipulation](./threats/malicious_instance_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to Asgard (through compromised credentials or excessive permissions) uses Asgard's interface to start, stop, terminate, or modify EC2 instances for malicious purposes. This could involve terminating critical production instances to cause a denial of service or launching rogue instances for cryptocurrency mining or botnet activities.

**Impact:** Service disruption, data loss (if instances are terminated without proper backups), increased cloud costs due to rogue instances, potential legal and reputational damage.

**Affected Asgard Component:** EC2 Management Module (Instance Actions, Instance Configuration)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control access to Asgard and enforce the principle of least privilege.
*   Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual instance activity (e.g., unexpected terminations, launches in unusual regions).
*   Utilize AWS CloudTrail to audit all actions performed within Asgard.
*   Implement safeguards within AWS (outside of Asgard) to prevent accidental or malicious termination of critical instances (e.g., termination protection).

## Threat: [Security Group Modification Leading to Exposure](./threats/security_group_modification_leading_to_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses Asgard to modify security group rules, opening up unintended access to internal resources or exposing sensitive services to the public internet. This could involve adding rules allowing inbound traffic on critical ports (e.g., SSH, database ports) from unauthorized IP addresses.

**Impact:**  Increased attack surface, potential data breaches, unauthorized access to internal systems, and compromise of sensitive data.

**Affected Asgard Component:** EC2 Management Module (Security Groups)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls for users who can modify security groups within Asgard.
*   Regularly review and audit security group configurations.
*   Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools to manage security groups and track changes.
*   Implement network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to identify unauthorized access attempts.

## Threat: [Load Balancer Misconfiguration](./threats/load_balancer_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to Asgard modifies load balancer configurations in a way that disrupts service availability or exposes backend instances directly to the internet. This could involve changing listener rules, health check configurations, or target group associations.

**Impact:** Service outages, performance degradation, exposure of backend servers to direct attacks, potential data breaches.

**Affected Asgard Component:** ELB/ALB Management Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to load balancer configuration within Asgard.
*   Implement thorough testing of load balancer configurations before deployment.
*   Use IaC tools to manage load balancer configurations and track changes.
*   Monitor load balancer health and performance metrics.
