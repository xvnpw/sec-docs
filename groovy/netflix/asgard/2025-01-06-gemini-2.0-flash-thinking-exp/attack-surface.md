# Attack Surface Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Asgard Instance](./attack_surfaces/compromised_asgard_instance.md)

**Description:** The server hosting the Asgard application is compromised by an attacker.

**How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard acts as a central point of control for managing AWS resources. Compromising it grants access to this control plane.

**Example:** An attacker exploits an unpatched vulnerability in the operating system or web server hosting Asgard to gain shell access.

**Impact:** Complete control over AWS resources managed by Asgard, including data breaches, service disruption, and resource hijacking.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly patch the operating system and all software components on the Asgard server.
* Implement strong access controls and firewalls to restrict access to the Asgard server.
* Harden the server configuration according to security best practices.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems.
* Consider hosting Asgard within a secure, isolated network segment.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised AWS IAM Credentials Used by Asgard](./attack_surfaces/compromised_aws_iam_credentials_used_by_asgard.md)

**Description:** The AWS IAM credentials (access keys or roles) used by Asgard to interact with AWS are compromised.

**How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard requires these credentials to function, making their security paramount. A compromise directly enables malicious actions *through Asgard's established access*.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the AWS credentials stored in Asgard's configuration files or through a compromised developer workstation that has access to Asgard's configuration.

**Impact:** Direct access to the AWS environment, often mimicking actions that would be performed through Asgard. Attackers can perform any action allowed by the compromised IAM credentials.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize IAM Roles for EC2 instances hosting Asgard instead of long-term access keys.
* If access keys are necessary, store them securely (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager and retrieving them dynamically).
* Implement strict IAM policies with the principle of least privilege for the Asgard role/user.
* Regularly rotate access keys if used.
* Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs for suspicious activity originating from the Asgard role/user.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Asgard Codebase (e.g., XSS, SSRF, Code Injection)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_asgard_codebase__e_g___xss__ssrf__code_injection_.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within the Asgard application code itself.

**How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard's code processes user input and interacts with AWS APIs, creating opportunities for exploitation if vulnerabilities are present *within the Asgard application itself*.

**Example:**
* **XSS:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a field within Asgard (e.g., resource tag displayed by Asgard), which is then executed in the browsers of other Asgard users, potentially stealing session cookies.
* **SSRF:** An attacker manipulates Asgard to make requests to internal or external resources *from the Asgard server*, potentially exposing sensitive information or compromising other systems.
* **Code Injection:**  Improper handling of user input *within Asgard's code* when interacting with AWS APIs allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Asgard server.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Asgard, execution of arbitrary code on the server, manipulation of AWS resources through Asgard.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure coding practices during development, including input validation and output encoding.
* Conduct regular security code reviews and penetration testing of the Asgard application.
* Keep Asgard updated to the latest version, which includes security patches.
* Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass within Asgard](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_within_asgard.md)

**Description:** Flaws in Asgard's authorization logic allow users to access or modify resources they are not intended to *through the Asgard interface*.

**How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard's role is to manage access to AWS resources, so weaknesses in its authorization mechanisms directly lead to security risks *within the context of using Asgard*.

**Example:** A user with read-only permissions in Asgard is able to perform actions that should require higher privileges due to a flaw in Asgard's permission checks.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of AWS resources *via Asgard*, potential data breaches, and service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and test Asgard's authorization logic.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within Asgard and map it correctly to AWS IAM policies.
* Regularly audit user permissions within Asgard.

## Attack Surface: [Session Management Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/session_management_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Asgard manages user sessions, allowing attackers to hijack sessions *of Asgard users*.

**How Asgard Contributes:** Asgard requires users to authenticate, and weak session management can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users *within the Asgard application*.

**Example:** An attacker steals a user's Asgard session cookie through a network interception or XSS attack and uses it to access Asgard.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Asgard, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user *through the Asgard interface*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use secure session cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
* Implement session timeouts and automatic logout after inactivity.
* Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
* Enforce HTTPS for all communication with Asgard.
