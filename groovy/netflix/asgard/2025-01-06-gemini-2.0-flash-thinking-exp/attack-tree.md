## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Asgard [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_asgard__critical_.md)

This is the root goal and therefore inherently critical. Success at this node signifies a complete compromise of the target application via Asgard.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asgard Itself [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asgard_itself__critical_.md)

* If Asgard itself is compromised, the attacker gains a powerful foothold to manipulate the managed application and its infrastructure.
* This node is critical because it enables a wide range of subsequent high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Asgard's Credentials [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_asgard's_credentials__critical_.md)

* Possessing valid Asgard credentials grants the attacker legitimate access to its functionalities, allowing them to bypass many security controls.
* This node is critical because it directly leads to the ability to abuse Asgard's functionality.
    * **Steal Asgard's AWS IAM Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Likelihood:** Low - Medium (depending on the security of credential storage).
        * **Impact:** Critical (full control over AWS resources managed by Asgard).
        * **Effort:** Medium - High.
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Advanced.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low (actions appear legitimate).
        * **Breakdown:** This involves techniques to extract the AWS credentials used by Asgard, granting the attacker significant control over the underlying AWS infrastructure. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how credentials are stored, gaining access to the Asgard server's file system or memory, or even social engineering.
    * **Exploit Weak or Default Asgard User Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (especially if MFA is not enforced).
        * **Impact:** High (access to Asgard's functionality).
        * **Effort:** Low.
        * **Skill Level:** Low.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
        * **Breakdown:** This involves exploiting weak password policies, default credentials, or the lack of multi-factor authentication to gain unauthorized access to Asgard's user interface. Once logged in, the attacker can leverage Asgard's features for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Asgard's Functionality [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_asgard's_functionality__critical_.md)

* This represents the direct exploitation of Asgard's intended features to harm the managed application.
* This node is critical because it directly leads to impactful consequences for the target application.
    * **Unauthorized Access to Asgard [CRITICAL]:**
        * This is a critical prerequisite for abusing Asgard's functionality. Without access, the attacker cannot leverage Asgard's features.
        * **Breakdown:** This involves bypassing Asgard's authentication mechanisms, either through exploiting vulnerabilities or using compromised credentials (as detailed above).
    * **Malicious Configuration Changes via Asgard [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Likelihood:** Low - Medium (depends on access controls within Asgard).
        * **Impact:** High to Critical (depending on the changes made - can lead to application compromise, DoS, or data exposure).
        * **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        * **Skill Level:** Low to Intermediate.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.
        * **Breakdown:** Once authenticated, an attacker can use Asgard's interface or API to modify critical deployment configurations. This could involve introducing malicious code, downgrading to vulnerable versions, changing environment variables to expose secrets, or manipulating auto-scaling and load balancer settings to disrupt the application.
    * **Resource Manipulation via Asgard [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Likelihood:** Low - Medium (depends on access controls within Asgard).
        * **Impact:** High to Critical (can lead to service disruption or data loss).
        * **Effort:** Low.
        * **Skill Level:** Low.
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.
        * **Breakdown:** An attacker with sufficient privileges within Asgard can use its features to directly manipulate AWS resources managed by it. This includes terminating critical application instances, creating malicious resources for cryptojacking or other purposes, or even deleting critical resources like databases or storage volumes, leading to severe consequences.
