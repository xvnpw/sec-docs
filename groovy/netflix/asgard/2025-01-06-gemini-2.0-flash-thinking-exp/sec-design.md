**Prepared By:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced design overview of Netflix's Asgard project, specifically tailored for threat modeling. Asgard is a web-based platform designed to streamline cloud management and deployment within Amazon Web Services (AWS). This revised document aims for greater clarity and detail in articulating Asgard's architecture, components, and data flow, thereby facilitating a more effective and comprehensive threat modeling exercise. It serves as a critical reference point for security analysts to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The core objectives of Asgard are to:

*   Offer an intuitive web interface for managing diverse AWS resources.
*   Simplify and standardize common AWS operational tasks for development and operations teams.
*   Provide a consolidated, real-time view of the organization's AWS infrastructure.
*   Empower teams with self-service capabilities for application deployment and management.
*   Reduce the complexity and learning curve associated with direct interaction with the native AWS console.

## 3. High-Level Architecture

Asgard employs a traditional client-server architecture. Users interact with a web browser client, which communicates with a Java-based backend server application hosted within a secure environment. The backend interacts with various AWS services through the official AWS SDK, leveraging configured credentials.

    style K fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Detailed Data Flow Steps:**

1. **User Initiates Action in Browser:** A user interacts with the Asgard UI, triggering an action (e.g., starting an EC2 instance).
2. **HTTP Request to Asgard Server:** The browser sends an authenticated HTTP request to the Asgard Web Application Server, typically containing parameters describing the desired action.
3. **Authentication and Authorization Check:** The Asgard server verifies the user's identity and confirms they have the necessary permissions to perform the requested action, based on their assigned roles and associated AWS IAM permissions.
4. **Asgard Backend Processes Request:** If authorized, the backend logic processes the request, potentially involving data validation, business rule execution, and preparation for interaction with AWS.
5. **AWS SDK Call to Relevant AWS Service:** The Asgard server uses the AWS SDK to make a specific API call to the relevant AWS service (e.g., the EC2 service to start an instance). This call includes necessary parameters and authentication credentials.
6. **AWS Service Processes Request:** The target AWS service receives and processes the API request, performing the requested action (e.g., starting the EC2 instance).
7. **Response from AWS Service:** The AWS service sends a response back to the Asgard server, indicating the success or failure of the operation, potentially including relevant data about the outcome.
8. **Asgard Backend Processes Response:** The Asgard server processes the response from AWS, potentially updating its internal state or formatting the data for presentation in the UI.
9. **HTTP Response to Browser:** The Asgard server sends an HTTP response back to the user's browser, indicating the status of the request and any relevant data.
10. **Browser Updates UI:** The browser updates the user interface to reflect the outcome of the action, providing feedback to the user.
11. **Error Response to Browser:** If authentication or authorization fails, or if an error occurs during processing on the Asgard server or within AWS, an error response is sent to the browser, providing information about the failure.
