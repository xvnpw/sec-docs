# Threat Model Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Threat: [Compromised Asgard AWS Credentials](./threats/compromised_asgard_aws_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the AWS credentials used *by Asgard*. This could happen through exploiting vulnerabilities in Asgard's storage, intercepting network traffic *to or from Asgard*, or compromising the server where Asgard is running. The attacker can then use these credentials to directly interact with the AWS API *as Asgard*.

**Impact:** Complete control over the managed AWS environment. Attackers could launch or terminate instances, access or delete data in S3, modify security groups, and potentially cause significant financial damage and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** AWS Credential Management Module, potentially also affecting API Interaction Module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust credential storage mechanisms (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) *integrated with Asgard*.
*   Enforce the principle of least privilege for Asgard's IAM role.
*   Regularly rotate AWS credentials used by Asgard.
*   Monitor AWS API activity for suspicious behavior originating from Asgard's assumed role.
*   Secure the environment where Asgard is deployed.

## Threat: [Exposure of AWS Credentials within Asgard Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_aws_credentials_within_asgard_configuration.md)

**Description:** AWS credentials are stored insecurely within Asgard's configuration files, environment variables, or database. An attacker gaining access to the Asgard server or its data store can retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the managed AWS environment, as described in the "Compromised Asgard AWS Credentials" threat.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management Module, potentially Database Access Layer.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Never store plain text credentials in Asgard's configuration files or environment variables.
*   Utilize secure credential management systems (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) *to store Asgard's credentials*.
*   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit *within Asgard*.
*   Implement strict access controls on Asgard's configuration files and data store.

## Threat: [Malicious Instance Launch via Asgard](./threats/malicious_instance_launch_via_asgard.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access *to Asgard* uses its interface to launch rogue EC2 instances for malicious purposes, such as cryptocurrency mining, participating in botnets, or hosting phishing sites.

**Impact:** Unexpected AWS costs, potential security breaches originating from the rogue instances, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Instance Management Module, potentially Auto Scaling Group Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization controls *within Asgard*.
*   Regularly audit Asgard's activity logs for suspicious instance launches.
*   Implement guardrails within AWS to restrict the types and configurations of instances that can be launched *even through Asgard*.
*   Monitor AWS resource usage for anomalies.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Scaling Operations through Asgard](./threats/unauthorized_scaling_operations_through_asgard.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates Auto Scaling Groups *through Asgard* to either rapidly increase the number of instances (leading to denial of service and increased costs) or drastically reduce the number of instances (causing service outages).

**Impact:** Denial of service, significant unexpected AWS costs, and service disruptions.

**Affected Component:** Auto Scaling Group Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization controls *within Asgard*.
*   Monitor Auto Scaling Group activity for unexpected scaling events *initiated by Asgard*.
*   Implement safeguards and approval workflows for significant scaling operations *within Asgard*.

## Threat: [ELB Manipulation for Traffic Interception](./threats/elb_manipulation_for_traffic_interception.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access *to Asgard* modifies Elastic Load Balancer configurations *through Asgard* to redirect traffic intended for legitimate applications to attacker-controlled servers, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks and data theft.

**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, and potential compromise of user credentials.

**Affected Component:** Load Balancer Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization controls *within Asgard*.
*   Monitor ELB configurations for unauthorized changes *made via Asgard*.
*   Implement network segmentation and security controls to limit the impact of traffic redirection.

## Threat: [Security Group Modification to Allow Unauthorized Access](./threats/security_group_modification_to_allow_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker uses Asgard to modify security group rules, opening up access to previously protected resources (e.g., databases, internal services) to unauthorized external entities.

**Impact:** Data breaches, compromise of internal systems, and potential lateral movement within the AWS environment.

**Affected Component:** Security Group Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization controls *within Asgard*.
*   Monitor security group configurations for unauthorized changes *made through Asgard*.
*   Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) to manage security group configurations and detect unauthorized drifts *including those made by Asgard*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Asgard's Codebase](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_asgard's_codebase.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist in Asgard's Java code or its dependencies (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection vulnerabilities) that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control *of Asgard and its functions*.

**Impact:**  Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from unauthorized access to data manipulation and potentially full control over Asgard and the managed AWS environment.

**Affected Component:** Various modules depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement secure coding practices during Asgard development.
*   Perform regular static and dynamic code analysis *on Asgard*.
*   Keep Asgard and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Conduct regular penetration testing of the Asgard application.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in Asgard](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities_in_asgard.md)

**Description:** Flaws in Asgard's authentication mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Asgard, potentially leading to the compromise of the managed AWS environment.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust and industry-standard authentication mechanisms *within Asgard*.
*   Enforce strong password policies *for Asgard users*.
*   Regularly review and test the authentication implementation for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking](./threats/session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** Attackers could potentially steal valid Asgard user sessions (e.g., through cross-site scripting vulnerabilities *in Asgard* or network sniffing) to gain unauthorized access without needing to know the user's credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to Asgard, allowing the attacker to perform actions as the legitimate user.

**Affected Component:** Session Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement secure session management practices *within Asgard* (e.g., using HTTP-only and secure flags for cookies).
*   Enforce session timeouts *in Asgard*.
*   Rotate session identifiers regularly.
*   Protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities *in Asgard*.

## Threat: [Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication for Asgard Users](./threats/lack_of_multi-factor_authentication_for_asgard_users.md)

**Description:** Asgard does not enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user logins, making it easier for attackers to compromise accounts using stolen credentials.

**Impact:** Increased risk of unauthorized access to Asgard.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement and enforce multi-factor authentication for all Asgard users.
