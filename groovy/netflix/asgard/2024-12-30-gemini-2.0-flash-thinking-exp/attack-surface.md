### Key Attack Surface List: Netflix Asgard (High & Critical, Asgard-Specific)

This list details key attack surfaces directly involving Netflix Asgard, with high or critical risk severity.

*   **Attack Surface:** Compromised Asgard Credentials
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to Asgard by obtaining legitimate user credentials (username/password, API keys if used).
    *   **How Asgard Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asgard acts as a central point of access for managing AWS resources. Compromised credentials grant the attacker the ability to perform actions within the scope of the compromised user's permissions *within Asgard*, which directly translates to actions in the connected AWS environment.
    *   **Example:** An attacker obtains an Asgard user's password through phishing or a data breach. They then log into Asgard and terminate critical EC2 instances.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over AWS resources manageable by the compromised user within Asgard, leading to data loss, service disruption, or financial damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies and regular password rotation for Asgard users.
        *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Asgard users.
        *   Securely store and manage Asgard credentials.
        *   Monitor Asgard login activity for suspicious patterns.
        *   Regularly review and revoke unnecessary Asgard user accounts.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insufficient Asgard Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    *   **Description:** Asgard's RBAC is not configured granularly, granting users more permissions than necessary for their roles *within Asgard*.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asgard's RBAC directly controls what actions users can perform on AWS resources *through its interface*. Overly permissive roles allow users (or compromised accounts) to perform actions beyond their intended scope *within Asgard*.
    *   **Example:** A developer with permissions only to deploy applications can, due to a poorly configured Asgard role, also modify security group rules, potentially opening up the environment to external attacks *through Asgard*.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation within Asgard, leading to unauthorized modification or deletion of AWS resources, potential security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring Asgard roles.
        *   Regularly review and audit Asgard role assignments.
        *   Define granular roles based on specific job functions and responsibilities within Asgard.
        *   Automate role assignment and revocation processes within Asgard.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of AWS Credentials through Asgard
    *   **Description:** Asgard stores or handles AWS credentials insecurely, making them accessible to attackers who compromise the Asgard server or application.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asgard needs access to AWS credentials to manage resources. If these credentials are not properly secured *within Asgard*, it becomes a target for credential theft.
    *   **Example:** AWS access keys are stored in plain text in Asgard's configuration files. An attacker gains access to the Asgard server and retrieves these keys, allowing them to directly access the AWS account outside of Asgard.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the AWS account, allowing attackers to perform any action within the account.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing AWS credentials directly within Asgard's configuration.
        *   Utilize AWS IAM roles for Asgard to assume, rather than storing long-term credentials.
        *   If credentials must be stored, use secure secrets management solutions and encryption.
        *   Regularly rotate AWS credentials used by Asgard.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Deployment Configurations via Asgard
    *   **Description:** Attackers with access to Asgard modify deployment configurations *within Asgard* to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code into deployed applications.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asgard is the tool used to manage and deploy applications. Compromising Asgard allows attackers to inject malicious elements into the deployment process *through Asgard*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a CloudFormation template in Asgard to include a user data script that installs a backdoor on newly launched EC2 instances.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable or compromised applications *via Asgard*, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further exploitation of the infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for modifying deployment configurations within Asgard.
        *   Utilize version control for deployment configurations managed by Asgard and track changes.
        *   Implement code review processes for deployment configurations within Asgard.
        *   Integrate security scanning tools into the deployment pipeline triggered by Asgard to detect vulnerabilities before deployment.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Asgard's Codebase
    *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the Asgard application itself (e.g., insecure deserialization, SQL injection if it uses a database).
    *   **How Asgard Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asgard is a software application and, like any software, can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise *the Asgard application itself*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an insecure deserialization vulnerability in Asgard to execute arbitrary code on the Asgard server, potentially gaining access to AWS credentials or the underlying infrastructure *through Asgard*.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Asgard application, potentially leading to control over the managed AWS environment or data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Asgard updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of the Asgard application.
        *   Follow secure coding practices during any customization or extension of Asgard.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the Asgard application from common web attacks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Compromise of the Asgard Server
    *   **Description:** The server hosting the Asgard application is compromised, granting attackers access to Asgard's configuration, credentials, and potentially the ability to directly interact with the AWS environment *through Asgard*.
    *   **How Asgard Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Asgard's functionality relies on the security of the server it runs on. A compromised server directly exposes Asgard and its capabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system of the Asgard server to gain root access. They then access Asgard's configuration files and retrieve AWS credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Asgard application and potentially the AWS environment it manages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the Asgard server by following security best practices (e.g., patching, disabling unnecessary services, strong firewall rules).
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) on the Asgard server.
        *   Regularly monitor the Asgard server for suspicious activity.
        *   Secure access to the Asgard server and restrict administrative privileges.
