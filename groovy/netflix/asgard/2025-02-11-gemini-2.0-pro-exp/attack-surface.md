# Attack Surface Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass (Asgard-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__asgard-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing Asgard's *internal* authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   **Asgard Contribution:** Vulnerabilities in Asgard's own authentication and RBAC code, distinct from AWS IAM.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a flaw in Asgard's LDAP integration to authenticate as a privileged Asgard user.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Asgard, leading to unauthorized AWS resource manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Robust input validation and sanitization for all authentication inputs within Asgard.
        *   Regular security reviews and updates of Asgard's authentication/authorization code.
        *   Secure session management practices within Asgard (strong tokens, proper expiration).
        *   Penetration testing targeting Asgard's authentication/authorization.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Integrate Asgard with a strong, centrally managed identity provider.
        *   Enforce MFA for Asgard users.
        *   Regularly audit Asgard user accounts and roles.

## Attack Surface: [AWS Credential Exposure/Misuse (Asgard Handling)](./attack_surfaces/aws_credential_exposuremisuse__asgard_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of AWS credentials due to vulnerabilities in *how Asgard stores or uses them*.
*   **Asgard Contribution:** Asgard's internal handling of AWS credentials is the direct risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker extracts AWS keys from Asgard's memory or database due to a vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Full control over AWS resources accessible to Asgard's credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Never hardcode credentials in Asgard's code.
        *   Use secure storage for credentials (encrypted databases, secrets management solutions).
        *   Robust logging and auditing of credential usage *within Asgard*.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive credentials.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Use IAM roles for Asgard (not long-term keys) whenever possible.
        *   Grant Asgard *least privilege* AWS permissions.
        *   Implement regular credential rotation.

## Attack Surface: [Deployment and Configuration Manipulation (Through Asgard)](./attack_surfaces/deployment_and_configuration_manipulation__through_asgard_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized AWS changes *via vulnerabilities in Asgard's deployment features*.
*   **Asgard Contribution:** Asgard's core functionality of managing deployments is the attack vector.
*   **Example:** Exploiting Asgard's security group management to open ports to the public.
*   **Impact:** Malicious instance launches, data breaches, denial-of-service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strict input validation and sanitization for all deployment parameters *within Asgard*.
        *   Strong validation of AMI IDs and configuration settings.
        *   Robust error handling and logging for deployment operations.
        *   Regular security reviews of Asgard's deployment workflows.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Use Asgard's RBAC to restrict access to deployment actions.
        *   Implement approval workflows for critical changes.
        *   Audit Asgard's activity logs for unauthorized actions.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Asgard's Dependencies)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__asgard's_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in libraries *used by Asgard*.
*   **Asgard Contribution:** Asgard's reliance on potentially vulnerable external libraries.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a known vulnerability in an outdated Groovy library used by Asgard.
*   **Impact:** Code execution within Asgard, leading to compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update Asgard's dependencies to secure versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools.
        *   Consider Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Deploy the latest version of Asgard.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Asgard and its technologies.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection (Within Asgard)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection__within_asgard_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious Groovy/Java code *into Asgard*.
*   **Asgard Contribution:** Asgard's use of Groovy/Java and potential mishandling of user input.
*   **Example:** Injecting a malicious Groovy script into an Asgard input field.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Asgard server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize *all* user input within Asgard. Use whitelisting.
        *   Avoid dynamic code evaluation if possible. Use a secure sandbox if necessary.
        *   Regular security code reviews, focusing on input handling.
        *   Use static analysis tools.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Limit users with permissions to modify configurations susceptible to code injection.
        *   Regularly audit user activity within Asgard.
