# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (Within Asgard) and MFA](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__within_asgard__and_mfa.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Asgard Roles:** Examine the built-in roles and permissions within Asgard. Understand the capabilities associated with each role.
    2.  **Restrict User Permissions:** Assign users the *minimum* necessary Asgard roles to perform their tasks. Avoid granting broad administrative access unless absolutely required.  Specifically, limit permissions related to:
        *   Launching instances.
        *   Modifying security groups.
        *   Creating/Deleting AMIs.
        *   Modifying Asgard's configuration.
    3.  **Enforce MFA:** Enable and *enforce* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for *all* Asgard user accounts. This is a critical control within Asgard itself. Configure Asgard to require MFA for login.
    4. **Regular Permission Review:** Periodically review user permissions within Asgard to ensure they remain appropriate and haven't become overly permissive over time.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-Reliance on Asgard UI (Severity: High):** While not eliminating reliance, it limits the damage an attacker can do if they compromise an Asgard account.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):** Restricts the ability of malicious insiders with Asgard access to cause significant damage.
    *   **Credential Compromise (Severity: High):** MFA significantly reduces the risk of compromised Asgard credentials being used for unauthorized access.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: Medium):** Limits the potential for attackers to escalate privileges within Asgard.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-Reliance on Asgard UI:** Risk reduction: Medium. Reduces the impact of a compromised account.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduction: Medium. Limits the scope of potential damage.
    *   **Credential Compromise:** Risk reduction: High. MFA is a very effective control.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduction: Medium. Makes it harder for attackers to gain higher privileges.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: Basic Asgard roles are used, but some users have more permissions than needed. MFA is not enabled.* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Need to conduct a thorough review of Asgard user roles and permissions, and re-assign users to the least-privilege roles.  Need to enable and enforce MFA for all Asgard users.* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Configure Asgard's Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_configure_asgard's_audit_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Asgard's Configuration:** Locate the configuration settings for Asgard's audit logging (this may be in a configuration file or through the Asgard UI).
    2.  **Enable Audit Logging:** Ensure that audit logging is explicitly enabled.
    3.  **Configure Log Levels:** Set the appropriate log level to capture all relevant actions.  This should include, at a minimum:
        *   User logins and logouts.
        *   Instance launches and terminations.
        *   Security group modifications.
        *   AMI creation and deletion.
        *   Changes to Asgard's configuration.
    4.  **Configure Log Destination (if applicable):** If Asgard supports configuring a specific log destination (e.g., a file path or a remote syslog server), configure it appropriately.  Ideally, logs should be sent to a secure, centralized location.
    5. **Test Logging:** After enabling and configuring logging, perform some test actions within Asgard (e.g., launch an instance, modify a security group) and verify that these actions are recorded in the audit logs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lack of Audit Trail (Severity: High):** Provides a detailed record of actions performed within Asgard, essential for security investigations.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium):** Allows for detection and investigation of unauthorized or malicious actions by Asgard users.
    *   **Delayed Incident Response (Severity: Medium):** Enables faster detection and response to security incidents by providing a clear record of events.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lack of Audit Trail:** Risk reduction: High. Provides the necessary audit trail.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduction: Medium. Facilitates detection and investigation.
    *   **Delayed Incident Response:** Risk reduction: Medium. Improves response times.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: Audit logging is partially enabled, but not all actions are being logged, and the logs are stored locally on the Asgard instance.* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Need to configure Asgard to log *all* relevant actions. Need to configure a secure, centralized log destination (e.g., forwarding to AWS CloudTrail or a SIEM system).* ]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates of Asgard and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_of_asgard_and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check for updates to Asgard itself and its dependencies. This includes monitoring the official Asgard repository, release notes, and security advisories.
    2.  **Establish an Update Process:** Define a clear process for applying updates. This should include:
        *   Testing updates in a non-production environment before deploying to production.
        *   Having a rollback plan in case an update causes issues.
        *   Documenting all updates.
    3.  **Automate Updates (if possible):** If feasible, automate the update process for Asgard and its dependencies. This can reduce the risk of human error and ensure that updates are applied promptly. *However*, ensure proper testing and rollback mechanisms are in place.
    4. **Dependency Scanning (Ideally, but less directly "within Asgard"):** While ideally done as part of the build process *before* deploying Asgard, regularly scanning the *running* Asgard instance's dependencies for known vulnerabilities can provide an additional layer of defense. This is a borderline case for "directly involving Asgard."

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium to High):** Reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in Asgard or its dependencies.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** While not preventing zero-days, regular updates increase the likelihood of quickly addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: Medium to High. Depends on the severity of the vulnerabilities and the speed of updates.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: Low to Medium. Improves the chances of a quick response.

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: Asgard is updated infrequently and manually. No formal update process exists.* ]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Need to establish a regular update schedule and a documented process for applying updates, including testing and rollback procedures. Explore options for automating updates.* ]
