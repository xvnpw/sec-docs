# Deep Analysis of Asgard Attack Tree Path: Broad AWS Permissions

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and propose mitigation strategies for the risk associated with overly broad AWS permissions granted to the IAM role used by the Asgard application.  We aim to understand how an attacker could exploit these excessive permissions and to define concrete steps to reduce the attack surface.  This analysis will inform specific security recommendations for the development and operations teams.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Application:** Asgard (specifically, deployments utilizing the https://github.com/netflix/asgard codebase).
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of overly permissive IAM roles associated with the Asgard application.
*   **AWS Services:**  All AWS services potentially accessible via the Asgard IAM role, with a particular focus on services *not* directly required for Asgard's core functionality (e.g., EC2, Auto Scaling, ELB, IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and potentially others depending on the specific Asgard configuration).
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of AWS resources, service disruption, and potential lateral movement within the AWS environment.
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover vulnerabilities within the Asgard codebase itself (e.g., XSS, SQLi), nor does it cover network-level attacks.  It is solely focused on the IAM role permissions.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **IAM Role Enumeration:**  Identify the exact IAM role(s) associated with the Asgard application. This may involve inspecting EC2 instance profiles, ECS task definitions, or other relevant AWS configurations.
2.  **Permission Policy Analysis:**  Obtain and meticulously review the IAM policies attached to the identified role(s).  This will involve using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI (`aws iam get-policy`, `aws iam get-role-policy`, `aws iam list-attached-role-policies`), or Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) definitions (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform).
3.  **Asgard Functionality Mapping:**  Create a detailed mapping of Asgard's core functionalities and the *minimum* required AWS permissions for each function. This will involve reviewing Asgard's documentation, source code, and operational procedures.
4.  **Gap Analysis:**  Compare the actual granted permissions (from step 2) with the minimum required permissions (from step 3).  Identify any discrepancies, highlighting permissions that are overly broad or unnecessary.
5.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:**  For each identified excessive permission, develop realistic attack scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could leverage that permission to compromise the system.
6.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Propose specific, actionable recommendations to remediate the identified risks, focusing on the principle of least privilege.
7.  **Tooling Identification:** Identify tools that can assist in automating the detection and remediation of overly permissive IAM roles.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [B1a] Broad AWS Permissions

**4.1 IAM Role Enumeration (Example)**

Let's assume, after investigation, we find that Asgard is running on EC2 instances and is associated with the IAM role named `Asgard-EC2-Role`.  This role is attached to the EC2 instance profile used by the Asgard instances.

**4.2 Permission Policy Analysis (Example)**

Using the AWS CLI, we retrieve the policies attached to `Asgard-EC2-Role`:

```bash
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name Asgard-EC2-Role
```

Let's assume this command reveals the following attached policies:

*   `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess`
*   `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`
*   `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`
*   `CustomPolicy-AsgardSpecific` (A custom policy we'll need to examine separately)

We then retrieve the policy documents themselves:

```bash
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn <ARN of CustomPolicy-AsgardSpecific> # Get the ARN from the previous command's output
```

We then examine the JSON policy documents.  We find that `AmazonEC2FullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess` grant extremely broad permissions, as their names suggest. `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess` is likely necessary for logging, but we'll confirm.  We need to carefully analyze `CustomPolicy-AsgardSpecific`.

**4.3 Asgard Functionality Mapping**

Based on Asgard's documentation and source code, we determine that Asgard *primarily* needs the following permissions:

*   **EC2:**
    *   `ec2:DescribeInstances`
    *   `ec2:StartInstances`
    *   `ec2:StopInstances`
    *   `ec2:TerminateInstances`
    *   `ec2:CreateTags`
    *   `ec2:DescribeImages`
    *   `ec2:RunInstances`
    *   `ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups`
    *   `ec2:DescribeKeyPairs`
    *   `autoscaling:*` (Permissions related to Auto Scaling Groups)
    *   `elasticloadbalancing:*` (Permissions related to Elastic Load Balancers)
*   **CloudWatch:**
    *   `logs:CreateLogGroup`
    *   `logs:CreateLogStream`
    *   `logs:PutLogEvents`
*   **IAM:** (Potentially, for limited actions like passing roles to EC2 instances)
    *   `iam:PassRole` (Strictly scoped to specific roles)

**4.4 Gap Analysis**

Comparing the granted permissions (4.2) with the required permissions (4.3), we identify significant gaps:

*   **`AmazonEC2FullAccess`:**  Grants *far* more EC2 permissions than needed.  This includes permissions to modify security groups, network interfaces, create/delete volumes, and much more, which Asgard doesn't require.
*   **`AmazonS3FullAccess`:**  Grants full access to all S3 buckets.  Asgard does *not* need any S3 access for its core functionality. This is a major security risk.
*   **`CustomPolicy-AsgardSpecific`:**  Needs further analysis.  It might contain necessary, narrowly scoped permissions, or it might introduce further risks.

**4.5 Exploitation Scenario Development**

*   **Scenario 1: S3 Data Exfiltration:** An attacker compromises the Asgard application (e.g., through a separate vulnerability like an unpatched library).  Because the Asgard IAM role has `AmazonS3FullAccess`, the attacker can use the compromised Asgard instance to list all S3 buckets in the AWS account, download sensitive data, or even delete/modify data in those buckets.
*   **Scenario 2: EC2 Instance Manipulation:**  An attacker, using the compromised Asgard instance, leverages `AmazonEC2FullAccess` to create new EC2 instances with malicious configurations (e.g., installing cryptocurrency miners, launching DDoS attacks), modify existing instances, or terminate critical instances, causing service disruption.
*   **Scenario 3: Privilege Escalation (if `iam:PassRole` is too broad):** If the `CustomPolicy-AsgardSpecific` or another policy grants overly permissive `iam:PassRole` permissions, the attacker could create a new EC2 instance and attach a highly privileged role to it, effectively escalating their privileges within the AWS account.
*  **Scenario 4: Security Group Modification:** An attacker could use `ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` and `ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress` (granted by `AmazonEC2FullAccess`) to open ports on the Asgard instances or other instances in the environment, creating new attack vectors.

**4.6 Mitigation Recommendation**

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Replace `AmazonEC2FullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess` with custom IAM policies that grant *only* the minimum necessary permissions identified in section 4.3.
2.  **Remove Unnecessary Policies:**  Completely remove `AmazonS3FullAccess` as Asgard does not require S3 access.
3.  **Refine Custom Policy:**  Thoroughly review and refine `CustomPolicy-AsgardSpecific` to ensure it adheres to the principle of least privilege.  Remove any unnecessary permissions.
4.  **Regular Audits:**  Implement a process for regularly auditing IAM roles and policies associated with Asgard (and all applications) to identify and remediate overly permissive configurations.  This should be automated as much as possible.
5.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Define IAM roles and policies using IaC (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform). This allows for version control, peer review, and automated deployment of security-hardened configurations.
6.  **IAM Access Analyzer:** Utilize AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify resources with overly permissive access and generate least-privilege policies.
7. **GuardDuty:** Enable AWS GuardDuty for continuous monitoring of suspicious activity related to IAM roles and other AWS resources.

**4.7 Tooling Identification**

*   **AWS IAM Access Analyzer:**  Helps identify resources with public or cross-account access and generates least-privilege policies.
*   **AWS CloudTrail:**  Logs all API calls made to AWS services, allowing for auditing and forensic analysis.
*   **AWS Config:**  Provides a detailed inventory of AWS resources and their configurations, enabling tracking of changes to IAM policies.
*   **Cloud Custodian:**  An open-source rules engine for managing cloud resources, including identifying and remediating security issues like overly permissive IAM roles.
*   **Prowler:**  An open-source security tool to perform AWS security best practices assessments, audits, incident response, and continuous monitoring.
*   **Terraform/CloudFormation (IaC):**  For defining and managing IAM roles and policies in a consistent and auditable manner.
*   **Netflix Security Monkey:** (Although deprecated, its principles and some of its code might be adaptable) - Designed to monitor and analyze AWS configurations for security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

The attack tree path "Broad AWS Permissions" represents a significant security risk for Asgard deployments.  By granting excessive permissions to the Asgard IAM role, the organization exposes itself to a wide range of potential attacks, including data breaches, service disruption, and privilege escalation.  Implementing the mitigation recommendations outlined in this analysis, particularly adhering to the principle of least privilege and utilizing automated security tooling, is crucial to reducing the attack surface and improving the overall security posture of the Asgard application and the broader AWS environment. Continuous monitoring and regular audits are essential to maintain a secure configuration over time.
