Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Default Asgard Credentials" attack tree path, structured as you requested, suitable for a cybersecurity expert working with a development team.

## Deep Analysis: Default Asgard Credentials Attack Path

### 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Default Asgard Credentials" attack path, identify potential vulnerabilities, assess the likelihood and impact of a successful attack, and recommend specific, actionable mitigation strategies to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk.  This analysis aims to provide the development team with the information needed to prioritize and implement security improvements.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Application:**  Applications deployed and managed using Netflix Asgard (specifically, the version currently in use by the development team, which should be explicitly stated here, e.g., "Asgard v1.10.0").  We assume Asgard is used for its intended purpose: deploying and managing applications on AWS.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker attempting to gain unauthorized access using default credentials.  This includes both:
    *   **Direct Access:**  Attempting to log in to the Asgard web interface directly.
    *   **API Access:**  Attempting to use default credentials with Asgard's API.
*   **Attacker Profile:**  We will consider both external attackers (with no prior access) and internal attackers (e.g., disgruntled employees or contractors with limited network access).  The primary focus will be on external attackers, as they represent the broader threat.
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors against Asgard (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, vulnerabilities in underlying AWS services).  It is solely focused on the default credentials issue.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**
    *   Review Asgard documentation (official documentation, community forums, known issue trackers) to identify any documented default credentials.
    *   Examine the Asgard source code (from the specific version in use) to identify how credentials are initialized and stored.  Look for any hardcoded defaults.
    *   If feasible and ethically permissible (e.g., in a test environment), attempt to access a fresh Asgard installation using commonly known default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin", "admin/password").
2.  **Likelihood Assessment:**
    *   Evaluate the ease with which an attacker could discover the Asgard instance (e.g., exposed to the public internet, discoverable via internal network scans).
    *   Assess the prevalence of default credential usage in real-world deployments (based on publicly available data, security reports, and industry best practices).
    *   Consider the attacker's motivation and resources.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   Determine the level of access granted by the default credentials.  What actions can an attacker perform if they successfully authenticate? (e.g., deploy malicious applications, modify existing deployments, access sensitive data, delete resources).
    *   Quantify the potential damage (financial loss, reputational damage, data breaches, service disruption).
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**
    *   Propose specific, actionable steps to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability.  These should be prioritized based on effectiveness and feasibility.
    *   Provide clear instructions for implementing the recommendations, including code examples, configuration changes, and verification steps.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**
    *   After implementing the mitigations, reassess the remaining risk.  Is it acceptable, or are further measures required?

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: [B2b] Default Asgard Credentials

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Identification

*   **Documentation Review:**  The Asgard documentation *should* explicitly state that there are NO default credentials and that the administrator MUST set credentials during initial setup.  However, older versions or forks of Asgard might have had defaults.  We need to verify this for the *specific version in use*.  Crucially, the documentation should emphasize the importance of strong, unique passwords.
*   **Source Code Review:**  Examine the Asgard source code (specifically, files related to authentication, user management, and initial setup).  Look for:
    *   Hardcoded usernames and passwords.
    *   Default values assigned to configuration files (e.g., `asgard.properties`).
    *   Logic that skips credential checks if certain conditions are met.
    *   Any mechanism that might allow bypassing authentication.
    *   Areas where environment variables are used for credentials (and check for default values).
*   **Practical Testing (Test Environment ONLY):**  Deploy a fresh instance of Asgard in a *sandboxed, isolated test environment*.  Attempt to log in using common default credentials:
    *   `admin/admin`
    *   `admin/password`
    *   `asgard/asgard`
    *   `root/root`
    *   (and any others found during documentation/code review)
    *   Attempt to access the Asgard API using these credentials (using tools like `curl` or Postman).

#### 4.2 Likelihood Assessment

*   **Discoverability:**
    *   **High:** If Asgard is exposed to the public internet without proper network segmentation or firewall rules, it's highly discoverable.  Attackers routinely scan for exposed web applications.
    *   **Medium:** If Asgard is only accessible within an internal network, the likelihood is lower, but still present.  Internal attackers or compromised internal systems could attempt to exploit it.
*   **Prevalence of Default Credentials:**
    *   **Historically High, Decreasing:**  Default credentials have been a common problem in many applications.  While awareness is increasing, it's still a significant risk, especially with older software or less security-conscious deployments.
    *   **Specific to Asgard:**  We need to research if there are any known cases of Asgard deployments being compromised due to default credentials.  This can be done through vulnerability databases (CVE), security blogs, and incident reports.
*   **Attacker Motivation:**  Attackers are highly motivated to gain access to cloud management tools like Asgard.  The potential payoff (control over cloud resources) is significant.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

*   **Access Level:**  If default credentials exist and provide administrative access, the attacker gains *complete control* over Asgard and, consequently, the AWS resources it manages.
*   **Potential Actions:**
    *   **Deploy Malicious Applications:**  The attacker could deploy applications containing malware, backdoors, or cryptominers.
    *   **Modify Existing Deployments:**  The attacker could inject malicious code into existing applications, steal data, or disrupt services.
    *   **Access Sensitive Data:**  Asgard likely has access to AWS credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.  The attacker could steal this data.
    *   **Delete Resources:**  The attacker could delete applications, databases, and other critical infrastructure.
    *   **Launch Further Attacks:**  The compromised Asgard instance could be used as a launching point for attacks against other systems.
*   **Damage Quantification:**
    *   **Financial Loss:**  Significant, due to resource consumption by malicious applications, data recovery costs, and potential fines.
    *   **Reputational Damage:**  Severe, especially if a data breach occurs.
    *   **Service Disruption:**  Complete outage of applications managed by Asgard.
    *   **Data Breaches:**  Loss of sensitive customer data, intellectual property, or internal company information.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendations

These recommendations are prioritized based on effectiveness and feasibility:

1.  **Mandatory Credential Change on First Login (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Modify the Asgard setup process to *force* the administrator to set a strong, unique password during the initial configuration.  Do *not* allow the application to function until this is done.  This should be enforced at the code level, not just in the documentation.
    *   **Verification:**  Test the setup process thoroughly to ensure that it's impossible to bypass the credential change requirement.
    *   **Code Example (Illustrative - Adapt to Asgard's Codebase):**
        ```java
        // In the initialization logic:
        if (isFirstRun() && !credentialsAreSet()) {
          forcePasswordChange(); // Redirect to a mandatory password change page
          disableAllFunctionality(); // Prevent any other actions
        }
        ```
2.  **Strong Password Requirements:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Enforce strong password policies:
        *   Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters).
        *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
        *   Password strength meter (provide feedback to the user).
        *   Block common passwords (use a dictionary of known weak passwords).
    *   **Verification:**  Test the password change functionality to ensure that weak passwords are rejected.
3.  **No Hardcoded Credentials:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Thoroughly review the codebase and remove *any* instances of hardcoded credentials.  Use configuration files or environment variables instead.
    *   **Verification:**  Use static analysis tools to scan the codebase for potential hardcoded credentials.
4.  **Secure Configuration Management:**
    *   **Implementation:**  If using configuration files (e.g., `asgard.properties`), ensure they are:
        *   Stored securely (not in publicly accessible directories).
        *   Protected with appropriate file permissions.
        *   Encrypted if they contain sensitive data.
    *   **Verification:**  Regularly audit configuration files for security vulnerabilities.
5.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **Implementation:**  Integrate 2FA (e.g., using TOTP) to add an extra layer of security.  This makes it much harder for an attacker to gain access, even if they have the password.
    *   **Verification:**  Test the 2FA implementation thoroughly.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Implementation:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Asgard deployment, including penetration testing and code reviews.
    *   **Verification:**  Document the audit findings and track the remediation of any identified vulnerabilities.
7.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *  Ensure that the Asgard service account itself has only the minimum necessary permissions within AWS.  Don't grant it overly broad access.

#### 4.5 Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing the above mitigations (especially mandatory credential change and 2FA), the residual risk is significantly reduced.  However, it's not zero.  Potential remaining risks include:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Undiscovered vulnerabilities in Asgard or its dependencies could still be exploited.
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker could trick an administrator into revealing their credentials.
*   **Compromised Administrator Workstation:**  If an administrator's computer is compromised, the attacker could gain access to Asgard.

To further mitigate these residual risks, consider:

*   **Continuous Monitoring:**  Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Train administrators on security best practices, including how to recognize and avoid phishing attacks.
*   **Regular Patching:**  Keep Asgard and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Default Asgard Credentials" attack path represents a significant security risk.  By implementing the recommended mitigations, the development team can dramatically reduce the likelihood and impact of a successful attack.  Continuous monitoring, regular security audits, and a strong security culture are essential for maintaining a secure Asgard deployment. The most crucial step is to enforce a mandatory, strong password change upon initial setup, eliminating the possibility of default credentials being used.
