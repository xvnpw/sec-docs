# Deep Analysis of Asgard Attack Tree Path: Overly Permissive IAM Roles

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with overly permissive IAM roles assigned to Asgard, identify potential exploitation scenarios, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to reduce the attack surface and enhance the overall security posture of the Asgard deployment.  We aim to move beyond a general understanding of the risk and delve into specific, actionable details.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target:**  The Asgard application instance and its associated AWS IAM role.  We are *not* analyzing the security of the underlying EC2 instances *except* as they are directly impacted by the Asgard IAM role's permissions.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The specific vulnerability of "Overly Permissive IAM Roles" ([B1] in the attack tree). We are assuming this vulnerability exists.
*   **Threat Actors:**  We consider both external attackers (who might gain initial access through other vulnerabilities not covered in this path) and malicious insiders (who might abuse existing access).
*   **Impact:**  We will analyze the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AWS resources managed by or accessible to Asgard.
*   **Asgard Version:** We are assuming a relatively recent version of Asgard, but we will highlight any version-specific considerations if they are relevant.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **IAM Role Permission Review:**  We will hypothetically construct a "bad" IAM role (overly permissive) and a "good" IAM role (least privilege) for Asgard.  This will involve examining the Asgard documentation and source code (specifically, areas that interact with AWS APIs) to determine the *minimum* necessary permissions.
2.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:**  Based on the "bad" IAM role, we will develop concrete exploitation scenarios, detailing how an attacker could leverage the excessive permissions.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  For each exploitation scenario, we will assess the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Recommendation:**  We will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, including IAM policy adjustments, monitoring and alerting configurations, and potential code/configuration changes within Asgard.
5.  **Tooling Identification:** We will identify tools that can assist in identifying and remediating overly permissive IAM roles.

## 4. Deep Analysis of [B1] Overly Permissive IAM Roles

### 4.1. IAM Role Permission Review

Let's contrast a "bad" (overly permissive) IAM role with a "good" (least privilege) IAM role for Asgard.

**4.1.1. "Bad" IAM Role (Example - DO NOT USE)**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy grants `AdministratorAccess`, allowing Asgard (and any attacker who compromises it) to perform *any* action on *any* AWS resource in the account. This is the worst-case scenario.  A slightly less egregious, but still dangerous, example might grant full access to specific services:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "s3:*",
        "rds:*",
        "iam:*",
        "cloudformation:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This grants full control over EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, and CloudFormation.  While seemingly more restricted, it still provides a massive attack surface.

**4.1.2. "Good" IAM Role (Example - Requires Refinement)**

A least-privilege IAM role for Asgard requires careful analysis of Asgard's functionality.  Here's a *starting point*, which *must* be refined based on your specific Asgard usage and AWS environment:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeImages",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "ec2:CreateTags",
        "ec2:DeleteTags",
        "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute",
        "autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups",
        "autoscaling:DescribeLaunchConfigurations",
        "autoscaling:CreateAutoScalingGroup",
        "autoscaling:UpdateAutoScalingGroup",
        "autoscaling:DeleteAutoScalingGroup",
        "autoscaling:CreateLaunchConfiguration",
        "autoscaling:DeleteLaunchConfiguration",
        "autoscaling:SetDesiredCapacity",
        "autoscaling:TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
        "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer",
        "elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterInstancesFromLoadBalancer",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
        "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
        "sns:Publish"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-asgard-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-asgard-bucket/*"
      ]
    },
     {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::ANOTHERACCOUNTNUMBER:role/CrossAccountRoleName"
        }
  ]
}
```

**Key Improvements and Considerations:**

*   **Specific Actions:**  Instead of `ec2:*`, we list only the necessary EC2 actions (e.g., `DescribeInstances`, `RunInstances`, `TerminateInstances`).  This list *must* be derived from Asgard's code and documentation.
*   **Resource-Level Permissions:**  Where possible, we restrict access to specific resources.  For example, S3 access is limited to a specific bucket (`your-asgard-bucket`).  This is *crucial* for minimizing the blast radius.
*   **Auto Scaling Permissions:** Asgard heavily relies on Auto Scaling, so we include the necessary permissions.  Again, this list should be carefully reviewed.
*   **CloudWatch Permissions:**  Asgard likely needs to read CloudWatch metrics for monitoring and scaling.
*   **SNS Permissions:** If Asgard uses SNS for notifications, we include `sns:Publish`.  The resource should be restricted to specific SNS topics.
*   **Cross-Account Access (Example):** The `sts:AssumeRole` permission is included as an example.  If Asgard needs to access resources in *another* AWS account, you'll need to use `AssumeRole` and configure the appropriate trust relationships.  This is a common pattern for multi-account deployments.
* **Missing Permissions:** This is a *starting point*. It is highly likely that this policy is *incomplete*. You *must* thoroughly test Asgard with this policy and add permissions *only as needed*. Use AWS CloudTrail to identify any permission errors during testing.

### 4.2. Exploitation Scenarios

Given the "bad" IAM role (either `AdministratorAccess` or the overly permissive service-specific example), here are some potential exploitation scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: Data Exfiltration (S3):**
    *   **Attacker Action:**  The attacker, having compromised Asgard, uses the `s3:*` permission to list all S3 buckets in the account and download sensitive data (customer data, backups, source code, etc.).
    *   **Impact:**  Severe confidentiality breach, potential regulatory fines, reputational damage.

*   **Scenario 2: Infrastructure Disruption (EC2/RDS):**
    *   **Attacker Action:**  The attacker uses `ec2:*` and `rds:*` to terminate running EC2 instances and RDS databases, causing a denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:**  Significant availability impact, business disruption, potential data loss (if backups are not properly configured).

*   **Scenario 3: Privilege Escalation (IAM):**
    *   **Attacker Action:**  The attacker uses `iam:*` to create a new IAM user with administrator privileges, granting them persistent access to the AWS account even if the Asgard vulnerability is patched.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete account compromise, long-term persistence, potential for further attacks.

*   **Scenario 4: Cryptocurrency Mining (EC2):**
    *   **Attacker Action:**  The attacker uses `ec2:*` to launch a large number of high-performance EC2 instances for cryptocurrency mining, incurring significant costs.
    *   **Impact:**  Financial loss, potential account suspension.

*   **Scenario 5: CloudFormation Stack Manipulation:**
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker uses `cloudformation:*` to modify or delete existing CloudFormation stacks, potentially disrupting critical infrastructure or deploying malicious resources.
    * **Impact:** Availability and integrity impact, depending on the affected stacks. Could lead to data loss or further compromise.

* **Scenario 6: Data Manipulation (RDS):**
    * **Attacker Action:** The attacker uses `rds:*` to modify data within RDS databases, potentially corrupting data, inserting malicious data, or stealing sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Integrity and confidentiality breach, potential for fraud or other malicious activities.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

| Scenario                     | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability | Overall Impact |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Data Exfiltration (S3)       | High            | Low       | Low          | Critical       |
| Infrastructure Disruption    | Low             | Low       | High         | Critical       |
| Privilege Escalation (IAM)   | High            | High      | High         | Critical       |
| Cryptocurrency Mining        | Low             | Low       | Medium       | High           |
| CloudFormation Manipulation | Medium          | High      | High         | Critical       |
| Data Manipulation (RDS)      | High            | High      | Medium       | Critical       |

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

1.  **Implement Least Privilege:**  This is the *most important* mitigation.  Use the "good" IAM role example as a starting point and refine it meticulously.  Use the principle of least privilege: grant *only* the permissions Asgard *absolutely needs*.

2.  **Regular IAM Audits:**  Conduct regular audits of the Asgard IAM role and all other IAM roles in your AWS account.  Use automated tools (see section 4.5) to identify overly permissive roles.

3.  **AWS CloudTrail Monitoring:**  Enable AWS CloudTrail and actively monitor it for any unusual API calls made by the Asgard IAM role.  Set up alerts for specific actions (e.g., `iam:CreateUser`, `s3:GetObject` on sensitive buckets).

4.  **AWS Config Rules:**  Use AWS Config Rules to continuously monitor your IAM policies and trigger alerts if they deviate from your defined baseline (e.g., if a policy grants `*` access).

5.  **IAM Access Analyzer:** Utilize AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify resources that are shared with external entities and to generate least-privilege policies based on access activity.

6.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Define your IAM roles and policies using Infrastructure as Code (e.g., CloudFormation, Terraform).  This allows for version control, peer review, and automated deployment, reducing the risk of manual errors.

7.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** While MFA doesn't directly protect the Asgard *role*, it's crucial for protecting IAM *users* who have the ability to modify the role.  Enforce MFA for all IAM users with administrative privileges.

8.  **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing of your Asgard deployment to identify and address vulnerabilities.

9.  **Asgard Configuration Review:** Review Asgard's configuration files to ensure that they are not inadvertently exposing sensitive information or enabling unnecessary features.

10. **Assume Role for Cross-Account Access:** If Asgard needs to access resources in other AWS accounts, use the `AssumeRole` functionality instead of granting direct permissions. This allows for better control and auditing.

### 4.5. Tooling Identification

*   **AWS IAM Access Analyzer:**  Built-in AWS service for identifying unintended public and cross-account access.
*   **AWS CloudTrail:**  Logs all API calls made in your AWS account.
*   **AWS Config:**  Monitors the configuration of your AWS resources and can trigger alerts based on defined rules.
*   **Cloud Custodian:**  Open-source tool for managing cloud resources and enforcing policies.  Excellent for identifying and remediating overly permissive IAM roles.
*   **Prowler:**  Open-source security tool for AWS that performs various security checks, including IAM role analysis.
*   **Scout Suite:**  Multi-cloud security auditing tool that can identify misconfigurations, including overly permissive IAM roles.
*   **Terraform/CloudFormation:** Infrastructure as Code tools that can be used to manage IAM roles and policies in a controlled and auditable manner.
*   **Netflix Security Monkey:** Although deprecated, Security Monkey's principles and some of its code can still be valuable for understanding how to monitor and audit AWS configurations.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Overly Permissive IAM Roles" vulnerability is a critical risk for any Asgard deployment.  By implementing the principle of least privilege, conducting regular audits, and leveraging the recommended tools and mitigation strategies, you can significantly reduce the attack surface and improve the security posture of your Asgard application and your overall AWS environment.
