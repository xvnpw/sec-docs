# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for netflix/asgard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Asgard Users](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_asgard_users.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Integrate Asgard with an Identity Provider (IdP) that supports MFA (e.g., AWS IAM, Okta, Active Directory). Asgard's authentication mechanism should be configured to delegate to this IdP.
    2.  Enable MFA within the chosen IdP for all user accounts that are granted access to Asgard.
    3.  Ensure Asgard's authentication configuration is correctly set up to enforce MFA during the login process. Verify that users are prompted for an MFA code after successful password authentication when accessing Asgard.
    4.  Provide clear instructions to Asgard users on how to configure MFA within the integrated IdP.
    5.  Regularly monitor Asgard login logs to confirm MFA is being enforced and used by all users.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Compromised Asgard User Credentials (High Severity) - Directly mitigates the risk of unauthorized Asgard access if user passwords are compromised.
    *   Asgard Account Takeover (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from taking control of Asgard user accounts, even with stolen passwords, protecting the central management platform.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromised Asgard User Credentials - High Risk Reduction
    *   Asgard Account Takeover - High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. MFA is enforced for some administrator roles within the integrated IdP used by Asgard.
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA needs to be universally enforced for *all* Asgard user roles via the integrated IdP to provide comprehensive protection across the platform.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Asgard User Roles within Asgard](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_asgard_user_roles_within_asgard.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Thoroughly review Asgard's built-in role-based access control (RBAC) system. Understand the default roles and permissions available within Asgard.
    2.  Define custom Asgard roles that precisely map to the required job functions of different user groups (e.g., deployment engineers, monitoring teams, security auditors).
    3.  Grant each Asgard user the *minimum* necessary role to perform their tasks within Asgard. Avoid assigning overly permissive roles like "admin" unless absolutely required.
    4.  Utilize Asgard's UI or API to assign users to their appropriate roles.
    5.  Regularly audit Asgard user role assignments and adjust permissions as user responsibilities change. Remove any unnecessary permissions.
    6.  Document the purpose and permissions associated with each Asgard role for clarity and maintainability.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation within Asgard (High Severity) - Limits the potential damage from compromised Asgard accounts by restricting user capabilities within the Asgard platform itself.
    *   Unauthorized Actions in AWS via Asgard (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of accidental or malicious unauthorized actions performed through Asgard's AWS management features due to overly broad user permissions.
    *   Lateral Movement within Asgard Managed Infrastructure (Medium Severity) - Restricts the scope of damage if an Asgard account is compromised, limiting the attacker's ability to manipulate infrastructure across the board.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Privilege Escalation within Asgard - High Risk Reduction
    *   Unauthorized Actions in AWS via Asgard - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Lateral Movement within Asgard Managed Infrastructure - Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic Asgard roles are used, but they are not finely grained, and some users may have more permissions than strictly necessary within Asgard.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Requires a detailed review and restructuring of Asgard roles to implement a true least privilege model. This involves creating more specific roles and carefully assigning users based on their actual needs within Asgard.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Network Access to the Asgard UI](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_network_access_to_the_asgard_ui.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure network firewalls or security groups to restrict access to the Asgard UI's network port (typically 80 or 443) to only authorized IP address ranges or networks.
    2.  If Asgard is hosted in AWS, utilize AWS Security Groups associated with the EC2 instance or Load Balancer running Asgard to enforce these network access restrictions.
    3.  Consider placing the Asgard UI behind a VPN or bastion host. Users would need to connect to the VPN or bastion host first before accessing the Asgard UI, adding an extra layer of network-level security.
    4.  Disable public internet access to the Asgard UI if it's not absolutely necessary for legitimate users.
    5.  Regularly review and update these network access control rules as network configurations evolve.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized External Access to Asgard UI (High Severity) - Prevents attackers on the public internet from directly reaching the Asgard UI and attempting to exploit vulnerabilities or brute-force login attempts.
    *   Exposure of Asgard Management Interface (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of exposing the Asgard management interface and potentially sensitive information to unauthorized individuals on the internet.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized External Access to Asgard UI - High Risk Reduction
    *   Exposure of Asgard Management Interface - Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Network access is restricted to some extent, but might not be limited to specific corporate networks or VPN ranges, potentially allowing broader access than desired.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs stricter network access controls specifically for the Asgard UI, limiting access to only trusted networks (e.g., corporate VPN, specific office IP ranges) using firewalls or security groups.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit Asgard User Accounts and Role Assignments](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_asgard_user_accounts_and_role_assignments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly) for auditing Asgard user accounts and their assigned roles within Asgard.
    2.  Generate reports from Asgard (if possible through UI or API) listing all active user accounts and their assigned Asgard roles.
    3.  Review the list of Asgard users and identify any accounts that are no longer needed (e.g., users who have left the organization or changed roles). Disable or remove these accounts from Asgard.
    4.  Verify that each active Asgard user is assigned the correct and least privileged role based on their current responsibilities related to Asgard and AWS management.
    5.  Document the audit process and any changes made to Asgard user accounts or role assignments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Stale Asgard User Accounts (Low Severity) - Eliminates inactive Asgard accounts that could become potential targets for compromise if not properly managed.
    *   Role Creep within Asgard (Low Severity) - Prevents users from accumulating unnecessary permissions within Asgard over time, ensuring adherence to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Unauthorized Asgard Access by Former Employees (Medium Severity) -  Removes access for individuals who should no longer have access to the Asgard platform.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Stale Asgard User Accounts - Low Risk Reduction
    *   Role Creep within Asgard - Low Risk Reduction
    *   Unauthorized Asgard Access by Former Employees - Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Regular audits of Asgard user accounts and roles are not currently performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to establish a defined process for regularly auditing Asgard user accounts and role assignments, including generating reports, reviewing user lists, and taking action to remove stale accounts and adjust roles.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden the Asgard Application Instance](./mitigation_strategies/harden_the_asgard_application_instance.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Apply security best practices to the operating system hosting the Asgard application (e.g., patching, disabling unnecessary services).
    2.  Specifically focus on hardening the Asgard application configuration itself. Review Asgard's configuration files and settings for any insecure defaults or potential vulnerabilities.
    3.  Ensure Asgard is running with the least privileged user account possible on the host operating system.
    4.  Disable any unnecessary features or plugins within Asgard that are not actively used.
    5.  Configure robust logging and auditing within Asgard to track security-relevant events and actions performed through the platform.
    6.  Keep the Asgard application updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the Asgard project.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Asgard Application Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Asgard application code or its dependencies.
    *   Compromise of Asgard Server (Medium Severity) - Hardening measures make it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to the server hosting Asgard, even if they bypass network security.
    *   Privilege Escalation on Asgard Server (Medium Severity) - Running Asgard with least privilege limits the impact if the application is compromised, preventing easy escalation to root or administrator privileges on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Asgard Application Vulnerabilities - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Compromise of Asgard Server - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation on Asgard Server - Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic OS patching is in place, but specific Asgard application hardening steps and configuration reviews are not regularly performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Requires a dedicated Asgard application hardening checklist and regular application-level vulnerability scanning. This should include reviewing Asgard's configuration, ensuring least privilege execution, and keeping the application updated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Asgard Configuration Files and Secrets Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_asgard_configuration_files_and_secrets_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all configuration files used by Asgard. These files may contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys for AWS or other services, and other secrets required for Asgard's operation.
    2.  Restrict file system permissions on Asgard configuration files to ensure only the Asgard application user and authorized administrators can read them. Prevent public access.
    3.  Avoid storing sensitive secrets directly in plain text within Asgard configuration files.
    4.  Utilize a secure secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage sensitive credentials used by Asgard.
    5.  Configure Asgard to retrieve secrets from the chosen secrets management solution at runtime instead of reading them directly from configuration files.
    6.  If Asgard configuration files must contain some sensitive data, consider encrypting them at rest.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Asgard Secrets (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive credentials if the Asgard server is compromised or configuration files are inadvertently exposed.
    *   Hardcoded Credentials in Asgard Configuration (High Severity) - Eliminates the risky practice of embedding secrets directly in configuration files, which can be easily discovered if access is gained.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Asgard Secrets - High Risk Reduction
    *   Hardcoded Credentials in Asgard Configuration - High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. File permissions are restricted, but secrets are currently stored as environment variables or in configuration files, not using a dedicated secrets management solution.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to fully implement a secure secrets management solution for Asgard. Migrate all sensitive credentials out of configuration files and environment variables into the secrets manager and configure Asgard to retrieve them securely.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Asgard Infrastructure](./mitigation_strategies/implement_infrastructure-as-code__iac__for_asgard_infrastructure.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Use an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) to define and manage the infrastructure components that Asgard relies on (e.g., EC2 instances, load balancers, databases, networking).
    2.  Store the IaC code in a version control system (e.g., Git).
    3.  Use automated pipelines to deploy and update the Asgard infrastructure from the IaC code. Avoid manual infrastructure provisioning or configuration.
    4.  Define security configurations within the IaC code (e.g., security groups, network ACLs, instance hardening settings) to ensure consistent and secure infrastructure deployments for Asgard.
    5.  Implement code review processes for all changes to the IaC code before deployment to catch potential security misconfigurations early.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Asgard Infrastructure Misconfiguration (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of manual configuration errors leading to security weaknesses in the infrastructure supporting Asgard.
    *   Configuration Drift in Asgard Infrastructure (Medium Severity) - Ensures that the Asgard infrastructure remains consistently configured and secure over time by preventing configuration drift.
    *   Inconsistent Asgard Environments (Low Severity) - IaC helps ensure consistent security configurations across different Asgard environments (development, staging, production).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Asgard Infrastructure Misconfiguration - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Configuration Drift in Asgard Infrastructure - Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Inconsistent Asgard Environments - Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Infrastructure provisioning is partially scripted, but not fully managed by a dedicated IaC tool. Security configurations are not consistently defined in code.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Needs to fully adopt an IaC approach to manage all Asgard infrastructure components and their security configurations. Migrate existing infrastructure definitions to IaC code and establish automated deployment pipelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring of Asgard Application Activity](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_logging_and_monitoring_of_asgard_application_activity.md)

*   **Description:**
