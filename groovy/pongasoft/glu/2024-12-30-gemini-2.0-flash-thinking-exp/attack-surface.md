Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Glu, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Parameter Injection via Glu Annotations:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate input parameters passed through HTTP requests to inject malicious code or data, leading to unintended actions.
    *   **How Glu Contributes:** Glu uses annotations like `@QueryParam`, `@PathParam`, `@HeaderParam`, `@FormParam`, and `@Body` to map HTTP request parameters to Java method arguments. If the application doesn't sanitize or validate data received through these annotations, it becomes vulnerable. Glu's direct mapping facilitates the flow of unsanitized input into the application logic.
    *   **Example:** A method annotated with `@GET @Path("/users/{id}")` and a parameter annotated with `@PathParam("id") String userId`. If `userId` is directly used in a database query without sanitization, an attacker could inject SQL code by sending a request like `/users/1'; DROP TABLE users; --`.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data corruption, or even remote code execution depending on the context where the injected data is used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the impact of successful injection).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation for all parameters received through Glu annotations.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Encode output data appropriately to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
        *   Sanitize input data to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences.
        *   Use a dedicated validation library to enforce data constraints.

*   **Unintended Method Exposure:**
    *   **Description:** Internal or sensitive Java methods are unintentionally exposed as HTTP endpoints due to improper use of Glu annotations.
    *   **How Glu Contributes:** Glu automatically exposes any public Java method annotated with HTTP method annotations (e.g., `@GET`, `@POST`) as an accessible endpoint. If developers are not careful about which methods they annotate, they can inadvertently expose sensitive functionality.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally annotates an internal utility method responsible for administrative tasks with `@POST @Path("/admin/utility")`. An attacker could discover this endpoint and potentially execute administrative functions without proper authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, data manipulation, or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed method).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review all methods annotated with Glu's HTTP method annotations.
        *   Ensure only methods intended for external access are annotated.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to endpoints.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing API endpoints.

*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities via `@Body`:**
    *   **Description:** When using `@Body` to receive request payloads (e.g., JSON, XML), vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization libraries can be exploited, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **How Glu Contributes:** Glu often relies on libraries like Jackson (for JSON) or JAXB (for XML) to deserialize the request body into Java objects when using the `@Body` annotation. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities or are misconfigured, attackers can send malicious payloads that trigger code execution during deserialization.
    *   **Example:** A method annotated with `@POST @Path("/process")` and a parameter annotated with `@Body MyObject data`. If the Jackson library used for deserializing `MyObject` has a known deserialization vulnerability, an attacker could send a crafted JSON payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the deserialization libraries (e.g., Jackson, JAXB) updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly.
        *   Implement object input stream filtering or other security mechanisms provided by the deserialization library.
        *   Consider alternative data formats or serialization methods if deserialization vulnerabilities are a significant concern.

*   **Path Traversal via `@PathParam`:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate path parameters received through `@PathParam` to access files or resources outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Glu Contributes:** Glu directly maps values from the URL path to method parameters using `@PathParam`. If these path parameters are used to construct file paths or access resources without proper validation, it can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A method annotated with `@GET @Path("/files/{filename}")` and a parameter annotated with `@PathParam("filename") String filename`. If `filename` is used to read a file without proper validation, an attacker could send a request like `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files or resources, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of path parameters.
        *   Avoid directly using path parameters to construct file paths.
        *   Use canonicalization techniques to resolve relative paths.
        *   Implement access controls to restrict access to specific files or directories.
