# Attack Surface Analysis for pongasoft/glu

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting critical weaknesses in how Glu parses configuration files (YAML, JSON, etc.) leading to severe consequences.
* **Glu Contribution:** Glu's reliance on configuration files for defining core application components (routes, services, dependencies) makes vulnerabilities in its parsing mechanism a direct and critical attack vector.
* **Example:** A maliciously crafted YAML configuration file exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in Glu's YAML parser could allow an attacker to achieve **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** on the server during application startup. Another example is injecting malicious configuration that bypasses schema validation and injects a rogue service.
* **Impact:** **Critical:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, complete compromise of the application and server.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Mandatory Robust Parsers:** Glu framework developers **must** use extremely robust, memory-safe, and actively maintained parsing libraries for configuration files.
    * **Strict Schema Validation (Enforced by Glu):** Glu should enforce mandatory and rigorous schema validation for all configuration files, preventing unexpected or malicious structures.
    * **Input Sanitization (Post-Parsing):**  Glu should internally sanitize and validate configuration data after parsing, before it's used to configure the application, to catch any parser bypasses or subtle injection attempts.
    * **Sandboxed Configuration Loading (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider sandboxing the configuration loading process to limit the impact of potential parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Injection (DI) Container Exploits](./attack_surfaces/dependency_injection__di__container_exploits.md)

* **Description:**  Critical vulnerabilities arising from the exploitation of Glu's Dependency Injection (DI) container, allowing attackers to gain significant control over application behavior.
* **Glu Contribution:** Glu's core architecture is built upon its DI container.  Critical flaws in the container's design or implementation directly translate to critical vulnerabilities in Glu applications.
* **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious configuration that leverages a vulnerability in Glu's DI container to **inject an arbitrary service factory**. This factory, when instantiated by Glu, executes attacker-controlled code, leading to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.  Alternatively, exploiting a service overriding vulnerability could allow replacing a critical security service with a compromised one, leading to complete application takeover.
* **Impact:** **Critical:** Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, Data Breach, complete compromise of application logic and data.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure DI Container Design (Fundamental):** Glu framework developers **must** prioritize security in the fundamental design of the DI container. This includes preventing unintended service injection, strictly controlling service instantiation, and robust access control within the container.
    * **Prevent Service Overriding (by Default):** Glu should, by default, prevent service overriding unless explicitly and securely configured. Overriding should require strong authentication and authorization.
    * **No Deserialization of Untrusted Data in DI Configuration:** Glu's DI configuration **must not** involve deserialization of untrusted data, as this is a common source of critical vulnerabilities.
    * **Security Audits of DI Container:**  Regular and thorough security audits of Glu's DI container implementation are crucial to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Handling and Lifecycle Issues (Leading to Critical DoS)](./attack_surfaces/resource_handling_and_lifecycle_issues__leading_to_critical_dos_.md)

* **Description:**  Exploitable flaws in Glu's resource handling and service lifecycle management that can be leveraged to cause a **Critical Denial of Service (DoS)**.
* **Glu Contribution:** Glu is responsible for managing the lifecycle of services and resources within an application.  Critical vulnerabilities in this management can be directly exploited to bring down Glu-based applications.
* **Example:** An attacker sends a carefully crafted series of requests that exploit a vulnerability in Glu's service instantiation logic. This triggers uncontrolled and excessive instantiation of expensive resources (e.g., database connection pools, external API clients) leading to **complete resource exhaustion and a critical Denial of Service**. The application becomes unresponsive and potentially crashes the server.
* **Impact:** **High to Critical:** Denial of Service, application unavailability, potential infrastructure instability.  Severity becomes Critical if the DoS is easily triggered and has a wide-ranging impact.
* **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on ease of exploitation and impact).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Robust Resource Limits and Quotas (Enforced by Glu):** Glu framework **must** provide and enforce robust mechanisms for setting resource limits and quotas on service instantiation and resource consumption.
    * **Circuit Breakers and Rate Limiting (Framework Level):** Glu should incorporate framework-level circuit breakers and rate limiting to prevent cascading failures and resource exhaustion due to malicious or unexpected traffic.
    * **Asynchronous and Non-Blocking Operations (Core Design):** Glu's core design should heavily favor asynchronous and non-blocking operations to efficiently handle requests and prevent resource starvation under load.
    * **Thorough Resource Leak Testing:**  Rigorous testing for resource leaks in Glu's core and example services is essential to prevent long-term resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.

This refined list highlights the most critical attack surfaces directly introduced by the Glu framework. Addressing these areas with robust security measures is paramount for building secure applications with Glu. Remember that this is not an exhaustive list and ongoing security vigilance is always necessary.
