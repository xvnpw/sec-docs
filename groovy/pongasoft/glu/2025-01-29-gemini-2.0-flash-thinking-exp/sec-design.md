# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To provide a configuration management and orchestration tool that simplifies the deployment and management of applications and infrastructure across various environments.
 - Priority: Ease of use and flexibility for developers and operations teams to manage configurations and automate tasks.
 - Priority: Reliability and consistency in configuration management to reduce errors and ensure predictable deployments.
 - Priority: Support for diverse environments, including cloud and on-premises infrastructure.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Misconfiguration leading to service disruptions or security vulnerabilities due to errors in configuration management.
 - Risk: Unauthorized access to configuration data or orchestration capabilities, potentially leading to system compromise.
 - Risk: Inconsistent state management across environments causing application failures or unexpected behavior.
 - Risk: Lack of auditability and traceability of configuration changes, hindering troubleshooting and compliance efforts.
 - Risk: Vendor lock-in if the tool becomes too tightly integrated with specific infrastructure or platforms.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code reviews are likely performed as part of the development process (standard practice for open-source projects on GitHub). Implemented in: Development process, GitHub pull requests.
 - security control: Version control using Git. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Dependency management using Maven (based on pom.xml). Implemented in: Build process.
 - security control:  Likely uses standard Java security practices for the application itself. Implemented in: Application code.
 - security control:  Relies on underlying infrastructure security for deployment environments (e.g., cloud provider security, on-premises network security). Implemented in: Deployment environment.

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching (typical for open-source projects).
 - accepted risk: Potential delay in security patch availability compared to commercial solutions.
 - accepted risk: Security of deployment environment is assumed to be managed separately by the user.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
 - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the CI/CD pipeline to manage and monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Introduce signed releases of artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity of distributed software.
 - security control: Provide guidance and documentation on secure configuration practices for users of the tool.
 - security control: Implement robust logging and auditing of configuration changes and orchestration activities.
 - security control:  Consider adding features for secrets management to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in configurations.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - requirement:  The tool should support authentication mechanisms to control access to configuration management and orchestration functionalities.
  - requirement:  Consider supporting multiple authentication methods (e.g., username/password, API keys, integration with identity providers).
 - Authorization:
  - requirement:  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and restrict access to specific configurations and actions based on roles.
  - requirement:  Authorization should be enforced at multiple levels, including access to the application itself and access to specific configuration resources.
 - Input Validation:
  - requirement:  All user inputs, including configuration data and orchestration commands, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, YAML injection).
  - requirement:  Input validation should be performed on both the client-side (if applicable) and server-side.
 - Cryptography:
  - requirement:  Sensitive data at rest (e.g., configuration secrets) should be encrypted.
  - requirement:  Communication channels used for configuration management and orchestration should be encrypted (e.g., HTTPS).
  - requirement:  Consider using cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity of configuration data.
