## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Glu-Based Application (Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_glu-based_application__root_goal_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized control over the application utilizing Glu. Success at this root goal implies significant security breach.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Full control over the application, data breach, service disruption, reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2___high-risk_path__exploit_configuration_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target weaknesses in how Glu loads its configuration. Successful exploitation allows manipulation of the application's behavior through modified configuration.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Supply Malicious Configuration File:**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Attacker gains write access to configuration file location:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker needs to obtain write permissions to the directory where Glu reads configuration files.
            *   **Action:** Exploit operating system or application vulnerabilities (e.g., directory traversal, insecure file permissions, application-specific upload flaws) to gain write access.
            *   **Impact:** High - Allows direct replacement of configuration files.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Configuration Injection via Input:**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses in Application:**
            *   **Description:** The application might use user-controlled inputs to construct paths or values used by Glu for configuration loading. Insufficient input validation can be exploited.
            *   **Action:** Identify application inputs that influence configuration loading. Inject malicious paths (e.g., "../../../malicious.yaml") or values to load attacker-controlled configuration files or manipulate configuration parameters.
            *   **Impact:** Medium/High - Can lead to loading malicious configuration or altering application behavior.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Default Configuration Behavior:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit Glu's default configuration loading mechanisms (e.g., searching for configuration files in standard locations).
        *   **Action:** Understand Glu's default configuration file paths and classpath scanning behavior. Place malicious configuration files in these locations, hoping Glu will automatically load them.
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High - Can lead to loading malicious configuration if default locations are accessible and writable by the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3___high-risk_path__exploit_configuration_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in how Glu processes configuration data, particularly YAML/JSON parsing and property handling.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Code Execution via YAML/JSON Deserialization (if applicable):**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] YAML/JSON Parsing Vulnerabilities:**
            *   **Description:** If Glu or the underlying YAML/JSON library is vulnerable to deserialization attacks, malicious YAML/JSON payloads can be crafted to execute arbitrary code.
            *   **Action:** Investigate Glu's YAML/JSON handling and dependencies. If deserialization vulnerabilities are present, craft malicious YAML/JSON configuration data that, when parsed by Glu, triggers code execution.
            *   **Impact:** High - Arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Property Injection Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] YAML/JSON Parsing Vulnerabilities:** (Indirectly related, as configuration is parsed)
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Property Handling in Application Components:**
            *   **Description:** Application components using Glu-injected properties might be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection) if they handle configuration values insecurely.
            *   **Action:** Identify application components that use Glu-injected properties. Analyze how these properties are used. If insecure handling is found, manipulate configuration data to inject malicious payloads (e.g., SQL injection strings, command injection commands) via Glu configuration.
            *   **Impact:** Medium/High - Data breach, unauthorized access, command execution depending on the injection vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Injection (DI) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4___high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_injection__di__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target Glu's core functionality - Dependency Injection - to inject malicious components or exploit vulnerabilities in Glu's dependency management.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Malicious Component Injection:**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE - Potential] Control Component Class Name/Path via Configuration:**
            *   **Description:** If Glu allows specifying component class names or paths through configuration, attackers can inject malicious code by providing paths to attacker-controlled classes.
            *   **Action:** **[CRITICAL INVESTIGATION NEEDED]** Review Glu documentation and code to determine if class names or paths can be specified in configuration. If possible, craft malicious Java classes and configure Glu to load them.
            *   **Impact:** High - Arbitrary code execution, full application compromise.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Vulnerable Dependencies of Glu itself:**
        *   **Description:** Glu relies on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly compromise applications using Glu.
        *   **Action:** Perform dependency analysis of Glu. Monitor CVE databases for vulnerabilities in Glu's dependencies. If vulnerabilities are found, exploit them to compromise the application.
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High - Depends on the vulnerability and affected dependency, can range from DoS to code execution.
