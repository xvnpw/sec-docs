# Threat Model Analysis for pongasoft/glu

## Threat: [Configuration File Manipulation](./threats/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets the external Glu configuration files (e.g., XML, properties) that dictate how Glu injects dependencies. By gaining unauthorized access and modifying these files, the attacker can redefine dependency bindings within Glu. This allows them to substitute legitimate components with malicious ones, effectively hijacking the dependency injection process.  Exploitation could involve compromising file system security, exploiting web server vulnerabilities if configuration files are served, or social engineering to gain access to configuration storage.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, arbitrary code execution. By injecting malicious dependencies, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, leading to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
    *   **Glu Component Affected:** Glu Configuration Loading Mechanism (e.g., `GluXmlModuleLoader`, `GluPropertiesModuleLoader`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store Glu configuration files in protected locations with strict access controls. Use file system permissions to limit access to only necessary users and processes.
        *   **Configuration Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of Glu configuration files. This could involve using checksums, digital signatures, or other tamper-detection methods.
        *   **Externalize Sensitive Configuration:** Avoid storing sensitive data directly in configuration files. Utilize environment variables, secure vaults, or dedicated secrets management solutions for sensitive information referenced by Glu.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the configuration management process and access controls to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection via Resolution Manipulation](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection_via_resolution_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** If Glu is configured with overly flexible or dynamic dependency resolution mechanisms (e.g., relying heavily on naming conventions or patterns without strict validation), an attacker might be able to craft and introduce a malicious component that matches the resolution criteria. Glu could then inadvertently inject this malicious component instead of the intended legitimate dependency. This is more likely if custom resolvers or less strict configuration practices are employed.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, arbitrary code execution. Successful malicious dependency injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, or denial of service.
    *   **Glu Component Affected:** Glu Dependency Resolution and Injection Engine (`Injector`, `Module` definitions, custom resolvers if used)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicit Dependency Definitions:** Favor explicit and specific dependency definitions in Glu configuration. Avoid relying on overly broad or dynamic resolution patterns that could be easily manipulated.
        *   **Strict Classpath Control:** Maintain tight control over the application's classpath and the locations where Glu searches for dependencies. Limit the introduction of untrusted JARs or components.
        *   **Secure Custom Resolvers:** If custom dependency resolvers are necessary, ensure they are developed with security in mind and undergo thorough security review. Implement input validation and sanitization within custom resolvers.
        *   **Dependency Verification (if feasible):** Explore and implement dependency verification mechanisms (if available or custom implementable) to ensure that injected dependencies originate from trusted and expected sources.

## Threat: [Code Execution through Vulnerable Custom Providers/Factories](./threats/code_execution_through_vulnerable_custom_providersfactories.md)

*   **Description:** Glu's extensibility allows for custom providers and factories to be defined for dependency instantiation. If developers implement these custom providers or factories with vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure deserialization, command injection, or other code execution flaws within the custom logic), these vulnerabilities become exploitable during Glu's dependency injection process. An attacker could potentially trigger these vulnerabilities by influencing the conditions under which these custom providers/factories are invoked or by manipulating input data passed to them during instantiation.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity compromise, arbitrary code execution. Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom providers/factories can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing for complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
    *   **Glu Component Affected:** Glu Custom Providers and Factories (`Provider` interface implementations, factory methods within modules)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices for Custom Components:** Enforce secure coding practices during the development of custom providers and factories. Pay close attention to input validation, output encoding, and avoid known vulnerability patterns like insecure deserialization or command injection.
        *   **Thorough Security Review and Testing:** Conduct rigorous security reviews and penetration testing specifically targeting custom provider and factory code.
        *   **Minimize Custom Code Complexity:** Keep custom provider and factory logic as simple and minimal as possible to reduce the attack surface and potential for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Prefer Built-in Glu Features:** Whenever feasible, utilize Glu's built-in features and standard dependency injection patterns to minimize the need for complex custom code, thereby reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
