## 6. Data Flow

The primary data flow within a Glu application centers around interactions between modules, orchestrated by the Glu Core.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant "'Module A'" as ModuleA
    participant "'Glu Core'" as GluCore
    participant "'Module B'" as ModuleB
    participant "'Configuration Service'" as ConfigService
    participant "'Logging Service'" as LoggingService

    ModuleA->>GluCore: Request Service from ModuleB
    activate GluCore
    GluCore->>GluCore: Lookup Service Provider for ModuleB
    GluCore->>ModuleB: Invoke Service Method
    activate ModuleB
    ModuleB-->>GluCore: Return Result
    deactivate ModuleB
    GluCore-->>ModuleA: Return Result
    deactivate GluCore

    ModuleA->>ConfigService: Request Configuration Parameter
    activate ConfigService
    ConfigService-->>ModuleA: Return Configuration Value
    deactivate ConfigService

    ModuleA->>LoggingService: Send Log Message
    activate LoggingService
    LoggingService-->>LoggingService: Process and Output Log
    deactivate LoggingService
```

**Detailed Data Flow Scenarios:**

* **Inter-Module Service Invocation:**
    1. A module (e.g., `ModuleA`) requires a service provided by another module (e.g., `ModuleB`).
    2. `ModuleA` sends a request to the `GluCore` to access the service.
    3. The `GluCore` utilizes its dependency injection mechanism to locate the appropriate instance of `ModuleB` that provides the requested service.
    4. The `GluCore` invokes the specified method on `ModuleB`.
    5. `ModuleB` processes the request and returns the result to the `GluCore`.
    6. The `GluCore` relays the result back to `ModuleA`.
* **Configuration Retrieval:**
    1. A module (e.g., `ModuleA`) needs to retrieve a configuration parameter.
    2. `ModuleA` sends a request to the `Configuration Service`.
    3. The `Configuration Service` retrieves the requested configuration value from its configured source.
    4. The `Configuration Service` returns the configuration value to `ModuleA`.
* **Logging:**
    1. A module (e.g., `ModuleA`) generates a log message.
    2. `ModuleA` sends the log message to the `Logging Service`.
    3. The `Logging Service` processes the log message, formats it according to its configuration, and outputs it to the configured destinations.

## 7. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

Prior to formal threat modeling, several critical security considerations emerge from the Glu architecture:

* **Robust Module Isolation:** Ensuring strong isolation between modules is paramount to prevent a compromised module from affecting other parts of the application. This includes:
    * **Classloader Isolation:** Utilizing separate classloaders for each module to prevent namespace collisions and unauthorized access to classes.
    * **Access Control Mechanisms:** Implementing mechanisms to control the resources and services that each module can access, limiting the potential impact of a compromised module.
* **Secure Dependency Management:** The process of resolving and loading module dependencies must be secured to prevent the introduction of malicious or vulnerable libraries:
    * **Dependency Verification:** Implementing mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of module dependencies, such as using checksums or digital signatures.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrating with vulnerability scanning tools to identify and prevent the use of known vulnerable dependencies.
* **Secure Inter-Module Communication:** Protecting communication channels between modules is crucial, especially when exchanging sensitive data:
    * **Encryption:** Employing encryption protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for communication channels to protect data in transit.
    * **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing mechanisms to authenticate communicating modules and authorize their access to specific services or data.
* **Configuration Service Security:** Securing the Configuration Service is vital to prevent unauthorized modification of application settings:
    * **Access Control:** Restricting access to the Configuration Service to authorized entities only.
    * **Encryption of Sensitive Data:** Encrypting sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit.
* **Logging Security Measures:** Protecting log data from unauthorized access and preventing the logging of sensitive information:
    * **Access Control for Log Data:** Restricting access to log files and logging infrastructure.
    * **Data Sanitization:** Implementing measures to sanitize log messages and prevent the inadvertent logging of sensitive data.
* **Module Lifecycle Security:** Securing the module loading and unloading processes is essential to prevent malicious module injection or tampering with legitimate modules:
    * **Signed Modules:** Requiring modules to be digitally signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
    * **Secure Module Loading Procedures:** Implementing secure mechanisms for loading modules, verifying their source and integrity.
* **Input Validation Across Modules:** Each module must rigorously validate inputs received from other modules or external sources to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
* **Authentication and Authorization Framework:** Implementing a comprehensive authentication and authorization framework to control access to application functionalities and resources at the module level.

## 8. Assumptions and Constraints

* **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) Dependency:** Glu assumes the availability of a compatible JRE for execution.
* **Standard Module Packaging Format:** Modules are expected to be packaged in a standard format, such as JAR files.
