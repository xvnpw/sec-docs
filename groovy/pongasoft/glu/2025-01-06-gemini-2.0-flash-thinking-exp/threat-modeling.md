# Threat Model Analysis for pongasoft/glu

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection via Data Binding](./threats/malicious_data_injection_via_data_binding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might intercept or craft API responses from the server or manipulate client-side data sources before they are processed by Glu's data binding mechanisms. By injecting malicious data (e.g., specially crafted strings, unexpected data types), the attacker could cause unintended state changes, trigger errors, or potentially introduce client-side vulnerabilities if the data is used in a vulnerable way later in the application logic. This directly leverages Glu's data synchronization features.
    *   **Impact:** State corruption leading to unexpected application behavior, potential client-side script injection if the injected data is rendered without proper escaping, denial of service by causing application crashes or infinite loops.
    *   **Affected Component:** Glu's Data Binding mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on both the server-side before sending data to the client and on the client-side before updating the Glu state.
        *   Enforce strict data type checking and validation within Glu components when handling bound data.
        *   Avoid directly rendering user-controlled data without proper escaping using Glu's or other appropriate mechanisms.

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection leading to XSS](./threats/client-side_template_injection_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** If the application dynamically generates parts of the Glu templates based on user input or data received from the server without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code. When Glu renders this template, the injected code will be executed in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, or redirect them to malicious sites. This directly exploits how Glu handles and renders templates.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the application, or redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Affected Component:** Glu's Templating and Rendering engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before incorporating it into Glu templates. Utilize Glu's built-in mechanisms for safe rendering.
        *   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        *   Avoid constructing HTML strings manually and rely on Glu's templating engine with proper escaping.

## Threat: [Malicious Event Injection](./threats/malicious_event_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might be able to craft and send malicious events to the server that are not properly validated or handled. This could involve modifying event payloads or sending unexpected event types, potentially triggering unintended server-side actions or exploiting vulnerabilities in the server-side event handling logic. This directly involves how Glu communicates client-side actions to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Server-side state corruption, unauthorized actions, potential server-side code execution (depending on server-side vulnerability).
    *   **Affected Component:** Glu's Event Handling mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation of all incoming events on the server-side, verifying event types and payloads.
        *   Ensure that only authorized users or client-side actions can trigger specific events.
        *   Avoid directly executing commands based on client-provided event data without thorough validation and authorization checks on the server.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Undiscovered Glu Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_undiscovered_glu_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software library, Glu itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially discover and exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the client-side application or, in some cases, even the server if the vulnerability allows for remote code execution or other severe impacts. This is a direct risk associated with using the Glu library.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the nature of the vulnerability, could range from client-side crashes and denial of service to complete compromise of the client or server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the Glu library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay up-to-date with the latest Glu releases and security patches.
        *   Monitor Glu's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement general security best practices in the application to limit the potential impact of library vulnerabilities (e.g., principle of least privilege, input validation).
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application code and potentially within the Glu library itself (although this is more challenging for external libraries).
