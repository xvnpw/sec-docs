# Attack Surface Analysis for pongasoft/glu

## Attack Surface: [Annotation Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/annotation_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Flaws in how Glu parses and interprets annotations used to define routes and handler mappings.

**How Glu Contributes:** Glu relies heavily on annotations within C++ code to establish the API structure. Vulnerabilities in the annotation parsing logic are directly introduced by Glu's design.

**Example:**  Crafting an overly long or deeply nested annotation that causes the Glu annotation parser to crash or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for unexpected behavior or code execution if parsing vulnerabilities are severe.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to **High** (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test Glu's annotation parsing with various malformed and edge-case inputs.
* Ensure Glu is updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* If possible, contribute to Glu's development by reporting and helping fix annotation parsing issues.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect or Overly Permissive Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_or_overly_permissive_route_definitions.md)

**Description:**  Misconfiguration or overly broad definitions of API routes, potentially exposing unintended functionalities or data.

**How Glu Contributes:** Glu's annotation-based routing makes it easy to define routes, but incorrect or overly permissive definitions are a direct consequence of how developers use Glu's features.

**Example:** Defining a route like `/admin/{param}` without sufficient constraints, allowing access to sensitive admin functionalities with arbitrary values for `{param}`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potential for privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** **High**.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow the principle of least privilege when defining routes.
* Use specific and restrictive route patterns.
* Implement robust authorization checks within handler functions to verify user permissions before executing actions.
* Regularly review and audit route definitions to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Request Parameter Binding and Handling](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_request_parameter_binding_and_handling.md)

**Description:**  Issues arising from how Glu binds incoming request parameters to handler function arguments, potentially leading to type confusion, buffer overflows, or other input validation bypasses.

**How Glu Contributes:** Glu's automatic parameter binding simplifies development but introduces a potential attack surface if the binding process is not secure or if developers rely solely on Glu's implicit handling without explicit validation.

**Example:**  Sending a large string as a parameter intended for a fixed-size buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow if Glu doesn't perform adequate size checks during binding.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution if buffer overflows are exploitable.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to **Critical** (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement explicit input validation within handler functions, regardless of Glu's binding mechanism.
* Be mindful of data types and sizes when defining handler function arguments.
* If possible, configure Glu or use its features to enforce stricter type checking during parameter binding.
