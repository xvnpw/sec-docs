## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Glu](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_glu.md)

An attacker identifies a point where Glu or the application deserializes untrusted data (e.g., request bodies). They then craft a malicious serialized Java object containing instructions to execute arbitrary code. When this object is deserialized, the code is executed on the server, potentially granting the attacker full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Deserialization Point in Glu](./attack_tree_paths/identify_deserialization_point_in_glu.md)

This involves analyzing Glu's code or the application's usage of Glu to pinpoint locations where deserialization occurs without proper input validation or type checking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious Payload](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_payload.md)

This requires knowledge of Java deserialization vulnerabilities and the use of "gadget chains" - sequences of Java classes that can be chained together to achieve code execution during deserialization. Tools and resources exist to aid in crafting these payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Input Through Glu's Parameter Handling](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_input_through_glu's_parameter_handling.md)

An attacker leverages Glu's parameter binding mechanism to inject malicious code or data into the application. This is possible if Glu does not properly validate or sanitize input parameters before they are processed by application handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Glu](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_in_glu.md)

This involves identifying that Glu's parameter handling does not adequately sanitize or validate input. Attackers can then craft inputs that exploit this lack of validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Code (e.g., Server-Side Template Injection if used with templating)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_code__e_g___server-side_template_injection_if_used_with_templating_.md)

If the application uses a templating engine in conjunction with Glu and input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject template directives that execute arbitrary code on the server when the template is rendered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Glu (Indirectly related, but worth considering)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_glu__indirectly_related__but_worth_considering_.md)

Glu relies on other Java libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities through Glu's usage of the vulnerable component.

## Attack Tree Path: [Research Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/research_known_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

Attackers can examine Glu's dependency list (e.g., in `pom.xml`) and then use public vulnerability databases (like CVE) to find known vulnerabilities in those specific versions of the dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies Through Glu's Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies_through_glu's_usage.md)

This requires understanding how Glu uses the vulnerable dependency. The attacker then crafts requests or data that trigger the vulnerability within the context of Glu's usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Analyze Error Responses for Sensitive Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/analyze_error_responses_for_sensitive_information_disclosure.md)

Although not a direct path to full compromise, exposing sensitive information in error messages (e.g., stack traces, internal paths) provides attackers with valuable reconnaissance data that can be used to plan and execute more sophisticated attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Configuration (if possible)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_configuration__if_possible_.md)

If Glu's configuration can be modified through external means (e.g., environment variables, configuration files), an attacker might be able to change settings to weaken security, disable features, or gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flaws in Glu's Security Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flaws_in_glu's_security_implementation.md)

If Glu has built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms, vulnerabilities in these mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access. This is more relevant if Glu were to introduce such features in the future.
