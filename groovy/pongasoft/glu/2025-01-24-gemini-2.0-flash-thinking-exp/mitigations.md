## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Code Signing for Hot-Reloaded Artifacts](./mitigation_strategies/implement_code_signing_for_hot-reloaded_artifacts.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Establish a secure code signing process. This involves generating a private key, keeping it secure, and using it to sign code artifacts (e.g., JAR files, class files) before deployment.
    *   Step 2: **Configure Glu to verify digital signatures before loading new code.** This might involve configuring Glu with the public key corresponding to the private key used for signing. (Refer to Glu documentation for specific configuration options if available).
    *   Step 3: Integrate the code signing process into the build and deployment pipeline. Ensure that all code artifacts intended for hot-reloading are signed before being placed in the reload location for Glu to pick up.
    *   Step 4: Implement monitoring to detect signature verification failures during hot-reloading by Glu, which could indicate tampering or invalid code.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Code Injection via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) - Severity: High
    *   Compromised Code Source - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Code Injection via MITM: High -  Effectively prevents MITM attacks from injecting malicious code during code delivery, as Glu's signature verification will fail.
    *   Compromised Code Source: Medium - Reduces the risk from a compromised code source if the signing key is securely managed. If the signing key is compromised, this mitigation is bypassed.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Code signing is implemented for production deployments of the main application artifacts, but not yet for hot-reloadable components used by Glu.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Code signing needs to be extended to the hot-reloadable components used by Glu and integrated with the Glu loading process. **Configuration of Glu to enforce signature verification is also missing.**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Validate Hot-Reload Configuration Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_validate_hot-reload_configuration_parameters.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all configuration parameters that **Glu uses for hot-reloading** (e.g., paths, polling intervals, class names).
    *   Step 2: Implement strict validation rules for these parameters. For example:
        *   Whitelist allowed paths or directories for code loading **by Glu**.
        *   Validate that polling intervals used by **Glu** are within acceptable ranges.
        *   If class names are configurable for **Glu**, validate them against expected patterns.
    *   Step 3: Sanitize any input that influences these configuration parameters to prevent injection attacks (e.g., path traversal) when configuring **Glu**.
    *   Step 4: Log any invalid configuration attempts for **Glu** for monitoring and auditing.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Path Traversal Attacks - Severity: High (related to Glu's file access)
    *   Configuration Injection - Severity: Medium (affecting Glu's behavior)
    *   Unexpected Behavior due to Malformed Configuration - Severity: Medium (Availability of Glu functionality)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Path Traversal Attacks: High - Prevents attackers from manipulating configuration to make **Glu** load code from unintended locations outside of the designated hot-reload directories.
    *   Configuration Injection: Medium - Reduces the risk of attackers injecting malicious configuration values that could alter **Glu's** hot-reload behavior in harmful ways.
    *   Unexpected Behavior due to Malformed Configuration: Medium - Improves application stability by ensuring **Glu's** configuration is valid and preventing errors due to incorrect settings.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic validation is in place for some configuration parameters used by the application, but specific validation for **Glu's** configuration parameters is not comprehensive.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More comprehensive validation is needed, specifically targeting **Glu's** configuration parameters, including whitelisting paths, validating parameter ranges, and input sanitization. This validation should be applied when **Glu** is initialized or reconfigured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Comprehensive Logging of Hot-Reload Events](./mitigation_strategies/implement_comprehensive_logging_of_hot-reload_events.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: **Configure Glu** and the application to log all relevant hot-reload events. This should include:
        *   Timestamp of each reload attempt **by Glu**.
        *   Source of the reloaded code (path or remote location) used by **Glu**.
        *   User or process initiating the reload (if applicable, triggering **Glu**).
        *   Outcome of the reload operation (success or failure) reported by **Glu**.
        *   Detailed error messages in case of failures reported by **Glu**.
    *   Step 2: Ensure logs are stored securely and are accessible for monitoring and auditing by security personnel.
    *   Step 3: Implement monitoring and alerting on these logs to detect suspicious activity related to **Glu**, such as:
        *   Frequent reload failures reported by **Glu**.
        *   Reload attempts from unexpected sources or users triggering **Glu**.
        *   Reloads at unusual times initiated via **Glu**.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Detection of Malicious Activity - Severity: Medium (related to Glu usage)
    *   Post-Incident Analysis - Severity: Medium (related to Glu actions)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Detection of Malicious Activity: Medium - Improves the ability to detect malicious hot-reload attempts or successful compromises by providing visibility into **Glu's** reload operations.
    *   Post-Incident Analysis: High - Provides crucial information for investigating security incidents related to hot-reloading via **Glu**, enabling better understanding of attack vectors and impact.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic application logging is in place, but specific logging for **Glu** hot-reload events is not yet implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Detailed logging of **Glu** hot-reload events needs to be implemented. This includes logging all the details mentioned in the description and integrating these logs into the central logging and monitoring system, specifically focusing on events generated by or related to **Glu**.
