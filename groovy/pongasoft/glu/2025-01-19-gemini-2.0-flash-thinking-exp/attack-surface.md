# Attack Surface Analysis for pongasoft/glu

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection through Glu's Parameter Extraction](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_through_glu's_parameter_extraction.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code or commands into backend systems by manipulating parameters extracted by Glu (path parameters, query parameters, request body).
    *   **How Glu Contributes:** Glu simplifies the process of extracting parameters, but it doesn't inherently sanitize or validate them. If developers directly use these extracted parameters in database queries, system commands, or other sensitive operations without proper sanitization, it creates an injection vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `/users/'; DROP TABLE users;--` where the application uses the `id` path parameter extracted by Glu directly in an SQL query without sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, remote code execution (depending on the context of the injection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all parameters extracted by Glu *before* using them in any backend operations. Define expected formats, types, and ranges.
        *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities when Handling Request Bodies](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_when_handling_request_bodies.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Glu to handle request bodies (e.g., JSON, XML) and employs a deserialization library, vulnerabilities in that library can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Glu Contributes:** Glu facilitates the reception and processing of request bodies. While Glu itself might not be vulnerable, its role in passing the request body to a deserialization library makes the application susceptible if that library has vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a malicious JSON payload that, when deserialized by the application's chosen library, leads to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete compromise of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Deserialization Practices:**  Carefully choose and configure deserialization libraries. Consider using allow-lists instead of deny-lists for allowed classes during deserialization.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the structure and content of the request body before deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Route Definition Vulnerabilities (Overlapping or Incorrectly Defined Routes)](./attack_surfaces/route_definition_vulnerabilities__overlapping_or_incorrectly_defined_routes_.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly defined routes in Glu can lead to unintended access to certain functionalities or bypass intended security checks.
    *   **How Glu Contributes:** Glu's routing mechanism determines how incoming requests are mapped to specific handlers. If routes are not defined carefully, overlaps or ambiguities can create security loopholes.
    *   **Example:** Two routes are defined: `/users/{id}` and `/users/admin`. If the routing logic prioritizes the first route incorrectly, a request to `/users/admin` might be mistakenly handled by the handler for `/users/{id}`, potentially bypassing authentication checks for administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources or functionalities, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Route Design:**  Design routes with clarity and avoid overlapping patterns. Be specific in route definitions.
        *   **Route Ordering:** Understand how Glu resolves route matches and ensure more specific routes are defined before more general ones.
