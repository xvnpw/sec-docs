# Threat Model Analysis for pongasoft/glu

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload in the JavaScript frontend. This payload is sent to the Java backend via Glu. Upon deserialization by the backend, the malicious payload executes arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise. The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the Java serialization process or libraries used *by Glu*.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the backend server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify system configurations, or launch further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Glu's serialization/deserialization mechanism, specifically the `convert` or similar functions used to transform data between JavaScript and Java *within Glu*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources *through Glu*.
    *   Use secure serialization libraries and configurations *within the context of Glu's data handling*. Consider alternatives to standard Java serialization if possible.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using HMAC) on serialized data passed *through Glu* to detect tampering.
    *   Restrict the classes that can be deserialized on the backend *when processing data from Glu* (whitelisting).
    *   Keep Java runtime and serialization libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Backend Method Invocation](./threats/unauthorized_backend_method_invocation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JavaScript code to call backend methods *through Glu* that they are not authorized to access. This could involve manipulating the method name or parameters sent via Glu. The attacker exploits insufficient access control checks on the backend *when processing requests originating from Glu*.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially leading to significant business impact.
*   **Affected Component:** Glu's method invocation mechanism, specifically the part that maps frontend calls to backend Java methods *within Glu*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks on the backend for all methods accessible *through Glu*.
    *   Use a principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to frontend components *interacting with the backend via Glu*.
    *   Avoid directly exposing sensitive or critical backend methods *through Glu* without strict access controls.
    *   Consider using a dedicated API layer with well-defined and controlled endpoints instead of directly mapping all backend methods *through Glu*.

## Threat: [Parameter Tampering in Method Invocation](./threats/parameter_tampering_in_method_invocation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates the parameters sent from the frontend to the backend *via Glu* during a method invocation. This could involve changing values to bypass validation or trigger unintended behavior in the backend logic.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, business logic errors, unauthorized actions, or potential exploitation of backend vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Glu's data passing mechanism during method invocation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the backend for all parameters received *through Glu*.
    *   Use strong typing and data validation frameworks on the backend *for data received via Glu*.
    *   Avoid relying solely on frontend validation.
    *   Consider using cryptographic signatures or checksums for sensitive parameters passed *through Glu* to detect tampering.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Glu Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_glu_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** The Glu library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., bugs, design flaws) that an attacker could exploit.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from information disclosure to remote code execution *within the application utilizing Glu*.
*   **Affected Component:** The Glu library code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Glu library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor Glu's release notes and security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the Glu library for potential vulnerabilities (though this might be challenging for a third-party library).

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Glu's Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_glu's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Glu relies on other libraries, and these dependencies might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited *through Glu*.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **Affected Component:** The dependencies used by the Glu library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan the application's dependencies, including Glu's dependencies, for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
    *   Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
