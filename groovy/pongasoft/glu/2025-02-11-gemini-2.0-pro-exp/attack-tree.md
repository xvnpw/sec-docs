## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Agent [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__on_agent__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit Agent Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1.2 Exploit authentication/authorization bypass in IPC. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to bypass the authentication and authorization mechanisms used for inter-process communication (IPC) between the `glu` agent and other components (e.g., ZooKeeper, other agents, the console). This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication protocol, finding default credentials, or leveraging misconfigurations.
        *   **Example:** If ZooKeeper is used without authentication, the attacker could connect directly to it and modify the deployment state.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., mutual TLS) and fine-grained authorization for all IPC channels. Regularly audit configurations.

    *   **1.1.1.3 Leverage deserialization vulnerabilities in message handling. [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a specially crafted serialized object to the `glu` agent.  If the agent deserializes this object without proper validation, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a common vulnerability in Java and other languages that use object serialization.
        *   **Example:**  The attacker uses a known "gadget chain" in a common Java library to execute a system command upon deserialization.
        *   **Mitigation:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data. If deserialization is necessary, use a whitelist of allowed classes and validate the data after deserialization. Consider using safer serialization formats (e.g., JSON with strict schema validation).

    *   **1.1.2.1 Inject malicious Groovy code via model parameters or fabric definitions. [HIGH-RISK][CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious Groovy code into the `glu` model or fabric definitions. This code is then executed by the `glu` agent during the deployment process. This is a direct attack on `glu`'s core functionality.
        *   **Example:** The attacker modifies a model parameter to include a Groovy script that executes a shell command.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all inputs to the model and fabric.  Consider using a more restrictive scripting language or eliminating scripting entirely if possible.  Implement a strong content security policy.

    *   **1.1.3.1 Supply a malicious artifact (e.g., a compromised JAR file) that exploits vulnerabilities in the application or its dependencies. [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker replaces a legitimate artifact with a malicious one. This malicious artifact could contain vulnerabilities that are exploited when the application is deployed or run.
        *   **Example:** The attacker replaces a legitimate JAR file with one containing a known vulnerability in a logging library.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use a secure artifact repository with access controls.  Verify artifact integrity using checksums and digital signatures.  Scan artifacts for vulnerabilities before deployment.

    *   **1.1.3.3 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on artifact download (if not using secure transport/verification). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts the communication between the `glu` agent and the artifact repository. They replace the legitimate artifact with a malicious one during the download process.
        *   **Example:** The attacker uses ARP spoofing to intercept traffic and inject a malicious JAR file.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Use HTTPS for all artifact downloads.  Verify the server's certificate.  Use checksums or digital signatures to verify artifact integrity.

    *   **1.1.4.1 Inject malicious configuration settings that lead to RCE (e.g., specifying a malicious command to execute). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the `glu` agent's configuration to include malicious settings. These settings could directly execute commands or indirectly lead to RCE.
        *   **Example:** The attacker changes a configuration parameter to specify a malicious script to be executed as part of a pre-deployment hook.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all configuration inputs.  Store configuration securely.  Use a configuration management system with auditing capabilities.

    *   **1.2.2 Gain access through weak credentials or SSH keys. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the agent's host system by guessing weak passwords, using default credentials, or stealing SSH keys.
        *   **Example:** The attacker uses a brute-force attack to guess the SSH password for the user running the `glu` agent.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Enforce strong password policies.  Use multi-factor authentication.  Disable password-based SSH access and use key-based authentication only.  Regularly rotate SSH keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Disrupt Deployment Process](./attack_tree_paths/2__disrupt_deployment_process.md)

*   **2.2 Deploy Malicious Artifacts [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **2.2.2 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on artifact download (if integrity checks are weak or absent). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **(Same description and mitigation as 1.1.3.3)**

    *   **2.2.3 Tamper with the glu model or fabric to point to a malicious artifact. [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the `glu` model or fabric definition to specify a malicious artifact to be deployed. This bypasses the need to compromise the artifact repository directly.
        *   **Example:** The attacker changes the URL of an artifact in the model to point to a malicious file hosted on a compromised server.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict access controls on the `glu` model and fabric.  Use version control and auditing to track changes.  Validate all artifact URLs before deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise glu Console (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_glu_console__if_applicable_.md)

*   **3.1.3 Authentication/Authorization bypass to gain access to the console. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker bypasses the authentication and authorization mechanisms of the `glu` console, gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the console's login form to bypass authentication.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and fine-grained authorization. Regularly test the authentication and authorization mechanisms.

*   **3.2.2 Gain access through weak credentials or SSH keys. [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to 1.2.2, but targeting the console's host system.
    *   **Example:** The attacker uses a dictionary attack to guess the password for an administrator account on the console.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies. Use multi-factor authentication. Disable password-based SSH access and use key-based authentication only. Regularly rotate SSH keys.
