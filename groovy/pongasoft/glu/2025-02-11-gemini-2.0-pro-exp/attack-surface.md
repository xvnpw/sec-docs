# Attack Surface Analysis for pongasoft/glu

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Glu Console Credentials](./attack_surfaces/compromised_glu_console_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to the glu console using stolen or guessed credentials.
*   **How glu contributes:**  The glu console is the central control point *provided by glu*, making it a high-value target. Glu's authentication mechanisms are a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:**  An attacker phishes a glu administrator's credentials or uses a default/weak password and logs in to the glu console.
*   **Impact:**  Full control over deployments managed *by glu*, access to sensitive data within glu (configurations, potentially secrets), ability to deploy malicious code via glu to all managed hosts.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all glu users.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Require MFA for all console logins.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:**  Implement a policy for regularly rotating credentials, especially for administrative accounts.
    *   **Secure Authentication Provider Configuration:**  Ensure that any integrated authentication providers used *by glu* (JIRA, GitHub, LDAP) are securely configured and regularly patched.  This is glu-specific because glu *chooses* to integrate with these.
    *   **Monitor Login Attempts:**  Implement monitoring and alerting for failed login attempts and suspicious login activity *within glu*.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation within the Glu Console](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_within_the_glu_console.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker with limited access to the glu console exploits a vulnerability *in glu's code* to gain higher privileges.
*   **How glu contributes:**  Glu's own role-based access control (RBAC) system and authorization logic are the direct attack surface.
*   **Example:**  A user with "read-only" access to a project discovers a vulnerability in a glu API endpoint that allows them to modify deployment scripts, bypassing glu's intended permissions.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to projects, environments, or actions *within glu*; potential for malicious deployments *through glu*.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Authorization Checks:**  Implement robust authorization checks *within glu's code* at every level, especially for API endpoints.  Ensure that glu's permissions are enforced consistently.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions *within glu*.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of *glu's* authorization logic and RBAC configuration.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all user input *within glu* to prevent attackers from manipulating authorization parameters.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Deployment Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_deployment_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker modifies deployment scripts (fabric files) *managed by glu* to include malicious code.
*   **How glu contributes:**  Glu *executes* these scripts on target hosts, providing a direct path for code execution.  Glu's central storage and management of scripts are the core vulnerability.
*   **Example:**  An attacker compromises the glu console and modifies a fabric file stored *within glu* to include a command that downloads and executes a backdoor.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of all target hosts *via glu*; data theft, system destruction, lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Script Storage:**  Store deployment scripts in a secure location with strict access controls, ensuring that *glu's access* to these scripts is also secured.
    *   **Script Integrity Checks:**  Implement mechanisms *within glu* to verify the integrity of scripts before execution (e.g., checksums, digital signatures).
    *   **Code Review:**  Require code review for all changes to deployment scripts *that glu will use*.
    *   **Input sanitization:** Sanitize all variables used in scripts *that glu will use*.
    * **Limit execution permissions:** Run scripts with limited user *configured in glu*.

## Attack Surface: [Glu Agent Code Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/glu_agent_code_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *in the glu agent itself* to execute arbitrary code.  This is distinct from compromising the *host* the agent runs on.
*   **How glu contributes:** The glu agent is code provided *by glu*, and any vulnerabilities in its handling of commands, scripts, or communication are direct attack surfaces.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted message to the glu agent that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the agent's code, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the agent host and potentially other hosts managed by glu; data theft, system disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Agent Communication:** Ensure that communication between the glu console and agents is encrypted and mutually authenticated *as implemented by glu*.
    *   **Monitor Agent Activity:** Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious agent activity *as reported by glu*.
    *   **Regular Agent Updates:** Keep glu agents up to date to patch vulnerabilities *in the agent code*.
    *   **Least Privilege for Agents:** Run glu agents with the least privilege necessary *as configured within glu*.

## Attack Surface: [ZooKeeper Compromise (Impacting Glu)](./attack_surfaces/zookeeper_compromise__impacting_glu_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains control of the ZooKeeper cluster *used by glu*.
*   **How glu contributes:**  Glu *relies* on ZooKeeper for coordination.  While ZooKeeper itself isn't part of glu, glu's *dependence* on it creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in ZooKeeper or gains access through weak credentials and modifies the ZooKeeper data *used by glu* to redirect deployments.
*   **Impact:**  Complete disruption of deployments *managed by glu*, potential for data corruption or loss, ability to inject malicious configurations *into glu*.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure ZooKeeper Configuration:**  Follow best practices for securing ZooKeeper, ensuring that *glu's connection* to ZooKeeper is secure:
        *   Strong Authentication: Use strong authentication for *glu's access* to ZooKeeper.
        *   Network Access Control: Restrict network access to the ZooKeeper cluster to only authorized hosts, *including the glu console and agents*.
        *   Encryption: Use TLS/SSL for communication between *glu and ZooKeeper*.
        *   Regular Updates: Keep ZooKeeper up-to-date.
        *   Dedicated Cluster: Use a dedicated ZooKeeper cluster for glu.

## Attack Surface: [API Vulnerabilities (Unauthenticated Access/Injection within Glu)](./attack_surfaces/api_vulnerabilities__unauthenticated_accessinjection_within_glu_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities *in the glu REST API itself* to gain unauthorized access or inject malicious data.
*   **How glu contributes:** The glu API is a core component *provided by glu*.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a glu API endpoint that does not require authentication and allows them to list all deployed projects. Or, an attacker uses a SQL injection vulnerability in a glu API parameter to extract data from glu's database.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data *within glu*, ability to modify deployments *through glu*, potential for denial-of-service attacks *against glu*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure API Authentication:** Require authentication for all glu API endpoints.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input to glu API endpoints.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting *within glu* to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   **Regular API Security Testing:** Conduct regular security testing of *glu's API*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Secrets within Glu](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_secrets_within_glu.md)

* **Description:** Glu stores or handles sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, etc.) in an insecure manner *within its own configuration or database*.
* **How glu contributes:** Glu requires access to various systems and services, often necessitating the storage and management of credentials *within the glu system itself*.
* **Example:** Glu stores database credentials in plain text within its configuration files, which are accessible to anyone with read access to the glu console.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, leading to unauthorized access to connected systems and services *that glu uses*.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secrets Management System:** Integrate glu with a dedicated secrets management system. Ensure *glu is configured* to use it correctly.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets in glu configuration files or scripts *used by glu*.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in the glu database.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant glu only the minimum necessary permissions to access secrets.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit *glu's* configuration and usage of secrets.
