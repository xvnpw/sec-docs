## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Configuration Validation (glu-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_configuration_validation__glu-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schema Definition (glu-Aware):** Create a formal schema (e.g., JSON Schema adapted for YAML) that *specifically* defines the allowed structure, data types, and required fields for `.glu` configuration files, taking into account all `glu`-specific keywords, parameters, and object structures (e.g., `services`, `agents`, `filters`, `plans`).
    2.  **Schema Validation Implementation (glu-Integrated):** Integrate a schema validator *directly* into the `glu` workflow. This could be:
        *   A `glu` plugin or extension (if `glu` supports such extensibility).
        *   A pre-processing step *before* `glu` processes the configuration file. This could be a custom script that validates the YAML against the schema before passing it to `glu`.
        *   Ideally, a feature built into `glu` itself (if possible, contribute this upstream).
    3.  **Semantic Validation Rules (glu-Centric):** Develop custom validation rules that are *specific to `glu`'s logic and functionality*. Examples:
        *   **Agent-Service Compatibility:** Check that services are assigned to compatible agents (e.g., based on tags or agent properties).
        *   **Filter Syntax Validation:** Validate the syntax of `glu` filters to prevent errors or potential injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Plan Step Validation:** Ensure that plan steps are defined correctly and reference valid services and actions.
        *   **Resource Limit Validation (glu Context):** Check that resource limits (CPU, memory) specified within `glu` configurations are within acceptable ranges *and are compatible with the target deployment environment*.
        *   **Reference Validation:** Ensure that references to other `glu` objects (e.g., services, agents, plans) are valid and exist.
    4.  **Linting (glu-Specific Rules):** Use a YAML linter with custom rules tailored to `glu` best practices.  These rules should enforce conventions and identify potential problems specific to `glu` configurations, such as:
        *   Deprecated `glu` features.
        *   Inefficient or potentially problematic `glu` configurations.
        *   Common `glu`-related anti-patterns.
    5.  **Pre-Commit Hooks (glu-Focused):** Implement pre-commit hooks that run the `glu`-specific validator and linter locally before developers commit changes to `.glu` files.
    6.  **Automated Testing (glu-Driven):** Create automated tests that *specifically* target `glu`'s configuration processing. These tests should:
        *   Provide valid and invalid `.glu` configurations.
        *   Verify that `glu` correctly applies valid configurations.
        *   Verify that `glu` correctly rejects invalid configurations and provides informative error messages.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Errors (Severity: High):** Misconfigured `glu` deployments leading to service exposure, incorrect routing, resource exhaustion, deployment to the wrong environment, or other `glu`-specific issues.
    *   **Untrusted Code Execution (Severity: Medium):** If configuration errors allow the deployment of malicious code via `glu`.
    *   **Access Control Issues (Severity: Medium):** If configuration errors lead to overly permissive access controls *within the context of `glu`*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Significantly reduces the risk. Catches most `glu`-specific configuration errors before deployment. Risk reduction: 70-90%.
    *   **Untrusted Code Execution:** Indirectly reduces the risk. Risk reduction: 20-30%.
    *   **Access Control Issues:** Indirectly reduces the risk. Risk reduction: 20-30%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial schema validation in `validate_config.py`.
    *   Basic linting via a pre-commit hook.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive semantic validation rules specific to `glu`.
    *   Automated testing of `glu`'s configuration processing.
    *   Pre-commit hooks are not enforced for all developers.
    *   The schema is not fully comprehensive and `glu`-specific.
    *   No direct integration with `glu`'s workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Secret Management (glu Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_secret_management__glu_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secret Store Selection:** (This step is external, but the *integration* is `glu`-specific).
    2.  **Secret Store Integration (glu-Specific):** This is the core `glu`-focused part.  Configure `glu` to retrieve secrets from the secret store *at runtime*.  This requires a mechanism that is compatible with both `glu` and the chosen secret store.  Possible approaches:
        *   **`glu` Plugin/Extension:** If `glu` supports plugins or extensions, develop one that integrates with the chosen secret store (e.g., a Vault plugin for `glu`). This is the ideal solution.
        *   **Environment Variable Injection (glu-Aware):** Use a tool or script that retrieves secrets from the secret store and injects them as environment variables *before* `glu` processes the configuration.  The `.glu` scripts would then reference these environment variables.  This requires careful management of the environment variable scope to avoid leaks.  The script must be tightly integrated with the `glu` deployment process.
        *   **Custom Script Wrapper (glu-Specific):** Create a custom script that wraps the `glu` command-line interface.  This script would:
            1.  Retrieve secrets from the secret store.
            2.  Temporarily set environment variables or modify the `.glu` configuration file (in memory, *never* writing secrets to disk).
            3.  Execute the `glu` command with the modified configuration or environment.
            4.  Clean up any temporary environment variables or configuration changes.
        *   **`glu` Configuration Options (Ideal):** If `glu` provides built-in configuration options for integrating with secret stores (e.g., specifying a Vault address and token), use these options. This is the most secure and maintainable approach.
    3.  **Least Privilege (Secrets within glu):** Ensure that `.glu` scripts and configurations only reference the *specific* secrets they need. Avoid using broad access patterns or retrieving unnecessary secrets.
    4. **Glu Script Modification:** Modify all `.glu` scripts to remove hardcoded secrets and replace them with references to the secret store (e.g., environment variable names, `glu`-specific placeholders).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secret Management (Severity: High):** Exposure of sensitive information stored within `.glu` configurations or passed to `glu` in an insecure manner.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secret Management:** Eliminates the risk of storing secrets directly in `.glu` files. Significantly reduces the risk of secret exposure. Risk reduction: 90-95%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None. Secrets are currently in environment variables and hardcoded in `.glu` files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects of secure secret management integration with `glu` are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Agent Authentication and Authorization (glu-Controlled)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_agent_authentication_and_authorization__glu-controlled_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Agent Credentials:** Use strong, unique credentials for each `glu` agent to authenticate to the `glu` console. Avoid using shared credentials or weak passwords.
    2.  **Authentication Mechanism (glu-Specific):** Utilize `glu`'s built-in authentication mechanisms for agents. This might involve:
        *   API keys generated and managed by `glu`.
        *   Certificates issued and managed by `glu`.
        *   Integration with an external authentication provider (if supported by `glu`).
    3.  **Authorization (glu-Level):** If `glu` supports authorization controls for agents (e.g., restricting which agents can deploy which services or access which resources), configure these controls to enforce the principle of least privilege.  Agents should only have the permissions they need to perform their assigned tasks.
    4. **Regular Credential Rotation (glu-Managed):** If `glu` provides mechanisms for automatically rotating agent credentials (e.g., API keys), enable and configure this feature. If not, implement a process for manually rotating credentials on a regular basis.
    5. **Revocation (glu-Controlled):** Ensure that `glu` provides a mechanism for revoking agent credentials in case of compromise or decommissioning.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Access Control Issues (Severity: High):** Unauthorized access to the `glu` console via compromised or misused agent credentials.
    *   **Agent Security (Severity: High):** Compromise of a `glu` agent, but with limited impact due to strong authentication and authorization.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Access Control Issues:** Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access via agents. Risk reduction: 70-90%.
    *   **Agent Security:** Reduces the impact of a compromised agent. Risk reduction: 40-60%.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic password authentication for agents.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Strong, unique credentials are not consistently used.
    *   `glu`'s built-in authentication mechanisms are not fully utilized.
    *   Authorization controls for agents (if supported by `glu`) are not implemented.
    *   Credential rotation is not implemented.
    *   A clear revocation process is not defined.
