### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving gogradle

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `gogradle` plugin:

- **Threat:** Dependency Confusion Attack
    - **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious Go dependency with the same name as an internal or private dependency used by the project. `gogradle`, during its dependency resolution process, might fetch and use the attacker's malicious dependency instead of the intended one.
    - **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the build process, potentially leading to compromised build artifacts, data exfiltration, or supply chain attacks.
    - **Affected Component:** `gogradle`'s dependency resolution logic, specifically when interacting with Go module repositories.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Utilize private dependency repositories or artifact managers with strict access controls.
        - Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability checks as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
        - Verify the integrity and source of dependencies.
        - Consider using checksum verification for dependencies.

- **Threat:** Command Injection via Configuration
    - **Description:** An attacker manipulates input fields or environment variables that are used to construct shell commands executed *by `gogradle`* during build tasks. This could involve injecting malicious commands to execute arbitrary code on the build server.
    - **Impact:** Full compromise of the build server, potentially leading to data breaches, code modification, or denial of service.
    - **Affected Component:** `gogradle`'s task execution logic where it interacts with the underlying operating system or Go toolchain.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid constructing shell commands dynamically based on external input within `gogradle` configurations.
        - Sanitize and validate all external input used in `gogradle` configurations.
        - Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution where possible within `gogradle` tasks.
        - Implement principle of least privilege for the build process.

- **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution during Build (Plugin Vulnerability)
    - **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `gogradle` plugin itself, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the build server or developer's machine during the build process. This could be triggered by a specially crafted Gradle configuration or a malicious dependency that exploits a flaw in `gogradle`.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the build environment or developer machine, leading to data theft, code modification, or supply chain attacks.
    - **Affected Component:** Core `gogradle` plugin code and its interaction with the Gradle API and Go toolchain.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Keep `gogradle` updated to the latest version with security patches.
        - Monitor for security advisories related to `gogradle`.
        - Restrict access to the build environment and Gradle configuration files.

- **Threat:** Tampering with `gogradle` Distribution
    - **Description:** The source or distribution mechanism for `gogradle` is compromised, and a malicious version of the plugin is distributed. When the build process attempts to use `gogradle`, it downloads and executes this malicious version.
    - **Impact:** All projects using the compromised distribution of `gogradle` could be affected, leading to widespread compromise during the build process.
    - **Affected Component:** The `gogradle` distribution mechanism (e.g., Maven Central, GitHub releases) and the plugin loading mechanism within Gradle.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Use trusted and verified sources for downloading `gogradle`.
        - Verify the integrity of the downloaded `gogradle` plugin (e.g., using checksums).
        - Monitor for any signs of compromise in the `gogradle` distribution channels.
