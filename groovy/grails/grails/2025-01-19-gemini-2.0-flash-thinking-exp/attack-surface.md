# Attack Surface Analysis for grails/grails

## Attack Surface: [Command Object Binding Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/command_object_binding_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Grails automatically binds request parameters to command objects. Without proper validation, attackers can manipulate data or set unintended properties.

**How Grails Contributes:** Grails' convention-over-configuration approach simplifies data binding, but this automatic binding can be exploited if not secured.

**Example:** A user submits a form with an extra parameter `isAdmin=true`, which gets bound to a command object without validation, potentially granting unauthorized administrative privileges.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation on command objects, including whitelisting allowed values and data types.
*   Use data transfer objects (DTOs) or specific command objects with only the necessary fields to limit the scope of binding.
*   Avoid directly binding to domain objects for write operations.
*   Leverage Grails' validation constraints effectively.

## Attack Surface: [GORM Injection](./attack_surfaces/gorm_injection.md)

**Description:** Improperly constructed GORM queries, especially dynamic finders or criteria queries that incorporate user input directly, can lead to GORM injection vulnerabilities, similar to SQL injection.

**How Grails Contributes:** Grails' dynamic finders and criteria builders offer convenience but can be misused if user input isn't sanitized.

**Example:**  A URL like `/users?name=${params.name}` used directly in a dynamic finder like `User.findByNameLike(params.name)` could allow an attacker to inject GORM query language.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use parameterized queries or criteria builders with explicit parameters.**
*   **Sanitize user input before incorporating it into GORM queries.**
*   **Avoid using raw strings in `where` clauses with user input.**
*   **Prefer static finders or explicitly defined criteria for better control.**

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in GSP](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_gsp.md)

**Description:** If user-provided data is not properly encoded before being rendered in Groovy Server Pages (GSP), attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute in other users' browsers.

**How Grails Contributes:** Grails uses GSP for view rendering, and developers need to be mindful of encoding output to prevent XSS.

**Example:** Displaying `params.message` directly in a GSP without encoding: `<h1>${params.message}</h1>`. An attacker could submit `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as the message.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always encode output in GSP using appropriate tags like `<g:encodeAsHTML>` or `<g:encodeAsJavaScript>`.**
*   **Be context-aware when encoding (HTML, JavaScript, URL, etc.).**
*   **Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate XSS risks.**
