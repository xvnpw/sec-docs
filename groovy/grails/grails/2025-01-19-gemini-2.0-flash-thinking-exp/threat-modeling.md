# Threat Model Analysis for grails/grails

## Threat: [Groovy Code Injection via Dynamic Evaluation](./threats/groovy_code_injection_via_dynamic_evaluation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Groovy code into input fields or parameters that are subsequently evaluated using methods like `Eval.me()` or similar dynamic evaluation mechanisms provided by the Groovy language integration within Grails. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, remote code execution, data breach, denial of service. The attacker can gain complete control over the server and its resources.

**Affected Component:** Groovy Language Integration within Grails (core framework).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using dynamic evaluation of user-supplied data entirely within Grails applications.
* If dynamic evaluation is absolutely necessary, implement extremely strict input validation and sanitization within the Grails application logic.
* Consider using safer alternatives to dynamic evaluation where possible within the Grails framework.
* Implement a strong security policy around code reviews and secure coding practices for Grails controllers and services.

## Threat: [GORM Injection](./threats/gorm_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user input that is directly incorporated into GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping) queries (HQL or Criteria) without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary database queries, potentially bypassing security restrictions enforced by the Grails application.

**Impact:** Data breach (accessing unauthorized data managed by the Grails application), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data within the application's database), privilege escalation (if the database user used by the Grails application has elevated privileges).

**Affected Component:** GORM Querying Mechanism (HQL, Criteria) within the Grails framework.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always use parameterized queries or criteria builders with user input when interacting with the database through GORM in Grails.
* Never directly concatenate user input into GORM query strings within Grails controllers or services.
* Implement input validation within the Grails application to ensure data conforms to expected types and formats before being used in GORM queries.
* Follow the principle of least privilege for database user accounts used by the Grails application.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerability in GORM](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerability_in_gorm.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests with extra parameters that are not intended to be modified. If Grails controllers directly bind request parameters to domain objects using GORM's data binding features without proper whitelisting, the attacker can modify unintended fields, potentially including sensitive ones like `isAdmin` flags or password fields.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation within the Grails application, data manipulation of application data, unauthorized access to features or data.

**Affected Component:** GORM Data Binding in Grails Controllers (core framework).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use the `allowedProperties` attribute in Grails controllers to explicitly define which fields can be bound from request parameters.
* Use the `bindData` method with explicit whitelisting of allowed fields in Grails controllers.
* Avoid directly binding all request parameters to domain objects without careful consideration in Grails controllers.
* Implement proper authorization checks within the Grails application before saving or updating domain objects.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Grails Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_grails_configurations.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit insecure default configurations within the core Grails framework, such as debug mode being enabled in production, overly permissive access controls configured by default, or exposed sensitive information in default error pages.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (stack traces, configuration details of the Grails application), increased attack surface for the Grails application, potential for further exploitation of the application.

**Affected Component:** Grails Core Framework Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While the impact can lead to higher severity issues, the direct impact of default misconfiguration is often information disclosure or increased attack surface. However, the *potential* for critical impact warrants inclusion here given the filtering criteria).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Review and harden default Grails configurations for production environments.
* Disable debug mode and other development-specific features in production Grails deployments.
* Configure custom error pages within the Grails application that do not reveal sensitive information.
* Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms within the Grails application.

## Threat: [Scaffolding Vulnerabilities](./threats/scaffolding_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Automatically generated scaffolding code within Grails might contain security vulnerabilities if not reviewed and hardened. This can include missing input validation in generated controllers, overly permissive access controls in generated views, or exposure of sensitive data through generated forms.

**Impact:** Data manipulation through the generated interface, unauthorized access to data or functionality exposed by the scaffolding, information disclosure via the generated views.

**Affected Component:** Grails Scaffolding Feature (core framework).

**Risk Severity:** Medium (Similar to insecure defaults, the direct impact might be medium, but the potential for exploitation leading to higher severity issues justifies its inclusion).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat scaffolding code as a starting point and thoroughly review and secure it within the Grails application development process.
* Implement proper input validation and sanitization in generated controllers and GSPs (Groovy Server Pages).
* Implement authorization checks to restrict access to scaffolding-generated actions and views within the Grails application.
