## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerable Grails Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerable_grails_plugin.md)

**Exploit Known Vulnerability in a Popular Plugin:**
*   Attack Vector: Attackers actively search for and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in widely used Grails plugins. This often involves leveraging existing proof-of-concept exploits or tools.
*   Mechanism: Exploits target flaws in the plugin's code, such as insecure data handling, lack of input validation, or authentication bypasses.
*   Consequences:  Successful exploitation can lead to various outcomes depending on the plugin's function, including remote code execution, data breaches, or privilege escalation.
**Exploit Dependency Vulnerability within a Plugin:**
*   Attack Vector:  Attackers target vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries (dependencies) used by Grails plugins. These vulnerabilities are often not directly apparent in the plugin's code.
*   Mechanism: Exploits target flaws in the underlying libraries, which the plugin unknowingly incorporates. This can involve similar vulnerabilities as direct plugin exploits (e.g., insecure deserialization, injection flaws).
*   Consequences: Similar to direct plugin exploits, this can result in remote code execution, data breaches, or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Grails Application Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_grails_application_misconfiguration.md)

**Exposed Development Endpoints (e.g., Spring Boot Actuator):**
*   Attack Vector: Attackers identify and access publicly exposed development endpoints, such as those provided by Spring Boot Actuator, which are intended for monitoring and management during development but should be secured or disabled in production.
*   Mechanism: These endpoints often provide sensitive information about the application's state, environment variables, and even the ability to trigger certain actions. Without proper authentication, attackers can access this information or manipulate the application.
*   Consequences:  Information disclosure (e.g., API keys, database credentials), ability to trigger shutdowns or restarts, and in some cases, even execute arbitrary code depending on the exposed endpoints.
**Weak Authentication/Authorization Configuration:**
*   Attack Vector: Attackers exploit flaws or weaknesses in how the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms are configured.
*   Mechanism: This can include using default credentials, exploiting overly permissive role-based access control (RBAC) configurations, bypassing authentication checks due to misconfigured filters, or exploiting vulnerabilities in custom authentication implementations.
*   Consequences:  Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data, performing actions on behalf of legitimate users, escalating privileges to administrative roles, and potentially taking over user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: GORM Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_gorm_injection.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping) queries, typically through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized or parameterized.
*   Mechanism: When GORM dynamically constructs SQL queries based on untrusted input, the injected SQL code is executed directly against the database.
*   Consequences:  Bypassing authorization checks, accessing or modifying sensitive data, and potentially executing arbitrary database commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Command Injection (Less Common but Possible via Groovy Execution)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_command_injection__less_common_but_possible_via_groovy_execution_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious operating system commands into areas where the application executes Groovy code, particularly if the code involves dynamic execution or interaction with the underlying operating system.
*   Mechanism: If the application uses functions or methods that execute shell commands based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject their own commands.
*   Consequences:  Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, or access sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Expression Language Injection (OGNL/Spring EL)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_expression_language_injection__ognlspring_el_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious expressions into areas where the application evaluates OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) or Spring Expression Language (SpEL), often through user-provided input that is not properly sanitized.
*   Mechanism: When the application evaluates these expressions, the injected malicious code is executed within the context of the application.
*   Consequences:  Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Serialization Vulnerabilities (Due to JVM/Groovy)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_serialization_vulnerabilities__due_to_jvmgroovy_.md)

*   Attack Vector: Attackers provide maliciously crafted serialized Java objects to the application, exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process.
*   Mechanism: When the application deserializes untrusted data, it can trigger the execution of arbitrary code embedded within the malicious object, often through "gadget chains" â€“ sequences of Java classes with unintended side effects during deserialization.
*   Consequences:  Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
