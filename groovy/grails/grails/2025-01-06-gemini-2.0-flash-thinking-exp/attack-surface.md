# Attack Surface Analysis for grails/grails

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment and Data Binding Issues](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment_and_data_binding_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate request parameters to set unintended properties on domain objects or command objects during data binding.
    *   **How Grails Contributes:** Grails' automatic data binding feature, while convenient, can bind request parameters to object properties without explicit whitelisting, leading to unintended modifications.
    *   **Example:** A user submits a form to update their profile. A malicious user adds an extra parameter like `isAdmin=true` to the request. If the `isAdmin` property exists on the domain object and is not protected, Grails might bind this value, elevating the user's privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, bypassing business logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `@Validateable` and explicitly define constraints for domain and command objects.
        *   Employ `bindData` with explicit `includes` or `excludes` lists to control which properties are bound.
        *   Utilize data transfer objects (DTOs) or command objects that only contain the necessary fields for specific actions.
        *   Avoid directly binding request parameters to sensitive domain object properties.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) in GSP](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti__in_gsp.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions that are then executed by the server.
    *   **How Grails Contributes:** Improper use of dynamic GSP tags or allowing user-controlled data directly within GSP expressions can lead to code execution on the server.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses a tag like `<g:render template="${unsafeTemplateName}" />` where `unsafeTemplateName` is derived from user input without sanitization. An attacker could provide a path to a malicious template containing Groovy code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-supplied data directly in dynamic template expressions.
        *   Sanitize and validate user input rigorously before using it in GSP.
        *   Prefer using static includes or rendering specific template paths instead of dynamically constructing them from user input.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Dynamic Finders and Criteria Queries in GORM](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_dynamic_finders_and_criteria_queries_in_gorm.md)

*   **Description:**  Constructing GORM queries using unsanitized user input can lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Grails Contributes:** GORM's dynamic finders (e.g., `findByUsernameLike`) and the ability to build criteria queries programmatically can be vulnerable if user input is directly incorporated without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:** A search functionality uses `User.findByUsernameLike("%${params.search}%")`. An attacker could input `"%'; DROP TABLE users; --"` leading to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always parameterize queries when using dynamic finders or criteria.
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into HQL or SQL strings.
        *   Use GORM's built-in sanitization mechanisms where applicable.
        *   Employ input validation to restrict the characters and format of user-provided search terms.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Grails Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_grails_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party Grails plugins may contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the application.
    *   **How Grails Contributes:** Grails' plugin ecosystem, while offering extensive functionality, introduces a dependency on external code that might not be thoroughly vetted for security.
    *   **Example:** A popular authentication plugin has a known vulnerability allowing password bypass. If the application uses this outdated plugin, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update all Grails plugins to their latest versions to benefit from security patches.
        *   Carefully evaluate the security reputation and maintenance status of plugins before using them.
        *   Consider performing security audits or code reviews of critical plugins.
        *   Explore alternative plugins or implement the required functionality directly if security concerns exist.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration of Security Filters](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration_of_security_filters.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured security filters can leave certain endpoints unprotected or introduce unintended access control issues.
    *   **How Grails Contributes:** Grails allows developers to define and configure security filters to intercept requests. Incorrect configuration of these Grails-specific filters can lead to security gaps.
    *   **Example:** A filter intended to protect administrative endpoints is not applied correctly due to an incorrect URL pattern defined within `grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy`, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test security filter configurations defined in `resources.groovy` or other security configuration files.
        *   Use specific and accurate URL patterns for filter mappings.
        *   Ensure that filters are applied in the correct order to achieve the desired security controls.
        *   Utilize a security framework or plugin that provides a more structured approach to security filter management within the Grails context.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Dependency Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_dependency_management.md)

*   **Description:** Using outdated or vulnerable dependencies can introduce security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Grails Contributes:** Grails relies on dependency management tools like Gradle for managing project dependencies, including transitive dependencies. If these are not regularly updated, or if vulnerable dependencies are introduced through the `build.gradle` file, the application becomes susceptible.
    *   **Example:** The application uses an older version of a logging library declared in `build.gradle` with a known remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update all dependencies declared in `build.gradle` to their latest versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (integrated with Gradle or external) to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and managing dependency updates, including transitive dependencies.
        *   Consider using a dependency management tool or plugin that provides vulnerability scanning and reporting within the Grails/Gradle ecosystem.
