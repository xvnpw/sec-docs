# Threat Model Analysis for grails/grails

## Threat: [Dynamic Finder Injection](./threats/dynamic_finder_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-supplied input that is directly used within GORM's dynamic finders (e.g., `findByUsernameLike`). By crafting malicious input, they could alter the intended query logic to retrieve or modify data they are not authorized to access. For example, an attacker might inject SQL fragments into the parameter intended for the `Like` clause.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, potential data modification or deletion, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** GORM's dynamic finder methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly incorporating user input into dynamic finder names or criteria.
*   Use static finders or the Criteria API for more control over query construction.
*   Sanitize and validate user input rigorously.
*   Employ parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Exploitation](./threats/mass_assignment_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could submit malicious HTTP requests with extra parameters that correspond to internal domain object properties that were not intended to be modified. If not properly protected, GORM's data binding mechanism might inadvertently update these properties.

**Impact:** Modification of sensitive data, privilege escalation (if roles or permissions are modifiable), bypassing business logic.

**Affected Component:** GORM's data binding mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly define which properties are bindable using the `allowedAttributes` constraint in domain classes.
*   Use form objects or command objects to strictly control the data being bound.
*   Avoid directly binding request parameters to domain objects without validation.
*   Mark sensitive properties as `transient` to prevent them from being bound.

## Threat: [Insecure `executeUpdate`/`executeSql` Usage](./threats/insecure__executeupdate__executesql__usage.md)

**Description:** Developers might use `executeUpdate` or `executeSql` to execute raw SQL queries. If user-provided input is concatenated directly into these SQL strings without proper sanitization, it can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.

**Impact:** Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation or deletion, potential for remote code execution on the database server.

**Affected Component:** GORM's `executeUpdate` and `executeSql` methods.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using `executeUpdate` and `executeSql` with user-provided input.
*   Prefer GORM's query methods or the Criteria API.
*   If raw SQL is absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries with placeholders for user input.

## Threat: [Code Injection via `GroovyShell`](./threats/code_injection_via__groovyshell_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `GroovyShell` to execute dynamically generated Groovy code based on user input (e.g., in plugins or custom scripting features), an attacker could inject malicious Groovy code that will be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Groovy's `GroovyShell` class.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using `GroovyShell` with untrusted input.
*   If dynamic code execution is necessary, implement strict sandboxing and input validation.
*   Consider alternative, safer methods for achieving the desired functionality.

## Threat: [Meta-programming Abuse](./threats/meta-programming_abuse.md)

**Description:** Groovy's meta-programming features, while powerful, can be abused by attackers if the application uses them in an insecure manner. For example, an attacker might be able to manipulate object behavior or bypass security checks by modifying meta-classes at runtime.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unexpected application behavior, potential for code injection or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Groovy's meta-programming capabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict the use of meta-programming, especially in security-sensitive areas.
*   Thoroughly review code that utilizes meta-programming for potential security implications.
*   Limit the scope and permissions of meta-programming operations.

## Threat: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the application serializes and deserializes objects (e.g., for sessions, caching, or inter-service communication) and doesn't properly handle untrusted data, it could be vulnerable to object deserialization attacks. An attacker could craft malicious serialized objects that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.

**Affected Component:** Groovy's serialization mechanisms and any libraries used for serialization (e.g., Java's built-in serialization).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
*   If deserialization of untrusted data is unavoidable, use secure serialization libraries and techniques.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using HMAC) to verify the authenticity and integrity of serialized objects.
*   Keep serialization libraries updated to the latest versions.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the application's build configuration or deployment process could introduce a malicious plugin designed to compromise the application or its environment.

**Impact:** Backdoor access, data theft, remote code execution, complete application compromise.

**Affected Component:** Grails' plugin management system (Gradle or Maven).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the application's build process and control access to build configuration files.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to dependencies.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to detect potentially malicious or vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Interceptors via URL Manipulation](./threats/bypassing_security_interceptors_via_url_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If URL mappings and security interceptors (e.g., Spring Security filters) are not configured correctly, attackers might be able to bypass authentication or authorization checks by manipulating URLs or request parameters.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Grails' URL mapping and Spring Security integration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and test URL mappings and security interceptor configurations.
*   Ensure that all sensitive endpoints are protected by appropriate authentication and authorization rules.
*   Avoid relying solely on URL patterns for security; implement robust authorization logic within controllers or services.
