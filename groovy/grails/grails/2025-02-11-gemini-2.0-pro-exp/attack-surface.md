# Attack Surface Analysis for grails/grails

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment (Over-Posting)](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment__over-posting_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers submit extra, unexpected parameters in HTTP requests that map to properties of domain classes or command objects, exploiting Grails' data binding.
*   **How Grails Contributes:** Grails' automatic data binding, while convenient, is the *direct* mechanism enabling this attack if not properly controlled.
*   **Example:** Adding `&isAdmin=true` to a user registration form to gain admin privileges, exploiting Grails' binding to the `User` domain class.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, potentially complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Command Objects:** *Always* use Command Objects for data binding; never bind directly to domain objects in controllers. This is a Grails-specific best practice.
    *   **`allowedFields` / `@Bindable`:**  Explicitly define allowed parameters in Command Objects using `allowedFields` (Grails 3) or the `@Bindable` annotation with constraints (Grails 4+). These are Grails-specific features.
    *   **Parameter Filtering:** Use a whitelist to filter parameters *before* Grails binding occurs.

## Attack Surface: [Method Injection (Dynamic Method Invocation)](./attack_surfaces/method_injection__dynamic_method_invocation_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate input to control which method is called on a Grails object, leveraging Grails' dynamic method dispatch.
*   **How Grails Contributes:** Grails' dynamic nature and Groovy's metaprogramming, specifically the ability to call methods based on string names, are *fundamental* to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A URL parameter `method=deleteUser` being manipulated to `method=grantAdmin`, exploiting Grails' dynamic method lookup.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data leakage, denial of service, potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Method Calls:** Minimize or eliminate dynamic method invocation based on user input. This directly addresses the Grails-specific risk.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Methods:** If dynamic invocation is unavoidable, use a strict whitelist of allowed method names. This mitigates the risk *within* the Grails context.
    *   **Secure URL Mappings:** Use well-defined URL mappings to map URLs to *specific* controller actions, avoiding reliance on dynamic dispatch.

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional GSP Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_gsp_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** User-supplied data is embedded directly within GSP expressions without proper escaping, leading to the execution of arbitrary Groovy code *within the GSP context*.
*   **How Grails Contributes:** GSPs are *inherently* Groovy-based, and this vulnerability is a direct consequence of that. The risk exists because GSPs are processed by Grails.
*   **Example:** Rendering an unescaped user comment containing Groovy code (e.g., `${Runtime.getRuntime().exec('...')}`) directly in a GSP.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Escape User Input:** Use Grails' built-in escaping tags (e.g., `<g:encodeAs ...>`) for *all* user-supplied data in GSPs. This is a Grails-provided defense.
    *   **Avoid `<g:evaluate>`:** Minimize or avoid the `<g:evaluate>` tag, a Grails-specific tag, especially with user data.
    *   **Move Logic to Controllers/Services:** Keep GSPs simple; move complex logic outside of the GSP, reducing the attack surface within the Grails view layer.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Plugins extend Grails functionality but can introduce security vulnerabilities if they are outdated, poorly written, or contain known exploits.
*   **How Grails Contributes:** Grails' plugin architecture makes it easy to add functionality, but also increases the attack surface if plugins are not carefully managed. This is attack surface is introduced by grails plugin system.
*   **Example:** A plugin used for image processing has a known vulnerability that allows remote code execution. An attacker uploads a specially crafted image to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin and vulnerability, but can range from data leakage to complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly research and vet any plugins before using them. Check for known vulnerabilities and security advisories.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update all plugins to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Remove Unused Plugins:** Uninstall any plugins that are not actively used.
    *   **Monitor for Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow security news related to Grails and the plugins you use.
    *   **Consider Forking:** For critical plugins, consider forking the repository and maintaining your own version to ensure timely security updates.
