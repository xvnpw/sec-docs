# Attack Tree Analysis for grails/grails

Objective: To gain unauthorized remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the Grails application, leveraging vulnerabilities specific to the Grails framework or its common usage patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Binding: Mass Assignment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_binding_mass_assignment.md)

*   **Mass Assignment (*** High-Risk Path):
    *   **Description:** Grails' data binding mechanism can be exploited if not properly secured.  Attackers can submit unexpected parameters in HTTP requests, potentially modifying object properties they shouldn't have access to. This can lead to privilege escalation, data corruption, or indirectly contribute to RCE.
    *   **Example:** A form intended to update a user's `email` might be manipulated to also set `isAdmin=true`, granting the attacker administrative privileges.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Common development oversight)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the exposed properties)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review or dynamic analysis)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use `params.bindData()` with a strict whitelist of allowed properties.  Example: `user.properties = params.bindData(user, ['email'])`
        *   Employ command objects to define a clear contract for expected input data.
        *   Avoid direct use of `params` for updates without thorough validation.
        *   Conduct regular code reviews focusing on data binding.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Binding: Insecure Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_binding_insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Insecure Deserialization (if using Java Serialization) (!!! Critical Node):
    *   **Description:** If the application uses Java serialization to handle data (e.g., in sessions, databases, or API calls), it's vulnerable to insecure deserialization. Attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted serialized object that, upon deserialization, executes a system command.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Less common in modern Grails, but *critical* if present)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Direct RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires crafting a malicious payload)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires specialized tools; often not visible in logs)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Avoid Java serialization whenever possible. Prefer JSON or XML with strict schema validation.
        *   If unavoidable, implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes for deserialization. Use tools like Apache Commons IO's `ValidatingObjectInputStream`.
        *   Keep all serialization-related libraries (and the Java runtime) up-to-date.
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious deserialization activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities: Vulnerable 3rd-Party Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities_vulnerable_3rd-party_library.md)

*   **Vulnerable 3rd-Party Library (within a Plugin) (!!! Critical Node & *** High-Risk Path):
    *   **Description:** Grails plugins often rely on external libraries. If a plugin uses a vulnerable library, the entire application inherits that vulnerability. This is a very common attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A plugin uses an outdated version of a logging library with a known RCE vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common; depends on plugin dependencies and update frequency)
    *   **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the library vulnerability; can range from low to Very High, including RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Often involves exploiting known vulnerabilities)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Dependency checkers can identify vulnerable libraries; exploitation might be harder to detect)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use dependency checkers (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) and integrate them into the build process.
        *   Regularly update all plugins and their dependencies.
        *   Carefully vet plugins before use; check their security history and community support.
