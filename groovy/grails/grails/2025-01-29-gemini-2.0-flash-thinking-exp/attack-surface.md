# Attack Surface Analysis for grails/grails

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposed_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, and internal application settings, is exposed through configuration files.
*   **Grails Contribution:** Grails uses configuration files like `application.yml`, `application.groovy`, and `BuildConfig.groovy` to manage application settings. If these files are not properly secured or are inadvertently exposed, they become an attack surface *directly due to Grails' configuration management approach*.
*   **Example:** A developer commits `application.yml` with database credentials directly to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the repository, extracts the credentials, and gains unauthorized access to the application's database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to backend systems, compromise of application secrets.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure File Permissions:** Restrict access to configuration files on the server using appropriate file system permissions.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Utilize environment variables or externalized configuration management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Spring Cloud Config) to store sensitive data instead of hardcoding it in files.
    *   **Configuration Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive values within configuration files if they must be stored there.
    *   **Version Control Exclusion:** Ensure configuration files containing secrets are excluded from version control systems (using `.gitignore` or similar).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Gradle)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies__gradle_.md)

*   **Description:** Grails applications rely on external libraries and plugins managed by Gradle. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **Grails Contribution:** Grails *mandates* Gradle for dependency management, including Grails plugins and general Java/Groovy libraries.  If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, the Grails application inherits them *due to Grails' dependency management system*.
*   **Example:** A Grails application uses an outdated version of a logging library (e.g., Log4j) with a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through the application.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, and other vulnerabilities depending on the dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability and its exploitability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Sonatype Nexus Lifecycle) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep dependencies updated to the latest stable versions, including Grails plugins and core libraries.
    *   **Dependency Management Best Practices:** Use dependency management tools effectively, manage transitive dependencies, and consider using dependency lock files to ensure consistent builds.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and monitor for newly discovered vulnerabilities in used dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [GORM Dynamic Finders and Mass Assignment](./attack_surfaces/gorm_dynamic_finders_and_mass_assignment.md)

*   **Description:** GORM's dynamic finders and automatic data binding can lead to mass assignment vulnerabilities if not carefully controlled, allowing attackers to modify unintended data fields.
*   **Grails Contribution:** GORM is the *default ORM in Grails*. GORM's dynamic finders (e.g., `findByUsernameLike`) and automatic data binding features simplify database interactions but can introduce security risks if input validation and data binding are not properly managed *due to GORM's design within Grails*.
*   **Example:** A user registration form allows binding all request parameters to a `User` domain object. An attacker sends a malicious request with an additional parameter like `isAdmin=true`. If the `isAdmin` field is not properly protected, the attacker can elevate their privileges to administrator.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, privilege escalation, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the sensitivity of the affected fields) - *Including as High due to potential for privilege escalation*.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Whitelist Data Binding:** Explicitly define allowed fields for data binding using `bindData` options or command objects with validation rules.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to sanitize and validate user-provided data before binding it to domain objects.
    *   **Field Level Security:** Use GORM constraints or application logic to enforce field-level security and prevent unauthorized modification of sensitive fields.
    *   **Command Objects:** Utilize command objects as intermediaries for data binding and validation, separating data transfer from domain objects.

## Attack Surface: [GSP Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./attack_surfaces/gsp_server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of user input within GSP templates can lead to Server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Grails Contribution:** GSP is the *default templating engine in Grails*. If user input is directly embedded into GSP templates without proper escaping, SSTI vulnerabilities can occur *due to GSP's template processing within Grails*.
*   **Example:** A GSP template dynamically renders a message using user input directly: `<h1>Welcome, ${params.username}</h1>`. An attacker injects a malicious payload like `${''.getClass().forName('java.lang.Runtime').getRuntime().exec('whoami')}` into the `username` parameter, potentially executing arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Always escape user input when rendering it in GSP templates using appropriate escaping mechanisms provided by GSP (e.g., `<g:escapeHtml>`, `<g:escapeJavaScript>`).
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Execution in Templates:** Minimize or eliminate the need for dynamic code execution within templates.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate the impact of successful SSTI by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Template Security Audits:** Regularly audit GSP templates for potential SSTI vulnerabilities, especially when handling user input.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Controller Actions](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_controller_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Controller actions and endpoints are not properly secured with authentication and authorization, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
*   **Grails Contribution:** Grails controllers *are the primary mechanism for handling web requests in Grails applications*. If actions are not protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms, they become publicly accessible, even if they are intended for internal or administrative use *due to the way controllers are designed in Grails*.
*   **Example:** An administrative controller action `/admin/deleteUser` is not protected by authentication or role-based authorization. Any user can access this endpoint and potentially delete user accounts.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication (e.g., Spring Security plugin) to verify user identity and authorization to control access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **URL Mapping Security:** Carefully define URL mappings and apply security constraints at the controller or action level.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to manage user permissions and restrict access to actions based on roles.
    *   **Security Interceptors/Filters:** Utilize interceptors or filters to enforce security policies and checks before controller actions are executed.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Grails Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_grails_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Grails applications rely on plugins to extend functionality. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can introduce security flaws into the application.
*   **Grails Contribution:** Grails has a *plugin-centric architecture*. Using vulnerable or malicious plugins *directly impacts the security of the Grails application because plugins are a core part of extending Grails functionality*.
*   **Example:** A Grails application uses a popular but outdated plugin that contains a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through the plugin's functionality.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting, remote code execution, data breach, and other vulnerabilities depending on the plugin vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the plugin vulnerability and its usage) - *Including as High due to potential for RCE or Data Breach depending on plugin vulnerability*.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully vet plugins before using them, considering their source, maintainability, and community reputation.
    *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Plugin Security Audits:** Regularly audit used plugins for known vulnerabilities and security best practices.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only use necessary plugins and avoid using plugins from untrusted or unverified sources.
    *   **Plugin Security Scanners:** Utilize plugin security scanners if available to identify potential vulnerabilities in plugins.
