# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Grails framework aims to simplify and accelerate web application development on the JVM by providing a convention-over-configuration approach.
  - It targets developers who want to build robust and scalable web applications quickly, leveraging Groovy and the Spring ecosystem.
  - The project prioritizes developer productivity, ease of use, and integration with existing Java and Spring technologies.
  - A key goal is to maintain a vibrant and active open-source community around the framework, ensuring its continued evolution and support.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could impact all applications built with Grails, leading to widespread security incidents.
  - Lack of adoption or community support could lead to the framework becoming outdated and less secure over time.
  - Compatibility issues with evolving Java and Spring ecosystems could hinder development and introduce security risks.
  - Improper use of the framework by developers could lead to insecure applications, even if the framework itself is secure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Framework Security Features: Grails leverages Spring Security for authentication and authorization, providing a robust and widely adopted security foundation. (Implemented within the Grails framework core and plugins)
  - security control: Input Validation: Grails encourages input validation through data binding and domain class constraints, helping developers prevent common input-based vulnerabilities. (Documented in Grails documentation and guides)
  - security control: Output Encoding: Grails uses Groovy Server Pages (GSP) which by default provide some level of output encoding to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. (Implicitly implemented in GSP rendering engine)
  - security control: Dependency Management: Grails uses Gradle for dependency management, allowing for control over included libraries and their versions. (Managed through Gradle build scripts)
  - security control: Secure Defaults: Grails aims to provide secure defaults where possible, reducing the likelihood of developers introducing vulnerabilities through misconfiguration. (Design principle of the framework)
  - accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies: Grails relies on numerous third-party libraries, including Spring and others. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect Grails applications. (Acknowledged risk of using open-source ecosystems)
  - accepted risk: Developer Security Practices: The security of applications built with Grails heavily depends on the security awareness and practices of the developers using the framework. (External factor, developer responsibility)

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the Grails build process to automatically detect potential security vulnerabilities in the framework code and in applications built with Grails.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning: Implement dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor and identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Grails and Grails applications.
  - security control: Penetration Testing: Conduct regular penetration testing of Grails framework and example applications to identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Security Code Reviews: Implement mandatory security code reviews for all contributions to the Grails framework to ensure code quality and security.
  - security control: Security Training for Developers: Provide security training and resources for Grails developers to promote secure coding practices and awareness of common web application vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Grails applications should support various authentication mechanisms, including username/password, OAuth 2.0, and SAML, to accommodate different application needs.
    - Requirement: Authentication mechanisms should be configurable and extensible to allow integration with different identity providers.
    - Requirement: Grails should provide secure session management to protect authenticated user sessions from hijacking and other attacks.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Grails applications should implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access to resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Authorization policies should be clearly defined and easily manageable.
    - Requirement: Grails should provide mechanisms to enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Grails applications must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting, etc.) and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both client-side and server-side to ensure comprehensive protection.
    - Requirement: Grails should provide convenient and robust input validation mechanisms that are easy for developers to use.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Grails applications should use strong cryptography for protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - Requirement: Cryptographic operations should be performed using well-vetted and secure cryptographic libraries.
    - Requirement: Grails should provide guidance and best practices for developers on how to properly implement cryptography in their applications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For Grails framework itself: Maintaining the integrity and availability of the framework to ensure developers can build secure and reliable applications.
  - For applications built with Grails: The critical business processes depend on the specific application. Examples include e-commerce transactions, user data management, content delivery, and API services. The framework should not introduce vulnerabilities that could compromise these processes.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - For Grails framework itself: Source code of the framework is sensitive and needs to be protected from unauthorized access and modification.
  - For applications built with Grails: Data sensitivity depends on the application. It can range from publicly accessible content to highly sensitive personal data, financial information, or intellectual property. Grails applications need to be designed and built to protect the sensitivity of the data they handle.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific compliance requirements for applications built with Grails (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?
  - What is the expected threat landscape for applications built with Grails? Are there specific threat actors or attack vectors to be particularly concerned about?
  - What are the performance and scalability requirements for Grails applications? How do security controls impact these requirements?
  - What is the process for reporting and patching security vulnerabilities in the Grails framework and applications?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that developer productivity and ease of use are high priorities for the Grails project, but security is also a critical concern.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that basic security controls like framework security features and input validation are already in place or considered. The focus is on recommending additional controls and highlighting security requirements.
  - DESIGN: It is assumed that Grails applications are typically deployed in a standard web application architecture, involving application servers, databases, and load balancers. The build process is assumed to involve CI/CD pipelines and artifact repositories.
