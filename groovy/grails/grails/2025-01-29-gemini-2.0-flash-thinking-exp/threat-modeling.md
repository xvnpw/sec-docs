# Threat Model Analysis for grails/grails

## Threat: [Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_transitive_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities within the extensive dependency tree of a Grails application, including transitive dependencies managed by Grails and Spring Boot.  Grails' dependency management, while convenient, can make it harder to identify and track vulnerabilities deep within the dependency graph. Exploitation occurs by triggering vulnerable code paths in these dependencies through malicious requests or data.

**Impact:** Application compromise, remote code execution, data breach, denial of service.

**Grails Component Affected:** Dependency Management, Spring Boot integration, Underlying Java/Groovy Libraries.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit and update dependencies using the `dependencyUpdates` Grails plugin.
* Integrate dependency scanning tools (like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerabilities.
* Establish a process for promptly patching vulnerable dependencies identified by scanning tools or security advisories.
* Monitor security advisories related to Spring Boot, Groovy, and common Java libraries used in Grails applications.

## Threat: [Groovy Meta-programming Exploits](./threats/groovy_meta-programming_exploits.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage Groovy's dynamic meta-programming capabilities, a core feature of Grails, to execute arbitrary code. By injecting malicious code snippets into input fields or manipulating request parameters processed by dynamic Groovy features (e.g., `Eval`, `MetaClass` manipulation within Grails controllers or services), attackers can bypass security controls and gain full control of the application.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), arbitrary code execution, security bypass, complete server takeover.

**Grails Component Affected:** Groovy Language Runtime, Dynamic Features inherent in Grails, Controllers, Services, GSP (Groovy Server Pages).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly avoid using dynamic Groovy features to process untrusted user input within Grails controllers, services, or GSP views.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before using it in any meta-programming operations within Grails code.
* Adhere to secure coding practices for dynamic languages, emphasizing input validation and output encoding within the Grails context.
* Consider using static compilation features of Groovy where feasible within Grails projects to minimize reliance on dynamic features in critical sections.

## Threat: [Groovy Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/groovy_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit insecure deserialization of Groovy objects within a Grails application.  They craft malicious serialized Groovy objects and send them to the application, potentially via HTTP requests or file uploads. When the Grails application deserializes these objects using default Groovy or Java serialization mechanisms, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server due to vulnerabilities in the deserialization process itself.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), arbitrary code execution, complete server compromise, data exfiltration.

**Grails Component Affected:** Groovy Language Runtime, Serialization/Deserialization mechanisms used by Grails, Controllers, Services, potentially GORM data handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Completely avoid deserializing untrusted data within Grails applications.
* If deserialization is absolutely necessary, use secure and well-vetted serialization libraries that are resistant to deserialization attacks.
* Implement strict input validation and whitelisting for any data that must be deserialized within Grails.
* Keep Groovy and the underlying JVM updated to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities that may affect Grails applications.

## Threat: [GORM Injection (GQL Injection)](./threats/gorm_injection__gql_injection_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Grails Object Relational Mapping (GORM) queries, specifically targeting Grails Query Language (GQL). By manipulating user input that is incorporated into dynamically constructed GORM queries within Grails controllers or services, attackers can alter the intended query logic. This allows them to bypass authorization checks, access sensitive data they shouldn't, or modify data in unintended ways, similar to SQL injection but specific to GORM.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential privilege escalation within the application.

**Grails Component Affected:** GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping), Data Access Layer, Controllers, Services, Domain Classes.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always utilize parameterized queries or the GORM Criteria API when constructing database queries in Grails, completely avoiding string concatenation of user input directly into GQL queries.
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input that is used in any GORM queries, even when employing the Criteria API, to prevent unexpected query modifications.
* Apply strict input validation rules based on the expected data types and formats for all query parameters used in GORM operations within Grails.
* Implement the principle of least privilege for database access, ensuring the Grails application's database user has only the necessary permissions.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Grails Plugins](./threats/vulnerable_grails_plugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities present in third-party Grails plugins that are integrated into the application. Grails' plugin ecosystem, while beneficial, relies on community-developed plugins which may contain security flaws. Attackers target known vulnerabilities in plugin code, which can be exploited through various attack vectors depending on the plugin's functionality and exposed interfaces within the Grails application.

**Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, potentially remote code execution, depending on the nature of the plugin vulnerability.

**Grails Component Affected:** Grails Plugin Ecosystem, Plugins themselves, Application Dependencies introduced by plugins, potentially Controllers and Services if plugins expose endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully evaluate the security posture of Grails plugins before incorporating them into the application, considering factors like plugin popularity, maintainership, security track record, and community feedback.
* Maintain a regular plugin update schedule, ensuring all used plugins are updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for all Grails plugins used in the application.
* Consider performing security audits or code reviews of plugins, especially those that handle sensitive data or provide critical functionalities within the Grails application.

## Threat: [Accidental Scaffolding Exposure in Production](./threats/accidental_scaffolding_exposure_in_production.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized administrative access by exploiting accidentally exposed Grails scaffolding interfaces in production environments. Grails scaffolding, intended for rapid development, provides administrative interfaces for CRUD operations on domain classes. If left enabled in production, these interfaces become publicly accessible, allowing attackers to bypass application security and directly manipulate data, potentially leading to full application compromise.

**Impact:** Full application compromise, data breach, unauthorized administrative access, complete data manipulation and deletion, potential for denial of service.

**Grails Component Affected:** Scaffolding Feature, Controllers generated by scaffolding, Grails Configuration settings.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure scaffolding is explicitly and definitively disabled in production Grails environments by setting `grails.scaffolding.enabled: false` in the `application.yml` or `application.groovy` configuration file for production.
* Implement robust configuration management practices to prevent accidental enabling of scaffolding during deployment to production environments.
* Regularly review the application configuration specifically for production deployments to verify that scaffolding is disabled and remains disabled.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations (Sensitive Keys)](./threats/insecure_default_configurations__sensitive_keys_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit insecure default configurations within Grails applications, specifically targeting default secret keys or other sensitive configuration values that are not properly changed from default settings.  Default secret keys, if known or easily guessed, can be used to bypass security mechanisms, forge signatures, or gain unauthorized access to protected resources within the Grails application.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, session hijacking, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities, potential for privilege escalation.

**Grails Component Affected:** Grails Configuration system, Security Settings, Session Management, potentially other modules relying on secret keys.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and harden all default configurations for production deployments of Grails applications.
* Immediately change all default secret keys, API keys, and passwords to strong, randomly generated values during the initial setup and deployment process.
* Securely manage and store sensitive configuration values, avoiding hardcoding them directly in the application code or configuration files. Consider using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
* Regularly audit and rotate secret keys and other sensitive configuration values as part of a security best practices program for Grails applications.
