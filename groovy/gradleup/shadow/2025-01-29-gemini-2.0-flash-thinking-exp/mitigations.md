# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gradleup/shadow

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Shadow's Dependency Transform Capabilities (Relocate and Shade)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_shadow's_dependency_transform_capabilities__relocate_and_shade_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Potential Class Name Collisions:** Analyze dependencies for potential class name collisions, especially when merging libraries with overlapping namespaces or when using different versions of the same library.
    2.  **Configure `relocate` Transforms:** In your Shadow configuration, use the `relocate` transform to rename packages and classes of specific dependencies. Target dependencies that are likely to cause collisions or those you want to isolate within your application's namespace.
    3.  **Configure `shade` Transforms (Less Common, More Risky):**  Use `shade` transforms with caution. `shade` can rename classes within a dependency, which is more complex and can potentially break functionality if not done correctly. Use it only when `relocate` is insufficient and with thorough testing.
    4.  **Thoroughly Test After Applying Transforms:** After configuring `relocate` or `shade` transforms, perform extensive testing of your application. Ensure that the transforms haven't broken any functionality and that dependencies still work as expected.
    5.  **Document Transform Configurations:** Clearly document the `relocate` and `shade` transforms applied in your Shadow configuration, explaining the reasons behind them and any potential implications.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Class Name Collisions (High Severity):**  Transforms directly address class name collisions, preventing runtime errors and unexpected behavior caused by conflicting classes.
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Spoofing (Medium Severity):**  `relocate` can offer a degree of namespace isolation, making it slightly harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities by relying on specific class names in dependencies.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Class Name Collisions:** Significantly Reduces risk. Transforms are a direct solution to class name collisions when configured correctly.
        *   **Dependency Confusion/Spoofing:** Minimally Reduces risk.  Provides a slight layer of obfuscation but is not a primary defense against sophisticated attacks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. `relocate` or `shade` transforms are not currently used in the Shadow configuration.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Analyze dependencies for potential class name collisions. Implement `relocate` transforms for dependencies that are known to cause conflicts or are considered high-risk. Document the rationale and configuration of any applied transforms.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Shadow Plugin Integrity](./mitigation_strategies/verify_shadow_plugin_integrity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use a Trusted Source:** Obtain the Shadow Gradle plugin from a reputable source, such as the official Gradle Plugin Portal or Maven Central.
    2.  **Verify Plugin Checksum/Signature:** Before using the Shadow plugin, verify its checksum or digital signature against the official published values. This ensures that the plugin hasn't been tampered with during download or distribution.
    3.  **Pin Plugin Version:** Explicitly declare and pin the version of the Shadow Gradle plugin in your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file. Avoid using dynamic version ranges for plugins.
    4.  **Regularly Review Plugin Updates:** Monitor for updates to the Shadow Gradle plugin and review release notes for security fixes or improvements. Update the plugin version periodically, verifying the integrity of the new version.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromised Build Plugin (High Severity):** Verifying plugin integrity prevents using a compromised version of the Shadow plugin that could inject malicious code into the build process.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Direct Mitigation - High Severity):**  Ensuring the integrity of the build plugin is a direct defense against supply chain attacks targeting build tools.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Compromised Build Plugin:** Significantly Reduces risk. Plugin verification is a crucial step in ensuring the trustworthiness of build tools.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Significantly Reduces risk. Directly mitigates the risk of using a compromised build plugin in the supply chain.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. The Shadow plugin is obtained from Maven Central, but checksum/signature verification is not routinely performed. Plugin version is pinned in `build.gradle.kts`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a process for verifying the checksum or signature of the Shadow Gradle plugin during setup or updates. Document the plugin verification process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Configure Shadow's Inclusion and Exclusion Rules](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_configure_shadow's_inclusion_and_exclusion_rules.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Inclusion/Exclusion:** Understand Shadow's default inclusion and exclusion rules. Be aware of what is included and excluded by default.
    2.  **Define Explicit Inclusion/Exclusion:**  Explicitly configure inclusion and exclusion rules in your Shadow configuration using `from`, `include`, `exclude`, and `mergeServiceFiles` directives. Avoid relying solely on defaults.
    3.  **Minimize Included Resources:** Only include necessary resources in the Shadow JAR. Exclude development artifacts, configuration files, sensitive data, and unnecessary files that are not required for runtime execution.
    4.  **Regularly Review Configuration:** Periodically review your Shadow inclusion and exclusion configuration to ensure it remains appropriate and doesn't inadvertently include sensitive or unnecessary files.
    5.  **Test JAR Contents:** After building the Shadow JAR, inspect its contents to verify that only intended files are included and that no sensitive or unwanted files are present.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Accidentally including sensitive data or configuration files in the Shadow JAR can lead to information disclosure if the JAR is exposed.
        *   **Increased Attack Surface (Low Severity):** Including unnecessary files can slightly increase the attack surface by providing more potential targets for attackers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderately Reduces risk. Careful configuration minimizes the chance of accidentally including sensitive data.
        *   **Increased Attack Surface:** Minimally Reduces risk. Reduces the attack surface by excluding unnecessary files, but the impact is generally low unless sensitive files are involved.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic inclusion/exclusion rules are configured, but not regularly reviewed or optimized.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a thorough review of Shadow inclusion/exclusion configuration. Optimize rules to minimize included resources. Implement a process for regularly reviewing and updating the configuration. Document the configuration and rationale behind inclusion/exclusion rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Output Verification (JAR Content Scanning)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_output_verification__jar_content_scanning_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Develop Automated JAR Content Scanning:** Create automated scripts or tools to scan the generated Shadow JAR after the build process.
    2.  **Scan for Sensitive Information:** Configure the scanning tool to search for patterns or keywords that indicate the presence of sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, internal paths, development comments).
    3.  **Validate JAR Structure:** Verify the expected structure of the JAR file. Check for the presence of necessary files and the absence of unexpected files.
    4.  **Integrate Scanning into CI/CD:** Integrate the JAR content scanning into your CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to fail the build or generate alerts if sensitive information or unexpected content is detected.
    5.  **Regularly Update Scanning Rules:** Keep the scanning rules and patterns up-to-date to detect new types of sensitive information or changes in expected JAR structure.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Output verification helps detect accidental inclusion of sensitive information in the Shadow JAR before deployment.
        *   **Build Process Anomalies (Low Severity):**  Verification can detect unexpected changes in JAR structure, potentially indicating build process anomalies or unintended inclusions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderately Reduces risk. Automated scanning provides a safety net to catch accidental inclusion of sensitive data.
        *   **Build Process Anomalies:** Minimally Reduces risk. Can detect anomalies, but primarily serves as a sanity check rather than a strong security control.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. Automated JAR content scanning is not currently performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Develop and implement automated JAR content scanning. Integrate scanning into the CI/CD pipeline. Define scanning rules for sensitive information and JAR structure validation. Document the output verification process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Document Included Dependencies and Licenses](./mitigation_strategies/document_included_dependencies_and_licenses.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Shadow Manifest Configuration:** Configure Shadow to include dependency information in the JAR's `MANIFEST.MF` file. This can include dependency names, versions, and potentially licenses.
    2.  **Generate Dependency License Reports:** Use Gradle plugins or external tools to generate reports listing all included dependencies and their licenses. (While report generation is not Shadow specific, the *need* for it is amplified by Shadow merging).
    3.  **Include License Information in Distribution:**  Include license information (e.g., a `LICENSE` file or a dedicated dependency license file) alongside the Shadow JAR in your application distribution.
    4.  **Maintain a Dependency Inventory:** Maintain a separate inventory of all third-party dependencies used in your project, including their licenses and sources. (While inventory is not Shadow specific, the *complexity* is increased by Shadow merging).
    5.  **Regularly Review License Compliance:** Periodically review your dependency licenses to ensure compliance with their terms and conditions. (While review is not Shadow specific, the *scope* is impacted by Shadow merging).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **License Violations (Legal/Reputational Risk - Low Security Impact):** While not a direct security threat, license violations can lead to legal issues and reputational damage. Transparency and documentation help mitigate this risk, and Shadow makes license tracking more complex.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **License Violations:** Significantly Reduces risk. Clear documentation and manifest inclusion make license tracking and compliance much easier, especially in the context of Shadow's dependency merging.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Dependency licenses are generally tracked, but not systematically documented or included in the JAR manifest or distribution.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Configure Shadow to include dependency information in `MANIFEST.MF`. Implement automated generation of dependency license reports. Include license information in the application distribution. Document the process for maintaining dependency inventory and ensuring license compliance.
