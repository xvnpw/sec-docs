# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the Shadow Gradle Plugin, aims to simplify the distribution and execution of Java and Kotlin applications by creating a single, self-contained JAR file (shadow JAR) that includes all application dependencies. This addresses the common problem of managing complex dependency trees and potential conflicts during deployment.

- Business Priorities:
  - Simplify application deployment process.
  - Reduce dependency conflicts and runtime errors related to classpath issues.
  - Potentially improve application startup time by reducing classpath scanning.
  - Streamline the distribution of applications, especially libraries and command-line tools.

- Business Risks:
  - Dependency confusion: Incorrectly packaging dependencies could lead to runtime issues or unexpected behavior.
  - Vulnerabilities in included dependencies: Packaging all dependencies into a single JAR increases the attack surface if vulnerable dependencies are included.
  - Increased JAR size: Shadow JARs can be significantly larger than traditional JARs, potentially impacting storage and download times.
  - Build complexity: Introducing a new build plugin adds complexity to the build process and requires developer understanding.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The Shadow Gradle Plugin itself is a build tool component. Security considerations primarily revolve around the secure development and distribution of the plugin, and the security implications of using the plugin to build applications.

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository access control and vulnerability scanning. (Implemented: GitHub)
  - security control: Gradle build system is used for building and publishing the plugin. (Implemented: build.gradle.kts)
  - security control: Plugin distributed through Maven Central or Gradle Plugin Portal. (Implemented: Publishing process)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of third-party dependencies used by the plugin itself.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in the plugin code itself.
  - accepted risk: Security of the build environment where the plugin is used is outside the scope of the plugin itself.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated vulnerability scanning of the plugin's dependencies during development and release process.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the plugin's build process to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the plugin releases to enhance transparency and allow users to assess dependency risks.
  - security control: Provide documentation and guidance to users on secure usage of the plugin, including dependency management best practices and vulnerability scanning of generated shadow JARs.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Access to the plugin's source code repository on GitHub should be controlled via GitHub's authentication mechanisms.
    - Publishing to Maven Central or Gradle Plugin Portal requires appropriate credentials and secure publishing processes.
  - Authorization:
    - Access to the plugin's source code repository should be granted based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Publishing rights should be restricted to authorized individuals or systems.
  - Input Validation:
    - The plugin should validate inputs from Gradle build scripts to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to malicious configurations. This includes validating dependency configurations, relocation rules, and other plugin parameters.
  - Cryptography:
    - Cryptography is not directly a core requirement for the plugin itself. However, if the plugin handles sensitive data or implements features requiring secure communication in the future, appropriate cryptographic measures should be implemented. For now, reliance on HTTPS for dependency downloads and plugin distribution is sufficient.

# DESIGN

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software development and build process for projects using the Shadow Gradle Plugin.
  - Distribution of software artifacts built with the Shadow Gradle Plugin.

- Data to Protect:
  - Plugin source code (Sensitivity: Confidential, Integrity: High, Availability: High).
  - Plugin build artifacts (Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High, Availability: High).
  - Dependencies of the plugin (Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High, Availability: High).
  - Configuration of the plugin and build process (Sensitivity: Confidential, Integrity: High, Availability: High).

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Plugin source code is considered confidential as it represents intellectual property and potential vulnerabilities could be exploited if exposed.
  - Plugin build artifacts are intended for public distribution but integrity is critical to ensure users are not downloading compromised or malicious versions.
  - Dependencies are generally public but their integrity and availability are crucial for the build process.
  - Configuration details can be sensitive if they expose internal infrastructure or security practices.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific security requirements of projects that will use the Shadow Gradle Plugin? (e.g., compliance requirements, industry standards).
  - What is the intended deployment environment for applications built with the Shadow Gradle Plugin? (e.g., cloud, on-premise, containers).
  - Are there any specific organizational security policies or guidelines that need to be considered for the plugin development and distribution?
  - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities found in the Shadow Gradle Plugin?

- Assumptions:
  - The primary goal of using the Shadow Gradle Plugin is to simplify deployment and dependency management for Java/Kotlin applications.
  - Security is a secondary but important consideration for the plugin and its users.
  - Users of the plugin are expected to have a basic understanding of Gradle and Java/Kotlin build processes.
  - The plugin will be distributed through public repositories (Gradle Plugin Portal and Maven Central).
  - The development and build process will leverage GitHub and GitHub Actions.
