## Attack Tree Path: [**1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Using Shadow Jar [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_using_shadow_jar__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application.
*   **Criticality:** Highest, as it represents complete failure of application security.
*   **Mitigation:** All security measures aim to prevent reaching this goal. Focus on securing all attack paths leading to this node.

## Attack Tree Path: [**2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Build Process Vulnerabilities (Shadow Jar Integration) [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__exploit_build_process_vulnerabilities__shadow_jar_integration___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromise Build Environment (Critical Node)
    *   Malicious Dependency Injection during Build (Critical Node)

## Attack Tree Path: [**3. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Build Environment [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__compromise_build_environment__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The build environment (CI/CD pipelines, developer machines) is a critical infrastructure. Compromise grants attackers control over the software supply chain.
*   **Criticality:** High, as it enables multiple attack vectors and long-term persistence.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromise CI/CD Pipeline (High Risk Path)
    *   Compromise Developer Machine (High Risk Path)

## Attack Tree Path: [**4. [HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__compromise_cicd_pipeline__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target the CI/CD system to inject malicious code or manipulate the build process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject malicious build steps into CI/CD configuration:**
        *   **Description:** Directly modify the CI/CD configuration files to include malicious commands or scripts that are executed during the build process. This can involve adding steps to download and include malicious dependencies, modify source code, or inject backdoors into the final Shadow JAR.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [**5. [HIGH RISK PATH] Compromise Developer Machine**](./attack_tree_paths/5___high_risk_path__compromise_developer_machine.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target developer workstations to gain access to code, credentials, or the build environment.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (can escalate to High if build environment access is gained)
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Phishing/Social Engineering developer credentials:**
        *   **Description:** Tricking developers into revealing their credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) through phishing emails, fake login pages, or social engineering tactics. Compromised credentials can be used to access developer resources and potentially the build environment.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit vulnerabilities on developer's workstation:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting software vulnerabilities (operating system, applications, browser plugins) on developer machines to gain unauthorized access. This can be achieved through drive-by downloads, malicious attachments, or exploiting known vulnerabilities in unpatched software.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [**6. [HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Dependency Injection during Build [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/6___high_risk_path__malicious_dependency_injection_during_build__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious dependencies into the project's dependency tree during the build process, which Shadow Jar then bundles into the final artifact.
*   **Criticality:** High, as it directly injects malicious code into the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Dependency Confusion Attack:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting the dependency resolution mechanism to trick the build system into downloading a malicious dependency from a public repository instead of a legitimate internal/private dependency. This is especially effective when internal dependency names are guessable or leaked. Shadow Jar will bundle this malicious dependency.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [**7. [HIGH RISK PATH] Bundling Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/7___high_risk_path__bundling_vulnerable_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Shadow Jar bundles all dependencies, including potentially vulnerable ones. If vulnerable dependencies are included, the application becomes vulnerable.
*   **Criticality:** High, as it directly introduces known vulnerabilities into the deployed application.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [**8. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfiguration of Shadow Jar by Developers [CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/8___high_risk_path__exploit_misconfiguration_of_shadow_jar_by_developers__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Relocation Rules:**
        *   **Description:** Poorly designed relocation rules can bypass security checks that rely on package names or introduce logic errors leading to vulnerabilities.
