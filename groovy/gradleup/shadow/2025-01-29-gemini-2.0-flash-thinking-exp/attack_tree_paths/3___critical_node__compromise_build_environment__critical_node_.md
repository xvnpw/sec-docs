## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Build Environment

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Compromise Build Environment" attack tree path, focusing on its implications for applications built using tools like `shadow` (specifically, the Gradle Shadow Jar plugin).

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with compromising the build environment of an application. This includes:

*   **Identifying potential attack vectors** within the build environment.
*   **Analyzing the impact** of a successful compromise on the application and the wider software supply chain.
*   **Developing mitigation strategies** to reduce the likelihood and impact of such attacks.
*   **Contextualizing the analysis** to applications utilizing `shadow` and highlighting any specific considerations.

Ultimately, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights for the development team to strengthen the security of their build environment and protect against supply chain attacks.

### 2. Scope of Analysis

This deep analysis is scoped to the following attack tree path:

**3. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Build Environment [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Description:** The build environment (CI/CD pipelines, developer machines) is a critical infrastructure. Compromise grants attackers control over the software supply chain.
*   **Criticality:** High, as it enables multiple attack vectors and long-term persistence.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromise CI/CD Pipeline (High Risk Path)
    *   Compromise Developer Machine (High Risk Path)

The analysis will delve into each of these attack vectors, exploring potential vulnerabilities, attack methodologies, and effective countermeasures.  While the context is applications using `shadow`, the core principles and vulnerabilities discussed are broadly applicable to software development in general.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology for this deep analysis will involve the following steps:

1.  **Attack Vector Breakdown:** For each attack vector (CI/CD Pipeline and Developer Machine), we will:
    *   **Detail potential attack steps:**  Outline the stages an attacker might take to compromise the target.
    *   **Identify common vulnerabilities:**  List typical weaknesses and misconfigurations that attackers exploit.
    *   **Assess the impact of successful compromise:**  Analyze the consequences for the application, organization, and users.
    *   **Propose mitigation strategies:**  Recommend security measures to prevent or detect attacks and minimize their impact.

2.  **Contextualization to `shadow`:**  Specifically consider how a compromised build environment can affect applications using `shadow`. This includes understanding how attackers might leverage control over the build process to inject malicious code into the final shaded JAR artifact produced by `shadow`.

3.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the overall risk associated with each attack vector, considering both likelihood and impact.

4.  **Prioritization of Mitigations:**  Based on the risk assessment, prioritize mitigation strategies for implementation by the development team.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Build Environment

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Compromise CI/CD Pipeline (High Risk Path)

**4.1.1. Detailed Attack Steps:**

An attacker aiming to compromise the CI/CD pipeline might follow these steps:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** Gather information about the CI/CD platform, its configuration, and exposed services. This could involve scanning for open ports, identifying used technologies (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions), and searching for publicly accessible configuration files or dashboards.
2.  **Credential Harvesting:** Attempt to obtain valid credentials for the CI/CD system. This could be achieved through:
    *   **Phishing:** Targeting developers or CI/CD administrators with emails or messages designed to steal credentials.
    *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force:**  Trying known or common usernames and passwords, or attempting to brute-force login forms.
    *   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in CI/CD Platform:**  Leveraging known security flaws in the CI/CD software itself (if outdated or misconfigured).
    *   **Compromising Developer Machines (Indirect):** Gaining access to a developer's machine and extracting stored CI/CD credentials or API tokens.
3.  **Access and Lateral Movement:** Once initial access is gained, the attacker will attempt to escalate privileges and move laterally within the CI/CD environment. This could involve:
    *   **Exploiting Misconfigurations:**  Identifying and exploiting weak access controls, overly permissive roles, or insecure API configurations.
    *   **Injecting Malicious Code into Pipelines:** Modifying pipeline configurations to execute malicious scripts or commands during the build process.
    *   **Manipulating Build Artifacts:**  Altering the build process to inject malicious code into the application's source code, dependencies, or final build artifacts (like JAR files created by `shadow`).
    *   **Stealing Secrets and Credentials:** Accessing stored secrets (API keys, database credentials, signing keys) within the CI/CD system for further attacks or persistence.
4.  **Persistence and Supply Chain Poisoning:** Establish persistent access to the CI/CD pipeline and use this control to inject malicious code into every build of the application. This ensures long-term compromise and widespread distribution of the malicious software.

**4.1.2. Common Vulnerabilities in CI/CD Pipelines:**

*   **Insecure Access Control:** Weak or default passwords, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), overly broad permissions granted to users or services.
*   **Exposed Secrets:** Hardcoded credentials, API keys, or signing keys stored in pipeline configurations, scripts, or environment variables.
*   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Using outdated or vulnerable versions of CI/CD platform software, plugins, or build tools.
*   **Insecure Pipeline Configurations:**  Lack of input validation, insecure script execution, insufficient logging and monitoring.
*   **Compromised Build Agents:**  Build agents (servers or containers that execute build jobs) that are themselves vulnerable or compromised, allowing attackers to inject malicious code during the build process.
*   **Lack of Network Segmentation:**  Insufficient network isolation between the CI/CD environment and other parts of the infrastructure, allowing lateral movement after initial compromise.
*   **Insufficient Monitoring and Auditing:**  Lack of proper logging and monitoring of CI/CD activities, making it difficult to detect and respond to attacks.

**4.1.3. Impact of Compromising CI/CD Pipeline:**

*   **Supply Chain Attack:**  Injection of malicious code into the application's build process, leading to the distribution of compromised software to users. This is a highly impactful attack as it can affect a large number of users and is difficult to detect.
*   **Data Breach:**  Access to sensitive data stored within the CI/CD environment, such as source code, databases, API keys, and customer data.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of trust from customers and the wider community due to the distribution of compromised software.
*   **Financial Losses:**  Costs associated with incident response, remediation, legal liabilities, and loss of business.
*   **Long-Term Persistence:**  Attackers can maintain persistent access to the build environment, allowing them to continuously inject malicious code or steal data.

**4.1.4. Mitigation Strategies for CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**

*   **Strong Access Control:** Implement strong passwords, enforce MFA for all users, apply the principle of least privilege for user and service accounts.
*   **Secret Management:** Utilize dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage secrets. Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly update CI/CD platform software, plugins, and build tools to the latest versions. Implement vulnerability scanning for the CI/CD environment.
*   **Secure Pipeline Configuration:**  Implement code review for pipeline configurations, enforce input validation, use secure coding practices in pipeline scripts, and minimize the use of external dependencies in build processes.
*   **Secure Build Agents:** Harden build agents, keep them patched, and isolate them from other parts of the infrastructure. Consider using ephemeral build agents that are destroyed after each build.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Implement network segmentation to isolate the CI/CD environment and limit lateral movement in case of a breach.
*   **Monitoring and Auditing:**  Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of CI/CD activities. Set up alerts for suspicious events and regularly review audit logs.
*   **Code Signing and Verification:** Implement code signing for build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity. Verify signatures during deployment and updates.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Compromise Developer Machine (High Risk Path)

**4.2.1. Detailed Attack Steps:**

Compromising a developer machine can be a stepping stone to compromising the build environment and the software supply chain. Attack steps might include:

1.  **Initial Access:** Gain access to a developer's machine through various methods:
    *   **Phishing:**  Tricking developers into clicking malicious links or opening infected attachments.
    *   **Malware:**  Infecting developer machines with malware through drive-by downloads, software vulnerabilities, or compromised websites.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Manipulating developers into revealing credentials or installing malicious software.
    *   **Physical Access:**  Gaining physical access to an unattended developer machine.
2.  **Persistence and Privilege Escalation:** Establish persistence on the compromised machine and escalate privileges to gain administrative access.
3.  **Credential Harvesting and Information Gathering:**  Steal credentials stored on the developer machine, including:
    *   **CI/CD Credentials:**  API tokens, passwords, or SSH keys used to access CI/CD systems.
    *   **Source Code Repository Credentials:**  Credentials for accessing Git repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    *   **Signing Keys:**  Private keys used for code signing.
    *   **Other Sensitive Data:**  Database credentials, API keys for other services, personal information.
4.  **Supply Chain Manipulation (Indirect):** Use the compromised developer machine as a launchpad to:
    *   **Commit Malicious Code:**  Inject malicious code directly into the source code repository, which will then be included in the next build.
    *   **Modify Build Scripts:**  Alter build scripts to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious functionality during the build process.
    *   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline (Indirect):** Use harvested CI/CD credentials to directly access and manipulate the CI/CD pipeline as described in section 4.1.

**4.2.2. Common Vulnerabilities in Developer Machines:**

*   **Weak Passwords:**  Using weak or default passwords for user accounts.
*   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Not enabling MFA for developer accounts.
*   **Outdated Software:**  Running outdated operating systems, applications, and development tools with known vulnerabilities.
*   **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:**  Failing to apply security patches promptly.
*   **Insecure Software Installation Practices:**  Downloading software from untrusted sources or disabling security features during installation.
*   **Lack of Endpoint Security:**  Not using or properly configuring endpoint security solutions like antivirus, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and firewalls.
*   **Insecure Development Practices:**  Storing sensitive data in code repositories, using insecure coding practices, and not following secure development guidelines.
*   **Physical Security Weaknesses:**  Leaving machines unattended and unlocked, allowing unauthorized physical access.

**4.2.3. Impact of Compromising Developer Machine:**

*   **Source Code Compromise:**  Exposure or modification of sensitive source code, potentially leading to intellectual property theft or the introduction of vulnerabilities.
*   **Supply Chain Attack (Indirect):**  Using the compromised machine to inject malicious code into the software supply chain via code commits or CI/CD pipeline manipulation.
*   **Data Breach:**  Access to sensitive data stored on the developer machine or accessible through the developer's accounts.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Similar to CI/CD pipeline compromise, a successful attack originating from a developer machine can damage the organization's reputation.
*   **Loss of Productivity:**  Disruption to developer workflows and productivity due to malware infections or incident response activities.

**4.2.4. Mitigation Strategies for Developer Machine Compromise:**

*   **Strong Password Policy and MFA:** Enforce strong password policies and require MFA for all developer accounts.
*   **Endpoint Security Solutions:** Deploy and properly configure endpoint security solutions (antivirus, EDR, firewalls) on all developer machines.
*   **Software Patch Management:** Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely patching of operating systems, applications, and development tools.
*   **Secure Software Installation Practices:**  Educate developers on secure software installation practices and restrict software installation privileges.
*   **Least Privilege Access:**  Grant developers only the necessary privileges on their machines and within development environments.

*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and regularly test an incident response plan for handling compromised developer machines.

#### 4.3. Contextualization to `shadow` and Applications Using `shadow`

For applications using `shadow` to create shaded JARs, a compromised build environment is particularly concerning.  `shadow` is used to package dependencies into a single JAR file, which is often a critical part of the application's distribution.

If an attacker compromises the build environment (CI/CD pipeline or developer machine), they can manipulate the build process *before* `shadow` packages the application. This means they can:

*   **Inject malicious code into the application's source code:**  This code will be compiled and included in the final JAR, even if `shadow` itself is functioning correctly.
*   **Modify dependencies:**  Replace legitimate dependencies with malicious versions, which will then be packaged into the shaded JAR by `shadow`.
*   **Alter build scripts:**  Modify Gradle build scripts to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious functionality during the build process, affecting the final JAR produced by `shadow`.

**The resulting shaded JAR, created by `shadow` in a compromised environment, will be a malicious artifact.**  This means that even if the application developers believe they are using `shadow` to create a secure and self-contained JAR, a compromised build environment can completely undermine this security.

**Therefore, securing the build environment is paramount for applications using `shadow` (and all applications in general) to ensure the integrity and security of the final distributed artifact.**  The mitigation strategies outlined above are crucial for protecting against these threats and maintaining the security of the software supply chain.

### 5. Risk Assessment and Prioritization

Both "Compromise CI/CD Pipeline" and "Compromise Developer Machine" are **High Risk Paths** due to their high criticality and potential impact.

**Prioritization of Mitigations:**

Given the high risk, mitigation strategies for both attack vectors should be prioritized. However, considering the potential for widespread and automated attacks, **securing the CI/CD pipeline should be considered the highest priority.**  Compromising the CI/CD pipeline allows for automated and large-scale injection of malicious code into every build, leading to a more significant and widespread supply chain attack.

Securing developer machines is also critical, as they can be used as entry points to compromise the CI/CD pipeline and introduce vulnerabilities directly into the codebase.  Therefore, mitigation efforts should be focused on both areas concurrently.

**In summary, the development team should prioritize implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above for both CI/CD pipelines and developer machines to effectively reduce the risk of build environment compromise and protect against supply chain attacks.**  Regular security assessments and continuous improvement of security practices are essential to maintain a secure build environment.
