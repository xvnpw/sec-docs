# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gradleup/shadow

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Relocation Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/careful_relocation_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Conflicting Packages:** Use tools or manual inspection to identify specific packages that are causing conflicts between different dependencies *within the shadowed JAR*.
2.  **Minimize Relocation Scope:** Relocate *only* the conflicting packages, not entire dependencies.  This reduces the risk of unintended consequences and keeps the Shadow configuration as targeted as possible.
3.  **Use Specific Rules:** In your `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`), use Shadow's `relocate` directive with precise package names.  Avoid wildcards unless absolutely necessary.  Example:
    ```gradle
    shadowJar {
        relocate 'com.example.conflicting.package', 'com.yourproject.relocated.package'
    }
    ```
4.  **Thorough Testing:** After relocation (and building the shadowed JAR), *thoroughly* test your application, paying close attention to areas that use the relocated classes.  This testing is directly tied to the Shadow configuration.
5.  **Documentation:** Document each `relocate` rule within the `build.gradle.kts` (or next to it as a comment), explaining *why* it's necessary and what packages are affected. This is crucial for maintainability of the Shadow configuration.
6. **Avoid if possible:** If it is possible try to solve conflicts by using never version of dependencies. This should be done before using relocation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Dependency Conflict Leading to Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Directly addresses this threat *within the context of a shadowed JAR* by resolving conflicts in a controlled manner.
*   **Incorrect Relocation Breaking Functionality (Medium Severity):** Minimizing the scope of relocation and thorough testing (specifically targeting the relocated code) reduce the risk of breaking functionality due to Shadow's actions.

**Impact:**
*   **Dependency Conflict:** High impact – resolves the conflict within the shadowed JAR.
*   **Incorrect Relocation:** Medium impact – reduces the risk of errors introduced by Shadow's relocation.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Some `relocate` rules exist in `build.gradle.kts`, but they are not comprehensively documented, and the testing after relocation (specifically focused on Shadow's changes) is not always rigorous.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive documentation of `relocate` rules *within the build file* is missing.
*   A standardized, rigorous testing process specifically for relocated code *as a result of Shadow's configuration* is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit Dependency Inclusion/Exclusion (Shadow Filters)](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_dependency_inclusionexclusion__shadow_filters_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Unnecessary Files:** Analyze your dependencies and identify files or packages that are not needed at runtime *within the context of the shadowed JAR* (e.g., test code, documentation, sample code, specific resource files).
2.  **Use `include` and `exclude` Filters:** In your `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`), use Shadow's `include` and `exclude` filters *directly within the `shadowJar` task configuration* to control which files are included in the final JAR.  Example:
    ```gradle
    shadowJar {
        exclude '**/test/**' // Exclude all files in test directories
        exclude 'META-INF/*.SF' // Exclude signature files
        include 'com/example/myproject/**' // Include only specific packages
        exclude '**/internal_implementation_details/**'
    }
    ```
3.  **Prioritize Exclusion:** Focus on excluding files that are definitely not needed.  It's generally safer to include something you might need than to exclude something you do need.  This is a direct Shadow configuration decision.
4.  **Regular Review:** Review your `include` and `exclude` filters *within the `shadowJar` task* periodically to ensure they are still accurate. This is a Shadow-specific audit.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerability in Unused Code (within the Shadowed JAR) (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of including vulnerable code that is not actually used by your application *by directly controlling what Shadow packages*.
*   **Increased JAR Size (Low Severity):** Reduces the size of the final shadowed JAR, improving deployment times and potentially performance. This is a direct consequence of Shadow's configuration.
*   **Exposure of Unnecessary Information (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of exposing unnecessary information (e.g., test data, internal documentation) *within the deployed shadowed artifact*.

**Impact:**
*   **Vulnerability in Unused Code:** High impact – directly reduces the attack surface *of the shadowed JAR*.
*   **Increased JAR Size:** Low impact – improves deployment and performance.
*   **Exposure of Unnecessary Information:** Low impact – reduces the risk of information leakage *from the shadowed JAR*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Some basic `exclude` filters are used in the `shadowJar` task in `build.gradle.kts`, but a comprehensive analysis of unnecessary files (specifically for Shadow's packaging) has not been performed.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A systematic process for identifying and excluding unnecessary files *specifically for the shadowed JAR* is missing.
*   More granular `include` and `exclude` filters could be used *within the `shadowJar` configuration*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Audits of Shadow Configuration (Specifically `shadowJar` Task)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_audits_of_shadow_configuration__specifically__shadowjar__task_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Schedule Regular Reviews:** Establish a schedule for reviewing your *Shadow configuration within the `shadowJar` task* (e.g., every sprint, every release, or quarterly).
2.  **Check for Updates:** Check for updates to the Shadow plugin itself. Newer versions might include security fixes or improved features related to how it packages dependencies.
3.  **Review Relocation Rules:** Re-examine your `relocate` rules *within the `shadowJar` task* (see "Careful Relocation Configuration").
4.  **Review Include/Exclude Filters:** Re-assess your `include` and `exclude` filters *within the `shadowJar` task* (see "Explicit Dependency Inclusion/Exclusion").
5.  **Document Changes:** Document any changes made to the Shadow configuration *within the build file or alongside it*, explaining the rationale. This ensures the `shadowJar` task remains understandable and maintainable.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Outdated Shadow Plugin (Medium Severity):** Ensures you're using the latest version of the Shadow plugin, with any security fixes related to its core functionality.
*   **Suboptimal Shadow Configuration (Medium Severity):** Helps identify and correct any configuration issues *within the `shadowJar` task* that might have crept in over time, leading to security or functional problems.

**Impact:**
*   **Outdated Shadow Plugin:** Medium impact – reduces the risk of using a vulnerable plugin version.
*   **Suboptimal Shadow Configuration:** Medium impact – improves the overall security and maintainability of the *Shadow-specific configuration*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Not implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No formal process for regularly auditing the Shadow configuration *specifically the `shadowJar` task and its directives* is in place.
