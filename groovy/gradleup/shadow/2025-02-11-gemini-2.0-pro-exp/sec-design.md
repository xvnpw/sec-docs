# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a user-friendly and efficient way to create fat JARs (uber-JARs) for Java/JVM applications.
*   Minimize the complexity of configuring and managing dependencies when building deployable artifacts.
*   Offer a solution that integrates seamlessly with the Gradle build system.
*   Reduce the size of the resulting JAR by allowing users to specify which dependencies and files should be included or excluded.
*   Support relocation of packages to avoid conflicts between different versions of libraries used by the application and its dependencies.
*   Provide a well-maintained and documented open-source project.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Vulnerabilities in the shadow plugin itself could be exploited to compromise applications that use it.
*   Incorrect configuration of the shadow plugin could lead to the inclusion of unnecessary or vulnerable dependencies, increasing the attack surface of applications.
*   Failure to properly relocate packages could lead to runtime conflicts and application instability.
*   Lack of maintenance or updates to the shadow plugin could leave users vulnerable to known security issues in its dependencies.
*   Lack of proper documentation and support could lead to misuse of the plugin and introduce security vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and contributions to identify and address security issues. (GitHub repository)
*   security control: The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, which includes automated testing. (GitHub Actions workflows)
*   security control: The project has a Code of Conduct. (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
*   security control: The project has contribution guide. (CONTRIBUTING.md)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The plugin relies on the security of the Gradle build system and its underlying dependencies.
*   accepted risk: Users are responsible for properly configuring the plugin and ensuring the security of their own application code and dependencies.
*   accepted risk: The plugin's functionality to relocate packages could potentially introduce unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI pipeline to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the plugin's code.
*   security control: Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to identify and track dependencies, and to alert on known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.
*   security control: Regularly review and update dependencies to address known security issues.
*   security control: Provide security documentation and guidelines for users on how to securely configure and use the shadow plugin.
*   security control: Establish a security vulnerability disclosure process.
*   security control: Consider using a dependency minimization strategy to reduce the plugin's own attack surface.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to this plugin, as it's a build tool.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable, but the plugin should operate within the permissions granted to the Gradle build process.
*   Input Validation: The plugin should validate user-provided configuration (e.g., include/exclude patterns, relocation rules) to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, unless the plugin is used to handle cryptographic keys or materials (which it shouldn't be). The plugin should not interfere with the cryptographic operations of the built application.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Building and deploying Java/JVM applications.
*   Managing dependencies for Java/JVM projects.

Data to Protect:

*   Source code of the Shadow plugin (sensitivity: medium - could contain vulnerabilities).
*   Source code of applications using the Shadow plugin (sensitivity: varies depending on the application).
*   Configuration files (sensitivity: medium - could contain sensitive information like API keys or credentials if misused, but Shadow itself doesn't handle these).
*   Dependencies (sensitivity: medium - vulnerable dependencies could be exploited).
*   Build artifacts (fat JARs) (sensitivity: varies depending on the application).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) that applications built with Shadow need to meet?
*   What is the expected frequency of updates and releases for the Shadow plugin?
*   What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the Shadow plugin?
*   Are there any specific security concerns or past incidents related to the Shadow plugin or similar tools?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable tool for building fat JARs. Security is a high priority.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Users are responsible for the security of their own applications and the overall deployment environment. The Shadow plugin itself is assumed to be used in a secure build environment.
*   DESIGN: The deployment environment is assumed to be a Kubernetes cluster, but other deployment scenarios are possible. The build process is assumed to be automated using a CI server like GitHub Actions.
