```


## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Compromise Application Using ShadowJar [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_compromise_application_using_shadowjar__critical_.md)

* **1.0 Compromise Application Using ShadowJar [CRITICAL]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application. It is critical as it signifies a complete security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities Introduced by ShadowJar [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_shadowjar__critical_.md)

* **1.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities Introduced by ShadowJar [CRITICAL]:**
    * This node represents the core focus of the threat model, specifically targeting weaknesses introduced by the Gradle Shadow plugin. It is critical because it encompasses all the ShadowJar-specific attack vectors.
    * **High-Risk Path:** This path signifies that exploiting vulnerabilities introduced by ShadowJar is a likely and impactful way to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Compromise Application Logic [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_compromise_application_logic__critical_.md)

* **1.1.1 Compromise Application Logic [CRITICAL]:**
    * This goal involves manipulating the application's intended behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation. It is critical due to the direct impact on the application's functionality and security.
    * **High-Risk Path:** This path indicates that compromising application logic through ShadowJar vulnerabilities is a significant threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1 Exploit Dependency Conflicts [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_exploit_dependency_conflicts__critical_.md)

* **1.1.1.1 Exploit Dependency Conflicts [CRITICAL]:**
    * Shadow's core function of bundling dependencies can lead to conflicts if different dependencies rely on different versions of the same library.
    * **High-Risk Path:** This path is high-risk because it leverages the core functionality of ShadowJar and the inherent complexities of dependency management. While controlling a repository is difficult, exploiting declared vulnerable dependencies is more feasible.
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker could compromise a public or private dependency repository used by the application and introduce a malicious version of a legitimate dependency. If Shadow prioritizes this malicious version, it could overwrite the intended dependency, leading to code execution or data manipulation.
        * **Attack Vector:** Even without malicious intent, Shadow might bundle different versions of the same library due to transitive dependencies. If these versions have incompatible APIs or known vulnerabilities, it can lead to unexpected behavior or exploitable weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Exploit Resource Merging Issues [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_exploit_resource_merging_issues__critical_.md)

* **1.1.1.3 Exploit Resource Merging Issues [CRITICAL]:**
    * Shadow merges resources from different dependencies.
    * **High-Risk Path:** This path is high-risk due to its relatively low effort and skill level required for the attacker. Providing a malicious resource is straightforward, and the impact can be significant if critical resources are overwritten.
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker can provide a malicious resource with the same path as a critical application resource (e.g., configuration files, security policies). Shadow might overwrite the legitimate resource, leading to a compromise.
        * **Attack Vector:** Incorrect merging logic in Shadow could lead to corrupted or incomplete resources, causing application errors or exploitable states.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Exfiltrate Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_exfiltrate_sensitive_information__critical_.md)

* **1.1.2 Exfiltrate Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]:**
    * This goal involves the unauthorized extraction of sensitive data from the application. It is critical due to the potential for significant data breaches and privacy violations.
    * **High-Risk Path:** This path indicates that exfiltrating sensitive information through ShadowJar vulnerabilities is a significant threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.1 Extract Secrets from Bundled Dependencies [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_1_extract_secrets_from_bundled_dependencies__critical_.md)

* **1.1.2.1 Extract Secrets from Bundled Dependencies [CRITICAL]:**
    * Developers sometimes inadvertently include secrets (API keys, passwords) directly within dependency code or configuration files. Shadow bundles all these dependencies into a single JAR.
    * **High-Risk Path:** This is a significant high-risk path because it exploits a common developer mistake and ShadowJar's bundling behavior, making secrets easily accessible. The effort is negligible for the attacker.
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker can decompile the final JAR file produced by Shadow and easily access any secrets that were embedded within the bundled dependencies. This can lead to unauthorized access to external services or internal systems.
