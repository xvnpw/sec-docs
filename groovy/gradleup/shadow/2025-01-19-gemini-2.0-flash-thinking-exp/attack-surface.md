# Attack Surface Analysis for gradleup/shadow

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Dependency Inclusion](./attack_surfaces/malicious_dependency_inclusion.md)

**Description:**  The final application artifact includes dependencies from various sources. If a malicious dependency is introduced (either directly or transitively), it will be bundled into the single JAR created by Shadow.

**How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow's core function is to merge all project dependencies into a single JAR file. This process inherently includes all resolved dependencies, regardless of their security posture, into the final output.

**Example:** A developer unknowingly adds a dependency with a known vulnerability or a dependency that has been backdoored by an attacker. Shadow will package this compromised library into the application's JAR.

**Impact:**  The malicious dependency can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other security compromises.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies before building with Shadow.
- Utilize dependency management tools and practices (like dependency lock files) to ensure consistent and expected dependency versions.
- Regularly review project dependencies and their licenses.
- Employ software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and manage open-source risks.
- Consider using private or curated dependency repositories to control the source of dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Typosquatting via Shadow](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusiontyposquatting_via_shadow.md)

**Description:** An attacker registers a package with a name similar to a legitimate internal or external dependency. If the build process isn't strictly configured, Shadow might pull in the malicious package during dependency resolution.

**How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow relies on Gradle's dependency resolution mechanism. If the resolution process isn't tightly controlled, and the attacker's malicious package is available in a configured repository, Shadow will include it in the merged JAR.

**Example:** The project depends on `com.example:mylibrary`. An attacker registers `com.examp1e:mylibrary` with malicious code. If the repository configuration isn't precise, Shadow might include the attacker's package.

**Impact:**  Similar to malicious dependency inclusion, this can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use private or internal Maven repositories for internal dependencies to avoid public namespace collisions.
- Implement strict dependency naming conventions and enforce them.
- Utilize dependency verification mechanisms (like checksum verification) to ensure the integrity of downloaded dependencies.
- Regularly audit the resolved dependencies in the build process.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Overwriting with Malicious Content](./attack_surfaces/resource_overwriting_with_malicious_content.md)

**Description:** Shadow merges resources from all dependencies. If a malicious dependency contains resources with the same path as legitimate application resources, Shadow's merging strategy might overwrite the legitimate ones.

**How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow's resource merging functionality can lead to unintended overwrites if not carefully configured. A malicious dependency can exploit this by including resources with common names (e.g., configuration files).

**Example:** A malicious dependency includes a `application.properties` file that overwrites the legitimate configuration, potentially changing database credentials or other sensitive settings.

**Impact:**  This can lead to application misconfiguration, security policy bypasses, or the introduction of malicious content served by the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement resource filtering in Shadow configuration to explicitly include or exclude resources based on their origin or path.
- Understand and configure Shadow's resource merging strategy to prevent unintended overwrites.
- Avoid using generic resource names in dependencies where possible.
- Regularly inspect the contents of the final Shadow JAR to verify resource integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Manifest Manipulation via Shadow](./attack_surfaces/manifest_manipulation_via_shadow.md)

**Description:** Shadow modifies the `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file during the merging process. If a malicious dependency or a compromised build environment can influence this process, malicious attributes could be injected or existing ones altered.

**How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow directly manipulates the manifest file. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in this process can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker could inject a malicious `Premain-Class` attribute in the manifest, causing code to execute before the main application starts.

**Impact:**  This can lead to early-stage code execution, potentially bypassing security measures or compromising the application's initialization.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Carefully review and control the Shadow plugin's configuration related to manifest generation.
- Secure the build environment to prevent unauthorized modification of build scripts or dependencies.
- Implement checks on the final JAR's manifest to ensure it contains only expected attributes.

## Attack Surface: [Build Environment Compromise Leading to Shadow Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/build_environment_compromise_leading_to_shadow_exploitation.md)

**Description:** If the build environment (developer machines, CI/CD servers) is compromised, attackers can manipulate the build process, including how Shadow is used.

**How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow acts as a vehicle to package and distribute malicious components if the build process is compromised.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline and modifies the build script to include a malicious dependency that Shadow then bundles.

**Impact:**  Generation of compromised application artifacts, potentially leading to widespread deployment of malicious software.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strong security measures for the build environment, including access controls, regular patching, and security monitoring.
- Secure the CI/CD pipeline with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Use immutable build environments where possible.
- Regularly audit the build process and configurations.
