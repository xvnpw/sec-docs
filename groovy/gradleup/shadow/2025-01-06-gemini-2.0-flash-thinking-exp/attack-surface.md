# Attack Surface Analysis for gradleup/shadow

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion and Substitution](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusion_and_substitution.md)

* **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious dependency with the same fully qualified class name as a legitimate dependency.
* **How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow merges dependencies into a single JAR. If the merging strategy isn't carefully configured, Shadow might inadvertently include and potentially prioritize the malicious class during the merge, overwriting the legitimate one.
* **Example:** A malicious library with a class named `com.example.security.Authenticator` is introduced. Shadow merges this, and the application uses the malicious `Authenticator` instead of the intended one.
* **Impact:** Code execution vulnerabilities, data breaches, or unexpected application behavior due to the execution of malicious code.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use dependency management tools (like Dependabot, Snyk) to identify and prevent the introduction of malicious or vulnerable dependencies.
    * Implement strict dependency verification and checksum validation during the build process.
    * Carefully review the merged JAR contents to ensure only intended dependencies are included.
    * Employ a robust software composition analysis (SCA) tool that can analyze the final shaded JAR.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Overwriting and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/resource_overwriting_and_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** A malicious dependency includes resources (e.g., configuration files, property files) with the same name as legitimate resources.
* **How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow merges resources from all dependencies. The order of merging determines which resource is ultimately included. A malicious resource can overwrite a legitimate one.
* **Example:** A malicious dependency includes a `config.properties` file that overwrites the legitimate one, changing database connection details to a malicious server.
* **Impact:** Configuration hijacking, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Configure Shadow's resource merging strategy to handle conflicts safely (e.g., using a first-wins or last-wins strategy with awareness of potential risks).
    * Namespace or prefix resource names within dependencies to avoid naming collisions.
    * Thoroughly inspect the contents of the shaded JAR to identify any unexpected or suspicious resources.
    * Implement runtime checks to verify the integrity and source of loaded resources.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Shadow Plugin Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_shadow_plugin_itself.md)

* **Description:** The Shadow plugin itself contains security vulnerabilities.
* **How Shadow Contributes:** If the plugin has vulnerabilities, they could be exploited to manipulate the build process or create a compromised shaded JAR.
* **Example:** A vulnerability in Shadow's dependency resolution logic allows an attacker to inject malicious dependencies during the shading process.
* **Impact:** Creation of backdoored or vulnerable application artifacts, compromising the entire application.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep the Shadow plugin updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    * Monitor security advisories related to the Shadow plugin.
    * Consider using alternative shading solutions if critical vulnerabilities are discovered and not promptly addressed.

## Attack Surface: [Build Script Injection Affecting Shadow Configuration](./attack_surfaces/build_script_injection_affecting_shadow_configuration.md)

* **Description:** A malicious actor gains control of the Gradle build script and modifies the Shadow plugin configuration.
* **How Shadow Contributes:** Shadow's behavior is defined in the build script. Malicious modifications can alter how dependencies are merged or resources are handled.
* **Example:** An attacker modifies the `build.gradle` to include a malicious dependency or to disable security-related Shadow configurations.
* **Impact:** Introduction of malicious code, bypassing security measures implemented through Shadow configuration.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the build environment and restrict access to the build script.
    * Implement code review processes for changes to the build script.
    * Use version control for the build script and track changes.
    * Employ build pipeline security measures to prevent unauthorized modifications.
