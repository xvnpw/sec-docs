# Threat Model Analysis for gradleup/shadow

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution.md)

**Description:** An attacker might register a malicious dependency with the same name and version as a legitimate dependency. If the project's dependency resolution is not properly secured, Gradle might download this malicious dependency. The **Shadow plugin** would then unknowingly bundle this malicious dependency into the shaded JAR, treating it as a legitimate part of the application.

**Impact:** Code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Shadow Plugin's dependency inclusion logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize dependency verification mechanisms (e.g., checksum verification, dependency signing).
* Employ a private and trusted Maven repository or repository manager.
* Implement strict control over the dependencies used in the project.
* Regularly audit project dependencies and their sources *before* the shading process.
* Use dependency locking mechanisms to ensure consistent dependency versions.

## Threat: [Vulnerability Amplification Due to Classpath Conflicts](./threats/vulnerability_amplification_due_to_classpath_conflicts.md)

**Description:** While **Shadow** aims to resolve classpath conflicts, misconfigurations or complex dependency graphs can lead to situations where different versions of the same library are present in the shaded JAR. This can lead to unexpected classloading behavior, potentially exposing or amplifying vulnerabilities present in one of the included versions. An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in a specific version of a library that is inadvertently active due to **Shadow's** merging or relocation logic.

**Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in dependencies, unexpected application behavior leading to security flaws, potential for remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Shadow Plugin's relocation and merging logic, the final shaded JAR's classpath structure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test the application with the generated shaded JAR to identify any unexpected behavior.
* Carefully configure **Shadow's** relocation and merge strategies to avoid version conflicts.
* Analyze the dependency tree to identify potential conflicts before shading.
* Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
* Consider using tools that analyze the final JAR for potential classpath issues *after* shading.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Injection Affecting Shadow Configuration](./threats/malicious_plugin_injection_affecting_shadow_configuration.md)

**Description:** If the Gradle build environment is compromised, an attacker could inject a malicious Gradle plugin that directly manipulates the **Shadow plugin's** configuration. This could involve altering relocation rules, exclusion patterns, or even replacing the **Shadow plugin** entirely with a modified version. The attacker could then force **Shadow** to include malicious code or exclude necessary security measures during the shading process.

**Impact:** Inclusion of backdoors or malware in the shaded JAR, weakening of security measures, dependency confusion.

**Affected Component:** Shadow Plugin configuration within the Gradle Build Script (`build.gradle`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Gradle build environment and control access to build scripts.
* Implement code review processes for build script changes, especially those affecting **Shadow** configuration.
* Utilize dependency locking for Gradle plugins, including **Shadow**.
* Regularly audit the plugins used in the build process.
* Employ security scanning tools on the build environment.

## Threat: [Build Process Manipulation Leading to Malicious Shading](./threats/build_process_manipulation_leading_to_malicious_shading.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains control over the build process could directly manipulate the contents of the shaded JAR *after* the **Shadow plugin** has performed its intended actions. This could involve injecting malicious code, modifying existing classes that were processed by **Shadow**, or replacing legitimate resources within the final JAR.

**Impact:** Inclusion of arbitrary malicious code in the final application artifact, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its environment.

**Affected Component:** The generated shaded JAR artifact (post-Shadow processing).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the entire build pipeline with strong access controls and authentication.
* Implement integrity checks for build artifacts at various stages, including after **Shadow** processing.
* Utilize secure build environments (e.g., containerized builds).
* Limit access to the build server and related infrastructure.
* Employ code signing for the final shaded JAR.
