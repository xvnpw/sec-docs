* **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Substitution via Shadow
    * **Description:** An attacker could introduce a malicious dependency with the same name as a legitimate internal or private dependency, but with a higher version number. When Shadow bundles dependencies, it might pick the malicious dependency due to version resolution, unknowingly including malicious code in the final JAR. This directly involves Shadow's dependency resolution and bundling process.
    * **Impact:**  Code execution within the application's context, data exfiltration, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload.
    * **Affected Component:** Dependency resolution during the Shadow task execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize Gradle's dependency verification feature to ensure the integrity of downloaded dependencies.
        * Employ private or internal Maven/Gradle repositories with strict access controls and dependency verification enabled.
        * Regularly audit project dependencies and their sources.
        * Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation and analysis to track included components.

* **Threat:** Manipulation of Shadow Plugin Configuration for Malicious Purposes
    * **Description:** If the build environment or the `build.gradle` file is compromised, an attacker could modify the Shadow plugin's configuration. This could involve including unintended files, excluding critical security measures, or renaming classes in a way that breaks security assumptions. This directly targets the configuration of the Shadow plugin.
    * **Impact:**  Inclusion of malicious code or data in the final JAR, disabling security features, or causing application malfunction.
    * **Affected Component:** The Shadow plugin configuration within the `build.gradle` file.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the build environment and control access to build files.
        * Implement code review processes for changes to build configurations.
        * Use version control for build files and track changes.
        * Employ infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles to manage and audit build configurations.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities within the Shadow Plugin Itself
    * **Description:** The Shadow plugin itself might contain vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities during the build process to inject malicious code into the output JAR or gain access to sensitive information within the build environment. This directly involves the Shadow plugin's code.
    * **Impact:**  Code injection into the application, compromise of the build environment, or exposure of sensitive build artifacts.
    * **Affected Component:** The Shadow plugin code and its execution during the Gradle build.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep the Shadow plugin updated to the latest stable version.
        * Monitor security advisories related to the Shadow plugin.
        * Consider using alternative bundling solutions if critical vulnerabilities are discovered and not promptly patched.
