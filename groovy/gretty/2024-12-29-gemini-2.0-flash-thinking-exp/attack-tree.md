## High-Risk & Critical Sub-Tree: Compromise Application via Gretty

**Goal:** Compromise application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Gretty development plugin.

**Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application via Gretty [ROOT]
*   [OR] Exploit Gretty Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   [AND] Inject Malicious Configuration [HIGH RISK]
        *   [OR] Modify build.gradle Directly [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   [AND] Exploit Insecure Default Configurations [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]
*   [OR] Exploit Gretty's Web Server Management [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   [AND] Exploit Exposed Development Server [HIGH RISK]
        *   [OR] Access Development Server on Public Network [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   [OR] Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Development Server [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]
*   [OR] Social Engineering Targeting Developers [HIGH RISK]
    *   [AND] Trick Developer into Running Malicious Gretty Configuration [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Gretty Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This represents a critical point because successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate the entire development process, potentially leading to various forms of compromise.

**Inject Malicious Configuration [HIGH RISK]:**

*   This path is high-risk due to the potential for significant impact if malicious configurations are successfully injected.
    *   **Modify build.gradle Directly [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine and directly modifies the `build.gradle` file.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires compromising a developer's system).
        *   **Impact:** High (full control over build process).
        *   **Effort:** Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

**Exploit Insecure Default Configurations [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This path is high-risk and critical because insecure defaults are common and easily exploitable, potentially exposing the development environment.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and leverages default settings in Gretty that expose sensitive information or functionality.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
    *   **Impact:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Effort:** Low.
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.

**Exploit Gretty's Web Server Management [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This is a critical node as gaining control over the managed web server provides direct access to the application and its data.

**Exploit Exposed Development Server [HIGH RISK]:**

*   This path is high-risk because exposing the development server makes the application directly accessible to external threats.
    *   **Access Development Server on Public Network [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Gretty is configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) or a public IP address, making the development server accessible from the internet.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium.
        *   **Impact:** Medium.
        *   **Effort:** Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.
    *   **Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization on Development Server [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Gretty does not enforce authentication or authorization on the managed web server, allowing unauthorized access.
        *   **Likelihood:** High.
        *   **Impact:** Medium.
        *   **Effort:** Low.
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.

**Social Engineering Targeting Developers [HIGH RISK]:**

*   This path is high-risk because successful social engineering can bypass technical security measures and lead to significant compromise.
    *   **Trick Developer into Running Malicious Gretty Configuration [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uses social engineering techniques to convince a developer to execute a Gradle command with a compromised Gretty configuration.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Impact:** High.
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High.
