### High and Critical Gretty-Specific Threats

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Gretty Gradle plugin:

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via Gretty Configuration
    *   **Description:** If Gretty allows executing external commands based on configuration parameters (e.g., in lifecycle hooks or custom tasks), an attacker who can modify the Gradle build file (`build.gradle`) could inject malicious commands that will be executed when Gretty starts or performs certain actions.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or installation of malware.
    *   **Affected Gretty Component:** Gretty's task execution and configuration parsing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using Gretty features that allow executing arbitrary commands based on configuration.
        *   Carefully review any custom Gretty configurations or tasks that involve command execution.
        *   Restrict write access to the `build.gradle` file and other build-related files.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Embedded Server
    *   **Description:** Gretty embeds a web server (like Jetty or Tomcat). If the version of the embedded server used by Gretty has known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the development server or the underlying machine. This could involve sending specially crafted requests to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the development machine, denial of service, unauthorized access to the development server and potentially the application's data.
    *   **Affected Gretty Component:** Gretty's dependency management and the embedded server library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the embedded server vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the Gretty plugin to the latest version, which typically includes updates to the embedded server.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the embedded server being used (e.g., Jetty or Tomcat).
        *   Consider using a dependency management tool to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Debugging Configuration
    *   **Description:** If remote debugging is enabled in Gretty without proper authentication or network restrictions, an attacker could connect to the debugger and potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's context or inspect sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, and potential manipulation of the application's state.
    *   **Affected Gretty Component:** Gretty's debugging configuration and integration with the embedded server's debugging features.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable remote debugging in production-like development environments.
        *   If remote debugging is necessary, secure it with strong authentication and restrict access to trusted networks.
        *   Avoid using default debugging ports.
