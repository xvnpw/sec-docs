## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Nextflow](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_nextflow.md)

*   **Compromise Application Using Nextflow (Root Goal):**
    *   The ultimate objective of the attacker. Success here means gaining unauthorized access or control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Workflow Definition](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_workflow_definition.md)

*   **Manipulate Workflow Definition (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   This is a critical control point. If an attacker can manipulate the workflow definition, they can control the execution flow and introduce malicious actions.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into Workflow Script (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Directly embedding malicious code within the Nextflow script.
            *   **Exploit Insecure Parameterization (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Injecting code through unsanitized user inputs used to construct the script.
            *   **Leverage Insecure Templating (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Injecting code through vulnerabilities in templating engines used to generate the script.
        *   **Supply Malicious Workflow Script Directly (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Providing a completely malicious workflow script to the application.
        *   **Modify Workflow Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Altering configuration settings to execute malicious code or access unauthorized resources.
            *   **Point to Malicious Resources (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**  Changing configuration to use malicious script files, container images, or data sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Workflow Script](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_workflow_script.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Code into Workflow Script (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Directly embedding malicious code within the Nextflow script.
            *   **Exploit Insecure Parameterization (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Injecting code through unsanitized user inputs used to construct the script.
            *   **Leverage Insecure Templating (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Injecting code through vulnerabilities in templating engines used to generate the script.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Parameterization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_parameterization.md)

*   **Exploit Insecure Parameterization (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Injecting code through unsanitized user inputs used to construct the script.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Templating](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_templating.md)

*   **Leverage Insecure Templating (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Injecting code through vulnerabilities in templating engines used to generate the script.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Workflow Script Directly](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_workflow_script_directly.md)

*   **Supply Malicious Workflow Script Directly (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Providing a completely malicious workflow script to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Workflow Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/modify_workflow_configuration.md)

*   **Modify Workflow Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Altering configuration settings to execute malicious code or access unauthorized resources.
            *   **Point to Malicious Resources (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**  Changing configuration to use malicious script files, container images, or data sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Point to Malicious Resources](./attack_tree_paths/point_to_malicious_resources.md)

*   **Point to Malicious Resources (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**  Changing configuration to use malicious script files, container images, or data sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Execution Environment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_execution_environment.md)

*   **Exploit Execution Environment (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
    *   Targeting the environment where Nextflow processes are executed to gain control or access.
    *   Attack Vectors:
        *   **Leverage Insecure Executor Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Exploiting misconfigurations in the executor (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to gain unauthorized access.
            *   **Escape Containerized Environments (High-Risk Path):** Breaking out of container boundaries to access the host system.
            *   **Gain Access to Underlying Host System (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Directly accessing the host system due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
        *   **Abuse Credentials Managed by Nextflow (Critical Node):** Stealing or impersonating credentials used by Nextflow to access resources, potentially leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Executor Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_executor_configuration.md)

*   **Leverage Insecure Executor Configuration (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Exploiting misconfigurations in the executor (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to gain unauthorized access.
            *   **Escape Containerized Environments (High-Risk Path):** Breaking out of container boundaries to access the host system.
            *   **Gain Access to Underlying Host System (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Directly accessing the host system due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Escape Containerized Environments](./attack_tree_paths/escape_containerized_environments.md)

*   **Escape Containerized Environments (High-Risk Path):** Breaking out of container boundaries to access the host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Underlying Host System](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_underlying_host_system.md)

*   **Gain Access to Underlying Host System (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Directly accessing the host system due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Credentials Managed by Nextflow](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_credentials_managed_by_nextflow.md)

*   **Abuse Credentials Managed by Nextflow (Critical Node):** Stealing or impersonating credentials used by Nextflow to access resources, potentially leading to further compromise.
