# Threat Model Analysis for nextflow-io/nextflow

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection in Workflow Definition](./threats/malicious_code_injection_in_workflow_definition.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code directly into a Nextflow workflow definition file (e.g., within a `script` block or a process definition). This could happen if the workflow file is sourced from an untrusted location or if an attacker gains write access to the file.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system where the Nextflow workflow is executed. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Nextflow DSL (Domain Specific Language), specifically the parsing and execution of `script` blocks and process definitions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store workflow definitions in trusted locations with restricted write access.
* Implement code review processes for workflow definitions.
* Use version control for workflow definitions to track changes and identify malicious modifications.
* Consider using static analysis tools to scan workflow definitions for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Command Injection in Process Execution](./threats/command_injection_in_process_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate input data or workflow parameters that are directly used within the `script` block of a Nextflow process without proper sanitization. This allows them to inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed by the underlying operating system.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the execution environment of the Nextflow process, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Nextflow Process execution, specifically the handling of `script` blocks and the execution of shell commands.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize all user-provided input and workflow parameters before using them in `script` blocks.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into shell commands.
* Use parameterized queries or shell escaping functions where appropriate.
* Consider using containerization (e.g., Docker) to isolate process execution environments.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Workflow Design](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_workflow_design.md)

**Description:** An attacker could design a Nextflow workflow that intentionally consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space) on the execution platform. This could involve creating infinite loops, processing extremely large datasets without proper resource limits, or spawning a large number of parallel tasks.

**Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation for other users or processes on the same platform, increased infrastructure costs.

**Affected Component:** Nextflow Workflow Engine, specifically the task scheduling and resource management components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement resource limits and quotas for Nextflow executions.
* Monitor resource usage of running workflows.
* Implement mechanisms to detect and terminate runaway workflows.
* Educate users on best practices for resource-efficient workflow design.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Workflow Processes](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_workflow_processes.md)

**Description:** A malicious workflow or a compromised process within a workflow could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data processed by Nextflow to an external location controlled by the attacker. This could involve sending data over the network or writing it to publicly accessible storage.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, loss of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Nextflow Process execution, specifically the ability of processes to interact with the network and file system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement network segmentation and restrict outbound network access for Nextflow execution environments.
* Monitor network traffic originating from Nextflow processes.
* Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures.
* Ensure proper access controls are in place for data storage locations used by Nextflow.

## Threat: [Use of Compromised Container Images in Processes](./threats/use_of_compromised_container_images_in_processes.md)

**Description:** If Nextflow workflows utilize container technologies (like Docker or Singularity), using compromised or vulnerable container images can introduce security risks. These images might contain malware or vulnerabilities that can be exploited during workflow execution.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the container, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise within the container environment. This could potentially escalate to the host system depending on container configuration.

**Affected Component:** Nextflow Process execution, specifically when using container executors (e.g., `-with-docker` or `-with-singularity`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use trusted and regularly scanned container images from reputable sources.
* Implement container image scanning and vulnerability management processes.
* Enforce the use of specific, approved container image registries.
* Regularly update container images to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Nextflow Core or Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_nextflow_core_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist in the Nextflow core codebase or in its underlying dependencies. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.

**Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Nextflow Core, underlying libraries and dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Nextflow updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Nextflow and its dependencies.
* Implement a process for promptly applying security updates.
