# Attack Surface Analysis for nextflow-io/nextflow

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Workflow Definitions (DSL)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_workflow_definitions__dsl_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Code Injection via Workflow Definitions (DSL)
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious Nextflow DSL code into workflow definitions if they are sourced from untrusted locations or constructed dynamically without proper sanitization.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow interprets and executes the DSL code directly. If the DSL itself contains malicious commands or logic, Nextflow will execute them.
    *   **Example:** A workflow definition is fetched from a remote, untrusted Git repository. The repository contains a malicious `nextflow.config` file that defines a process executing `rm -rf /`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the system running Nextflow, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Source workflow definitions from trusted and controlled repositories.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any dynamically generated parts of the workflow definition.
        *   Use static analysis tools to scan workflow definitions for potential malicious code patterns.
        *   Employ code review processes for workflow definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection within Process Definitions](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_within_process_definitions.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection within Process Definitions
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious shell commands into process definitions if user-supplied input or external data is used without proper sanitization within the `script` or `shell` blocks.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow directly executes the commands specified within the `script` or `shell` blocks of a process.
    *   **Example:** A process takes a filename as input from a user. The process definition uses this filename directly in a shell command: `process my_process { input: val filename from params.input; script: "cat $filename > output.txt" }`. A malicious user could provide an input like `"file.txt && rm -rf /"` leading to command injection.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the system running Nextflow, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly using user-supplied input or external data in shell commands without sanitization.
        *   Use parameterized commands or functions provided by Nextflow or the underlying scripting language to prevent injection.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in process definitions.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the user running Nextflow processes.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Workflow Definitions and Processes](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_workflow_definitions_and_processes.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal in Workflow Definitions and Processes
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths within workflow definitions or process definitions to access or modify files outside the intended scope.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow handles file paths specified in workflow definitions and process inputs/outputs. If these paths are not properly validated, attackers can use techniques like "../" to navigate the file system.
    *   **Example:** A workflow takes a file path as input and uses it to read data: `process read_file { input: path input_file; script: "cat $input_file" }`. A malicious user could provide an input like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` to access sensitive system files.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files, data exfiltration, or modification of critical system files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all file paths used in workflow and process definitions.
        *   Use absolute paths or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal.
        *   Restrict file access permissions for the user running Nextflow processes.
        *   Avoid constructing file paths dynamically using user-provided input.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Dependency Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_dependency_management.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Dependency Management
    *   **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in dependencies managed by Nextflow (e.g., Conda environments, Docker images) or introduce malicious dependencies.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow relies on external tools like Conda or Docker to manage software dependencies for processes. If these dependencies are compromised, the Nextflow environment becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A workflow uses a Conda environment with a known vulnerability in a specific package. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability during the execution of a process within that environment. Alternatively, a workflow could be configured to pull a malicious Docker image containing malware.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code, data breaches, or system compromise within the Nextflow execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Conda environments and Docker images.
        *   Source dependencies from trusted and reputable repositories.
        *   Implement a process for verifying the integrity of downloaded dependencies (e.g., using checksums).
        *   For Docker, use minimal base images and follow secure Docker image building practices.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets might be stored in Nextflow configuration files without proper protection.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow uses configuration files (`nextflow.config`) to define various settings, which can sometimes include sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** A `nextflow.config` file contains database credentials in plain text. If this file is compromised, attackers can gain access to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, or compromise of external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage secrets.
        *   Ensure proper file permissions are set on configuration files to restrict access.
        *   Implement encryption for sensitive data stored in configuration files if absolutely necessary.
