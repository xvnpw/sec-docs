# Threat Model Analysis for nextflow-io/nextflow

## Threat: [Malicious Workflow Injection](./threats/malicious_workflow_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Workflow Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a crafted Nextflow workflow (`.nf` file or a Git repository containing one) that contains malicious code.  This code is executed *by Nextflow* as part of the workflow definition. The attacker might exploit a vulnerability in how Nextflow receives and processes workflow definitions (e.g., a web interface, API, or even a shared filesystem if Nextflow is configured to monitor it). The malicious code could be within the `process` blocks, in helper functions, or even in how channels are used.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data processed by the workflow could be stolen.
        *   **System Compromise:** The attacker could gain control of the compute infrastructure where the workflow is executed *via Nextflow's execution context*.
        *   **Resource Abuse:** The attacker could use the compute resources for malicious purposes.
        *   **Data Corruption:** The attacker could modify or delete data.
        *   **Reputation Damage:** Successful exploitation could damage reputation.
    *   **Affected Nextflow Component:**
        *   Nextflow Engine (core execution logic, parsing and execution of `.nf` files).
        *   Workflow Definition (`.nf` files) - *This is the primary attack vector*.
        *   Process Definitions (within `.nf` files) - *Where the malicious code resides*.
        *   Executor (indirectly, as it executes the code *as directed by Nextflow*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of *all* workflow submissions, checking for malicious patterns, and limiting allowed commands *before Nextflow parses them*.
        *   **Code Review:** *Mandatory* code review for all workflow definitions before they are allowed to run within the Nextflow environment.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Execute workflows within isolated environments (containers, VMs) with limited privileges, *managed by Nextflow's executor configuration*.
        *   **Workflow Repository Control:** Use a controlled repository (Git) with strict access controls and commit signing *for all workflow definitions used by Nextflow*.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Monitor Nextflow's logs and system activity for suspicious behavior originating from workflow execution.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering (Targeting Nextflow)](./threats/configuration_file_tampering__targeting_nextflow_.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering (Targeting Nextflow)

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the Nextflow configuration file (`nextflow.config`) to alter *Nextflow's* behavior.  This is distinct from general system configuration tampering.  The attacker targets settings *specific to Nextflow*, such as executor choices, resource limits, or security-related parameters (e.g., disabling signature verification). The attacker might gain access to the file through a compromised system or a misconfigured shared file system *that Nextflow is configured to use*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** The attacker could configure Nextflow to consume excessive resources.
        *   **Security Bypass:** The attacker could *disable Nextflow's security features* or weaken security settings.
        *   **Data Leakage:** The attacker could redirect output or intermediate data to insecure locations *via Nextflow's configuration*.
        *   **Execution Hijacking:** The attacker could change the executor to a malicious one *through Nextflow's settings*.
    *   **Affected Nextflow Component:**
        *   `nextflow.config` file - *The direct target*.
        *   Nextflow Engine (core execution logic) - *Interprets and applies the configuration*.
        *   Executor configuration - *Specifically, the settings within `nextflow.config`*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Access Control:** Implement *strict* access controls on the `nextflow.config` file, allowing only authorized users to modify it.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Use file integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized changes to *this specific file*.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the `nextflow.config` file for suspicious settings *related to Nextflow's operation*.
        *   **Version Control:** Store the `nextflow.config` file in a version control system (Git) to track changes.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement validation checks *within Nextflow or a wrapper script* to ensure settings are within acceptable ranges and don't violate security policies.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Nextflow Logs/Outputs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_nextflow_logsoutputs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Nextflow Logs/Outputs

    *   **Description:** Sensitive data is inadvertently printed to standard output, standard error, or log files *due to actions within the Nextflow workflow or Nextflow's handling of process output*. This is a direct threat to how Nextflow manages and presents information. The workflow scripts or the tools they use, *as executed by Nextflow*, might not be properly configured to handle sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data could be exposed.
        *   **Compliance Violations:** Exposure of PII or regulated data.
        *   **Reputation Damage:** Data breaches can damage reputation.
    *   **Affected Nextflow Component:**
        *   Process Definitions (within `.nf` files) - *Where the scripts and commands that might leak data are defined*.
        *   Nextflow Logging (standard output, standard error, `.nextflow.log`) - *Nextflow's own logging mechanisms*.
        *   Executor (indirectly, as it captures the output *as managed by Nextflow*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode sensitive data in workflow scripts.
        *   **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data in environment variables and access them securely within the workflow *using Nextflow's mechanisms for environment variable handling*.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Use a secrets management system, integrating it with *Nextflow's execution context*.
        *   **Log Redaction:** Implement log redaction *specifically for Nextflow's logs and output streams*.
        *   **Code Review:** Review workflow scripts and configurations to ensure sensitive data is not being printed.
        *   **Secure Output Handling:** Configure Nextflow and the executor to store output files securely, *using Nextflow's directives for output management*.
        *   Nextflow `secret` directive (if applicable, and ensure it's used correctly).
