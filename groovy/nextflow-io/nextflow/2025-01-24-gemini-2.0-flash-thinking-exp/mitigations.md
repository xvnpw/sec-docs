## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation within Nextflow Processes](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_within_nextflow_processes.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization and Validation within Nextflow Processes
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Input Points in Nextflow:** Review your Nextflow workflow (`.nf` files) and identify all `params`, input channels, and data fetched within processes that originate from external sources or user input.
        2.  **Implement Validation in Process Scripts:** Within the `script` or `shell` blocks of your Nextflow processes, add validation steps at the beginning of the script. Use shell commands or scripting language features (like Python, Bash, etc. if used within the script) to check the format, type, and allowed values of input variables *before* they are used in commands.
        3.  **Utilize Nextflow `if` Conditions for Validation:**  Incorporate `if` statements within your Nextflow process scripts to perform validation checks. For example, check if a parameter is within an expected range or if an input file exists and is of the correct type before proceeding with the main process logic.
        4.  **Fail Fast and Provide Informative Errors:** If validation fails within a Nextflow process, use `exit 1` (or similar in your scripting language) to immediately terminate the process and signal an error to Nextflow.  Include informative error messages in the `error` channel output or logs to help users understand the validation failure.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Command Injection (High Severity): Prevents attackers from injecting malicious shell commands by manipulating user inputs that are not properly sanitized *before* being used in shell commands *within Nextflow processes*.
        *   Code Execution (High Severity): Mitigates the risk of attackers injecting malicious code into scripts executed by Nextflow processes through unsanitized inputs.
    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of command injection and code execution vulnerabilities *specifically within Nextflow workflows*. The effectiveness depends on how thoroughly validation is implemented in each process.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic type checking using `if` conditions might be present in some process scripts in `modules/` directory.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing systematic and comprehensive input validation in *all* Nextflow processes, especially those handling user-provided parameters or external data. Validation logic needs to be consistently applied across all relevant processes in `.nf` files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Process Isolation using Nextflow's Container Support (Docker/Singularity)](./mitigation_strategies/process_isolation_using_nextflow's_container_support__dockersingularity_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Process Isolation using Nextflow's Container Support (Docker/Singularity)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Containers in Nextflow Processes:**  For each Nextflow `process` definition in your `.nf` files, utilize the `container` directive to specify a Docker or Singularity container image. This ensures that the process executes within the isolated environment of the container.
        2.  **Configure Nextflow Executor for Containers:** Configure your `nextflow.config` file to use the `docker` or `singularity` executor. This tells Nextflow to launch processes within the specified container runtime.
        3.  **Build Minimal Containers for Nextflow Processes:** Create container images specifically tailored for each Nextflow process, including only the necessary tools and dependencies. This minimizes the attack surface within the containerized environment.
        4.  **Leverage Nextflow's Container Options:** Explore and utilize Nextflow's container-related configuration options in `nextflow.config` or process directives to further control container execution, such as mounting volumes securely or setting resource limits within containers.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Command Injection (Medium Severity - Impact Reduction): While containerization in Nextflow doesn't prevent command injection, it significantly limits the *impact* of a successful command injection *within a Nextflow workflow*. A compromised process inside a container is isolated from the host system and other Nextflow processes.
        *   Code Execution (Medium Severity - Impact Reduction): Similar to command injection, Nextflow's container support limits the impact of malicious code execution within a process.
        *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of privilege escalation from a compromised Nextflow process to the host system, as containers provide isolation managed by Nextflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Significantly reduces the *impact* of command injection and code execution vulnerabilities *in Nextflow pipelines* by containing the damage within Nextflow-managed containers. Limits lateral movement and prevents compromise of the host system *from within Nextflow processes*.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for compute-intensive processes defined in `modules/` directory. `container` directives are used in process definitions and `docker` executor is configured in `nextflow.config`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Not consistently applied to all Nextflow processes, especially simpler utility processes defined directly in the main workflow (`main.nf`). Need to ensure all processes, regardless of complexity, are containerized using Nextflow's `container` directive for consistent isolation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits using Nextflow Resource Directives](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_using_nextflow_resource_directives.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits using Nextflow Resource Directives
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Analyze Resource Needs per Nextflow Process:** For each `process` in your Nextflow workflow (`.nf` files), analyze its typical and maximum resource requirements (CPU, memory, execution time).
        2.  **Define Resource Directives in Processes:**  Within each `process` definition, use Nextflow's resource directives: `cpus`, `memory`, `time`, and `disk`. Set appropriate values based on the analyzed resource needs.  These directives instruct Nextflow to request and enforce these limits during process execution.
        3.  **Configure Nextflow Executor to Enforce Limits:** Ensure that the Nextflow executor configured in `nextflow.config` (e.g., `local`, `slurm`, `awsbatch`) is capable of enforcing the resource limits specified by the Nextflow directives. Most executors will respect these directives.
        4.  **Monitor Nextflow Execution for Resource Usage:** Utilize Nextflow's monitoring capabilities (e.g., execution reports, trace files) or external monitoring tools to track the resource usage of running Nextflow pipelines and processes. Identify processes that are approaching or exceeding their defined limits.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Prevents a runaway Nextflow process or a malicious pipeline from consuming excessive resources and causing a denial of service *within the Nextflow execution environment*.
        *   Resource Starvation (Medium Severity): Prevents resource starvation for other Nextflow pipelines by ensuring fair resource allocation *managed by Nextflow* and limiting the resource consumption of individual processes *within Nextflow workflows*.
    *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion and denial of service *specifically within Nextflow executions* by enforcing resource limits defined directly in Nextflow workflows. Ensures more stable and predictable resource allocation for Nextflow pipelines.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Resource directives (`cpus`, `memory`, `time`) are used for some compute-intensive processes in `modules/` directory and some processes in `main.nf`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Resource directives are not consistently defined for *all* Nextflow processes. Need to systematically review and add resource directives to all process definitions in `.nf` files to ensure comprehensive resource management within Nextflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Data Size and Complexity within Nextflow Workflow](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_data_size_and_complexity_within_nextflow_workflow.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation for Data Size and Complexity within Nextflow Workflow
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Acceptable Input Limits in Nextflow:** Determine reasonable limits for the size and complexity of input data that your Nextflow pipeline is designed to handle. Consider file sizes, number of input files, or data structure complexity relevant to your workflow.
        2.  **Implement Input Validation at Workflow Start:** At the beginning of your main Nextflow workflow (`main.nf`), add validation steps to check the size and complexity of input data *before* launching resource-intensive processes. Use Nextflow scripting features or external tools within a dedicated initial process to perform these checks.
        3.  **Use Nextflow `error` Channel for Input Rejection:** If input data exceeds the defined limits, use Nextflow's `error` channel to signal a workflow failure and provide an informative error message to the user indicating that the input data is too large or complex. This prevents the pipeline from proceeding with excessive input.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Input Overload (Medium Severity): Prevents attackers from overloading the Nextflow pipeline with excessively large or complex input data, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service *of the Nextflow pipeline*.
        *   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity): Prevents performance degradation of the Nextflow pipeline caused by processing excessively large or complex input data that exceeds the pipeline's designed capacity.
    *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of denial of service and performance degradation *specifically for the Nextflow pipeline* caused by input overload. Ensures that the Nextflow workflow operates within its designed and tested capacity.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic input file size checks might be present at the beginning of `main.nf` for some key input channels.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Input validation for data complexity and other input characteristics is largely missing. Validation is not consistently applied to all relevant input channels at the workflow entry point in `main.nf`. Need to implement more robust and comprehensive input validation logic at the start of the Nextflow workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Nextflow's Secret Handling (Environment Variables with Caution)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_nextflow's_secret_handling__environment_variables_with_caution_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Nextflow's Secret Handling (Environment Variables with Caution)
    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Use Environment Variables for Secrets in Nextflow:**  Nextflow allows accessing environment variables within process scripts. You can leverage this to pass secrets to Nextflow processes *instead of hardcoding them*.
        2.  **Set Environment Variables Securely Outside Nextflow:** Configure your Nextflow execution environment (e.g., job scheduler, cloud platform) to securely set environment variables containing secrets *before* Nextflow execution begins. Avoid storing secrets directly in Nextflow configuration files or workflow code.
        3.  **Access Environment Variables in Process Scripts:** Within your Nextflow process scripts, access the secrets using environment variable syntax (e.g., `$MY_SECRET` in Bash).
        4.  **Restrict Access to Environment Variables:**  Be aware that environment variables can sometimes be logged or exposed.  Implement access control measures in your execution environment to restrict access to environment variables containing secrets to only authorized processes and users. *This method is less secure than dedicated secrets management systems but is a Nextflow-relevant approach*.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Secrets Exposure (Medium Severity - Reduced compared to hardcoding): Reduces the risk of hardcoding secrets in Nextflow code or configuration files, which are more easily exposed. Using environment variables is a *relative* improvement within the context of Nextflow's capabilities.
        *   Credential Theft (Medium Severity - Reduced compared to hardcoding):  Reduces the risk of credential theft compared to hardcoding, as secrets are not directly present in the codebase. However, environment variables are still less secure than dedicated secrets management.
    *   **Impact:** Reduces the risk of secrets exposure and credential theft *compared to hardcoding secrets in Nextflow workflows*.  Provides a *basic* level of secret management *within Nextflow's capabilities*, but is less secure than dedicated systems.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Environment variables are used to pass some configuration parameters to Nextflow processes, but not consistently for sensitive secrets.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Need to systematically migrate secrets from configuration files or hardcoded values to environment variables for Nextflow processes. Need to improve documentation and guidance on securely setting and managing environment variables in the Nextflow execution environment. *Consider migrating to a dedicated secrets management system for stronger security in the future*.
