# Attack Surface Analysis for nextflow-io/nextflow

## Attack Surface: [Workflow Definition (DSL2) Injection](./attack_surfaces/workflow_definition__dsl2__injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting dynamic workflow generation or untrusted input within Nextflow DSL2 to inject malicious Groovy code, leading to arbitrary code execution within the Nextflow engine.
    *   **Nextflow Contribution:** Nextflow's DSL2, based on Groovy, allows for dynamic workflow construction. This flexibility, if misused, creates a direct pathway for code injection vulnerabilities within the workflow definition itself.
    *   **Example:** A workflow dynamically constructs a process command using user-provided input intended for a filename, but an attacker injects Groovy code instead, leading to arbitrary code execution when Nextflow parses and executes the workflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the Nextflow engine, potentially leading to full system compromise, sensitive data breaches, or complete denial of service of the Nextflow execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prioritize static workflow definitions:** Avoid dynamic workflow generation based on untrusted input whenever possible. Design workflows to be statically defined and parameterized securely.
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** If dynamic generation is absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate *all* external inputs used in workflow construction. Treat any external data as potentially malicious.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices for DSL2:** Treat workflow definitions as critical code. Apply secure coding practices, including thorough code reviews focusing on injection vulnerabilities and static analysis tools to detect potential issues.
        *   **Parameterization:** Utilize parameterized workflow definitions and functions instead of string concatenation to build workflow logic, reducing the risk of injection.

## Attack Surface: [Process Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/process_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious shell commands through unsanitized process inputs (parameters, channel data) within Nextflow processes, leading to arbitrary code execution within the process execution environment.
    *   **Nextflow Contribution:** Nextflow processes are designed to execute shell commands, scripts, or programs. The ease with which data from Nextflow channels and parameters can be incorporated into these commands creates direct injection points if input validation and sanitization are neglected.
    *   **Example:** A Nextflow process uses a user-provided string directly within a `bash` command without any sanitization. An attacker provides a malicious input like `; malicious_command &`, which gets executed by the shell within the process container or directly on the host if containers are not used.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the process execution environment (container or host). This can lead to unauthorized access to data processed by the workflow, modification or deletion of data, escalation of privileges, or denial of service of the workflow execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Always sanitize and rigorously validate *all* process inputs before using them in shell commands or scripts. Implement input validation at the process level to ensure data conforms to expected formats and constraints.
        *   **Parameterized Commands and Functions:**  Favor using parameterized commands or functions provided by scripting languages or external tools to avoid direct string concatenation of inputs into shell commands. This helps separate code from data and reduces injection risks.
        *   **Secure Scripting Practices:** Employ secure coding practices within process scripts. Avoid using shell interpreters directly when possible. Utilize safer alternatives or libraries that offer built-in protection against command injection.
        *   **Input Validation Mechanisms:** Leverage Nextflow's or external libraries' input validation and sanitization mechanisms to enforce data integrity and security.
        *   **Containerization as a Mitigation Layer:** Utilize containerized processes. While not a complete solution, containerization can limit the impact of command injection to the container environment, preventing direct host system compromise in many scenarios.

## Attack Surface: [Nextflow Plugins and Extensions (Untrusted or Vulnerable)](./attack_surfaces/nextflow_plugins_and_extensions__untrusted_or_vulnerable_.md)

*   **Description:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities through the use of untrusted or poorly secured Nextflow plugins and extensions.
    *   **Nextflow Contribution:** Nextflow's plugin architecture allows for extending its core functionality. However, if plugins are sourced from untrusted locations or are developed without security considerations, they can introduce new attack vectors directly into the Nextflow environment.
    *   **Example:** A seemingly helpful Nextflow plugin, downloaded from an unofficial repository, contains a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary file read access when used within a workflow. This could be exploited to access sensitive data processed by the workflow.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the plugin's functionality and vulnerabilities, impacts can range from information disclosure and data breaches to arbitrary code execution within the Nextflow engine or workflow execution environment, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Plugin Sources:**  Strictly use plugins only from trusted and officially recognized sources. Verify the plugin's origin and maintainer reputation.
        *   **Plugin Security Audits:**  Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of any plugins before deploying them in production workflows, especially those handling sensitive data or interacting with external systems.
        *   **Regular Plugin Updates and Monitoring:**  Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches. Monitor plugin repositories and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:**  If possible, implement mechanisms to limit the privileges and access rights granted to plugins, minimizing the potential impact of a compromised plugin.
        *   **Plugin Sandboxing/Isolation:** Explore and implement plugin sandboxing or isolation techniques to further contain the potential damage from a vulnerable plugin.

## Attack Surface: [Nextflow Configuration and Secrets Management (Insecure Handling)](./attack_surfaces/nextflow_configuration_and_secrets_management__insecure_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, and database passwords, due to insecure storage and management within Nextflow configurations.
    *   **Nextflow Contribution:** Nextflow configurations often require sensitive information to access external resources (cloud platforms, databases, APIs) necessary for workflow execution. If these configurations are not handled securely, Nextflow becomes a conduit for exposing these secrets.
    *   **Example:** Storing cloud provider access keys or database credentials in plain text directly within a Nextflow configuration file that is then committed to a version control system or shared insecurely.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external resources and systems protected by the exposed secrets. This can lead to data breaches in connected systems, unauthorized resource usage, financial losses, and disruption of services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Eliminate Hardcoded Secrets:**  Absolutely avoid hardcoding secrets directly in Nextflow configuration files or workflow definitions.
        *   **Utilize Secure Secrets Management:** Implement robust secrets management practices. Leverage environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, CyberArk), or Nextflow's built-in secrets management features to securely store and retrieve sensitive information.
        *   **Externalized Configuration:** Externalize sensitive configurations from the workflow code and configuration files. Load secrets at runtime from secure external sources.
        *   **Access Control for Configurations and Secrets:** Implement strict access control mechanisms to limit who can access Nextflow configuration files and secrets storage systems. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Secrets Rotation and Auditing:** Regularly rotate secrets and implement auditing mechanisms to track access and modifications to sensitive configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration via Workflow Logic (Malicious or Unintentional)](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration_via_workflow_logic__malicious_or_unintentional_.md)

*   **Description:** Workflow logic designed or configured in a way that allows for the unauthorized or unintentional exfiltration of sensitive data processed by Nextflow workflows.
    *   **Nextflow Contribution:** Nextflow workflows orchestrate complex data processing pipelines, including data movement and output. Poorly designed or maliciously crafted workflows can be exploited to leak sensitive data to external, untrusted locations.
    *   **Example:** A workflow processing sensitive patient data is configured to inadvertently upload intermediate or final results to a publicly accessible cloud storage bucket due to misconfiguration in the workflow logic or output channels.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of confidentiality of sensitive data, potential regulatory compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Minimization in Workflow Design:** Design workflows with data minimization principles in mind. Only process and output the necessary data. Avoid unnecessary data movement or storage.
        *   **Strict Output Channel Controls:** Implement strict controls and validation on Nextflow output channels. Ensure that data is only written to authorized and secure destinations.
        *   **Data Access Control within Workflows:** Implement data access control mechanisms within the workflow logic to restrict access to sensitive data to only authorized processes and steps.
        *   **Regular Workflow Security Reviews:** Conduct regular security reviews of workflow definitions and configurations to identify potential data exfiltration risks and ensure data handling practices align with security policies.
        *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Measures:** Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to monitor and prevent sensitive data from being exfiltrated from the Nextflow environment.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Nextflow Core and Libraries](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_nextflow_core_and_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known security vulnerabilities present in Nextflow's core code or its underlying dependencies (e.g., Groovy, Java libraries).
    *   **Nextflow Contribution:** Nextflow, being a software application, relies on various dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact the security of the Nextflow engine itself and any workflows executed by it.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the Groovy language runtime used by Nextflow. If Nextflow is running an outdated version of Groovy, this vulnerability could be exploited to gain remote code execution on the Nextflow server.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the Nextflow engine itself, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the Nextflow server, full system compromise, and denial of service for all workflows managed by that Nextflow instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High to Critical** (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Maintain Up-to-Date Nextflow and Dependencies:**  Keep Nextflow and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions. Regularly check for and apply security patches released by the Nextflow project and its dependency providers.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Patching Process:** Implement a robust vulnerability monitoring and patching process. Subscribe to security advisories for Nextflow and its dependencies. Promptly address and patch identified vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning Tools:** Utilize dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in Nextflow's dependencies. Integrate these tools into the development and deployment pipeline.
        *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Nextflow deployments. This helps track dependencies and facilitates vulnerability management and incident response.
        *   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular security assessments of the Nextflow environment, including dependency checks, to proactively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
