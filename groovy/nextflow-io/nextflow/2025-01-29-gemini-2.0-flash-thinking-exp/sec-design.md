# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Scientific Research and Data Analysis: Nextflow is used to automate and accelerate scientific research by enabling efficient and reproducible data analysis workflows. Protecting the integrity and availability of these workflows is critical for research progress.
  - Data Processing Pipelines: Nextflow orchestrates complex data processing pipelines, often involving large and sensitive datasets. Ensuring the secure and reliable execution of these pipelines is crucial for data-driven decision-making and research outcomes.
  - Workflow Development and Sharing: Nextflow facilitates collaboration and knowledge sharing through workflow development and exchange. Protecting the intellectual property and integrity of workflows is important for maintaining trust and fostering innovation within the community.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Research Data: Nextflow workflows often process sensitive research data, including genomic data, patient data, and other confidential information. The sensitivity level depends on the specific research domain and data being processed, but can be high, requiring strong data protection measures.
  - Workflow Definitions: Workflow definitions themselves can contain sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or proprietary algorithms. Protecting workflow definitions from unauthorized access and modification is important for security and intellectual property protection.
  - Execution Logs and Metadata: Workflow execution logs and metadata may contain information about data processed, workflow configurations, and execution environments. While less sensitive than raw data, these logs can still reveal valuable information and should be protected from unauthorized access.
