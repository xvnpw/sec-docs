# Threat Model Analysis for nextflow-io/nextflow

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection in Workflow Definition](./threats/malicious_code_injection_in_workflow_definition.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code or commands directly into the Nextflow DSL (Domain Specific Language) of a workflow definition. This might occur if workflow definitions are built dynamically using untrusted input. The attacker could manipulate the DSL syntax or embed shell commands within process definitions.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system where the Nextflow executor runs. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, installation of malware, or denial of service.
- **Affected Component:** Nextflow DSL parser, workflow execution engine.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Strictly control the source of workflow definitions.
    - Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for any dynamic parts of the workflow definition.
    - Employ static analysis tools to detect potential code injection vulnerabilities in workflows.
    - Avoid constructing workflow definitions dynamically from untrusted user input or external data without thorough sanitization.

## Threat: [Command Injection in Process Definitions](./threats/command_injection_in_process_definitions.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious commands into the `script` or `shell` blocks of a Nextflow process definition. This is possible if the commands within these blocks are constructed using untrusted input, such as parameters passed to the process. The attacker could manipulate these inputs to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system where the Nextflow process is executed. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, or resource exhaustion.
- **Affected Component:** Nextflow process execution engine, specifically the handling of `script` and `shell` directives.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid constructing process scripts dynamically from untrusted input.
    - Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives where possible.
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all parameters used within process scripts.
    - Enforce the principle of least privilege for the user running Nextflow processes.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks through Malicious Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_through_malicious_dependencies.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could compromise software dependencies used by Nextflow workflows. This could involve injecting malicious code into Conda environments, Docker images, or other dependencies specified by the workflow. The attacker might target publicly available packages or attempt to compromise private repositories.
- **Impact:** Execution of malicious code within the Nextflow environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or the introduction of backdoors.
- **Affected Component:** Nextflow dependency management (Conda integration, Docker integration, etc.).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use trusted and verified sources for dependencies.
    - Employ dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - Regularly update dependencies to patch security flaws.
    - Implement a process for verifying the integrity of downloaded dependencies (e.g., using checksums).
    - Consider using private package repositories with strict access controls.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Process Environment Variables](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_process_environment_variables.md)

- **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or database credentials, might be inadvertently exposed through environment variables accessible to Nextflow processes. An attacker who gains access to the execution environment could read these variables.
- **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to external services or systems, potential for further exploitation using the exposed credentials.
- **Affected Component:** Nextflow process execution environment, handling of environment variables.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables.
    - Use secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and inject secrets securely into the process environment only when necessary.
    - Ensure that environment variables are not logged or exposed in easily accessible locations.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data in Workflows](./threats/insecure_handling_of_sensitive_data_in_workflows.md)

- **Description:** Nextflow workflows might process sensitive data without proper encryption or access controls. This could occur during intermediate steps, in the final output, or in temporary files created by processes. An attacker gaining access to the filesystem or storage could access this data.
- **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, violation of privacy regulations.
- **Affected Component:** Nextflow data management, channel operations, process execution.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the workflow.
    - Implement access controls to restrict access to data and intermediate files.
    - Sanitize or redact sensitive data when necessary.
    - Ensure temporary files containing sensitive data are securely deleted after use.
