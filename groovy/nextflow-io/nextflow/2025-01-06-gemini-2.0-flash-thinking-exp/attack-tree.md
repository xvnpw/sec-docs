## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nextflow DSL Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nextflow_dsl_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious code within Nextflow scripts. When these scripts are parsed or executed by the Nextflow engine, the malicious code is also executed. This can be achieved through techniques like manipulating string interpolation, exploiting parsing flaws in the DSL, or leveraging insecure features of the language.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical

**Critical Node: Inject malicious code within Nextflow scripts**

* **Attack Vector:** This is the core of the DSL exploitation path. The attacker's goal is to inject code that the Nextflow interpreter will execute as part of the workflow. This could involve manipulating input that is directly incorporated into script execution or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Nextflow handles dynamic code generation.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Process Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_process_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting how Nextflow executes individual processes defined in the workflow. Vulnerabilities arise from insecure construction of shell commands, misconfigurations in container environments, or the ability to influence the environment in which processes run.
* **Risk Assessment:** This path encompasses multiple critical nodes, each with a significant risk.

**Critical Node: Command Injection through process definitions**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates input data that is used to construct shell commands executed by Nextflow processes. By injecting malicious commands into this data, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system running the Nextflow executor.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical

**Critical Node: Exploiting insecure container configurations (Docker/Singularity)**

* **Attack Vector:** If Nextflow uses containers (Docker or Singularity), insecure configurations can be exploited. This includes running containers as root, exposing unnecessary ports, or having insufficient resource limits. Attackers can leverage these misconfigurations to escape the container and gain access to the host system or other containers.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical

**Critical Node: Exploiting insecure secrets management**

* **Attack Vector:** Nextflow configurations or processes might handle sensitive secrets (like API keys, database passwords) insecurely. This could involve storing them in plain text in configuration files, environment variables, or code. Attackers gaining access to these secrets can compromise other systems or data.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input/Output Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inputoutput_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path involves manipulating the input data or file paths provided to Nextflow workflows. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in how Nextflow handles file paths to access files outside the intended scope (path traversal).
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Significant

**Critical Node: Path Traversal through input channels**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input file paths that allow access to files and directories outside the intended working directory of the Nextflow process. This can lead to information disclosure, modification of sensitive files, or even code execution in some scenarios.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Significant

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Nextflow's Interaction with External Resources](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_nextflow's_interaction_with_external_resources.md)

**Critical Node: Exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud provider integrations**

* **Attack Vector:** If Nextflow integrates with cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud), vulnerabilities in the integration logic or the underlying cloud provider APIs can be exploited. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources, manipulate data, or disrupt cloud services.
* **Risk Assessment:**
    * Likelihood: Very Low
    * Impact: Critical
