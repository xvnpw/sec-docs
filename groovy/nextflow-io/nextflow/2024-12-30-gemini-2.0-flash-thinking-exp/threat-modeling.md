### High and Critical Nextflow Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the Nextflow software.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Workflow Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code directly into a Nextflow workflow definition (DSL2). This might occur if the application allows users to upload or define workflows without proper sanitization *within the Nextflow processing*. The attacker could embed commands that Nextflow interprets and executes on the Nextflow execution environment.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Nextflow execution environment, leading to data breaches, system disruption, resource hijacking, or the execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Nextflow process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nextflow DSL2 Parser, Workflow Execution Engine
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided workflow definitions *before they are processed by Nextflow*.
        *   Use parameterized inputs and avoid string concatenation for constructing commands within workflows.
        *   Enforce code review processes for workflow definitions.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for workflow execution *managed by Nextflow*.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection within Processes
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands into Nextflow processes if user-supplied data or parameters are not properly sanitized *by the Nextflow application* before being passed to shell commands within `script` or `shell` blocks. The attacker could manipulate input channels or parameters that Nextflow uses to construct these commands.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the context of the Nextflow process, potentially leading to data manipulation, access to sensitive information, or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Execution Engine, `script` and `shell` blocks
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `script` and `shell` blocks where possible. Prefer using native Nextflow operators and functions.
        *   If `script` or `shell` is necessary, use parameterized commands and avoid string interpolation of user-provided data *within the Nextflow workflow*.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all data passed to shell commands *within the Nextflow workflow definition*.
        *   Use secure coding practices to prevent command injection vulnerabilities *within Nextflow workflows*.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Configuration of Execution Environments
    *   **Description:** Misconfigured Nextflow execution environments (e.g., local, HPC, cloud) *specifically related to Nextflow's configuration* could introduce vulnerabilities. This includes weak authentication for remote execution *managed by Nextflow*, or insecure file system permissions *on Nextflow's work directories*.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the underlying infrastructure where Nextflow is running, potentially impacting other applications and data. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or the ability to manipulate Nextflow executions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nextflow Configuration, Execution Environment (Local, HPC, Cloud)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow security best practices for configuring the chosen execution environment *as it pertains to Nextflow's requirements*.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for remote access *if enabled in Nextflow*.
        *   Restrict network access to necessary ports and services *used by Nextflow*.
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions are set to protect workflow data and configuration files *managed by Nextflow*.
        *   Regularly review and audit the Nextflow execution environment configuration.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** Nextflow configuration files (e.g., `nextflow.config`) might contain sensitive information like API keys, credentials for external services *used by Nextflow processes*, or access tokens. If these files are not properly secured *within the Nextflow deployment*, they could be exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services or resources, potentially leading to data breaches, financial loss, or the ability to impersonate legitimate users *interacting with Nextflow*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nextflow Configuration Files (`nextflow.config`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Nextflow configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to store and access sensitive credentials *used by Nextflow*.
        *   Ensure proper file permissions are set on Nextflow configuration files to restrict access.

*   **Threat:** Compromise of Nextflow Orchestration Components
    *   **Description:** If the Nextflow orchestration components (e.g., the Nextflow engine itself, any associated databases or message queues *used internally by Nextflow*) are compromised due to vulnerabilities in the Nextflow software, attackers could manipulate workflow execution, access sensitive data managed by Nextflow, or disrupt the entire system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Nextflow application and potentially the underlying infrastructure, leading to data breaches, system disruption, and loss of control over workflow execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nextflow Engine, Associated Databases/Message Queues
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Nextflow software updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Secure the underlying infrastructure where Nextflow is running.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to Nextflow orchestration components.
        *   Monitor the health and security of Nextflow orchestration components.

*   **Threat:** Exfiltration of Data through Workflow Processes
    *   **Description:** Malicious workflows could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data to external locations controlled by the attacker *using Nextflow's process execution capabilities*. This could be done by embedding commands within Nextflow processes to upload data to external servers.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches and loss of confidential information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Execution, Network Access
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict network access from within the Nextflow execution environment to only necessary destinations.
        *   Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections *originating from Nextflow processes*.
        *   Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures.
        *   Regularly review workflow definitions for suspicious network activity.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugins
    *   **Description:** Attackers could introduce malicious plugins designed to compromise the Nextflow environment, steal data, or disrupt operations. This could involve tricking users into installing malicious plugins *within Nextflow's plugin management system* or exploiting vulnerabilities in the plugin installation process.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious workflow code injection, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or the ability to manipulate workflow execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nextflow Plugin System, Plugin Installation Mechanism
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict controls over plugin installation and management *within Nextflow*.
        *   Only allow installation of plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Implement a plugin verification process.
        *   Regularly audit installed plugins.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for plugin execution *managed by Nextflow*.
