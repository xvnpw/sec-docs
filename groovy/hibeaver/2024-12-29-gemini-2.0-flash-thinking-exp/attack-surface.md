Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on elements directly involving Hibeaver with High or Critical risk severity:

* **Unsanitized User Input Leading to Command Injection:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious commands into the backend system by providing unsanitized input that is passed through Hibeaver to the terminal.
    * **How Hibeaver Contributes:** Hibeaver's core function is to relay user input to a terminal process. Without proper sanitization *before* reaching Hibeaver, it becomes a conduit for malicious commands.
    * **Example:** A user enters `; rm -rf /` in the terminal interface. If not sanitized, Hibeaver will send this to the backend, potentially deleting all files on the server.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the server, data loss, service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Server-Side Input Sanitization:**  Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the backend *before* passing any user input to Hibeaver. Use allow-lists for expected commands or parameters.
        * **Command Parameterization:** If possible, structure the application to execute predefined commands with user-provided parameters, rather than directly executing arbitrary user input.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Hibeaver process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful command injection.

* **Exposure of Sensitive Backend Information:**
    * **Description:** The terminal environment exposed by Hibeaver can reveal sensitive information about the server's configuration, running processes, environment variables, and files.
    * **How Hibeaver Contributes:** Hibeaver facilitates the display of terminal output, which can include sensitive data if not carefully managed.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses commands like `env`, `ps aux`, or `cat /etc/shadow` within the Hibeaver terminal to view environment variables, running processes, or potentially user credentials.
    * **Impact:** High - Information disclosure, potential for privilege escalation or further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Restrict Command Execution:** Limit the commands that can be executed through Hibeaver to only those absolutely necessary for the application's functionality. Implement a whitelist of allowed commands.
        * **Output Filtering and Sanitization:**  Filter and sanitize the output received from the terminal process before displaying it to the user to remove sensitive information.
        * **Secure Environment Variables:** Avoid storing sensitive information in environment variables accessible to the Hibeaver process.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review the commands and information accessible through the Hibeaver interface.

* **Resource Exhaustion via Terminal Commands:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can send commands through Hibeaver that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to denial of service.
    * **How Hibeaver Contributes:** Hibeaver allows the execution of arbitrary commands, including those that can be resource-intensive.
    * **Example:** An attacker executes a fork bomb (`:(){ :|:& };:`) or a command that creates a very large file, overwhelming the server.
    * **Impact:** High - Denial of service, impacting application availability and potentially other services on the same server.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the number of commands a user can execute through Hibeaver within a given timeframe.
        * **Resource Quotas:** If possible, set resource quotas for the process running the Hibeaver terminal.
        * **Command Execution Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for command execution to prevent long-running, resource-intensive processes.
        * **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.

* **Insecure Authentication and Authorization for Terminal Access:**
    * **Description:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization controls for accessing the Hibeaver-powered terminal can allow unauthorized users to execute commands.
    * **How Hibeaver Contributes:** Hibeaver provides the interface for interacting with the terminal; the application is responsible for securing access to this interface.
    * **Example:**  A publicly accessible endpoint exposes the Hibeaver terminal without any login or access controls, allowing anyone to execute commands.
    * **Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the server, data loss, service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Authentication:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, multi-factor authentication) before granting access to the Hibeaver terminal.
        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control which users or roles have access to the Hibeaver terminal and what commands they are allowed to execute.
        * **Session Management:** Securely manage user sessions to prevent session hijacking.

* **Session Hijacking of Terminal Sessions:**
    * **Description:** Attackers could potentially hijack active terminal sessions if session management is not implemented securely.
    * **How Hibeaver Contributes:** Hibeaver manages the communication channel for the terminal session; vulnerabilities in session management can expose this channel.
    * **Example:**  Session IDs are predictable or transmitted insecurely, allowing an attacker to take over a legitimate user's terminal session.
    * **Impact:** High - Unauthorized access to the backend system with the privileges of the hijacked user.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Session ID Generation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for session IDs.
        * **HTTPS Only:** Enforce the use of HTTPS to encrypt communication and protect session IDs from eavesdropping.
        * **Session Expiration and Timeout:** Implement appropriate session expiration and timeout mechanisms.
        * **Regenerate Session IDs:** Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation attacks.
