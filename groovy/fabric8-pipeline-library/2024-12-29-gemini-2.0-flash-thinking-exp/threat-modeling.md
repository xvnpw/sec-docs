*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection in Pipeline Definitions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., Groovy scripts, shell commands) into pipeline definitions. This could be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the library parses or processes these definitions. The injected code would then be executed by the pipeline runner.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise of the pipeline execution environment, data exfiltration from systems accessible by the pipeline, deployment of backdoors, disruption of the CI/CD process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Pipeline Definition Processing module, potentially the Groovy execution engine integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all pipeline definition inputs within the library.
        *   Utilize parameterized pipeline definitions where possible to limit the scope of user-provided input processed by the library.
        *   Employ secure coding practices within the library to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using sandboxed environments or containerization for pipeline execution to limit the impact of malicious code executed by the library.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Pipeline Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker could bypass access controls implemented within the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and trigger the execution of pipelines they are not authorized to run. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the library's authentication or authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of unintended code orchestrated by the library, potential deployment of malicious artifacts through the pipeline, resource consumption on the pipeline execution environment, exposure of sensitive information handled by the pipeline.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication and Authorization module, Pipeline Triggering API within the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within the library for triggering pipeline executions.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for pipeline access managed by the library.
        *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations within the library.

*   **Threat:** Secrets Exposure through Insecure Handling
    *   **Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library` might handle sensitive information like credentials or API keys required for pipeline tasks. An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how the library stores, retrieves, or transmits these secrets, leading to their exposure. This could involve accessing configuration files managed by the library, logs generated by the library, or intercepting network traffic related to the library's operations.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of external services and resources accessed by the pipeline, data breaches due to exposed credentials, unauthorized access to infrastructure managed or accessed by the pipeline.
    *   **Affected Component:** Secrets Management module within the library, potentially logging mechanisms and network communication functions used by the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and ensure the library integrates with them securely.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in pipeline definitions or configuration files managed by the library.
        *   Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit within the library's operations.
        *   Implement mechanisms within the library to prevent secrets from being logged or exposed in error messages.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library` relies on various third-party libraries. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application or the pipeline execution environment through the `fabric8-pipeline-library`. This could involve crafting specific inputs or requests that are processed by the vulnerable dependency through the library.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, this could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the library or the pipeline execution environment, denial of service affecting the library's functionality, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependency Management within the library, potentially any module utilizing the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Implement dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the library and its dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Pipeline Definition Tampering (Integrity Violation)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the storage or management system for pipeline definitions used by the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and modify them to introduce malicious steps or alter the intended workflow. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the library's definition management features.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of backdoors into deployed applications through the modified pipeline, deployment of malicious code orchestrated by the library, disruption of the CI/CD process managed by the library, potential data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Pipeline Definition Storage and Management module within the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement version control for pipeline definitions managed by the library.
        *   Restrict access to modify pipeline definitions based on the principle of least privilege within the library's management features.
        *   Use code signing or other mechanisms to ensure the authenticity and integrity of pipeline definitions processed by the library.
        *   Implement audit logging for changes to pipeline definitions managed by the library.
