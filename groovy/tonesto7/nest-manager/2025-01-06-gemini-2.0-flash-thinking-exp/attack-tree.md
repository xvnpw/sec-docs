## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Attacker's Goal: Compromise Application via Nest Manager (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_attacker's_goal_compromise_application_via_nest_manager__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate objective and represents a complete security breach.
*   Success here means the attacker has gained unauthorized access to the application's resources or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Nest Manager Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_nest_manager_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   This path involves directly exploiting weaknesses within the Nest Manager application itself.
*   Successful exploitation can lead to various forms of compromise, including code execution, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Code Injection in Nest Manager (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__code_injection_in_nest_manager__critical_node_.md)

*   This involves injecting malicious code that is then executed by the Nest Manager.
*   Impact is high as it allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands or code within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Command Injection via Malicious Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__command_injection_via_malicious_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   Injecting operating system commands into Nest Manager's configuration (e.g., during setup or updates).
*   Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Authentication/Authorization Bypass in Nest Manager (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__authenticationauthorization_bypass_in_nest_manager__critical_node_.md)

*   Circumventing security measures to gain unauthorized access or perform actions.
*   Allows attackers to bypass normal access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Nest API Authentication (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__bypass_nest_api_authentication__critical_node_.md)

*   Exploiting flaws in how Nest Manager handles Nest API credentials.
*   Allows attackers to impersonate the application and control Nest devices.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Data Leakage via Nest Manager (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__data_leakage_via_nest_manager__critical_node_.md)

*   Unintentional exposure of sensitive information through Nest Manager.
*   Can lead to the compromise of API keys or other sensitive application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Expose Sensitive Nest API Credentials (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__expose_sensitive_nest_api_credentials__critical_node_.md)

*   Retrieving stored Nest API keys or tokens from Nest Manager's storage.
*   Provides attackers with direct access to the Nest API, bypassing the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Nest API Interaction via Nest Manager (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_nest_api_interaction_via_nest_manager__critical_node_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting the communication channel between the application (via Nest Manager) and the Nest API.
*   Compromising this interaction can allow attackers to manipulate Nest devices or gain access to data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Steal Nest API Credentials Used by Nest Manager (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__steal_nest_api_credentials_used_by_nest_manager__critical_node_.md)

*   Obtaining the credentials that Nest Manager uses to authenticate with the Nest API.
*   Allows attackers to directly interact with the Nest API as the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Access Stored Credentials (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_stored_credentials__critical_node_.md)

*   Directly accessing the storage location of the Nest API credentials.
*   Often a low-effort attack if credentials are not properly secured.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Supply Chain Attack Targeting Nest Manager (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__supply_chain_attack_targeting_nest_manager__critical_node_.md)

*   This path involves compromising the Nest Manager library itself or its dependencies.
*   Successful attacks here can have widespread impact on all applications using the compromised library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Code into Nest Manager Repository (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_code_into_nest_manager_repository__critical_node_.md)

*   Injecting malicious code directly into the `tonesto7/nest-manager` repository.
*   This would affect all future installations or updates of the library.
