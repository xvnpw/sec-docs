# Attack Surface Analysis for tonesto7/nest-manager

## Attack Surface: [Nest API Key/Token Exposure](./attack_surfaces/nest_api_keytoken_exposure.md)

**Description:** The risk of unauthorized access to a user's Nest account due to the compromise of their Nest API key or OAuth token.

**How nest-manager Contributes:** `nest-manager` requires users to provide their Nest developer API keys or OAuth tokens to interact with the Nest API. If `nest-manager` stores these credentials insecurely, it directly contributes to this attack surface.

**Example:** `nest-manager` stores the Nest API key in plaintext within a configuration file on the server where it's running. An attacker gains access to this server and reads the configuration file, obtaining the API key.

**Impact:** Full control over the user's Nest devices (thermostats, cameras, etc.), access to historical data, potential for privacy breaches, and manipulation of home automation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement secure storage mechanisms for API keys and tokens (e.g., using OS keychains, dedicated secrets management libraries, encryption at rest). Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files.
* **Users:** Ensure the system running `nest-manager` is secure. Review the application's configuration and ensure proper permissions are set on configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Nest Account Compromise via OAuth Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/nest_account_compromise_via_oauth_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's Nest account by exploiting vulnerabilities in the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow implemented by `nest-manager`.

**How nest-manager Contributes:** If `nest-manager`'s implementation of the OAuth flow has weaknesses (e.g., improper redirect URI validation, allowing authorization code interception), it creates an opportunity for attackers.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by the user during the OAuth flow, redirects the authorization code to the attacker's server instead of `nest-manager`. The attacker then uses this code to obtain an access token.

**Impact:** Full control over the user's Nest account, similar to API key compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**  Strictly adhere to OAuth 2.0 best practices. Implement proper redirect URI validation. Ensure the state parameter is used and verified to prevent CSRF attacks. Use secure HTTPS for all communication during the OAuth flow.
* **Users:** Be cautious of links provided during the authorization process. Verify the URL of the authorization server.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Nest Device Data through Insecure Storage](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_nest_device_data_through_insecure_storage.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data about Nest devices (e.g., device IDs, names, settings, sensor readings) is exposed due to insecure storage practices within `nest-manager`.

**How nest-manager Contributes:** `nest-manager` likely stores information about connected Nest devices. If this data is stored without proper encryption or access controls, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** `nest-manager` stores a database containing device names and sensor readings without encryption. An attacker gains access to the server's filesystem and reads the database.

**Impact:** Privacy breach, potential for identifying user activity patterns, and information that could be used in further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Encrypt sensitive Nest device data at rest. Implement proper access controls to restrict who can access this data. Avoid storing more data than necessary.
* **Users:** Ensure the system running `nest-manager` has appropriate file system permissions. Regularly review the data stored by the application.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities due to Unsanitized Input](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_vulnerabilities_due_to_unsanitized_input.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious code into the `nest-manager` application by exploiting vulnerabilities in how it handles user input or data received from the Nest API.

**How nest-manager Contributes:** If `nest-manager` doesn't properly sanitize or validate data before processing it, it can be vulnerable to code injection.

**Example:** `nest-manager` allows users to define custom rules based on device names. If the application doesn't sanitize these names, an attacker could inject malicious code within the device name that gets executed by the application.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server running `nest-manager`, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data and data received from external sources like the Nest API. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection if a database is used.
* **Users:**  Avoid entering suspicious or unexpected data into `nest-manager`. Keep the application updated to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication Channels](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_channels.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data transmitted by `nest-manager` is vulnerable to interception if sent over insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted HTTP).

**How nest-manager Contributes:** If `nest-manager` communicates with the Nest API or other services over HTTP instead of HTTPS, or if internal communication is not encrypted, it exposes data in transit.

**Example:** `nest-manager` sends the Nest API key in the clear over an HTTP connection when authenticating.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data like API keys, access tokens, and device information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Enforce the use of HTTPS for all external communication with the Nest API and other services. Encrypt internal communication channels if necessary.
* **Users:** Ensure the network where `nest-manager` is running is secure. Avoid using `nest-manager` on untrusted networks.
