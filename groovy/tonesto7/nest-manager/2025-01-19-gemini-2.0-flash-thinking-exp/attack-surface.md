# Attack Surface Analysis for tonesto7/nest-manager

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Nest API Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_nest_api_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Nest API Credentials
    *   **Description:** Nest API credentials (like OAuth tokens) required by `nest-manager` are stored insecurely.
    *   **How `nest-manager` Contributes:** `nest-manager` necessitates the storage and use of these credentials to interact with the Nest API. The library's dependency on these credentials creates the vulnerability if not handled securely by the application.
    *   **Example:**  Credentials stored in plain text within a configuration file accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the linked Nest account, allowing an attacker to control all connected Nest devices (thermostats, cameras, doorbells, etc.), potentially leading to physical security breaches, privacy violations, or property damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Utilize secure storage mechanisms (e.g., environment variables, encrypted configuration files, dedicated secrets management).
            *   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code.
            *   Implement proper access controls to configuration files and storage locations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Nest Authentication Flow](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_nest_authentication_flow.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Handling of Nest Authentication Flow
    *   **Description:** The application implementing `nest-manager` mishandles the authentication process with the Nest API.
    *   **How `nest-manager` Contributes:** `nest-manager` relies on a proper authentication flow (likely OAuth). If the application doesn't correctly implement or validate this flow, it can introduce vulnerabilities that directly impact the library's ability to securely connect to Nest.
    *   **Example:**  The application doesn't properly validate the redirect URI during OAuth, allowing an attacker to intercept the authorization code intended for `nest-manager`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to a user's Nest account, potentially allowing an attacker to control their devices through the application using `nest-manager`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Strictly adhere to the recommended OAuth 2.0 best practices.
            *   Validate redirect URIs to prevent authorization code interception.
            *   Use secure libraries and frameworks for handling OAuth flows.

## Attack Surface: [Storage of Sensitive Nest Device Data](./attack_surfaces/storage_of_sensitive_nest_device_data.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Storage of Sensitive Nest Device Data
    *   **Description:** The application stores sensitive data retrieved from Nest devices (e.g., camera footage, presence data) without proper encryption.
    *   **How `nest-manager` Contributes:** `nest-manager` is the mechanism through which this data is accessed and potentially stored by the application. While the storage is the application's responsibility, `nest-manager`'s role in retrieving this sensitive data makes it a direct contributor to this attack surface.
    *   **Example:**  Storing unencrypted video recordings from a Nest camera obtained via `nest-manager` on the application's server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive personal information, privacy violations, potential for blackmail or other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
            *   Implement proper access controls to stored data.
            *   Consider data retention policies to minimize the storage of sensitive information.
