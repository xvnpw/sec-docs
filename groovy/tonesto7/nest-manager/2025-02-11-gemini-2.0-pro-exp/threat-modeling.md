# Threat Model Analysis for tonesto7/nest-manager

## Threat: [Unauthorized Nest Account Access via Credential Stuffing](./threats/unauthorized_nest_account_access_via_credential_stuffing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses lists of compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from other data breaches) in automated attempts to log in to the `nest-manager` instance.  They target the login endpoint, trying various combinations.
*   **Impact:**  Complete control of the user's Nest devices (thermostat, cameras, etc.), access to sensitive home data, potential for physical harm or privacy invasion.
*   **Component Affected:**  `nest-manager`'s authentication module (specifically, the login handling functions and any API endpoints used for authentication).  This likely involves interaction with the Nest API authentication process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strong password policies:** Enforce minimum password length, complexity, and disallow common passwords.
    *   **Implement account lockout:**  Lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    *   **Implement rate limiting:**  Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address or user within a given time frame.
    *   **Monitor for suspicious login activity:**  Log and analyze login attempts, looking for patterns indicative of credential stuffing.
    *   **Educate users:**  Advise users to use strong, unique passwords and to enable two-factor authentication on their Nest accounts (if supported by Nest and `nest-manager`).
    *   **Consider CAPTCHA or similar challenges:** Implement challenges to differentiate between human users and automated bots.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in `nest-manager` UI](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in__nest-manager__ui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `nest-manager` web interface, typically through an input field that is not properly sanitized.  This code could then be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker could steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the `nest-manager` interface, or potentially gain control of the user's `nest-manager` session (and thus their Nest devices).
*   **Component Affected:**  Any `nest-manager` UI component that displays user-provided data without proper sanitization.  This could include input fields for device names, automation rules, or any other user-configurable settings.  Specifically, the rendering functions and templates used to display these inputs are vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strict input validation:**  Validate all user inputs on the server-side to ensure they conform to expected formats and lengths.
    *   **Implement output encoding:**  Encode all user-provided data before displaying it in the UI.  Use appropriate encoding methods (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to prevent the browser from interpreting the data as code.
    *   **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure a CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load scripts and other resources, limiting the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   **Use a templating engine with built-in XSS protection:**  If `nest-manager` uses a templating engine, choose one that automatically escapes output by default.

## Threat: [Compromised Dependency Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/compromised_dependency_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:**  `nest-manager` relies on a third-party library (e.g., a Node.js module) that contains a known vulnerability allowing for remote code execution.  An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the server running `nest-manager`.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the `nest-manager` instance, potentially affecting *all* users.  The attacker could steal Nest credentials, manipulate devices, install malware, or use the server for other malicious purposes.
*   **Component Affected:**  The vulnerable third-party library itself, and any `nest-manager` code that interacts with it.  This could be any part of the application that uses the compromised library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update dependencies:**  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Dependabot) to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool:**  Employ an SCA tool to scan the codebase and identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Pin dependency versions (with caution):**  Consider pinning dependency versions to specific, known-good releases, but be aware that this can prevent security updates.  A balance between stability and security is needed.
    *   **Monitor security advisories:**  Stay informed about security advisories related to the dependencies used by `nest-manager`.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Device Control](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_device_control.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker manipulates a device ID or other identifier in a request to `nest-manager` to gain access to or control a device that they do not own.  For example, changing a device ID parameter in a URL or API call.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized control of another user's Nest devices, potential for privacy violations or physical harm.
*   **Component Affected:**  The `nest-manager` functions and API endpoints responsible for handling device control requests.  Specifically, any code that uses device IDs or other identifiers to authorize access to devices is vulnerable.  This likely involves interaction with the Nest API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement proper access control checks:**  Before granting access to a device, verify that the currently authenticated user is authorized to access that specific device.  Do not rely solely on user-provided identifiers.
    *   **Use indirect object references:**  Instead of using direct device IDs, use indirect references (e.g., session-based mappings) that are not predictable or guessable by attackers.
    *   **Validate all input parameters:**  Ensure that all input parameters, including device IDs, are validated against the user's session and permissions.

## Threat: [Improper OAuth Token Handling Leading to Account Takeover](./threats/improper_oauth_token_handling_leading_to_account_takeover.md)

*   **Description:** `nest-manager` mishandles OAuth tokens received from the Nest API. This could involve storing tokens insecurely (e.g., in plain text, in logs, or in client-side storage), not validating token signatures, or failing to properly revoke tokens when a user logs out.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who obtains a valid OAuth token can gain full access to the user's Nest account, even if the user changes their Nest password.
*   **Component Affected:** The `nest-manager` components responsible for handling OAuth authentication with the Nest API. This includes functions for requesting tokens, storing tokens, refreshing tokens, and revoking tokens.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Store OAuth tokens securely:** Use a secure storage mechanism, such as encrypted storage or a dedicated secrets management solution. Never store tokens in client-side storage (e.g., cookies or local storage) without strong encryption.
    *   **Validate token signatures:** Verify the signature of OAuth tokens to ensure they have not been tampered with.
    *   **Implement proper token revocation:** Ensure that tokens are properly revoked when a user logs out or when their session expires.
    *   **Use short-lived access tokens:** Configure `nest-manager` to use short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens to minimize the window of opportunity for an attacker.
    *   **Follow OAuth 2.0 best practices:** Adhere to the OAuth 2.0 specification and best practices for secure token handling.
