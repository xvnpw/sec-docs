# Attack Surface Analysis for tonesto7/nest-manager

## Attack Surface: [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](./attack_surfaces/oauth_2_0_authorization_code_flow.md)

*   **1. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow:**

    *   **Description:**  The process of obtaining authorization from the user to access their Nest account via Google's OAuth 2.0.  This is *entirely* within `nest-manager`'s control.
    *   **`nest-manager` Contribution:**  `nest-manager` initiates, manages, and is responsible for the security of the entire OAuth 2.0 flow, including redirect URI handling, client secret protection, and authorization code exchange.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker intercepts the authorization code due to a vulnerability in `nest-manager`'s handling of the redirect URI (e.g., insufficient validation).
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control of the user's Nest devices (thermostat, cameras, locks, etc.), leading to potential physical intrusion, privacy violation, or property damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)**  Rigorously validate the `redirect_uri` against a hardcoded, *absolute* whitelist.  Reject any request with a `redirect_uri` that doesn't *exactly* match the expected value.
        *   **(Developer)**  Securely store the client secret using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution.  *Never* include the secret in the source code or configuration files that might be exposed.
        *   **(Developer)**  Implement robust error handling and logging around the OAuth 2.0 flow, but *absolutely never* log sensitive data like tokens or the client secret.  Log only enough information to diagnose issues without compromising security.

## Attack Surface: [Access/Refresh Token Storage and Handling](./attack_surfaces/accessrefresh_token_storage_and_handling.md)

*   **2. Access/Refresh Token Storage and Handling:**

    *   **Description:**  The secure storage and management of the access and refresh tokens obtained from the Nest API.  `nest-manager` is fully responsible for this.
    *   **`nest-manager` Contribution:**  `nest-manager` receives, stores, and uses these tokens for all API interactions.  Its security practices directly determine the risk.
    *   **Example:**  `nest-manager` stores tokens in an unencrypted file, and an attacker with local access to the server (or through a separate vulnerability) retrieves them.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the user's Nest devices, with the same consequences as an OAuth 2.0 compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)**  Encrypt tokens at rest using a strong, industry-standard encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256).  Securely manage the encryption key, *separately* from the encrypted tokens.
        *   **(Developer)**  Store tokens in a secure location designed for secrets management.  Avoid plain text files, easily accessible databases, or configuration files.  Consider using a dedicated secrets vault.
        *   **(Developer)**  Implement a token revocation mechanism.  Provide a way for users to revoke tokens (e.g., through a web interface or command-line tool), and automatically revoke tokens upon detecting suspicious activity or after a defined period of inactivity.
        *   **(Developer)** Ensure that token expiration is handled correctly. The application should gracefully handle expired tokens and attempt to refresh them securely, without exposing the user to errors or security risks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **3. Vulnerable Dependencies:**

    *   **Description:**  Third-party libraries (Node.js packages) used by `nest-manager` that contain known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **`nest-manager` Contribution:** `nest-manager`'s choice of dependencies and its update practices directly determine its exposure to this risk.
    *   **Example:** A library used by `nest-manager` for making HTTP requests has a known remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from denial of service to complete server compromise and subsequent access to Nest devices.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)**  Regularly use dependency analysis tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `snyk`, Dependabot) to *automatically* identify and update vulnerable packages.  Integrate these tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **(Developer)**  Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies and their versions.
        *   **(Developer)**  Carefully evaluate the security posture of *any* new dependency *before* adding it to the project.  Consider the library's popularity, maintenance activity, and known security history.
        *   **(Developer)**: Consider using a dependency vulnerability scanner that integrates with your source code repository and provides alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Data Validation and Sanitization (from Nest API)](./attack_surfaces/data_validation_and_sanitization__from_nest_api_.md)

*   **4. Data Validation and Sanitization (from Nest API):**

    *   **Description:** Ensuring that data received from the Nest API is properly validated and sanitized to prevent injection or other data-related vulnerabilities. While the Nest API is *generally* trusted, `nest-manager` should still practice defensive programming.
    *   **`nest-manager` Contribution:** `nest-manager` is responsible for parsing and processing all data received from the Nest API.
    *   **Example:** Although unlikely, a compromised Nest API (or a sophisticated man-in-the-middle attack) could send malformed data that exploits a vulnerability in `nest-manager`'s parsing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially code execution, denial of service, or data corruption within `nest-manager`. The likelihood is lower than with user-supplied input, but the impact could still be significant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)** Validate the *structure* and *data types* of all data received from the Nest API. Use schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema) if possible.
        *   **(Developer)** Use well-established and actively maintained libraries for parsing data from the Nest API, rather than writing custom parsing code.
        *   **(Developer)** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected or malformed data from the API, without crashing or exposing sensitive information.
