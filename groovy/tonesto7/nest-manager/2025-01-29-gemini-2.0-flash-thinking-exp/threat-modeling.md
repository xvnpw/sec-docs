# Threat Model Analysis for tonesto7/nest-manager

## Threat: [Exposure of Nest API Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_nest_api_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to files, environment variables, or logs where `nest-manager` stores Nest API credentials (like OAuth tokens). This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application hosting `nest-manager`, insecure server configuration, or social engineering to access the system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized control of Nest devices, privacy breaches through access to historical data, potential physical security risks by disabling security systems, or manipulating home environment settings.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration storage mechanisms within the application using `nest-manager`, potentially logging modules, and any part of the application code handling Nest API credentials.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store Nest API credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest if stored in files or databases.
    *   Implement strict file system permissions to limit access to configuration files.
    *   Avoid logging sensitive credentials in application logs.
    *   Regularly rotate API credentials if the Nest API allows and `nest-manager` supports it.

## Threat: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities in nest-manager](./threats/code_injection_vulnerabilities_in_nest-manager.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit code injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, code injection) present in the `nest-manager` code itself. This could be achieved by providing malicious input to the application that is processed by `nest-manager` or by exploiting programming flaws within `nest-manager`.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise of the server or device running `nest-manager`, allowing attackers to gain complete control. This can lead to data breaches, denial of service, and further attacks on connected systems and the local network.
*   **Affected Component:** Input handling and processing logic within the `nest-manager` code, specifically modules that process external data or user inputs.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and audit the `nest-manager` code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Validate and sanitize all external inputs before processing them within `nest-manager`.
    *   If possible, use a sandboxed environment or containerization to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly update `nest-manager` to the latest version, ensuring security patches are applied.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities leading to Code Execution](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies used by `nest-manager`. If `nest-manager` relies on outdated or vulnerable dependencies, attackers can leverage publicly known exploits to execute arbitrary code in the context of `nest-manager`.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, denial of service, similar to code injection vulnerabilities within `nest-manager` itself. The attacker gains control over the system running `nest-manager`.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-party libraries and dependencies used by `nest-manager`. Vulnerable components could be anywhere within the dependency tree.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all dependencies used by `nest-manager`.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process to promptly address and patch identified vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a software composition analysis (SCA) tool for continuous monitoring of dependency vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Running nest-manager with Excessive Privileges](./threats/running_nest-manager_with_excessive_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** If `nest-manager` is configured to run with excessive privileges (e.g., as root or administrator), an attacker who successfully exploits any vulnerability within `nest-manager` (like code injection or dependency vulnerability) will inherit these elevated privileges.
*   **Impact:** Significantly increased severity of security breaches. Exploitation can lead to system-wide compromise, privilege escalation, and the ability for the attacker to perform almost any action on the system, including installing malware, accessing sensitive data beyond Nest data, and pivoting to other systems on the network.
*   **Affected Component:** System deployment and process execution environment configuration for `nest-manager`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege.
    *   Run `nest-manager` with the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation. Create a dedicated user account with restricted permissions specifically for running `nest-manager`.
    *   Utilize containerization technologies (like Docker) or virtualization to isolate `nest-manager` and limit the potential impact of a compromise. Configure containers/virtual machines with minimal privileges.
    *   Regularly audit the privileges assigned to the process running `nest-manager` to ensure they remain minimal and appropriate.
