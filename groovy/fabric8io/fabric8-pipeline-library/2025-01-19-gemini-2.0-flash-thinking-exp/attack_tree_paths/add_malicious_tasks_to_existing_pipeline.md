### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Add Malicious Tasks to Existing Pipeline

**Attack Description:** Attackers insert new tasks into the pipeline that perform malicious actions, such as deploying backdoors, exfiltrating data, or disrupting services.

**Understanding the Attack:** This attack path relies on the attacker's ability to modify the pipeline definition or configuration in a way that introduces new, unauthorized tasks. These tasks are then executed as part of the normal pipeline workflow, leveraging the permissions and access granted to the pipeline execution environment.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

* **Compromised Source Code Repository:**
    * **Direct Code Modification:** Attackers gain access to the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and directly modify the pipeline definition files (e.g., Jenkinsfile, Tekton PipelineRun). This could be achieved through compromised developer credentials, stolen access tokens, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the repository platform.
    * **Malicious Pull Requests:** Attackers submit pull requests containing malicious task definitions. If code review processes are weak or compromised, these changes could be merged into the main branch.
* **Compromised CI/CD System:**
    * **Direct Access to CI/CD Configuration:** Attackers gain access to the CI/CD system's (e.g., Jenkins, Tekton) configuration interface or underlying storage. This allows them to directly modify pipeline definitions or create new pipelines with malicious tasks.
    * **Exploiting CI/CD Vulnerabilities:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the CI/CD system to gain unauthorized access and modify pipeline configurations.
    * **Compromised CI/CD Credentials:** Attackers obtain valid credentials for the CI/CD system, allowing them to authenticate and make changes to pipelines.
* **Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to the source code repository or CI/CD system intentionally adds malicious tasks to the pipeline.
* **Supply Chain Attack:**
    * **Compromised Dependencies:** Attackers compromise a dependency used by the pipeline definition or a plugin used by the CI/CD system, injecting malicious code that modifies pipeline behavior.
    * **Compromised Base Images:** If the pipeline uses container images, attackers could compromise a base image used in the pipeline, adding malicious scripts or tools that are executed during pipeline runs.
* **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Lack of proper access controls on pipeline definition files or the CI/CD system allows unauthorized users to modify pipeline configurations.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Deployment of Backdoors:** Malicious tasks could deploy backdoors into production or staging environments, granting attackers persistent access.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Tasks could be added to steal sensitive data, such as application secrets, database credentials, or customer information, and transmit it to attacker-controlled servers.
* **Service Disruption:** Malicious tasks could intentionally disrupt services by deleting resources, modifying configurations, or introducing faulty code.
* **Supply Chain Contamination:** If the pipeline builds and publishes artifacts (e.g., container images, libraries), malicious tasks could inject malware into these artifacts, affecting downstream users.
* **Credential Theft:** Tasks could be designed to steal credentials used by the pipeline itself, such as cloud provider keys or API tokens, allowing attackers to further compromise the infrastructure.
* **Resource Hijacking:** Malicious tasks could utilize the pipeline's resources (compute, network) for cryptomining or other malicious activities.
* **Tampering with Audit Logs:** Attackers might add tasks to delete or modify audit logs to cover their tracks.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strong Access Controls:**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular RBAC on the source code repository and CI/CD system, limiting who can view, modify, and execute pipelines.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all accounts with access to the source code repository and CI/CD system.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and service accounts only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
* **Secure Code Repository Practices:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to pipeline definition files.
    * **Branch Protection:** Utilize branch protection rules to prevent direct commits to critical branches and require pull requests.
    * **Commit Signing:** Enforce commit signing to verify the identity of the committer.
* **CI/CD Security Hardening:**
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the CI/CD system and its configurations.
    * **Keep CI/CD Software Up-to-Date:** Apply security patches and updates to the CI/CD system and its plugins promptly.
    * **Secure Secrets Management:** Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in pipeline definitions. Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and integrate them securely with the pipeline.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to pipeline tasks to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Restrict Network Access:** Limit the network access of the CI/CD system and pipeline execution environments.
* **Pipeline as Code Security:**
    * **Static Analysis of Pipeline Definitions:** Use static analysis tools to scan pipeline definition files for potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Where possible, treat pipeline definitions as immutable infrastructure, requiring changes to go through a controlled process.
    * **Pipeline Templates:** Utilize parameterized pipeline templates to enforce consistency and reduce the risk of ad-hoc modifications.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * **Pipeline Execution Monitoring:** Monitor pipeline execution logs for unusual activity or unexpected tasks.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate CI/CD system logs with a SIEM solution to detect suspicious events.
    * **Alerting on Pipeline Changes:** Implement alerts for any modifications to pipeline definitions or configurations.
* **Supply Chain Security:**
    * **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan pipeline dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain SBOMs for all software components used in the pipeline.
    * **Secure Base Images:** Use hardened and regularly scanned base images for containerized pipeline tasks.
* **Insider Threat Mitigation:**
    * **Background Checks:** Conduct thorough background checks for employees with access to sensitive systems.
    * **Security Awareness Training:** Provide regular security awareness training to developers and operations teams, emphasizing the risks of insider threats.
    * **Separation of Duties:** Implement separation of duties for critical tasks related to pipeline management.
