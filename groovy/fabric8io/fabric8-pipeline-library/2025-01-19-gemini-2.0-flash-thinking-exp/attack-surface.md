# Attack Surface Analysis for fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library

## Attack Surface: [Pipeline Definition Injection](./attack_surfaces/pipeline_definition_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into pipeline definitions, leading to arbitrary code execution during pipeline runs.
    * **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** If the library's design allows for dynamic generation or external influence on pipeline definitions (e.g., through parameters or Git repository content that the library processes), it creates an entry point for injection. The library's execution engine then interprets and runs this injected code.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor modifies a pull request to include a crafted `Jenkinsfile` that executes a reverse shell command on the CI/CD agent when the pipeline, processed by `fabric8-pipeline-library`, runs.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the CI/CD environment, potential compromise of deployment targets, data exfiltration, supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Parameterize Pipeline Definitions:** Avoid directly embedding user-provided input into pipeline steps that the library executes. Use parameterized builds and sanitize input before it's processed by the library.
        * **Static Analysis of Pipeline Definitions:** Implement tools to scan pipeline definitions for suspicious code patterns before the `fabric8-pipeline-library` attempts to execute them.
        * **Restrict Pipeline Definition Sources:** Limit who can modify pipeline definitions and where they are sourced from, controlling the input to the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
        * **Code Review for Pipeline Changes:** Implement mandatory code reviews for any changes to pipeline definitions that will be interpreted by the library.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secret Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secret_management.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, certificates) used within pipelines are stored insecurely, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** If the library provides mechanisms for handling secrets, and these mechanisms are not used correctly or are inherently insecure within the library's design (e.g., storing secrets in plain text within pipeline files that the library parses, or in environment variables without proper masking that the library accesses), it directly contributes to the risk.
    * **Example:** An API key for a cloud provider is stored as a plain text environment variable within a pipeline definition that is processed by `fabric8-pipeline-library`, allowing anyone with access to the pipeline definition to retrieve it.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, ability to deploy malicious code to production environments.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Utilize Dedicated Secret Management Tools:** Integrate with secure secret management solutions and ensure the `fabric8-pipeline-library` is configured to retrieve secrets dynamically from these sources rather than relying on insecure storage.
        * **Avoid Storing Secrets in Pipeline Definitions:** Never hardcode secrets directly in `Jenkinsfile` or other pipeline configuration files that the library processes.
        * **Mask Secrets in Logs and UI:** Ensure the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and the CI/CD platform properly mask secrets in logs and user interfaces.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s dependencies can be exploited to compromise the CI/CD environment.
    * **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library inherently introduces a set of dependencies. If these dependencies are not regularly updated or scanned for vulnerabilities by the library developers or users, it directly increases the attack surface.
    * **Example:** A known security vulnerability exists in a specific version of a logging library used by `fabric8-pipeline-library`, allowing for remote code execution on the CI/CD agent when a pipeline using the library is executed.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the CI/CD environment, potential for lateral movement to other systems, supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions. This responsibility falls on both the library developers and the users integrating the library.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Integration with External Systems](./attack_surfaces/insecure_integration_with_external_systems.md)

* **Description:** Weak or misconfigured integrations with external systems (Git repositories, container registries, cloud providers) can be exploited.
    * **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library provides functionalities to interact with these external systems. If the library's configuration options or default settings encourage insecure practices (e.g., using default credentials, insecure protocols) or if the library doesn't enforce secure configurations, it contributes to the risk.
    * **Example:** The pipeline, orchestrated by `fabric8-pipeline-library`, uses hardcoded, weak credentials to push images to a private container registry, allowing an attacker who gains access to the pipeline definition to also access the registry.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external resources, code tampering, deployment of malicious artifacts, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure the `fabric8-pipeline-library` is configured to use strong, unique credentials and enforce proper authorization mechanisms for all external integrations.
        * **Secure Communication Protocols:** Configure the `fabric8-pipeline-library` to utilize secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH) for communication with external systems.

## Attack Surface: [Pipeline Execution Control Issues](./attack_surfaces/pipeline_execution_control_issues.md)

* **Description:** Lack of proper authorization or control over pipeline execution allows unauthorized manipulation of the CI/CD process.
    * **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** If the library allows external triggers or modifications to running pipelines without sufficient authorization checks within its design or configuration options, it creates a vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker can trigger a pipeline execution, managed by `fabric8-pipeline-library`, with modified parameters to deploy a malicious version of the application due to insufficient access controls on pipeline triggers exposed by the library.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, deployment of malicious code, disruption of the development workflow.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for Pipeline Triggers:** Ensure only authorized users or systems can trigger pipeline executions managed by the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
        * **Restrict Access to Pipeline Configuration:** Limit who can modify pipeline configurations and triggers that the library utilizes.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Pipeline Steps and Plugins](./attack_surfaces/custom_pipeline_steps_and_plugins.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom pipeline steps or plugins integrated with the library introduce new attack vectors.
    * **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library provides a framework for extending its functionality with custom steps or plugins. If the library doesn't provide sufficient security guidance or mechanisms for securing these extensions, or if the library's API for custom components is inherently insecure, it contributes to the risk.
    * **Example:** A custom pipeline step, integrated with `fabric8-pipeline-library`, executes arbitrary shell commands based on user input without proper sanitization, allowing for command injection.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, compromise of the CI/CD environment, potential compromise of deployment targets.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Development Practices for Custom Components:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom pipeline steps or plugins for `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
        * **Code Review for Custom Components:** Implement mandatory security code reviews for all custom components integrated with the library.
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization in Custom Components:** Ensure all external input is properly validated and sanitized within custom components interacting with the library's framework.
