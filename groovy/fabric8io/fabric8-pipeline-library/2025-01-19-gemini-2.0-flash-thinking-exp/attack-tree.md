## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using fabric8-pipeline-library](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_fabric8-pipeline-library.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within the library's ecosystem to compromise the target application. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, disrupting services, or gaining control over the application and its environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Pipeline Execution](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_pipeline_execution.md)

This critical node represents a significant category of high-risk attacks. If an attacker can inject malicious code into the pipeline execution, they can gain arbitrary code execution within the pipeline environment. This can lead to:
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data processed by the pipeline.
    * **Infrastructure Compromise:** Using the pipeline's access to compromise underlying infrastructure.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Injecting malicious code into the application build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Pipeline Definition Processing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_pipeline_definition_processing.md)

This node is critical because the pipeline definition (likely YAML or Groovy) is the blueprint for the pipeline's execution. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to manipulate this blueprint to inject malicious commands or logic.
    * **Inject Malicious YAML/Groovy in Pipeline Definition:** Attackers can craft malicious YAML or Groovy code within the pipeline definition that, when parsed and executed by the library, performs unintended and harmful actions. This could involve executing arbitrary commands on the pipeline runner, accessing sensitive resources, or modifying the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious YAML/Groovy in Pipeline Definition](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_yamlgroovy_in_pipeline_definition.md)

Attackers can craft malicious YAML or Groovy code within the pipeline definition that, when parsed and executed by the library, performs unintended and harmful actions. This could involve executing arbitrary commands on the pipeline runner, accessing sensitive resources, or modifying the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Source Code Repository Used by Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_source_code_repository_used_by_pipeline.md)

This is a critical control point. If the attacker can compromise the source code repository that the pipeline uses to build and deploy the application, they can inject malicious code directly into the application codebase.
    * **Inject Malicious Code into Application Repository:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the application's source code repository and insert malicious code. This code will then be included in subsequent builds and deployments by the pipeline, directly compromising the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Application Repository](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_application_repository.md)

Attackers gain unauthorized access to the application's source code repository and insert malicious code. This code will then be included in subsequent builds and deployments by the pipeline, directly compromising the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Pipeline Configuration for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_pipeline_configuration_for_malicious_purposes.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's ability to alter the pipeline's intended behavior. By gaining unauthorized access and modifying the pipeline configuration, attackers can introduce malicious steps or change existing ones to achieve their goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Pipeline Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_pipeline_configuration.md)

This is a critical prerequisite for manipulating the pipeline. Without authorized access, attackers cannot modify the pipeline's definition or settings.
    * **Exploit RBAC/Authorization Weaknesses in Pipeline Management:** Attackers exploit flaws in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or other authorization mechanisms governing access to pipeline configurations. This allows them to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access.
    * **Compromise Credentials with Pipeline Management Permissions:** Attackers obtain the valid credentials (usernames and passwords, API keys, etc.) of users or service accounts that have permissions to manage pipeline configurations. This is a common and effective way to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RBAC/Authorization Weaknesses in Pipeline Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rbacauthorization_weaknesses_in_pipeline_management.md)

Attackers exploit flaws in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or other authorization mechanisms governing access to pipeline configurations. This allows them to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Credentials with Pipeline Management Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_credentials_with_pipeline_management_permissions.md)

Attackers obtain the valid credentials (usernames and passwords, API keys, etc.) of users or service accounts that have permissions to manage pipeline configurations. This is a common and effective way to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Pipeline Step Implementations](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_pipeline_step_implementations.md)

If individual steps within the pipeline are vulnerable or configured insecurely, attackers can exploit these weaknesses.
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Pipeline Steps:** Custom-developed pipeline steps might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, path traversal) that attackers can exploit to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive resources within the pipeline environment.
    * **Abuse Default Pipeline Steps with Insecure Configurations:** Even standard pipeline steps can be misused if they are configured insecurely. For example, a deployment step might be configured to use insecure credentials or deploy to an unintended location.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Pipeline Steps](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_pipeline_steps.md)

Custom-developed pipeline steps might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, path traversal) that attackers can exploit to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive resources within the pipeline environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Default Pipeline Steps with Insecure Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_default_pipeline_steps_with_insecure_configurations.md)

Even standard pipeline steps can be misused if they are configured insecurely. For example, a deployment step might be configured to use insecure credentials or deploy to an unintended location.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Pipeline to Introduce Malicious Steps](./attack_tree_paths/modify_pipeline_to_introduce_malicious_steps.md)

Once unauthorized access to the pipeline configuration is gained, attackers can modify the pipeline to include malicious steps.
    * **Add Malicious Tasks to Existing Pipeline:** Attackers insert new tasks into the pipeline that perform malicious actions, such as deploying backdoors, exfiltrating data, or disrupting services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Add Malicious Tasks to Existing Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/add_malicious_tasks_to_existing_pipeline.md)

Attackers insert new tasks into the pipeline that perform malicious actions, such as deploying backdoors, exfiltrating data, or disrupting services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Secrets Management Weaknesses in Pipelines](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_secrets_management_weaknesses_in_pipelines.md)

Pipelines often handle sensitive information like API keys and credentials. Weaknesses in how these secrets are managed can be exploited.
    * **Retrieve Secrets from Plaintext Configuration:**  Secrets are stored directly in plaintext within pipeline configuration files, making them easily accessible to anyone who can view the configuration.
    * **Access Secrets from Pipeline Execution Environment:** Secrets are exposed within the pipeline's execution environment (e.g., as environment variables or in mounted volumes) in a way that allows unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Secrets from Plaintext Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_secrets_from_plaintext_configuration.md)

Secrets are stored directly in plaintext within pipeline configuration files, making them easily accessible to anyone who can view the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Secrets from Pipeline Execution Environment](./attack_tree_paths/access_secrets_from_pipeline_execution_environment.md)

Secrets are exposed within the pipeline's execution environment (e.g., as environment variables or in mounted volumes) in a way that allows unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Pipeline Execution Environment for Lateral Movement](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_pipeline_execution_environment_for_lateral_movement.md)

The environment where pipelines execute can be a stepping stone to access other parts of the infrastructure.
    * **Access Sensitive Resources within the Kubernetes Cluster:** Attackers leverage the pipeline's service account or other credentials to access sensitive resources within the Kubernetes cluster that the pipeline should not have access to.
    * **Abuse Service Accounts or API Keys Used by Pipelines:** Attackers gain access to the service accounts or API keys used by the pipeline and then abuse these credentials to access other systems or services, potentially outside the immediate pipeline environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Resources within the Kubernetes Cluster](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_resources_within_the_kubernetes_cluster.md)

Attackers leverage the pipeline's service account or other credentials to access sensitive resources within the Kubernetes cluster that the pipeline should not have access to.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Service Accounts or API Keys Used by Pipelines](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_service_accounts_or_api_keys_used_by_pipelines.md)

Attackers gain access to the service accounts or API keys used by the pipeline and then abuse these credentials to access other systems or services, potentially outside the immediate pipeline environment.
