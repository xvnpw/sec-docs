# Threat Model Analysis for fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library

## Threat: [Malicious Pipeline Definitions Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_pipeline_definitions_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code or commands into pipeline definitions. When the `fabric8-pipeline-library` parses and executes these compromised pipeline definitions, the injected code will be executed on the pipeline execution environment. This directly leverages the library's core functionality of interpreting and running pipeline definitions.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the pipeline execution environment, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to connected systems, deployment of malicious artifacts, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Pipeline Definition Parsing and Execution Engine (core functionality of the library).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all pipeline definition inputs.
* Enforce strict access controls and authentication for modifying pipeline definitions.
* Implement a code review process for all pipeline changes.
* Utilize parameterized pipeline definitions to limit the scope of user-provided input and prevent direct command injection.
* Employ secure coding practices when developing custom pipeline steps or tasks that are executed by the library.
* Consider using a sandboxed or containerized environment for pipeline execution to limit the impact of compromised pipelines.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets and Credentials Through Pipeline Definitions or Logs](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_and_credentials_through_pipeline_definitions_or_logs.md)

**Description:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or other credentials if these are inadvertently included in pipeline definitions that are processed by the `fabric8-pipeline-library` or are logged during pipeline execution by the library. The library's handling of pipeline definitions and its logging mechanisms are directly involved in this threat.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services or systems, data breaches, privilege escalation within the application or connected infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Pipeline Definition Parsing, Logging Mechanism (both are part of the `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s operation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in pipeline definitions.
* Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and integrate them with the pipeline library to retrieve secrets at runtime.
* Implement mechanisms to mask or redact sensitive information in pipeline logs generated by the library.
* Regularly audit pipeline definitions for exposed secrets.
* Educate developers on secure secret management practices relevant to pipeline definitions.

## Threat: [Exploiting Dependency Vulnerabilities within the Library](./threats/exploiting_dependency_vulnerabilities_within_the_library.md)

**Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library` relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies if the library is not regularly updated or if vulnerable versions are used. This directly impacts the security of the `fabric8-pipeline-library` itself.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure within the pipeline execution environment or the application itself.

**Affected Component:** Dependency Management (implicitly affects the entire library).

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `fabric8-pipeline-library` to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its dependencies.
* Implement dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies.
* Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and their versions.
* Have a process for promptly addressing reported vulnerabilities in the `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s dependencies.
