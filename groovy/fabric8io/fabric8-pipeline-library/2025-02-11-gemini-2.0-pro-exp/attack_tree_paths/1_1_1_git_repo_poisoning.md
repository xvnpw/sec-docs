## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1: Git Repo Poisoning

### 4.1. Attack Scenarios

Given the use of `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library`, several specific attack scenarios become more relevant:

*   **Scenario 1: Malicious Jenkinsfile Modification:**  The attacker gains write access to the repository (e.g., through compromised developer credentials, a misconfigured repository, or a supply chain attack on a developer's machine) and modifies the `Jenkinsfile` (or equivalent pipeline definition file used by the library).  This modification could:
    *   Introduce malicious build steps that execute arbitrary code on the build server.
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive data (environment variables, secrets) during the build process.
    *   Deploy a compromised version of the application.
    *   Alter the pipeline to bypass security checks (e.g., disable code scanning or vulnerability analysis).
    *   Use the build server as a launchpad for further attacks within the network.

*   **Scenario 2:  Compromised Dependencies (Indirect Poisoning):** The attacker targets a dependency *used by* the application or *used within the pipeline itself*.  This is a supply chain attack.  The `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library` likely uses various tools and libraries.  If the attacker compromises one of *those*, they can inject malicious code that gets executed during the pipeline run.  Examples:
    *   A compromised Docker image used as a build environment.
    *   A malicious plugin or extension for Jenkins or another CI/CD tool.
    *   A poisoned library pulled in via a package manager (npm, Maven, pip, etc.) during the build.

*   **Scenario 3:  Branch Manipulation:** The attacker, with write access, creates a malicious branch (e.g., `feature/malicious-code`) that appears legitimate.  They then:
    *   Submit a pull request (PR) that subtly introduces malicious code, hoping it bypasses code review.
    *   Directly merge the malicious branch into a protected branch (e.g., `main`, `release`) if branch protection rules are weak or bypassed.
    *   Manipulate the pipeline configuration to build from the malicious branch instead of the intended branch.

*   **Scenario 4:  Tag Manipulation:** The attacker creates a malicious tag that points to a compromised commit.  If the pipeline is configured to build based on tags (e.g., for releases), this could trigger the deployment of a malicious version.

*   **Scenario 5: History Rewriting (Force Push):**  An attacker with sufficient privileges (and potentially after disabling branch protection) uses `git push --force` to rewrite the repository's history, removing evidence of their malicious changes or replacing legitimate commits with compromised ones. This makes detection much harder.

### 4.2. Vulnerabilities in the Context of `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library`

The `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library` itself, being a collection of pipeline steps, introduces specific attack surfaces:

*   **Implicit Trust in Repository Contents:** The library, by its nature, executes code and scripts defined within the repository.  This creates an inherent trust relationship.  If the repository is poisoned, the library will unknowingly execute malicious code.
*   **Dynamic Script Loading:**  The library likely loads and executes scripts (Groovy, shell, etc.) from the repository.  This dynamic loading is a prime target for attackers.
*   **Secret Handling:**  The library may handle secrets (API keys, credentials) required for the build and deployment process.  If the repository is compromised, these secrets could be exposed or misused.  The *way* the library handles secrets is crucial.
*   **Dependency Management:** The library itself has dependencies, and the pipeline it defines will likely pull in further dependencies.  Vulnerabilities in any of these dependencies can be exploited.
*   **Lack of Code Signing/Verification:** If the library doesn't verify the integrity of the code it's executing from the repository (e.g., through code signing or checksums), it's highly vulnerable to poisoning.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for protecting against Git Repo Poisoning, specifically in the context of using the `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library`:

**4.3.1. Repository Access Control (Preventative):**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant developers *only* the minimum necessary permissions to the Git repository.  Avoid granting broad write access.  Use role-based access control (RBAC).
*   **Strong Authentication:**  Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all repository access.  Use SSH keys instead of passwords where possible.
*   **Branch Protection Rules:**  Implement strict branch protection rules on critical branches (e.g., `main`, `release`):
    *   Require pull requests for all changes.
    *   Require code reviews from multiple approvers.
    *   Require status checks to pass (e.g., successful builds, tests, security scans) before merging.
    *   Prevent force pushes.
    *   Restrict who can merge to protected branches.
*   **Repository Mirroring (Read-Only):** Consider using a read-only mirror of the repository for the CI/CD pipeline.  This prevents the pipeline from accidentally (or maliciously) modifying the primary repository.
*  **Signed Commits:** Enforce commit signing using GPG or SSH. This ensures that commits can be traced back to a specific, trusted identity.

**4.3.2. Pipeline Security (Preventative & Detective):**

*   **Immutable Build Environments:**  Use immutable, well-defined build environments (e.g., Docker containers) from trusted sources.  Avoid building directly on the host operating system.  Regularly update and scan these base images for vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:**  Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check, Trivy) into the pipeline to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   **Static Code Analysis (SAST):**  Incorporate SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify) to scan the application code *and* the pipeline configuration files (e.g., `Jenkinsfile`) for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** If applicable, include DAST scans in the pipeline to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
*   **Secret Management:**  Use a dedicated secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage sensitive data.  *Never* store secrets directly in the Git repository.  Ensure the `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library` is configured to retrieve secrets securely from the secret manager.
*   **Pipeline-as-Code Review:**  Treat the `Jenkinsfile` (and any other pipeline configuration files) as critical code.  Subject it to the same rigorous code review process as the application code.
*   **Least Privilege for Pipeline:** The CI/CD pipeline itself should run with the least privilege necessary. Avoid granting it excessive permissions to the underlying infrastructure or other systems.
* **Audit Logging:** Enable comprehensive audit logging for all Git operations (pushes, merges, branch creation, etc.) and pipeline executions.  Monitor these logs for suspicious activity.

**4.3.3. Detection and Response (Detective & Reactive):**

*   **Git Monitoring Tools:**  Use Git monitoring tools (e.g., GitGuardian, GitHub Advanced Security) to detect leaked secrets, suspicious commits, and other potential security issues in the repository.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic and system activity for signs of compromise.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate security logs from various sources (Git, CI/CD, infrastructure) into a SIEM for centralized monitoring and analysis.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to handle Git Repo Poisoning incidents effectively.  This plan should include steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the entire CI/CD pipeline, including the Git repository, build environment, and deployment process.

**4.3.4 Specific recommendations related to fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library:**

*   **Review Library Usage:** Carefully review how the `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library` is used in your pipeline.  Identify any custom scripts or configurations that could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep the `fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library` and all its dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.
*   **Contribute to Security:** If you identify any security vulnerabilities in the library, report them responsibly to the maintainers.
