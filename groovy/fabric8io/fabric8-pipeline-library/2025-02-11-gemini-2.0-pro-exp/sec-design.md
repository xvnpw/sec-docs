Okay, let's create a design document for the Fabric8 Pipeline Library.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Enable Continuous Delivery (CD) for applications deployed on Kubernetes and OpenShift.
*   Provide reusable, configurable, and extensible pipeline components for Jenkins.
*   Simplify and standardize the process of building, testing, and deploying applications.
*   Promote best practices for DevOps and cloud-native development.
*   Reduce the time and effort required to create and maintain CI/CD pipelines.
*   Improve the overall efficiency and reliability of the software delivery process.
*   Support a wide range of application types and deployment scenarios.

Business Risks:

*   Unauthorized access to Jenkins and the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, potentially leading to malicious deployments or data breaches.
*   Vulnerabilities in the pipeline library itself or its dependencies, which could be exploited to compromise the build and deployment process.
*   Incorrectly configured pipelines, leading to deployment failures, security vulnerabilities, or data loss.
*   Lack of visibility and auditability of pipeline executions, making it difficult to track changes and identify the root cause of issues.
*   Supply chain attacks targeting the library or its dependencies.
*   Inability to scale the pipeline infrastructure to meet the demands of large or complex projects.
*   Incompatibility with future versions of Jenkins, Kubernetes, or OpenShift.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The library leverages Jenkins' built-in security features, including authentication and authorization mechanisms. (Described in Jenkins documentation and configuration).
*   security control: The library interacts with Kubernetes/OpenShift through their respective APIs, relying on the security controls provided by these platforms (e.g., RBAC, network policies). (Described in Kubernetes/OpenShift documentation).
*   security control: The library promotes the use of secure coding practices through its examples and documentation. (Described in the repository's README and examples).
*   security control: The library uses declarative pipelines, which are more secure by design than scripted pipelines.
*   security control: The library is open source, allowing for community review and contributions to improve security.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library relies on the security of the underlying Jenkins, Kubernetes, and OpenShift infrastructure. Any vulnerabilities in these platforms could impact the security of the pipelines.
*   accepted risk: The library's functionality can be extended through custom scripts and plugins, which may introduce security risks if not carefully reviewed and tested.
*   accepted risk: The library depends on external tools and libraries, which may have their own vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement static code analysis (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) within the pipelines to identify vulnerabilities in the applications being deployed.
*   security control: Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to scan for known vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies and the application's dependencies.
*   security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of pipeline executions to detect and respond to security incidents.
*   security control: Enforce the principle of least privilege for all users and service accounts involved in the pipeline.
*   security control: Regularly review and update the library and its dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement a secrets management solution to securely store and manage sensitive information used in the pipelines (e.g., API keys, passwords).
*   security control: Sign the released artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users and systems interacting with the pipeline must be authenticated.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) is highly recommended.
    *   Integration with existing identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth) should be supported.

*   Authorization:
    *   Access to pipeline resources and functionality must be controlled through role-based access control (RBAC).
    *   The principle of least privilege must be enforced.
    *   Fine-grained access control should be supported to restrict access to specific stages, environments, or resources within the pipeline.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All inputs to the pipeline, including user inputs, parameters, and external data, must be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Input validation should be performed at multiple levels, including the Jenkins UI, the pipeline scripts, and the underlying tools.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, and certificates, must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    *   Strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols must be used.
    *   Key management practices must be secure and follow industry best practices.
