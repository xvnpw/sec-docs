# Attack Surface Analysis for fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library

## Attack Surface: [1. Code Injection in Pipeline Scripts (Groovy)](./attack_surfaces/1__code_injection_in_pipeline_scripts__groovy_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious Groovy code into the pipeline definition, exploiting the library's reliance on Groovy scripting for core functionality.
*   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library's core design centers around Groovy scripts.  Its helper functions are Groovy methods, and the entire pipeline execution flow is typically defined in Groovy. This creates a *primary* attack vector for code injection.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a `Jenkinsfile` using the library to include a `sh` step that executes a reverse shell, or they misuse a `fabric8-pipeline-library` function like `openshift.apply()` with malicious parameters to deploy a compromised resource.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains control of the build/deployment environment, potentially accessing secrets, source code, and production systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandatory, thorough code reviews for *all* pipeline changes (Groovy scripts), with a focus on security.
    *   **Pipeline-as-Code with Immutability:** Treat pipeline definitions as immutable artifacts. Use version control and prevent direct modification of running pipelines.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run pipeline steps (and the library's functions) with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid highly privileged service accounts.
    *   **SCM Access Control:** Strong access controls on the source code management system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to prevent unauthorized script modifications. Require multi-factor authentication.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools that can detect potentially malicious patterns in Groovy scripts (e.g., suspicious system calls, network connections, misuse of library functions).
    *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate *all* parameters passed to `fabric8-pipeline-library` functions, even if those parameters originate from within the pipeline itself.  Use allow-lists where possible.

## Attack Surface: [2. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Direct and Transitive impacting the library)](./attack_surfaces/2__dependency_vulnerabilities__direct_and_transitive_impacting_the_library_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s direct dependencies, or in the transitive dependencies pulled in by the library, are exploited.
*   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library itself has dependencies, and these dependencies may have vulnerabilities.  The library's code is the execution context for these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable version of a library used by `fabric8-pipeline-library` for interacting with Kubernetes is exploited to gain unauthorized access to the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to complete system compromise of the build/deployment environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and its dependencies using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, etc.  This should be part of the build process.
    *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain an SBOM to track all dependencies and their versions.
    *   **Prompt Patching:** Apply security updates to the `fabric8-pipeline-library` and its dependencies as soon as they are available.
    *   **Vulnerability Database Monitoring:** Stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities in the library and its dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [3. Improper Secrets Management (within the library's context)](./attack_surfaces/3__improper_secrets_management__within_the_library's_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Secrets used *by* the `fabric8-pipeline-library` are exposed or mishandled, leading to potential compromise.
*   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library's functions often require secrets (e.g., for interacting with Kubernetes, container registries, etc.).  If these secrets are not handled securely *within the pipeline scripts that use the library*, they become vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A Kubernetes API token is hardcoded in a Groovy script that uses `fabric8-pipeline-library` functions, or a registry credential is passed as a plain-text parameter to a library function.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive resources accessed by the library (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, container registries).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the exposed secrets)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secrets Management System:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution.  The pipeline scripts using the `fabric8-pipeline-library` should *reference* secrets, never store them directly.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant the pipeline (and thus the library) only the minimum necessary access to secrets.
    *   **Log Redaction:** Implement mechanisms to prevent secrets from being written to pipeline logs, especially when using `fabric8-pipeline-library` functions that might output sensitive information.
    *   **Secure Secret Retrieval:** Ensure that the way the pipeline retrieves secrets (and how the library accesses them) is secure (TLS, strong authentication).

## Attack Surface: [4. Abuse of Kubernetes API Access (via library functions)](./attack_surfaces/4__abuse_of_kubernetes_api_access__via_library_functions_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages the `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s functions for interacting with the Kubernetes API to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library provides a *direct interface* to the Kubernetes API.  If the pipeline's service account has excessive permissions, or if the pipeline script is compromised, the library's functions become tools for malicious actions.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects code into a pipeline script to use `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s `openshift.apply()` or similar functions to deploy a malicious pod or modify existing deployments.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the Kubernetes cluster and any applications running on it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the cluster's role)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Kubernetes RBAC:** Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to limit the permissions of the service account used by the pipeline *and accessed by the library*.
    *   **Network Policies:** Use network policies to restrict network access within the cluster, limiting the impact of compromised pods deployed via the library.
    *   **Pod Security Policies/Standards:** Enforce security policies to prevent the deployment of insecure pods via the library's functions.
    *   **Kubernetes Auditing:** Enable and monitor Kubernetes audit logs to detect suspicious activity initiated through the library.
    *   **Least Privilege (Crucial):** The service account used by the pipeline, and therefore available to the `fabric8-pipeline-library`, should have the *absolute minimum* permissions required.

## Attack Surface: [5. YAML/Configuration Injection (affecting library usage)](./attack_surfaces/5__yamlconfiguration_injection__affecting_library_usage_.md)

* **Description:** If the pipeline configuration that utilizes the `fabric8-pipeline-library` is dynamically generated or accepts user input, an attacker might inject malicious YAML, leading to unintended library function calls or parameter manipulation.
    * **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** While the library itself doesn't *generate* YAML, it *consumes* it. If the YAML that configures how the library is used is compromised, the library's behavior can be altered maliciously.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects a configuration snippet that changes the parameters passed to a `fabric8-pipeline-library` function, causing it to deploy a malicious image or interact with a compromised service.
    * **Impact:** Similar to code injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands or manipulate the pipeline's behavior through the library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Generation:** Minimize or eliminate dynamic generation of pipeline configurations that use the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** If dynamic generation is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate *all* user-supplied input that influences how the `fabric8-pipeline-library` is configured. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Treat Configuration as Code:** Apply the same security principles to pipeline configurations as to the code itself, especially when those configurations directly affect how the `fabric8-pipeline-library` is used.
