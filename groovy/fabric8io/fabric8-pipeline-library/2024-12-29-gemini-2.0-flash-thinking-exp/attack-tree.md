Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

Exploit Vulnerabilities in Pipeline Definition Processing [CRITICAL NODE]:
  This node is critical because successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious code directly into the pipeline definition, leading to code execution within the pipeline environment.

  Attack Vectors:
    - Inject Malicious Code into Pipeline Definition:
      - Compromise Source Code Repository (e.g., Git) [CRITICAL NODE]: Gaining write access to the repository allows direct modification of pipeline definitions. This is critical as it provides a persistent and direct way to inject malicious code.
      - Manipulate Pipeline Parameters: If pipeline parameters are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious commands or scripts that will be executed during pipeline runtime.
      - Execute Malicious Code within Pipeline Execution Environment [CRITICAL NODE]: This is the culmination of successful injection, where the attacker's code runs with the privileges of the pipeline, potentially compromising the application or infrastructure. This node is critical due to the direct impact of arbitrary code execution.

Exploit Vulnerabilities in Pipeline Execution [CRITICAL NODE]:
  This node is critical because it focuses on exploiting the execution phase of the pipeline, allowing attackers to run malicious pipelines or influence the execution of legitimate ones.

  Attack Vectors:
    - Trigger Execution of Malicious Pipeline:
      - Compromise CI/CD System (e.g., Jenkins, Tekton) [CRITICAL NODE]: Gaining control over the CI/CD system allows attackers to schedule and trigger arbitrary pipelines, including malicious ones. This is a critical node due to the centralized control it provides over pipeline execution.
      - Malicious Pipeline Executes with Elevated Privileges: If a malicious pipeline is triggered and runs with excessive permissions, it can cause significant damage to the application and its environment.

Exploit Insecure Handling of Secrets and Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:
  This node is critical because the compromise of secrets can provide attackers with direct access to sensitive resources and application components.

  Attack Vectors:
    - Use Compromised Secrets to Access Application Resources [CRITICAL NODE]: If secrets managed by the library are compromised (due to weak storage, access controls, etc.), attackers can use these credentials to directly access databases, APIs, and other critical application resources. This node is critical due to the direct access to sensitive data and systems it grants.
