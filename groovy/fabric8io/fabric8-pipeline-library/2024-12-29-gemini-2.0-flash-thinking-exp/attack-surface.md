Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces with high and critical severity that directly involve the `fabric8-pipeline-library`:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Code Injection via Pipeline Definition
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., Groovy for Jenkinsfile) into pipeline definitions.
    *   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library is designed to execute pipeline definitions, often allowing for arbitrary code execution within the pipeline environment based on the provided definition. It doesn't inherently sanitize or restrict the code within these definitions.
    *   **Example:** A user with permissions to modify a Jenkinsfile adds a step that executes `rm -rf /` on the pipeline agent.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the pipeline execution environment, potential data loss, and the ability to pivot to other systems accessible from the pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control for modifying pipeline definitions.
        *   Use a "Pipeline as Code" approach with version control and code review for all pipeline changes.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to scan pipeline definitions for potentially malicious code patterns.
        *   Utilize sandboxed or containerized environments for pipeline execution to limit the impact of malicious code.
        *   Adopt declarative pipeline syntax where possible, which offers more restrictions than scripted pipelines.

*   **Attack Surface:** Command Injection via Pipeline Parameters
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate pipeline parameters that are used unsafely in shell commands within pipeline steps.
    *   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library facilitates the use of parameters within pipeline steps. If these parameters are directly incorporated into shell commands without proper sanitization, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A pipeline step uses a parameter `$IMAGE_TAG` in a `docker push` command. An attacker provides a value like `latest; rm -rf /tmp/*` for `$IMAGE_TAG`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the pipeline execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize and validate user-provided input and pipeline parameters.
        *   Avoid directly embedding parameters in shell commands. Use parameterized commands or dedicated functions provided by tools (e.g., Docker CLI).
        *   Enforce strict input validation rules for parameters.
        *   Use secure command execution methods that prevent injection.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Pipeline Definitions or Parameters
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or internal network details are stored directly in pipeline definitions or passed as parameters without proper protection.
    *   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library processes and executes pipeline definitions and parameters. If these definitions or parameters contain secrets in plaintext, the library facilitates their use and potential exposure.
    *   **Example:** An API key for a deployment platform is hardcoded in a Jenkinsfile step.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems, data breaches, and potential compromise of infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never store sensitive information directly in pipeline definitions or parameters.
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and integrate them with the pipeline.
        *   Use credential binding plugins or features provided by the CI/CD system to securely inject secrets into the pipeline environment.
        *   Implement access controls to restrict who can view and modify pipeline definitions.
