# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the `fabric8-pipeline-library`, aims to provide a collection of reusable and standardized Jenkins pipeline shared libraries specifically designed for the Fabric8 ecosystem.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: Streamline and simplify the creation and maintenance of CI/CD pipelines for applications deployed within the Fabric8 platform.
 - Goal: Promote consistency and best practices in pipeline design and implementation across different projects and teams using Fabric8.
 - Goal: Reduce development time and effort by providing pre-built, tested, and reusable pipeline components.
 - Priority: Enhance developer productivity and accelerate software delivery within Fabric8 environments.
 - Priority: Improve the reliability and maintainability of CI/CD pipelines.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities within the pipeline library could be inherited by all pipelines utilizing it, potentially compromising deployed applications and infrastructure.
 - Risk: Improperly configured or misused pipeline components could lead to insecure deployments, data breaches, or service disruptions.
 - Risk: Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates to the library could result in compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and reduced effectiveness over time.
 - Risk: Dependency on a community-driven library introduces a risk of inconsistent quality, delayed updates, or project abandonment.
 - Risk: Inadequate documentation or complex usage patterns could hinder adoption and lead to misconfigurations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code review process for contributions to the library (location: GitHub repository contribution guidelines and pull request process).
 - security control: Static code analysis might be performed on the library code (location: potentially integrated into CI/CD pipelines used to build and test the library itself, details not explicitly provided in the repository).
 - security control: Version control using Git (location: GitHub repository).
 - security control: Access control to the GitHub repository (location: GitHub repository settings).
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions may introduce vulnerabilities if not thoroughly vetted.
 - accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users integrating the library into their pipelines.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) as part of the library's CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
 - recommended security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the library.
 - recommended security control: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples that emphasize secure usage patterns and highlight potential security pitfalls.
 - recommended security control: Implement input validation and sanitization within the pipeline library functions to prevent injection attacks in pipelines using the library.
 - recommended security control: Regularly update dependencies of the library to patch known vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: The library itself does not directly handle authentication. Authentication is assumed to be managed by the Jenkins instance and the Fabric8 platform where the pipelines are executed.
  - Requirement: Pipelines using the library might need to authenticate to external systems (e.g., artifact repositories, cloud providers). Secure credential management practices should be enforced in pipeline examples and documentation.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Authorization is managed by Jenkins and Fabric8. Access to use and modify pipelines using the library should be controlled based on roles and responsibilities.
  - Requirement: The library should not introduce any authorization bypass vulnerabilities in pipelines that use it.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All pipeline steps provided by the library should perform robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, script injection) if user-provided input is used.
  - Requirement: Documentation should clearly specify the expected input types and formats for each pipeline step.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: If the library handles sensitive data or secrets (which should be minimized), it should utilize secure cryptographic practices for storage and transmission.
  - Requirement: Pipelines using the library might need to handle cryptographic operations (e.g., signing artifacts, encrypting data). The library should provide secure and easy-to-use functions for common cryptographic tasks if applicable, or guide users to use secure external tools.

## DEPLOYMENT

The `fabric8-pipeline-library` itself is not deployed as a standalone application. It is used within Jenkins environments to define and execute CI/CD pipelines. The deployment context is therefore the Jenkins environment and the target environments where applications are deployed by these pipelines.

We will focus on a typical deployment scenario where Jenkins is running within a Kubernetes cluster (potentially within the Fabric8 platform itself) and pipelines deploy applications to the same or a different Kubernetes cluster.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Kubernetes Cluster (Jenkins)
        subgraph Jenkins Namespace
            jenkins("Jenkins Master")
            jenkins_agent("Jenkins Agent")
        end
    end
    subgraph Kubernetes Cluster (Target Environment)
        namespace("Application Namespace")
        application("Deployed Application")
    end

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Process: Software Development and Delivery - The library directly impacts the efficiency and security of the software development and delivery process for applications within the Fabric8 ecosystem. Failures or vulnerabilities in the library can disrupt development workflows and compromise deployed applications.
 - Process: CI/CD Pipeline Automation - The library is fundamental to automating CI/CD pipelines. Its reliability and security are crucial for maintaining the integrity and automation of these pipelines.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Data: Pipeline Definitions - Pipeline definitions that utilize the library might contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and configuration details. These definitions need to be protected from unauthorized access and modification. Sensitivity: High.
 - Data: Build Artifacts - Build artifacts produced by pipelines using the library might contain intellectual property or sensitive data. These artifacts need to be protected from unauthorized access and tampering. Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on the application).
 - Data: Logs and Audit Trails - Logs generated by pipelines and the library itself can contain sensitive information and are crucial for security monitoring and incident response. Sensitivity: Medium.
 - Data: Source Code of the Library - The source code of the library itself is intellectual property and needs to be protected from unauthorized access and modification. Sensitivity: Medium.
