# Threat Model Analysis for fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependency Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_dependency_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency used by `fabric8-pipeline-library`. This could involve crafting malicious input processed by the library's functions that rely on the vulnerable dependency, or leveraging the vulnerability to compromise the Jenkins environment where the library is used.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins master or agent, data breaches, denial of service, compromise of CI/CD pipeline integrity.
*   **Affected Component:** Dependencies of `fabric8-pipeline-library` (Groovy libraries, Jenkins plugins, transitive dependencies) as utilized by the library's modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and exploitability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `fabric8-pipeline-library` and its dependencies.
    *   Implement dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies used by the library.
    *   Monitor security advisories specifically for `fabric8-pipeline-library` and its direct dependencies.
    *   Utilize dependency management tools to ensure dependencies are up-to-date and patched.

## Threat: [Groovy Code Injection](./threats/groovy_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious Groovy code through a vulnerable function within `fabric8-pipeline-library`. This could be achieved by manipulating input parameters to pipeline steps provided by the library, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code within the Jenkins environment.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Groovy code execution on the Jenkins master or agent, full control of the Jenkins environment, access to secrets and sensitive data managed by Jenkins, manipulation of pipeline execution flow, potentially leading to compromised deployments.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions within `fabric8-pipeline-library` that process user input or pipeline parameters and execute Groovy code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and audit the source code of `fabric8-pipeline-library` functions for potential code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the library's functions to prevent injection.
    *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in Groovy code execution within the library.
    *   Apply principle of least privilege for pipeline execution and Jenkins permissions to limit the impact of potential code injection.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Library Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within `fabric8-pipeline-library` to escalate their privileges within the Jenkins environment or target systems (Kubernetes/OpenShift). This could involve exploiting a bug in the library's permission handling or a flaw in how it interacts with Jenkins or target cluster APIs.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Jenkins environment and potentially target infrastructure, allowing attackers to perform unauthorized actions, access sensitive data, and disrupt operations, including gaining control over deployed applications and infrastructure.
*   **Affected Component:** Core functionalities of `fabric8-pipeline-library` related to permission management, interaction with Jenkins API, or interaction with target environments (Kubernetes/OpenShift modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `fabric8-pipeline-library` and Jenkins to patch known vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation.
    *   Implement robust access control mechanisms within Jenkins and target environments, independent of the library.
    *   Follow least privilege principles for pipeline execution and service accounts used by the library.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on potential privilege escalation points within the CI/CD pipeline and the library's usage.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage through Logging (Library Induced)](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_through_logging__library_induced_.md)

*   **Description:** `fabric8-pipeline-library` functions are designed in a way that inadvertently logs sensitive information (credentials, API keys, secrets) during pipeline execution. An attacker with access to Jenkins logs could retrieve this sensitive data due to the library's logging behavior.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems and resources, compromise of application security, and broader infrastructure compromise if leaked credentials are for critical systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Logging mechanisms within `fabric8-pipeline-library` functions, specifically if they are designed to log or expose sensitive data by default or through misconfiguration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if critical secrets are leaked).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Review the logging practices of `fabric8-pipeline-library` functions and identify any unintentional logging of sensitive data.
    *   Modify or configure the library (if possible) to prevent logging of sensitive information.
    *   Implement secure logging practices and strictly control access to Jenkins logs.
    *   Utilize secret masking or redaction techniques in logs as a secondary measure, but primarily focus on preventing logging sensitive data in the first place.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of fabric8-pipeline-library](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_fabric8-pipeline-library.md)

*   **Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library` repository, build process, or release mechanism is compromised, and malicious code is injected into the library itself. Users downloading and using the compromised library unknowingly introduce malicious code into their CI/CD pipelines, which is executed by Jenkins.
*   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of pipelines and applications using the compromised library, potentially leading to significant security breaches, data exfiltration, backdoors in deployed applications, and operational disruptions across numerous organizations relying on the library.
*   **Affected Component:** Entire `fabric8-pipeline-library` codebase and release artifacts as distributed through official or unofficial channels.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use official and trusted sources (e.g., verified GitHub releases, official package repositories if available) for downloading `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
    *   Verify the integrity of downloaded libraries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the maintainers.
    *   Implement security best practices for managing dependencies and software supply chains, including vulnerability scanning and provenance checks.
    *   Monitor for any unusual activity or changes in the `fabric8-pipeline-library` repository or release process that could indicate a compromise.
