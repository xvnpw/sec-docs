    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Distribution Channels:** Intercepting and modifying library artifacts during distribution if using insecure channels (less likely for GitHub releases, more relevant for unofficial mirrors).
*   **Dependency Confusion/Substitution:**
    *   Creating a malicious package with a similar name to a legitimate dependency used by `fabric8-pipeline-library` and tricking the build system into using the malicious package. (Less likely for direct library compromise, more relevant if attackers target dependencies *of* the library).

#### 4.3. Attack Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Compromised Maintainer Account**

1.  **Phishing Attack:** Threat actors send a sophisticated phishing email to a maintainer of the `fabric8-pipeline-library` repository, successfully stealing their GitHub credentials.
2.  **Repository Access:** Using the compromised credentials, the attacker gains write access to the repository.
3.  **Malicious Code Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code into a commonly used Groovy script within the library, perhaps disguised as a bug fix or feature enhancement.
4.  **Code Commit and Merge:** The attacker commits and merges the malicious code, potentially bypassing code review if the compromise is subtle or the review process is weak.
5.  **Release and Distribution:** The compromised code is included in the next release of `fabric8-pipeline-library` and distributed through GitHub releases.
6.  **User Download and Execution:** Users download the compromised library and integrate it into their Jenkins pipelines. The malicious code is executed within their CI/CD environments, potentially granting the attacker access to sensitive data, build artifacts, or deployment credentials.

**Scenario 2: Compromised Build Server**

1.  **Vulnerability in Build Server:** Threat actors identify and exploit a vulnerability in the build server used to compile `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
2.  **Access and Persistence:** The attacker gains access to the build server and establishes persistence, potentially installing backdoors or malware.
3.  **Build Process Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the build scripts or build environment on the server to inject malicious code into the compiled library artifacts during the build process.
4.  **Clean Code in Repository:** The source code in the GitHub repository remains clean, making detection more difficult through static analysis of the repository alone.
5.  **Release and Distribution:** The compromised build server produces malicious library artifacts, which are then released and distributed through official channels.
6.  **User Download and Execution:** Users download the seemingly legitimate library, unknowingly executing the injected malicious code within their pipelines.
