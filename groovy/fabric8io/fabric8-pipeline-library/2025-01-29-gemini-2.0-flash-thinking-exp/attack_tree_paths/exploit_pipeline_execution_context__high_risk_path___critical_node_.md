#### 7. Exploit Pipeline Execution Context [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

* **Description:** This node represents the overarching goal of an attacker to compromise the environment where Jenkins pipelines using `fabric8-pipeline-library` are executed. Successful exploitation at this level can grant the attacker significant control over the CI/CD process and potentially the deployed application.
* **Risk Level:** CRITICAL
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to sensitive data, secrets, credentials, and source code managed within the pipeline.
    * **Integrity Compromise:** Modification of build artifacts, deployment of malicious code, alteration of application configurations.
    * **Availability Disruption:** Denial of service attacks against the CI/CD pipeline, disruption of deployments, and application downtime.

#### 7.1. Script Injection in Pipelines Using Library [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Description:** This attack vector focuses on injecting malicious scripts directly into the pipeline definition. These scripts can then interact with the `fabric8-pipeline-library` or the broader pipeline execution environment to achieve malicious objectives.
* **Risk Level:** HIGH
* **Potential Impact:** Code execution within the Jenkins agent and potentially the Jenkins master, leading to full control over the pipeline execution.

##### 7.1.1. Injecting malicious scripts into pipeline definitions that utilize library steps [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to modify pipeline definitions. This could be achieved through:
    * **Compromised Jenkins Accounts:** Weak passwords, phishing attacks, or account hijacking.
    * **Insecure Access Controls:** Insufficient role-based access control (RBAC) within Jenkins, allowing unauthorized users to modify pipelines.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Pipeline Definition Storage/Management:** Exploiting weaknesses in how pipeline definitions are stored, versioned, or managed (e.g., insecure Git repositories).
* **Vulnerability:**
    * **Insufficient Access Control:** Lack of proper authorization mechanisms to restrict who can modify pipeline definitions.
    * **Insecure Pipeline Definition Management:**  Storing pipeline definitions in insecure locations or without proper version control and integrity checks.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Injected scripts can execute arbitrary Groovy or shell commands within the Jenkins pipeline execution environment.
    * **Malicious Library Usage:** Injected scripts can misuse or abuse the `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps to perform unintended actions, such as deploying malicious containers or manipulating Kubernetes resources in unauthorized ways.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Scripts can be designed to steal sensitive data, credentials, or secrets managed by the pipeline.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement Strong Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforce strict access control policies within Jenkins to limit pipeline modification access to authorized personnel only.
    * **Secure Pipeline Definition Storage:** Store pipeline definitions in version-controlled repositories (e.g., Git) with protected branches and access restrictions.
    * **Code Review and Security Scanning of Pipeline Definitions:** Implement code review processes for pipeline changes and utilize static analysis tools to scan pipeline definitions for potential vulnerabilities and malicious code.
    * **Immutable Pipeline Definitions:** Promote the use of immutable pipeline definitions, where changes are tracked and audited, and unauthorized modifications are prevented.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant pipeline execution environments only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, limiting the potential impact of injected scripts.

##### 7.1.2. Manipulating pipeline parameters to execute arbitrary code via library steps [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate pipeline parameters that are used within pipeline scripts or passed to `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps in an unsafe manner. This could be achieved through:
    * **Unvalidated Parameter Input:** Pipelines accepting user-provided parameters without proper validation and sanitization.
    * **Direct Parameter Usage in Script Execution:** Using pipeline parameters directly in shell commands or Groovy `eval()` without proper escaping or sanitization.
    * **Vulnerable Library Step Parameter Handling:** `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps potentially vulnerable to parameter injection if they don't properly sanitize or validate input parameters.
* **Vulnerability:**
    * **Lack of Input Validation:** Pipelines failing to validate and sanitize user-provided parameters before using them in scripts or library steps.
    * **Unsafe Parameter Handling:**  Using parameters in a way that allows for code injection, such as directly executing parameter values as commands.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Code Injection:** Maliciously crafted parameters can inject code that gets executed by the pipeline or within `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps.
    * **Bypassing Security Checks:** Parameter manipulation could be used to bypass security checks or access controls implemented within library steps.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate parameters to alter data processed by the pipeline or library steps, leading to unintended consequences.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all pipeline parameters. Use whitelisting and escaping techniques to prevent code injection.
    * **Avoid Direct Parameter Execution:**  Never directly execute parameter values as code. Use parameters for configuration or data input, but not for constructing executable commands without proper sanitization.
    * **Parameterized Builds with Caution:** Use parameterized builds judiciously and carefully review how parameters are used within pipeline scripts and library steps.
    * **Secure Parameter Handling in `fabric8-pipeline-library`:** Ensure that `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps are designed to handle parameters securely and are not vulnerable to parameter injection attacks. Report any potential vulnerabilities to the library maintainers.

#### 7.2. Environment Variable Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Description:** This attack vector focuses on manipulating environment variables within the pipeline execution environment. Attackers aim to alter the behavior of `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps by modifying the environment variables they rely upon.
* **Risk Level:** HIGH
* **Potential Impact:** Altered pipeline behavior, bypassing security checks, and potentially malicious actions performed by library steps due to manipulated environment variables.

##### 7.2.1. Injecting or modifying environment variables used by library steps to alter behavior [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to inject or modify environment variables that are used by `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps. This could be achieved through:
    * **Access to Jenkins Master/Agent:** Gaining access to the Jenkins master or agent nodes, allowing direct manipulation of environment variables.
    * **Pipeline Script Manipulation (if already compromised):** If an attacker has already compromised pipeline definitions (as in 7.1), they can inject scripts to modify environment variables.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Jenkins Plugins or Configurations:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins or insecure configurations that allow environment variable manipulation.
* **Vulnerability:**
    * **Reliance on Environment Variables for Security-Sensitive Configurations:** `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps relying on environment variables for critical security settings or configurations without proper validation or protection.
    * **Lack of Environment Variable Validation:** Library steps not validating or sanitizing environment variables before using them, leading to potential vulnerabilities if manipulated.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Bypassing Security Checks:** Manipulated environment variables could disable security checks or bypass access controls within `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps.
    * **Altering Deployment Targets:** Environment variables controlling deployment targets or configurations could be manipulated to deploy to unauthorized environments.
    * **Modifying Library Behavior:** Attackers could alter the intended behavior of library steps by changing environment variables that influence their logic.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Minimize Reliance on Environment Variables for Security-Critical Configurations:** Avoid using environment variables for sensitive configurations whenever possible. Prefer secure secret management solutions.
    * **Validate and Sanitize Environment Variables:** If environment variables are used, `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps should validate and sanitize them to prevent manipulation and ensure they are within expected ranges or formats.
    * **Secure Secret Management:** Utilize Jenkins Credentials or dedicated secret management tools to securely store and manage sensitive information instead of relying on environment variables.
    * **Immutable Infrastructure Principles:** Implement immutable infrastructure principles where environment variables are predefined and controlled, limiting the ability to modify them during pipeline execution.
    * **Restrict Access to Jenkins Master/Agent:** Secure access to Jenkins master and agent nodes to prevent unauthorized environment variable manipulation.

#### 7.3. Jenkins Plugin Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related to library usage) [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Description:** This attack vector highlights the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in *other* Jenkins plugins installed in the same Jenkins environment as the `fabric8-pipeline-library`. While not directly targeting the library itself, compromising other plugins can provide an attacker with a foothold to then leverage the `fabric8-pipeline-library` within the compromised security context.
* **Risk Level:** HIGH
* **Potential Impact:** Full Jenkins compromise, access to pipeline execution environment, and the ability to leverage `fabric8-pipeline-library` for further attacks.

##### 7.3.1. Exploiting vulnerabilities in other Jenkins plugins used in conjunction with fabric8-pipeline-library, impacting its security context. [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in other Jenkins plugins installed in the same Jenkins instance. This could involve:
    * **Outdated Plugins:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Jenkins plugins.
    * **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities in plugins before patches are available.
    * **Plugin Misconfigurations:** Exploiting insecure configurations of other plugins that expose vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability:**
    * **Vulnerable Jenkins Plugins:** Presence of outdated or vulnerable Jenkins plugins within the environment.
    * **Inadequate Plugin Management:** Lack of a robust plugin management strategy, including regular updates, security audits, and vulnerability scanning.
* **Potential Impact:**
    * **Jenkins Master Compromise:** Exploiting plugin vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution on the Jenkins master, granting the attacker full control over the Jenkins instance.
    * **Agent Compromise:** Vulnerabilities in plugins running on agents can compromise agent nodes.
    * **Access to Pipeline Execution Environment:** Once Jenkins or agents are compromised, attackers gain access to the pipeline execution environment and can manipulate pipelines, access secrets, and leverage `fabric8-pipeline-library` for malicious purposes.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regularly Update Jenkins and Plugins:** Implement a strict policy of regularly updating Jenkins and all installed plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * **Plugin Management Policy:** Establish a plugin management policy that includes:
        * **Plugin Auditing:** Regularly audit installed plugins to ensure they are necessary and secure.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize security scanners to identify vulnerable plugins.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:** Grant plugins only the necessary permissions to minimize the impact of a potential compromise.
        * **Controlled Plugin Installation:** Restrict plugin installation to authorized administrators and implement a process for vetting new plugins before deployment.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate the Jenkins environment and limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities in other plugins.
    * **Security Hardening of Jenkins:** Follow Jenkins security best practices to harden the Jenkins instance and reduce the attack surface.
