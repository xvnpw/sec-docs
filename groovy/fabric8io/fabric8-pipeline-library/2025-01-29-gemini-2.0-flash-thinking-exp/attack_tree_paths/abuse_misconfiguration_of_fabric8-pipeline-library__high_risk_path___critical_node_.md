#### 6.1. Insecure Credential Management [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]

* **Attack Vector:** Improper handling of credentials used by the library to interact with Kubernetes/OpenShift.
* **Description:** This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of sensitive credentials used by the `fabric8-pipeline-library` to interact with Kubernetes/OpenShift. Credentials are essential for authentication and authorization, and their compromise can lead to significant security breaches.
* **Impact:** If credentials are compromised, attackers can gain unauthorized access to Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, resource manipulation, and even complete cluster takeover.
* **Likelihood:** High. Credential management is a common area of security weakness in software development and CI/CD pipelines. Developers may prioritize speed and convenience over security, leading to insecure practices.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Never hardcode credentials:**  Absolutely avoid embedding credentials directly in pipeline scripts or configuration files.
    * **Utilize secure credential stores:** Leverage dedicated credential management systems like Jenkins Credential Provider, Kubernetes Secrets (with encryption at rest), HashiCorp Vault, or cloud provider secret management services.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to credentials used by pipelines and library steps.
    * **Regularly rotate credentials:** Implement a policy for periodic credential rotation to limit the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.

    * **Implement automated checks** to prevent hardcoded credentials from being committed to version control.
    * **Regularly audit credential usage and permissions** to identify and rectify any overly permissive access.

    ##### 6.1.1. Hardcoded credentials within pipeline configurations using library steps [HIGH RISK PATH]

    * **Attack Vector:** Developers might mistakenly embed sensitive credentials directly into pipeline scripts that use library steps. Attackers can find these hardcoded credentials by reviewing pipeline definitions in version control systems or Jenkins configurations.
    * **Description:** Developers directly embed sensitive credentials (e.g., API tokens, passwords, client certificates) within pipeline scripts that utilize `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps. This makes credentials easily discoverable if pipeline definitions are exposed.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the associated Kubernetes/OpenShift resources accessible with the hardcoded credentials. Attackers can gain immediate and direct access upon discovering these credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** High.  While considered a basic security mistake, it still occurs frequently, especially in fast-paced development environments or when developers lack sufficient security awareness.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict code review processes:**  Implement mandatory code reviews that specifically check for hardcoded credentials in pipeline configurations.
        * **Automated secret scanning tools:** Integrate secret scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline and version control system to automatically detect and flag potential hardcoded credentials.
        * **Education and awareness:**  Educate developers about the severe risks of hardcoding credentials and promote secure alternatives.
    * **Recommendations:**
        * **Prohibit hardcoding credentials** as a strict security policy.
        * **Enforce the use of secret scanning tools** as a mandatory step in the CI/CD process.
        * **Provide clear examples and documentation** on how to securely manage credentials with `fabric8-pipeline-library`.

    ##### 6.1.2. Storing credentials insecurely in Jenkins or Kubernetes Secrets accessed by library [HIGH RISK PATH]

    * **Attack Vector:** Credentials might be stored in Jenkins credential stores or Kubernetes Secrets, but with weak access controls or without proper encryption. Attackers can exploit misconfigurations in these systems to gain unauthorized access to the stored credentials that the library uses.
    * **Description:** Credentials are stored in Jenkins credential stores or Kubernetes Secrets, but these storage mechanisms are misconfigured, leading to insecure access. This could involve weak access controls, lack of encryption at rest, or default settings that are not sufficiently secure.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to stored credentials. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in Jenkins or Kubernetes to retrieve credentials intended for `fabric8-pipeline-library` usage.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  While using credential stores is a step in the right direction, misconfigurations are common. Default settings might not be secure enough, and access control might be overly permissive.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Jenkins Credential Provider:**  Ensure Jenkins Credential Provider is properly configured with appropriate access controls and encryption. Use encrypted credential types where available.
        * **Kubernetes Secrets Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets to protect them from unauthorized access at the storage level.
        * **Restrict access to Kubernetes Secrets:** Implement RBAC policies to limit access to Kubernetes Secrets to only authorized service accounts and users.
        * **Regular security audits of Jenkins and Kubernetes configurations:** Periodically review and harden the security configurations of Jenkins and Kubernetes environments, focusing on credential storage and access controls.
    * **Recommendations:**
        * **Implement strong RBAC for Jenkins and Kubernetes resources.**
        * **Enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets.**
        * **Regularly audit and review security configurations.**
        * **Follow security best practices for Jenkins and Kubernetes hardening.**

    ##### 6.1.3. Overly permissive access to credentials used by library steps [HIGH RISK PATH]

    * **Attack Vector:** The service accounts or credentials used by pipelines and library steps might be granted excessive permissions. If an attacker compromises the pipeline execution environment, they can abuse these overly permissive credentials to access resources beyond what is necessary for the pipeline's intended function.
    * **Description:** The service accounts or credentials used by pipelines and `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps are granted excessive permissions. Even if credentials are not hardcoded or insecurely stored, overly broad permissions amplify the potential damage if the pipeline execution environment is compromised.
    * **Impact:** Lateral movement and privilege escalation within Kubernetes/OpenShift. If an attacker compromises a pipeline, overly permissive credentials allow them to access and manipulate resources far beyond the pipeline's intended scope, potentially leading to cluster-wide compromise.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  It's common for developers to grant broad permissions for convenience or due to a lack of understanding of the principle of least privilege.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to service accounts and credentials used by pipelines. Grant only the minimum necessary permissions required for each pipeline step to perform its intended function.
        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement fine-grained RBAC policies in Kubernetes/OpenShift to control access to resources based on roles and responsibilities.
        * **Regularly review and audit permissions:** Periodically review the permissions granted to service accounts and credentials used by pipelines to identify and remove any unnecessary or excessive privileges.
        * **Use dedicated service accounts per pipeline/task:**  Avoid reusing service accounts across multiple pipelines or tasks. Create dedicated service accounts with specific, limited permissions for each pipeline or task.
    * **Recommendations:**
        * **Mandate the principle of least privilege** for all pipeline configurations.
        * **Implement and enforce RBAC policies** for Kubernetes/OpenShift resources.
        * **Automate permission reviews and audits.**
        * **Provide training on RBAC and least privilege principles to developers.**

#### 6.2. Overly Permissive RBAC/Permissions [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Attack Vector:**  Granting excessive Kubernetes/OpenShift Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions to pipelines and library steps.
* **Description:** This node expands on the previous point, focusing specifically on overly permissive RBAC roles and permissions granted to pipelines and `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps within Kubernetes/OpenShift.
* **Impact:**  Similar to overly permissive credential access, this allows for lateral movement and privilege escalation if a pipeline is compromised. Attackers can leverage excessive RBAC permissions to perform unauthorized actions within the cluster.
* **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Misconfiguration of RBAC is a common issue in Kubernetes/OpenShift environments.  Default roles or quickly created roles might be too broad.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (RBAC):**  Apply the principle of least privilege when defining RBAC roles for pipelines and library steps. Grant only the necessary permissions for their specific tasks.
    * **Role Separation:**  Define distinct roles with specific permissions for different pipeline stages or tasks.
    * **Regular RBAC Audits:**  Periodically audit RBAC configurations to identify and rectify overly permissive roles.
    * **Use Kubernetes Network Policies:**  In conjunction with RBAC, use network policies to further restrict network access for pipeline components and service accounts.
* **Recommendations:**
    * **Implement a robust RBAC framework** for Kubernetes/OpenShift.
    * **Regularly audit and refine RBAC roles.**
    * **Provide RBAC training to developers and operations teams.**
    * **Use network policies to complement RBAC.**

    ##### 6.2.1. Library steps configured with excessive Kubernetes/OpenShift permissions [HIGH RISK PATH]

    * **Attack Vector:** When configuring library steps, developers might grant them broader Kubernetes/OpenShift permissions than required for their specific tasks. This expands the attack surface, as a compromised library step could then perform actions beyond its intended scope.
    * **Description:** When configuring individual `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps, developers might grant them broader Kubernetes/OpenShift permissions than strictly necessary for the step's function. This is often due to convenience or lack of understanding of required permissions.
    * **Impact:**  Increased attack surface. If a specific library step is compromised (e.g., through a vulnerability in its dependencies or misconfiguration), the attacker can leverage the excessive permissions granted to that step to perform unauthorized actions.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium.  Developers might overestimate the required permissions or copy configurations without fully understanding the implications.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Step-Specific Permission Scoping:**  Carefully define and scope the Kubernetes/OpenShift permissions required for each individual `fabric8-pipeline-library` step. Grant only the minimum necessary permissions.
        * **Documentation and Guidance:**  Provide clear documentation and guidance on the minimum required permissions for each library step.
        * **Permission Review during Pipeline Development:**  Incorporate permission review as part of the pipeline development and code review process.
        * **Automated Permission Analysis Tools:**  Explore tools that can analyze pipeline configurations and identify potentially excessive permissions.
    * **Recommendations:**
        * **Document minimum required permissions for each library step.**
        * **Provide templates and examples of secure step configurations.**
        * **Educate developers on the importance of step-specific permission scoping.**

    ##### 6.2.2. Service accounts used by pipelines with overly broad roles [HIGH RISK PATH]

    * **Attack Vector:** The Kubernetes/OpenShift service accounts associated with Jenkins pipelines might be assigned overly broad roles. If an attacker gains control of the pipeline execution, they inherit the permissions of the service account, potentially leading to cluster-wide compromise if the service account has excessive privileges.
    * **Description:** The Kubernetes/OpenShift service accounts associated with Jenkins pipelines themselves are assigned overly broad roles. This means the entire pipeline execution environment operates with excessive privileges.
    * **Impact:**  Cluster-wide compromise potential. If an attacker gains control of the pipeline execution environment (e.g., through Jenkins vulnerability or compromised pipeline code), they inherit the overly broad permissions of the service account, potentially leading to severe damage across the entire Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  It's common to assign default or overly broad roles to service accounts for ease of setup or due to a lack of granular RBAC configuration.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Least Privilege Service Accounts:**  Create dedicated service accounts for pipelines with the absolute minimum necessary roles and permissions.
        * **Namespace-Scoped Roles:**  Where possible, scope service account roles to specific namespaces rather than cluster-wide roles.
        * **Regular Service Account Role Review:**  Periodically review the roles assigned to service accounts used by pipelines and reduce permissions as needed.
        * **Avoid Cluster Admin Roles:**  Never assign cluster-admin roles to service accounts used by pipelines unless absolutely unavoidable and with extreme caution.
    * **Recommendations:**
        * **Mandate least privilege service accounts for pipelines.**
        * **Default to namespace-scoped roles.**
        * **Implement regular service account role audits.**
        * **Provide clear guidelines on service account creation and role assignment for pipelines.**

#### 6.3. Insecure Defaults or Configurations [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Attack Vector:** Relying on insecure default settings or failing to configure security-related parameters when using the library.
* **Description:** This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from relying on insecure default settings or failing to configure security-related parameters when using the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
* **Impact:**  Exposure to known vulnerabilities or insecure practices due to reliance on default configurations. Attackers can exploit these known weaknesses if default settings are not hardened.
* **Likelihood:** Medium.  Developers might assume default configurations are secure or overlook security-related configuration options.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Review Default Configurations:**  Thoroughly review the default configurations of `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps and identify any potential security weaknesses.
    * **Security Hardening Guides:**  Provide security hardening guides and best practices for using `fabric8-pipeline-library`, highlighting critical security configurations.
    * **Secure Configuration Templates:**  Offer secure configuration templates and examples that developers can use as a starting point, ensuring security is built-in from the beginning.
    * **Security Audits of Pipeline Configurations:**  Regularly audit pipeline configurations to identify instances where default or insecure configurations are being used.
* **Recommendations:**
    * **Document secure configuration best practices for `fabric8-pipeline-library`.**
    * **Provide secure configuration templates and examples.**
    * **Raise awareness about the risks of relying on default configurations.**
    * **Include security configuration checks in pipeline validation processes.**

    ##### 6.3.1. Using default configurations of library steps that are insecure [HIGH RISK PATH]

    * **Attack Vector:** Some library steps might have default configurations that are not secure by design. If users rely on these defaults without hardening them, they might introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Description:** Specific `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps might have default configurations that are not secure by design. If users blindly adopt these defaults without hardening them, they introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:**  Vulnerability exploitation due to insecure defaults. Attackers can target known weaknesses in default configurations if they are not modified.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium.  Developers might assume defaults are acceptable or not be aware of potential security implications of default settings.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Identify Insecure Defaults:**  Proactively identify and document any insecure default configurations in `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps.
        * **Promote Secure Alternatives:**  Clearly document and promote secure alternatives to insecure default configurations.
        * **Warn Users about Insecure Defaults:**  Provide warnings or alerts in documentation and usage examples about the risks of using insecure defaults.
        * **Consider Changing Defaults (if feasible):**  If possible, consider changing the default configurations of library steps to be more secure by default in future versions.
    * **Recommendations:**
        * **Conduct a security review of default configurations for all library steps.**
        * **Document and highlight insecure defaults and their secure alternatives.**
        * **Provide clear guidance on hardening default configurations.**

    ##### 6.3.2. Failing to properly configure security-related parameters in library usage [HIGH RISK PATH]

    * **Attack Vector:** The library might offer security-related configuration options that users are unaware of or fail to configure correctly. Neglecting these security parameters can leave vulnerabilities open.
    * **Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library` might offer security-related configuration options that users are unaware of or fail to configure correctly. Neglecting these security parameters leaves vulnerabilities open.
    * **Impact:**  Missed security hardening opportunities.  Vulnerabilities remain unaddressed because security features or options are not properly configured.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium.  Developers might be unaware of all available configuration options, especially security-related ones, or might not understand their importance.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Comprehensive Security Documentation:**  Provide comprehensive documentation that clearly outlines all security-related configuration parameters for `fabric8-pipeline-library` steps.
        * **Security Configuration Checklists:**  Create security configuration checklists for pipeline development to ensure developers consider and configure all relevant security parameters.
        * **Training on Security Configurations:**  Provide training to developers on the available security configuration options and their importance.
        * **Automated Security Configuration Checks:**  Develop or integrate automated tools to check pipeline configurations for missing or insecure security parameter settings.
    * **Recommendations:**
        * **Improve documentation of security-related configuration parameters.**
        * **Provide security configuration checklists and templates.**
        * **Offer training on secure configuration practices.**
        * **Implement automated security configuration checks in CI/CD pipelines.**
