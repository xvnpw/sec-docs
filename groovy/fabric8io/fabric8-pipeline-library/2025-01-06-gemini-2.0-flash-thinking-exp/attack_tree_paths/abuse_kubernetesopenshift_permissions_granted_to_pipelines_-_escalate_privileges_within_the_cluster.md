## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Abuse Kubernetes/OpenShift Permissions Granted to Pipelines -> Escalate Privileges within the Cluster

This analysis delves into the specified attack tree path, focusing on the critical node of "Pipeline Service Account Permissions" and the associated attack vectors within a Kubernetes/OpenShift environment utilizing the fabric8-pipeline-library.

**Context:**

The fabric8-pipeline-library provides reusable Jenkins shared libraries for building CI/CD pipelines within Kubernetes/OpenShift. These pipelines often require access to cluster resources to perform tasks like deploying applications, managing configurations, and interacting with other services. To achieve this, pipelines are typically associated with a Kubernetes/OpenShift Service Account. This service account grants the pipeline specific permissions within the cluster. The security of the entire CI/CD process hinges on the principle of least privilege applied to these service accounts.

**CRITICAL NODE: Pipeline Service Account Permissions**

This node represents the core vulnerability. If the service account associated with a pipeline possesses excessive or inappropriate permissions, it becomes a prime target for attackers. Compromising a pipeline's execution environment or gaining access to its service account credentials allows attackers to leverage these permissions for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vector 1: Leverage Service Account Permissions**

**Detailed Analysis:**

This vector focuses on directly utilizing the existing permissions granted to the pipeline's service account. Even if RBAC roles are seemingly configured correctly, the inherent permissions granted to the service account might be sufficient for attackers to achieve their goals.

**How it works:**

1. **Pipeline Compromise:** An attacker first needs to compromise the pipeline execution environment. This could occur through various methods:
    * **Supply Chain Attack:** Injecting malicious code into a dependency used by the pipeline.
    * **Vulnerable Pipeline Configuration:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Jenkinsfile or other pipeline configuration files.
    * **Compromised Pipeline Infrastructure:** Gaining access to the Jenkins master or agent nodes.
    * **Stolen Credentials:** Obtaining the service account token through exposed logs, insecure storage, or compromised developer machines.

2. **Permission Exploitation:** Once inside the pipeline's execution context with access to the service account credentials, the attacker can use `kubectl` or the Kubernetes/OpenShift API to perform actions authorized by the service account.

**Examples of Exploitation:**

* **Reading Secrets:** If the service account has `get` or `list` permission on `secrets` within the namespace or cluster, the attacker can retrieve sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other secrets.
* **Modifying Deployments:** With `patch`, `update`, or `create` permissions on `deployments`, `statefulsets`, or `daemonsets`, the attacker can modify existing applications, potentially injecting malicious code or altering configurations.
* **Creating New Resources:** If the service account has permissions to create resources like `pods`, `services`, or `ingresses`, the attacker can deploy malicious workloads within the cluster.
* **Accessing Cluster-Scoped Resources:** If the service account has cluster-wide permissions (e.g., `cluster-admin` role binding, which is a severe misconfiguration), the attacker gains control over the entire cluster.
* **Interacting with Other Namespaces:** Depending on the RBAC configuration, the service account might have permissions in other namespaces, allowing the attacker to pivot and compromise resources in those namespaces.
* **Exfiltrating Data:** Using the pipeline's network access and permissions, the attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data from the cluster.

**Impact:**

* **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive information stored as secrets or within application data.
* **Service Disruption:** Modification or deletion of critical deployments, leading to application downtime.
* **Malware Deployment:** Introduction of malicious containers or workloads into the cluster.
* **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised pipeline as a stepping stone to access other parts of the infrastructure.
* **Resource Hijacking:** Utilizing cluster resources for malicious activities like cryptomining.

**Attack Vector 2: Exploit Misconfigured RBAC Roles**

**Detailed Analysis:**

This vector focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities arising from overly permissive or incorrectly configured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles associated with the pipeline's service account.

**How it works:**

1. **RBAC Analysis:** The attacker analyzes the RBAC roles and role bindings associated with the pipeline's service account. This can be done through:
    * **Direct Inspection:** If the attacker has gained initial access to the cluster, they can use `kubectl get rolebindings`, `kubectl get roles`, `kubectl get clusterrolebindings`, and `kubectl get clusterroles`.
    * **Inferring Permissions:** By observing the pipeline's behavior and error messages, attackers can deduce the permissions it possesses.
    * **Exploiting Information Disclosure:**  Misconfigured dashboards or exposed API endpoints might reveal RBAC configurations.

2. **Identifying Weaknesses:** The attacker looks for common RBAC misconfigurations:
    * **Wildcard Verbs:** Roles granting actions like `*` (all) or broad verbs like `get`, `list`, `watch`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, and `delete` on sensitive resources.
    * **Wildcard Resources:** Roles granting access to `resources: ["*"]`, allowing actions on any resource type.
    * **Cluster-Wide Permissions:** Binding roles with broad permissions (like `cluster-admin` or roles with wildcard resources at the cluster scope) to the pipeline's service account.
    * **Overly Broad Namespaces:** Granting permissions across multiple namespaces when the pipeline only needs access to specific ones.
    * **Missing Resource Names:** Roles granting access to all instances of a resource type without specifying specific resource names, allowing manipulation of unintended resources.

3. **Exploitation:** Once a misconfiguration is identified, the attacker leverages the excessive permissions to perform actions beyond the intended scope.

**Examples of Exploitation:**

* **Gaining Cluster-Admin Privileges:** If the service account is inadvertently bound to a `cluster-admin` role, the attacker effectively gains full control of the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.
* **Manipulating Critical Infrastructure Components:** With excessive permissions, the attacker might be able to modify or delete core Kubernetes/OpenShift components like controllers, schedulers, or the API server.
* **Elevating Privileges of Other Users/Service Accounts:** The attacker could create new role bindings or modify existing ones to grant elevated privileges to other malicious actors or service accounts.
* **Circumventing Security Policies:** Overly permissive roles can allow the pipeline to bypass network policies, security context constraints, or other security mechanisms.

**Impact:**

* **Complete Cluster Compromise:** If cluster-admin privileges are obtained.
* **Infrastructure Instability:** Manipulation of core Kubernetes/OpenShift components.
* **Widespread Security Breaches:** Ability to access and control resources across multiple namespaces.
* **Long-Term Persistence:** Creating backdoors or privileged accounts for future access.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively defend against this attack path, a multi-layered approach is crucial:

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the pipeline service account only the absolute minimum permissions required for its specific tasks. Avoid wildcard verbs and resources.
* **Granular RBAC Configuration:** Define specific roles and role bindings tailored to the pipeline's needs. Limit access to specific namespaces and resource names.
* **Regular RBAC Audits:** Periodically review and audit the RBAC configuration associated with pipeline service accounts to identify and rectify any misconfigurations. Utilize tools like `kube-bench` or custom scripts for automated audits.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat pipeline configurations and service account definitions as immutable. Changes should be version-controlled and deployed through a controlled process.
* **Secure Secret Management:** Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in pipeline configurations. Utilize secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets (with encryption at rest), or cloud provider secret managers.
* **Pipeline Security Hardening:**
    * **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan pipeline dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing pipeline scripts and configurations.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to the pipeline to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Limited External Access:** Restrict the pipeline's access to external resources and networks.
* **Network Segmentation:** Implement network policies to restrict communication between namespaces and workloads, limiting the impact of a potential compromise.
* **Security Context Constraints (SCCs) / Pod Security Policies (PSPs) / Pod Security Admission (PSA):** Enforce security policies at the pod level to restrict capabilities, prevent privilege escalation, and limit resource access.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect suspicious activity within the cluster and pipeline executions. Monitor API calls made by pipeline service accounts.
* **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in the CI/CD pipeline and cluster configuration.
* **Role-Based Access for Pipeline Management:** Restrict access to modify pipeline configurations and service account definitions to authorized personnel.
* **Utilize Namespaces Effectively:** Isolate pipelines and their associated resources within dedicated namespaces to limit the blast radius of a potential compromise.

**Specific Considerations for fabric8-pipeline-library:**

* **Review Default Permissions:** Understand the default permissions granted by the fabric8-pipeline-library to the service accounts it creates or uses. Ensure these defaults adhere to the principle of least privilege.
* **Customization Options:** Leverage the library's customization options to define more restrictive RBAC roles for your specific pipeline needs.
* **Template Security:** Scrutinize the templates and shared libraries provided by fabric8 for potential vulnerabilities or overly permissive configurations.
* **Parameterization and Input Validation:** Ensure that pipeline parameters and inputs are properly validated to prevent injection attacks that could lead to unauthorized actions using the service account.
* **Library Updates:** Keep the fabric8-pipeline-library updated to benefit from security patches and improvements.

**Conclusion:**
