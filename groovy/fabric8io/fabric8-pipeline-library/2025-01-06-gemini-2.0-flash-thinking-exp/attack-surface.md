# Attack Surface Analysis for fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library

## Attack Surface: [Pipeline Definition Injection](./attack_surfaces/pipeline_definition_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious code is injected into pipeline definitions, leading to unintended actions during pipeline execution.
    *   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library's core function is to execute pipeline definitions. If these definitions, often written in Groovy or similar scripting languages, are sourced from untrusted origins or constructed without proper sanitization, the `fabric8-pipeline-library` will directly execute the injected, malicious code.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses the `fabric8-pipeline-library` to execute a pipeline defined in a `Jenkinsfile`. This `Jenkinsfile` is fetched from a public repository where an attacker has inserted a step that executes arbitrary shell commands on the pipeline agent.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the pipeline execution environment, data breaches through exfiltration, denial of service by disrupting the pipeline, and potential lateral movement to other systems accessible from the pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Source pipeline definitions from trusted and controlled repositories only.
        *   Implement rigorous code review processes specifically for pipeline definitions.
        *   Utilize parameterized pipeline definitions to avoid direct string concatenation of untrusted inputs within the pipeline logic executed by `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
        *   Employ static analysis tools capable of scanning pipeline definitions for potential code injection vulnerabilities before they are executed by the library.
        *   Enforce strict access controls on who can modify the source of pipeline definitions used by the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.

## Attack Surface: [Secret Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/secret_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, etc.) required by the pipeline are stored or handled insecurely, leading to potential exposure.
    *   **How fabric8-pipeline-library Contributes:** The library orchestrates pipeline steps that frequently require authentication with external services. The way the `fabric8-pipeline-library` is used and configured can directly influence how these secrets are managed and accessed within the pipeline execution. If not configured securely, the library can facilitate the exposure of these secrets.
    *   **Example:** A pipeline definition used with `fabric8-pipeline-library` directly embeds an API key as a string within a Groovy script that interacts with a cloud service. When the pipeline runs, this key is present in the execution environment and potentially in logs.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, and potential financial loss due to compromised credentials used within the pipeline orchestrated by the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and ensure the `fabric8-pipeline-library` is configured to retrieve secrets from these secure sources.
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in pipeline definitions or environment variables directly accessible by the `fabric8-pipeline-library` during execution.
        *   Leverage Jenkins' built-in credential management features and configure the `fabric8-pipeline-library` to utilize these securely stored credentials.
        *   Implement least privilege principles for secret access within the pipeline steps executed by the library.
        *   Regularly rotate secrets used within pipelines managed by the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.
