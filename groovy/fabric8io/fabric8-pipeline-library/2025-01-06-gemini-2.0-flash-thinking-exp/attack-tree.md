## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Pipeline Definition Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Pipeline Steps](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pipeline_definition_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_pipeline_steps.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Contribute Malicious Code to Source Repository [CRITICAL NODE: Source Code Repository]:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository where pipeline definitions are stored.
    *   **Exploit Weak Access Controls on Repository:**  Leveraging weak or default credentials, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository platform to gain write access.
    *   **Social Engineering of Developers:** Tricking developers into committing malicious code or granting access to malicious actors.
*   **Craft Malicious Pull Requests:** An attacker creates a pull request containing malicious modifications to the pipeline definitions.
    *   **Exploit Automated Merge Processes:**  Bypassing human review by targeting automated merge configurations that might automatically merge pull requests based on certain conditions.
    *   **Bypass Code Review:** Submitting pull requests with subtle malicious changes that are overlooked during the code review process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Pipeline Definition Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Insecure Parameterization in Pipelines](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pipeline_definition_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_insecure_parameterization_in_pipelines.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Inject Malicious Commands via Pipeline Parameters [CRITICAL NODE: Pipeline Parameter Handling]:** Attackers exploit the way pipeline parameters are handled to inject and execute malicious commands during pipeline execution.
    *   **Identify Exposed Pipeline Parameters:** Discovering pipeline parameters that are exposed and can be manipulated.
    *   **Manipulate Parameter Values:** Providing malicious input as parameter values that, when processed by the pipeline, result in the execution of unintended commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Secrets Management Used by Pipelines -> Steal Secrets from Pipeline Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_secrets_management_used_by_pipelines_-_steal_secrets_from_pipeline_environment.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Steal Secrets from Pipeline Environment [CRITICAL NODE: Pipeline Runtime Environment]:** Attackers attempt to retrieve sensitive secrets directly from the environment where the pipeline is running.
    *   **Access Environment Variables Containing Secrets:**  Accessing environment variables within the pipeline container that might contain secrets.
    *   **Read Secret Files on Pipeline Workers:** Gaining access to the file system of the pipeline worker node to read files where secrets might be stored.

*   **Attack Vectors related to Critical Node: Secret Management System:**
    *   **Manipulate Secret Storage [CRITICAL NODE: Secret Management System]:** Attackers target the central system responsible for storing and managing secrets.
        *   **Gain Access to Secret Management System (e.g., Vault, Kubernetes Secrets):** Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the secret management system to gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Modify or Replace Existing Secrets:** Once access is gained, attackers can modify or replace existing secrets, potentially compromising other systems that rely on them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Kubernetes/OpenShift Permissions Granted to Pipelines -> Escalate Privileges within the Cluster](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_kubernetesopenshift_permissions_granted_to_pipelines_-_escalate_privileges_within_the_cluster.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Escalate Privileges within the Cluster [CRITICAL NODE: Pipeline Service Account Permissions]:** Attackers leverage the permissions granted to the pipeline's service account to gain broader access within the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.
    *   **Leverage Service Account Permissions:**  Using the existing permissions of the service account to perform actions beyond the intended scope, potentially gaining access to sensitive resources or the ability to create new, more privileged resources.
    *   **Exploit Misconfigured RBAC Roles:** Identifying and exploiting overly permissive or incorrectly configured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles associated with the pipeline's service account.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate or Compromise External Dependencies of Pipelines -> Compromise Container Images Used in Pipelines](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_or_compromise_external_dependencies_of_pipelines_-_compromise_container_images_used_in_pi_18e49101.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Compromise Container Images Used in Pipelines [CRITICAL NODE: Container Image Supply Chain]:** Attackers target the container images used by the pipelines to introduce malicious code.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Base Images:** Compromising base images used in the pipeline's container builds, ensuring that the malicious code is included in all derived images.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Container Registries:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the container registry to push malicious images or modify existing legitimate images.
