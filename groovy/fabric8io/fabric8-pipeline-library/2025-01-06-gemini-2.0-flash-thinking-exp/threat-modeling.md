# Threat Model Analysis for fabric8io/fabric8-pipeline-library

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection in Pipeline Definitions](./threats/malicious_code_injection_in_pipeline_definitions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code (e.g., shell commands, scripts) into pipeline definitions. The `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s **Pipeline Definition Parsing and Execution Engine** would then interpret and execute this malicious code as part of the pipeline. This could occur if the library doesn't properly sanitize or validate pipeline definitions.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary commands on the CI/CD system or within the target Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster. This could lead to data exfiltration, resource manipulation, denial of service, or deployment of compromised applications.

**Affected Component:** Pipeline Definition Parsing and Execution Engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization within the `fabric8-pipeline-library` for all pipeline parameters and scripts.
* The library should enforce the use of parameterized tasks and restrict or carefully control the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

## Threat: [Tampering with Pipeline Steps](./threats/tampering_with_pipeline_steps.md)

**Description:** An attacker could modify existing pipeline steps, and the `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s **Pipeline Execution Engine** would execute these tampered steps. This could involve introducing vulnerable dependencies or malicious build steps that the library orchestrates.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into deployed applications, leading to potential security breaches, data compromise, or system instability.

**Affected Component:** Pipeline Execution Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* The `fabric8-pipeline-library` should provide mechanisms to verify the integrity of pipeline steps before execution.
* Integrate with security scanning tools within the library's workflow to detect potential issues in pipeline steps.

## Threat: [Excessive Permissions Granted to Pipeline Execution (due to library configuration)](./threats/excessive_permissions_granted_to_pipeline_execution__due_to_library_configuration_.md)

**Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s **Kubernetes/OpenShift Integration Module** might be designed or configured in a way that grants overly broad permissions to the pipeline execution context within the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster by default. If a pipeline is compromised through the library, the attacker could leverage these excessive permissions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources within the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, potential data breaches, or manipulation of critical infrastructure components.

**Affected Component:** Kubernetes/OpenShift Integration Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* The `fabric8-pipeline-library` should adhere to the principle of least privilege and allow users to configure granular permissions for pipeline execution.
* Provide clear documentation and guidance on how to configure secure RBAC settings when using the library.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Kubernetes/OpenShift Credentials](./threats/insecure_handling_of_kubernetesopenshift_credentials.md)

**Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library`'s **Kubernetes/OpenShift Credential Management** might store or transmit Kubernetes/OpenShift credentials (e.g., API tokens, kubeconfig files) insecurely. Vulnerabilities in how the library manages these credentials could allow an attacker to retrieve them.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, allowing the attacker to perform any action within the cluster.

**Affected Component:** Kubernetes/OpenShift Credential Management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* The `fabric8-pipeline-library` should leverage secure secrets management solutions (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets API) for storing Kubernetes/OpenShift credentials.
* Avoid storing credentials directly within the library's configuration or in environment variables accessible to the pipeline.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in the Library Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_library_itself.md)

**Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library` itself might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code within the pipeline execution environment orchestrated by the library.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the CI/CD pipeline and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** Various components of the `fabric8-pipeline-library`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `fabric8-pipeline-library` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* The developers of the library should follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `fabric8-pipeline-library` relies on various dependencies. If these dependencies have known high or critical severity vulnerabilities, they could be exploited through the library.

**Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities within the library itself, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure within the context of the pipeline execution.

**Affected Component:** Dependency Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* The developers of the `fabric8-pipeline-library` should regularly scan their dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
* Users of the library should also be aware of their dependency tree and update the library when necessary.
