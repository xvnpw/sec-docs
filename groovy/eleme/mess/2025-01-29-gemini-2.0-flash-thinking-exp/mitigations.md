## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Input Validation and Sanitization for Message Payloads (in `mess` context)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_input_validation_and_sanitization_for_message_payloads__in__mess__context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Input Validation and Sanitization for Message Payloads (in `mess` context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Message Schemas:** Create clear and strict schemas for all message types published and consumed via `mess`. Document these schemas thoroughly to guide developers using `mess`.
    2.  **Implement Validation at Producer (before `mess.publish`):** Before publishing a message using `mess.publish()`, validate the message payload against the defined schema. Reject messages that do not conform to the schema *before* they are sent to `mess`. Log validation failures for monitoring and debugging related to message publishing via `mess`.
    3.  **Implement Validation at Consumer (after `mess.consume`):** Immediately after receiving a message from `mess` in your consumer application (within the `mess.consume()` callback), validate the message payload again against the defined schema. Reject invalid messages *received from `mess`* and implement appropriate error handling (e.g., logging, moving to a dead-letter queue using `mess` if implemented).
    4.  **Sanitize Data (after `mess.consume`):** If message payloads *received from `mess`* are used in contexts susceptible to injection attacks, sanitize the data after validation but before processing. Ensure sanitization is applied to data *after it has been retrieved from `mess`*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** SQL Injection, Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if message data *transported by `mess`* is used in web contexts. Malicious payloads can be injected via messages and exploited by consumers if not validated and sanitized *after being received from `mess`*.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Malformed messages *sent via `mess`* can lead to incorrect data processing and corruption.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior (Medium Severity):** Invalid data *received from `mess`* can cause application crashes, errors, or unpredictable behavior in consumers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing malicious code or commands from being injected through message payloads *handled by `mess`*.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring data *sent and received via `mess`* conforms to expected formats.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior:** Moderately reduces the risk by filtering out invalid data *processed after retrieval from `mess`*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, input validation is implemented in the message publishing service using JSON Schema validation before messages are sent to `mess`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input validation and sanitization are partially implemented in message consumers *after receiving messages from `mess`*, but sanitization for specific contexts is missing. Validation against schema needs to be enforced more strictly in all consumers *handling messages from `mess`*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Message Size Limits (in `mess` publishing)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_message_size_limits__in__mess__publishing_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Message Size Limits (in `mess` publishing)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Acceptable Limits:** Analyze application requirements and infrastructure to determine reasonable maximum message sizes for messages published via `mess`.
    2.  **Implement Limit at Producer (before `mess.publish`):** Before publishing a message using `mess.publish()`, check the size of the message payload. If it exceeds the defined limit, reject the message *before calling `mess.publish()`* and log the rejection.
    3.  **Document Limits:** Clearly document the message size limits for developers using `mess` to publish messages.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Messages (High Severity):** Attackers can attempt to publish extremely large messages via `mess`, overwhelming Redis or consumers.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Large messages *published via `mess`* can consume excessive resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Messages:** Significantly reduces the risk by preventing the queue from being flooded with oversized messages *published through `mess`*.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Moderately reduces the risk by limiting the resource consumption associated with individual messages *published via `mess`*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, message size limits are implemented in the message publishing service. Messages larger than 1MB are rejected before being sent to `mess`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Message size limits are not explicitly enforced at the consumer level *after receiving messages from `mess`*. While less critical, consumers could also check message sizes as a secondary defense.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize TLS/SSL for Redis Connections (configured in `mess` client)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_tlsssl_for_redis_connections__configured_in__mess__client_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize TLS/SSL for Redis Connections (configured in `mess` client)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `mess` Client for TLS:** When initializing the `mess` client in your application, configure it to connect to Redis using TLS/SSL. This involves specifying connection parameters within the `mess` client configuration that enable TLS and point to necessary certificate files or configurations. Consult the `mess` library documentation for TLS configuration details.
    2.  **Verify TLS Connection:** After implementing TLS configuration in `mess`, verify that the connection between your application and Redis *established by `mess`* is indeed encrypted. Use network monitoring tools or Redis commands to confirm TLS is active for `mess` connections.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Data Interception (High Severity):** Unencrypted communication *by `mess`* between the application and Redis allows attackers to intercept message data in transit.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Without TLS for `mess` connections, attackers can intercept and potentially modify communication.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Data Interception:** Significantly reduces the risk by encrypting communication *handled by `mess`*, making it extremely difficult to intercept message data.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Significantly reduces the risk by establishing a secure channel *for `mess` communication*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, TLS/SSL is enabled for Redis connections in the production environment for all services using `mess`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** TLS/SSL is not consistently enforced in development and testing environments for `mess` connections. It should be enabled across all environments for consistent security posture of `mess` usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Message Signing or Integrity Checks (integrated with `mess` messages)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_message_signing_or_integrity_checks__integrated_with__mess__messages_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Message Signing or Integrity Checks (integrated with `mess` messages)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Signing Mechanism:** Select a signing mechanism like HMAC or digital signatures.
    2.  **Generate Signing Keys:** Generate secure keys for message signing.
    3.  **Implement Signing at Producer (before `mess.publish`):** In the message producer, before publishing a message using `mess.publish()`, calculate the signature of the message payload. Include the signature in the message metadata or as part of the payload itself *that is then published via `mess`*. Ensure the signature is part of the data structure `mess` handles.
    4.  **Implement Verification at Consumer (after `mess.consume`):** In the message consumer, after receiving a message from `mess` (within `mess.consume()`), extract the signature and payload. Recalculate the signature. Verify the signatures match *for messages received from `mess`*. Reject invalid messages.
    5.  **Consider Nonce/Timestamp:** To mitigate replay attacks, include a nonce or timestamp in the message payload *published via `mess`* and incorporate it into the signature calculation. Consumers should verify nonce/timestamp validity *of messages received from `mess`*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Message Tampering (High Severity):** Malicious actors could modify messages in the queue *after they are published by `mess` but before consumption*.
    *   **Message Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** Attackers could replay previously captured valid messages *published and consumed via `mess`*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Message Tampering:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring message integrity for messages *handled by `mess`*.
    *   **Message Replay Attacks:** Moderately reduces the risk for messages *processed via `mess`* if combined with nonce/timestamp verification.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, message signing or integrity checks are not currently implemented in the project for messages handled by `mess`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Message signing should be implemented in all message producers *before using `mess.publish()`* and verification in all message consumers *after receiving messages from `mess`* to ensure end-to-end message integrity within the `mess` workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Resource Limits for Message Consumers (using `mess` consumer options)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_resource_limits_for_message_consumers__using__mess__consumer_options_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Resource Limits for Message Consumers (using `mess` consumer options)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Resource Constraints:** Analyze consumer application resource limitations.
    2.  **Implement Concurrency Limits (using `mess` configuration):** Configure `mess` consumers to limit concurrent message processing tasks. Utilize `mess`'s consumer configuration options (if available) to set concurrency limits. This directly controls how `mess` consumers operate.
    3.  **Implement Timeouts (within `mess.consume` callback):** Set timeouts for message processing within the `mess.consume()` callback function. If processing takes too long *within the `mess` consumer*, consider it a failure.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Consumer Overload/Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Slow consumers can be overloaded when using `mess`.
    *   **Queue Buildup/Message Loss (Medium Severity):** If `mess` consumers are slow, queue buildup can occur.
    *   **Cascading Failures (Medium Severity):** A failing `mess` consumer can impact the system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Consumer Overload/Resource Exhaustion:** Moderately reduces the risk by preventing `mess` consumers from being overwhelmed.
    *   **Queue Buildup/Message Loss:** Moderately reduces the risk by ensuring `mess` consumers process messages sustainably.
    *   **Cascading Failures:** Minimally to Moderately reduces the risk by managing `mess` consumer resources.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Concurrency limits are partially implemented in some message consumers *configured via `mess`*. Timeouts are not consistently configured within `mess.consume()` callbacks.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Timeouts should be implemented in all `mess.consume()` callbacks. Concurrency limits need review and adjustment for all `mess` consumers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) and Error Handling (within `mess` workflow)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_dead_letter_queues__dlqs__and_error_handling__within__mess__workflow_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) and Error Handling (within `mess` workflow)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure DLQ in `mess` (If Supported):** Check if `mess` provides built-in DLQ support. If so, configure `mess` to automatically move messages to a DLQ after processing failures. Utilize `mess`'s DLQ features if available.
    2.  **Implement DLQ Logic Manually (If No Built-in `mess` Support):** If `mess` lacks built-in DLQ, implement DLQ logic manually in your consumer application *that uses `mess`*. When message processing fails after retries *within the `mess.consume()` callback*, publish the message to a separate "dead-letter" queue *using `mess.publish()`*.
    3.  **Implement Retry Mechanism (within `mess.consume` callback):** Configure a retry mechanism in your consumer application *within the `mess.consume()` callback* for transient errors. Limit retries before considering a message as failed *within the `mess` consumer logic*.
    4.  **Implement DLQ Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up monitoring for the DLQ *queue used by `mess` for dead letters* to track message accumulation. Implement alerting for DLQ size thresholds.
    5.  **Implement DLQ Processing/Analysis:** Regularly review and process messages in the DLQ *related to `mess`* to understand processing failures.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Message Loss (Medium Severity):** Without DLQs in the `mess` workflow, messages can be lost.
    *   **Repeated Processing Failures (Medium Severity):** Without DLQs and error handling in `mess` consumers, repeated failures can occur.
    *   **Lack of Visibility into Processing Errors (Low Severity):** Without DLQ monitoring for `mess` messages, error visibility is limited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Message Loss:** Moderately reduces the risk by preventing message loss in the `mess` workflow.
    *   **Repeated Processing Failures:** Moderately reduces the risk by managing retries and DLQs within the `mess` context.
    *   **Lack of Visibility into Processing Errors:** Moderately reduces the risk by improving error observability for messages handled by `mess`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic error handling and retry mechanisms are implemented in message consumers *using `mess`*. Dedicated Dead Letter Queues *integrated with `mess`* are not yet implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Dead Letter Queues need to be implemented for all critical message types *within the `mess` workflow*. DLQ monitoring and alerting are also missing and should be set up for `mess` DLQs.
