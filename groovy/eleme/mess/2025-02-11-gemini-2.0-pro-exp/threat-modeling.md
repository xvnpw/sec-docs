# Threat Model Analysis for eleme/mess

## Threat: [Misuse for Security-Critical Operations](./threats/misuse_for_security-critical_operations.md)

**Threat:** Misuse for Security-Critical Operations

    *   **Description:** Developers incorrectly use `mess` for tasks requiring cryptographic security, such as generating unique identifiers, session tokens, or encryption keys. `mess` is *not* a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). Its output is not suitable for any security-sensitive purpose.
    *   **Impact:** Weak security, predictable identifiers, potential for spoofing, session hijacking, or other attacks that rely on the unpredictability of random values. Attackers could easily predict "random" values and compromise the system.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `mess` function (misused).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Never* use `mess` for generating anything requiring cryptographic security. This is the most important mitigation.
        *   Use a dedicated CSPRNG (e.g., `crypto.getRandomValues()` in modern browsers, or a suitable library in Node.js) and established cryptographic libraries for such tasks.
        *   Educate developers about the appropriate use of `mess` (shuffling only) and the critical importance of using proper cryptographic tools for security. Code reviews should flag any misuse.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure - Shuffled Array Exposure (When Containing Sensitive Data)](./threats/information_disclosure_-_shuffled_array_exposure__when_containing_sensitive_data_.md)

**Threat:** Information Disclosure - Shuffled Array Exposure (When Containing Sensitive Data)

    *   **Description:** The shuffled array, *if it contains sensitive data*, is exposed to unauthorized parties. This could happen through debugging endpoints, error messages, client-side JavaScript, or insecure logging. The exposure is a direct consequence of how the *output* of `mess` is handled.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of confidential information, potentially violating privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) or exposing internal application secrets. The severity depends entirely on the sensitivity of the data within the array.
    *   **Affected Component:** The output (shuffled array) of the `mess` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if the array contains sensitive data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Never* expose the raw shuffled array to the client if it contains sensitive information. This is paramount. Process the shuffled array server-side and only return the *necessary* results to the client, and only if the client is authorized to see them.
        *   Avoid logging the full shuffled array if it contains sensitive data. Log a secure hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the array instead, or a redacted version that omits the sensitive parts.
        *   Thoroughly review error handling mechanisms to ensure that sensitive data is *never* leaked in error messages, regardless of the error's cause.
        *   Restrict access to debugging endpoints and logs to authorized personnel only. Implement strong authentication and authorization controls.
