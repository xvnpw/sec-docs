## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) on mess Communication [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos__on_mess_communication__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:**  Attacks aimed at making the `mess` communication unavailable to legitimate users.

    *   **1.1 Flood the Message Queue [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Overwhelm the message queue with a large number of messages or excessively large messages, preventing legitimate messages from being processed.

        *   **1.1.1 Exploit Lack of Rate Limiting (if present) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  If `mess` doesn't limit the rate at which messages can be sent, an attacker can flood the queue with a high volume of messages.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (if no rate limiting is implemented)
            *   **Impact:** High (application unavailability)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (high traffic, queue buildup)
            *   **Action:** Implement rate limiting and queue size limits.

        *   **1.1.2 Exploit Large Message Sizes (if unbounded) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** If `mess` doesn't limit the size of individual messages, an attacker can send very large messages to consume resources and potentially crash the system.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on application usage and whether large messages are expected)
            *   **Impact:** High (resource exhaustion, potential crash)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (large messages visible in logs or network monitoring)
            *   **Action:** Enforce maximum message size limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Message Manipulation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__message_manipulation__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Attacks that involve intercepting, modifying, replaying, or injecting messages to compromise data integrity or impersonate legitimate users.

    *   **2.1 Message Interception and Modification (Man-in-the-Middle) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  An attacker positions themselves between the sender and receiver of messages, allowing them to read, modify, or delete messages.

        *   **2.1.1 Exploit Lack of Encryption (if present) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** If messages are transmitted in plain text, an attacker can easily read their contents.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (if no encryption and network access is obtained)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (data compromise, confidentiality breach)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without network monitoring and intrusion detection)
            *   **Action:** Implement end-to-end encryption.

        *   **2.1.3 Exploit Lack of Authentication/Integrity Checks (if present) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  If messages don't have integrity checks (e.g., HMACs), an attacker can modify them without detection.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (if no authentication and network access is obtained)
            *   **Impact:** High (data modification, impersonation, integrity violation)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without specific monitoring for message alterations)
            *   **Action:** Implement message authentication and integrity checks (HMAC, digital signatures).

    *   **2.2 Message Replay**
        * **Description:** An attacker captures a legitimate message and resends it later, potentially causing unintended actions or data duplication.

        *   **2.2.1 Exploit Lack of Message Sequencing/Timestamping (if present) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** If messages don't have sequence numbers or timestamps, it's difficult to detect replayed messages.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on application logic and whether replay attacks are relevant)
            *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the application; could cause data corruption, duplicate actions, or unexpected behavior)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires application-level logic to detect out-of-order or duplicate messages)
            *   **Action:** Implement message sequencing or timestamping.

    *   **2.3 Message Injection [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends forged messages that appear to be from a legitimate source.

        *   **2.3.1 Exploit Lack of Sender Authentication [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** If the receiver doesn't verify the sender's identity, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate sender.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (if no sender authentication and network access is obtained)
            *   **Impact:** High (data corruption, impersonation, potential for unauthorized actions)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without specific monitoring for unauthorized senders)
            *   **Action:** Implement sender authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Unauthorized Access to Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__unauthorized_access_to_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Attacks that allow an attacker to gain access to data they are not authorized to see.

    *   **3.1 Eavesdropping (Passive Interception) [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:**  An attacker passively listens to network traffic to capture sensitive data transmitted via `mess`.

        *   **3.1.1 Exploit Lack of Encryption (if present) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  Identical to 2.1.1; if messages are unencrypted, they can be easily read.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (if no encryption and network access is obtained)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (data compromise, confidentiality breach)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without network monitoring)

    *   **3.2 Unauthorized Subscription/Access to Message Channels [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to message channels they are not authorized to access.

        *   **3.2.1 Exploit Lack of Access Control (if present) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** If `mess` doesn't enforce access control, any user can subscribe to any channel.
            *   **Likelihood:** High (if no access control is implemented)
            *   **Impact:** High (data leakage, potential for unauthorized actions)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (audit logs, access monitoring can reveal unauthorized subscriptions)
