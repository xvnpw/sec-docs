# Threat Model Analysis for eleme/mess

## Threat: [Malicious Deserialization leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_deserialization_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload that, when deserialized *by `mess`*, executes arbitrary code on the server. This directly exploits how `mess` handles incoming message data.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Affected Component:** Deserialization module/functionality within `mess` that handles incoming messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* passing data to `mess` for deserialization.
    *   Consider using safer serialization formats that are less prone to RCE vulnerabilities if configurable within `mess` or the application's usage of it.
    *   Keep the `mess` library and its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Implement sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential RCE.

## Threat: [Malicious Deserialization leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_deserialization_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted malicious payload that, when deserialized *by `mess`*, consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) leading to a denial of service. This directly exploits `mess`'s deserialization process.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or experiences significant performance degradation, impacting legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** Deserialization module/functionality within `mess` that handles incoming messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource limits for deserialization operations *within the application's usage of `mess`* (e.g., maximum object depth, maximum string length).
    *   Set timeouts for deserialization processes *when interacting with `mess`* to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   Monitor resource usage during message processing and implement alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Message Spoofing](./threats/message_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts messages that appear to originate from legitimate sources *within the `mess` communication channels*. This directly involves how `mess` handles and potentially trusts message origins.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed based on the spoofed message, data manipulation, bypassing authentication or authorization checks.
*   **Affected Component:** Message handling and routing logic within `mess`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for message producers and consumers *interacting with `mess`*.
    *   Utilize message signing (e.g., using HMAC or digital signatures) *integrated with `mess` if supported* to verify the integrity and origin of messages.
    *   Ensure proper authorization checks are in place *before `mess` processes messages*, verifying the sender's permissions.

## Threat: [Message Tampering](./threats/message_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts messages in transit and modifies their content before they are processed *by `mess`*. This directly affects the integrity of messages handled by the library.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect application behavior, unauthorized actions performed based on the tampered message.
*   **Affected Component:** Message transmission and reception within `mess`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use encryption for message transmission (e.g., TLS/SSL) to protect confidentiality and integrity *at the transport layer used by `mess`*.
    *   Implement message integrity checks (e.g., using checksums or HMAC) *within the message structure handled by `mess`* to detect tampering.
