# Attack Surface Analysis for eleme/mess

## Attack Surface: [Message Content Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/message_content_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** Malicious content within a message sent through `mess` is processed by a subscriber, leading to unintended consequences.
    * **How `mess` Contributes:** `mess` serves as the transport mechanism for these messages. Without proper sanitization of data received via `mess`, applications are vulnerable to malicious payloads.
    * **Example:** A message containing a crafted string is published. A subscriber uses this string in a database query without sanitization, leading to SQL injection.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, code execution on subscriber services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data received from `mess` before processing.
        * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
        * Apply context-aware encoding when using message content.

## Attack Surface: [Message Injection/Spoofing](./attack_surfaces/message_injectionspoofing.md)

* **Description:** Unauthorized entities inject arbitrary messages into the `mess` bus, potentially impersonating legitimate publishers or disrupting communication.
    * **How `mess` Contributes:** If `mess` lacks robust authentication or authorization at the transport level, or if the application doesn't implement its own verification, attackers can inject messages.
    * **Example:** An attacker publishes a message to a critical topic, triggering a system shutdown or unauthorized transaction, despite lacking permissions.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service, unauthorized actions, data manipulation, system instability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement authentication and authorization for message publishing (e.g., shared secrets, digital signatures).
        * Design application logic to verify the source and integrity of messages.

## Attack Surface: [Subscription Hijacking/Interception](./attack_surfaces/subscription_hijackinginterception.md)

* **Description:** Unauthorized access to messages intended for other subscribers is gained by subscribing to restricted topics.
    * **How `mess` Contributes:** If `mess` doesn't enforce proper access control on subscriptions, or if the application's subscription management is flawed, attackers can eavesdrop.
    * **Example:** An attacker subscribes to a topic containing sensitive user data exchanged between services, gaining unauthorized access.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, information disclosure, potential for further attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement granular access control for subscriptions, allowing only authorized components to subscribe to specific topics.
        * Minimize the transmission of sensitive data over the message bus if possible.
        * Consider encrypting sensitive message payloads before publishing.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Custom Serialization Used)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_custom_serialization_used_.md)

* **Description:** Malicious serialized payloads sent via `mess` lead to code execution or other vulnerabilities upon deserialization by a subscriber.
    * **How `mess` Contributes:** `mess` carries the serialized data. The vulnerability arises from insecure deserialization practices after receiving the message through `mess`.
    * **Example:** An attacker publishes a message with a malicious serialized object. Deserializing this object triggers arbitrary code execution on the subscriber's system.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, complete compromise of subscriber services.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid custom serialization if possible; prefer secure formats like JSON.
        * If custom serialization is necessary, implement robust security measures to prevent deserialization of untrusted data.
        * Regularly update serialization libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
