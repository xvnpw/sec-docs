## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to RCE](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_deserialization_of_untrusted_data_leading_to_rce.md)

*   Compromise Application Using mess [CRITICAL]: The attacker's ultimate goal.
*   Exploit Deserialization of Untrusted Data [CRITICAL]: The attacker targets the deserialization process as the entry point.
*   Application Deserializes Without Proper Validation [CRITICAL]: The application fails to validate the integrity and safety of the serialized data before processing it.
*   Inject Malicious Serialized Payload (e.g., Gadget Chains) [CRITICAL]: The attacker injects a crafted serialized payload designed to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   Craft a payload that leverages these classes for malicious actions (e.g., RCE) [CRITICAL]: The attacker successfully crafts a payload that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Gaining Unauthorized Access to Stored Serialized Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_gaining_unauthorized_access_to_stored_serialized_data.md)

*   Compromise Application Using mess [CRITICAL]: The attacker's ultimate goal.
*   Exploit Insecure Handling of Serialized Data: The attacker targets how the application manages serialized data at rest.
*   Storage Mechanism is Insecure: The system used to store serialized data has security weaknesses.
*   Gain unauthorized access to the storage location [CRITICAL]: The attacker successfully bypasses security measures to access the storage containing serialized data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in `mess` leading to Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in__mess__leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   Compromise Application Using mess [CRITICAL]: The attacker's ultimate goal.
*   Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `mess` Library Itself: The attacker focuses on flaws within the `mess` library.
*   Application Uses Vulnerable Version of `mess`: The application is running an outdated version of the library with known security issues.
*   Craft an exploit leveraging the identified vulnerability [CRITICAL]: The attacker develops and executes an exploit that takes advantage of the specific vulnerability in the `mess` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Information Disclosure leading to Leak of Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_information_disclosure_leading_to_leak_of_sensitive_information.md)

*   Compromise Application Using mess [CRITICAL]: The attacker's ultimate goal.
*   Information Disclosure via Serialized Data: The attacker aims to extract sensitive information exposed through serialized data.
*   Lack of Proper Sanitization/Filtering: The application fails to remove or mask sensitive information before exposing serialized data.
*   Leak Sensitive Information: The attacker successfully obtains sensitive data that was present in the exposed serialized data.
