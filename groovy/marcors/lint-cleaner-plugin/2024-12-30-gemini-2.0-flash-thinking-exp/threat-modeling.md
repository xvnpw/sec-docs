* Threat: Malicious Code Injection via Plugin Vulnerability
    * Description: An attacker identifies a security flaw within the `lint-cleaner-plugin`'s code. They craft a malicious input or exploit a vulnerability that allows them to inject arbitrary code into the codebase during the plugin's automated fixing process. This could involve manipulating the plugin's parsing logic or exploiting insecure handling of code transformations.
    * Impact: Successful injection of malicious code can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including remote code execution on the server or client-side, data exfiltration, unauthorized access to resources, and complete compromise of the application.
    * Affected Component: Core plugin logic, specifically the code transformation and application modules.
    * Risk Severity: Critical
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Keep the `lint-cleaner-plugin` updated to the latest version.
        * Monitor for security advisories related to the plugin.
        * Consider using static analysis tools to scan the plugin's code.
        * Implement code reviews for any changes made by the plugin.
        * Isolate the plugin's execution environment with limited privileges.

* Threat: Introduction of Logic Errors or Security Vulnerabilities through Automated Fixes
    * Description: The plugin's automated fixes, while intended to improve code quality, inadvertently introduce logical errors or security vulnerabilities. This can happen if the plugin's rules are flawed, too aggressive, or don't fully understand the context of the code being modified. An attacker could then exploit these newly introduced vulnerabilities.
    * Impact: Introduction of vulnerabilities can lead to various security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, or business logic flaws, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service. Logic errors can cause application malfunctions and unexpected behavior.
    * Affected Component: Code fixing modules within the plugin, and the linters it utilizes.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Carefully review the plugin's configuration and the linters it uses.
        * Implement thorough testing (unit, integration, and security testing) after the plugin's execution.
        * Use a version control system to track changes made by the plugin and allow for easy rollback.
        * Consider using a "dry run" mode of the plugin to review changes before applying them.
        * Implement human review of the changes made by the plugin, especially for critical sections of code.

* Threat: Configuration Tampering Leading to Malicious Code Changes
    * Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the plugin's configuration files or settings. They modify the configuration to introduce malicious fixes, disable security-related linting rules, or point to compromised linter configurations. This allows them to inject vulnerable code without triggering warnings or to introduce backdoors.
    * Impact:  Malicious code changes can lead to the same severe consequences as direct code injection (remote code execution, data breaches, etc.). Disabling security linters can allow the introduction of known vulnerabilities into the codebase.
    * Affected Component: Plugin configuration management and loading modules.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Secure the plugin's configuration files with appropriate access controls.
        * Avoid storing sensitive configuration data in plain text. Use environment variables or secure vault solutions.
        * Implement monitoring and alerting for changes to the plugin's configuration.
        * Use a configuration management system with version control for the plugin's settings.

* Threat: Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Plugin Dependency
    * Description: The `lint-cleaner-plugin` relies on external dependencies (libraries, other plugins). If any of these dependencies are compromised by an attacker, malicious code could be introduced into the plugin's functionality, indirectly leading to vulnerabilities in the application's codebase.
    * Impact:  A compromised dependency can introduce any type of malicious behavior, including code injection, data exfiltration, or denial of service, impacting the security of the application using the plugin.
    * Affected Component: Dependency management and loading mechanisms within the plugin.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Regularly audit the plugin's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.
        * Pin dependency versions to avoid automatically using vulnerable updates.
        * Consider using a software bill of materials (SBOM) to track and manage dependencies.
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies using checksums or signatures.
