Okay, here's the focused attack subtree with only the High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes, along with a detailed breakdown:

**Threat Model: Compromising Application via lint-cleaner-plugin (Focused on High-Risk)**

**Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code within the developer's environment or introduce malicious code into the application's codebase through the `lint-cleaner-plugin`.

                    └─── Exfiltrate sensitive information from the project **(High-Risk Path)**
```

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Influence Plugin Behavior (Critical Node):**

*   This represents the attacker's overarching goal of manipulating how the plugin operates to achieve their malicious objectives. Success here often unlocks further attack opportunities.

**Supply Malicious Configuration (High-Risk Path):**

*   This path involves providing the plugin with a crafted configuration file designed to execute malicious actions.
    *   **Supply Malicious `.lint-cleaner.yml` (Critical Node):** The configuration file itself is the key entry point for this attack.
        *   **Modify `.lint-cleaner.yml` to execute arbitrary commands -> Inject malicious commands into `fix` or `ignore` patterns (High-Risk Path):** If the plugin interprets configuration values as commands, attackers can inject malicious commands that will be executed within the context of the developer's environment.

**Influence Linting Process:**

*   **If plugin allows execution of custom linters or scripts (Critical Node):** This feature, if present, allows attackers to introduce their own code that will be executed during the linting process.
*   **Manipulate Project Files to Trigger Malicious Fixes (High-Risk Path):**
    *   **Exploit predictable or insecure fix patterns in the plugin (Critical Node):** By understanding how the plugin automatically fixes code, attackers can craft code that, when "fixed," introduces malicious elements.

**Exploit Plugin's Dependency Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**

*   **If plugin uses vulnerable libraries for parsing, file operations, etc. (Critical Node):**  Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in the plugin's dependencies to gain unauthorized access or execute code.

**Leverage Plugin's File System Access (Critical Node):**

*   This represents attacks that exploit the plugin's ability to interact with the file system.
    *   **Write Malicious Files (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in path handling or file writing logic (Critical Node):** Weaknesses in how the plugin handles file paths or writes data can be exploited to write malicious files to arbitrary locations.
            *   **Overwrite critical application files with malicious content (High-Risk Path):** A severe outcome where attackers replace legitimate application files with malicious ones.
    *   **Modify Existing Files Maliciously (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Exploit insecure string manipulation or code generation during fixes (Critical Node):** Vulnerabilities in how the plugin modifies code can be used to inject malicious code into existing files.
            *   **Introduce backdoors or vulnerabilities into the application code (High-Risk Path):** The result of successfully exploiting insecure code modification.

**Abuse Plugin's Execution Context:**

*   **Exploit Plugin's Permissions within the IDE (Critical Node):** This involves leveraging the permissions the plugin has within the IDE environment.
    *   **Leverage plugin's access to IDE APIs for malicious actions -> If plugin has excessive permissions (e.g., file system access, network access) (Critical Node):** If the plugin has more permissions than necessary, it expands the attack surface.
        *   **Exfiltrate sensitive information from the project (High-Risk Path):**  If the plugin has file system or network access, it can be abused to steal sensitive data.

This focused view highlights the most critical areas to address when securing applications using the `lint-cleaner-plugin`. Prioritizing mitigation efforts on these high-risk paths and critical nodes will provide the most significant security improvements.
