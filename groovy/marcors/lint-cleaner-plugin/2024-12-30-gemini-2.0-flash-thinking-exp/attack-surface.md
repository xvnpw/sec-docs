Here are the high and critical attack surface elements that directly involve the `lint-cleaner-plugin`:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Code Injection via Lint Rules
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates lint configurations or introduces malicious custom lint rules that, when processed by the plugin, inject harmful code into project files.
    *   **How lint-cleaner-plugin Contributes:** The plugin automatically applies fixes suggested by linting tools. If these suggestions are based on malicious rules, the plugin will unknowingly inject the malicious code.
    *   **Example:** A malicious custom lint rule is added that, when "fixed" by the plugin, appends a script to the `build.gradle` file that downloads and executes arbitrary code during the next build.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the build environment, developer machines, and potentially the deployed application. Could lead to data theft, malware installation, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control and review all lint configurations and custom lint rules used in the project.
        *   Implement code review processes for any changes to lint configurations.
        *   Use trusted and well-vetted lint rule sets.
        *   Consider static analysis tools to scan lint configurations for suspicious patterns.

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Modification
    *   **Description:** The plugin, while modifying files based on lint output, might be vulnerable to path traversal if it doesn't properly sanitize file paths provided by the linting tools. This could allow modification of files outside the intended project scope.
    *   **How lint-cleaner-plugin Contributes:** The plugin directly interacts with the file system based on paths provided by external linting tools. If these paths are not validated, the plugin could be tricked into modifying arbitrary files.
    *   **Example:** A manipulated lint output suggests fixing an issue in a file path like `../../../../etc/passwd`, leading the plugin to attempt to modify a critical system file.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential modification or deletion of sensitive system files, leading to system instability or compromise. Could also affect other projects on the same machine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the plugin uses secure file path handling mechanisms, validating and sanitizing all paths received from linting tools.
        *   Implement strict permission controls on the build environment to limit the plugin's access.
        *   Regularly audit the plugin's code for path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Plugin
    *   **Description:** A malicious actor compromises the `lint-cleaner-plugin` itself (e.g., through a compromised maintainer account or a vulnerability in its dependencies), distributing a malicious version.
    *   **How lint-cleaner-plugin Contributes:** By being a dependency in the build process, a compromised plugin can execute arbitrary code or perform malicious actions during the build.
    *   **Example:** A compromised version of the plugin is released that, upon execution, exfiltrates environment variables containing sensitive credentials or injects malware into the build output.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the build environment, developer machines, and potentially the deployed application. Can lead to data breaches, malware distribution, and reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the plugin and its dependencies.
        *   Pin the plugin version in your build configuration to avoid automatically updating to a potentially compromised version.
        *   Monitor the plugin's repository for suspicious activity or changes.
        *   Consider using alternative, well-vetted linting and code formatting tools.
