# Threat Model Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

## Threat: [Malicious Module Injection](./threats/malicious_module_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Module Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities *within AppJoint's* module loading mechanism to introduce a malicious module into the application. This might involve manipulating configuration files *processed by AppJoint*, exploiting insecure file paths used *by AppJoint* for module discovery, or leveraging a lack of integrity checks *within AppJoint* on module files. The attacker's goal is to have their malicious code executed within the application's context *via AppJoint's loading process*.
    *   **Impact:** Successful injection of a malicious module could lead to complete compromise of the application, including data theft, unauthorized access, modification of data, or denial of service. The attacker could gain control over the application's functionality and potentially the underlying system *through the injected module loaded by AppJoint*.
    *   **Affected Component:** AppJoint's module loading mechanism, potentially AppJoint's configuration system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of module paths and configuration data *within AppJoint*.
        *   Utilize code signing or integrity checks *within AppJoint* to verify the authenticity and integrity of module files before loading.
        *   Restrict write access to module directories and configuration files to authorized users/processes only.
        *   Employ secure file storage practices for modules.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attack
    *   **Description:** If *AppJoint* relies on external sources (like package managers or internal repositories) to resolve module dependencies, an attacker could introduce a malicious module with the same name as a legitimate dependency. When *AppJoint* attempts to load the dependency, it might inadvertently load the attacker's malicious module instead.
    *   **Impact:** Loading a malicious dependency can have the same severe consequences as malicious module injection, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context and compromise its security and data *due to AppJoint's dependency resolution*.
    *   **Affected Component:** AppJoint's dependency resolution mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mechanisms *within AppJoint* to verify the source and integrity of dependencies.
        *   Utilize private or controlled repositories for module dependencies.
        *   Employ dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent and expected dependency versions are used.
        *   Regularly audit and scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Injection via Insecure Module Configuration](./threats/injection_via_insecure_module_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Injection via Insecure Module Configuration
    *   **Description:** If module configurations *processed by AppJoint* are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious code or configurations that are executed during module initialization or runtime *managed by AppJoint*. This could involve manipulating configuration files or exploiting vulnerabilities in how configuration data is processed *by AppJoint*.
    *   **Impact:** Successful injection via configuration can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the application's security and data *through AppJoint's configuration handling*.
    *   **Affected Component:** AppJoint's module configuration loading and processing mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all module configuration data *within AppJoint*.
        *   Avoid executing code directly from configuration files if possible.
        *   Use secure configuration formats and parsing libraries.
        *   Restrict write access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Lack of Module Isolation Leading to Cross-Module Compromise](./threats/lack_of_module_isolation_leading_to_cross-module_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Lack of Module Isolation Leading to Cross-Module Compromise
    *   **Description:** If *AppJoint* doesn't provide sufficient isolation between modules, a vulnerability in one module could be exploited to compromise other modules or the core application. This could involve shared memory access, insecure inter-module communication channels *facilitated by AppJoint*, or insufficient permission controls *within AppJoint's module management*.
    *   **Impact:** A successful attack on one module could cascade to other parts of the application, amplifying the impact and potentially leading to a full system compromise *due to the lack of isolation enforced by AppJoint*.
    *   **Affected Component:** AppJoint's inter-module communication mechanisms, module isolation features (if any).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong isolation between modules using operating system features (e.g., separate processes, containers) or language-level mechanisms.
        *   Enforce strict access control policies for inter-module communication.
        *   Minimize shared resources between modules.
        *   Regularly audit module interactions and dependencies.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in AppJoint Core](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_appjoint_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in AppJoint Core
    *   **Description:** Like any software library, *AppJoint itself* could contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws, logic errors). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to directly compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the core AppJoint library can have a widespread impact, potentially leading to complete application compromise, denial of service, or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The core AppJoint library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the AppJoint library up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Follow security best practices when integrating and using the AppJoint library.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to AppJoint.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration of AppJoint Itself](./threats/insecure_configuration_of_appjoint_itself.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Configuration of AppJoint Itself
    *   **Description:** If *AppJoint's own configuration* is not handled securely (e.g., storing sensitive information in plaintext, weak access controls to configuration files), attackers could exploit these weaknesses to gain control over the module loading process or other critical aspects of the application's behavior *managed by AppJoint*.
    *   **Impact:** Compromising AppJoint's configuration can allow attackers to inject malicious modules, manipulate application behavior, or gain unauthorized access *through AppJoint's compromised settings*.
    *   **Affected Component:** AppJoint's configuration system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive configuration data securely (e.g., using encryption).
        *   Implement strong access controls for AppJoint's configuration files.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in configuration files; use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions.
