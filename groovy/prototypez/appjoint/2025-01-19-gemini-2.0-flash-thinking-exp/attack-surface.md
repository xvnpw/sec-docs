# Attack Surface Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Configuration Source](./attack_surfaces/compromised_configuration_source.md)

*   **Description:** The source from which AppJoint loads its configuration (e.g., a JSON file, a remote API) is compromised, allowing an attacker to inject malicious module definitions.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:** AppJoint *directly* relies on this configuration to determine which modules to load and how to integrate them. If the source is compromised, AppJoint will blindly follow the malicious instructions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Git repository where the `appjoint.config.json` file is stored and modifies it to include a malicious JavaScript module hosted on their server. When the application loads, AppJoint fetches and executes this malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the client-side application, including:
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to session hijacking, data theft, and arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
        *   Redirection of users to phishing sites or malware distribution.
        *   Data exfiltration by sending sensitive information to attacker-controlled servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Storage: Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access controls.
        *   Integrity Checks: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the configuration data before loading (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
        *   Secure Transmission: If the configuration is fetched remotely, use HTTPS to protect it from eavesdropping and tampering.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Grant only necessary permissions to access and modify the configuration source.

## Attack Surface: [Loading Modules from Untrusted Sources](./attack_surfaces/loading_modules_from_untrusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:** AppJoint is configured to load micro-frontend modules from sources that are not adequately vetted or controlled, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:** AppJoint's core functionality is to *dynamically load and integrate modules based on the configuration*. If the configuration points to untrusted sources, AppJoint becomes the vehicle for delivering malicious content.
    *   **Example:** The `modules` section in the AppJoint configuration includes a URL pointing to a public, unverified CDN or a personal server controlled by an attacker. This server hosts a module with malicious JavaScript code that gets executed when the application loads.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to compromised configuration, this can lead to:
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
        *   Redirection to malicious sites.
        *   Data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict Module Sources:  Only allow loading modules from trusted and controlled sources (e.g., internal repositories, verified CDNs with Subresource Integrity).
        *   Subresource Integrity (SRI): Implement SRI tags in the HTML to ensure that fetched module files match the expected content, preventing tampering.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Configure a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the impact of loading from untrusted origins.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Integrity Checks for Loaded Modules](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_integrity_checks_for_loaded_modules.md)

*   **Description:** AppJoint does not verify the integrity of the modules it loads, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks or compromised hosting environments.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:** Without integrity checks, AppJoint *assumes* that the content fetched from the configured URLs is legitimate, even if it has been tampered with in transit or at the source.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the user's browser and the server hosting a legitimate micro-frontend module. They replace the legitimate module with a malicious one before it reaches the browser. AppJoint, lacking integrity checks, executes the malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code (XSS).
        *   Data manipulation.
        *   Compromise of user sessions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Subresource Integrity (SRI): As mentioned before, this is a crucial defense against this attack.
        *   HTTPS: Enforce HTTPS for all module loading to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks during transit.
        *   Code Signing: If feasible, implement a code signing mechanism for modules to verify their authenticity.
