## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Insecure Communication Channel](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_insecure_communication_channel.md)

* **1.1 Eavesdrop on Communication:**
    * **1.1.1 Lack of Encryption:**
        * **1.1.1.a Communication channel uses unencrypted protocol (e.g., plain HTTP, unencrypted WebSockets):**
            - Attack Step: Communication between native app and web app via AppJoint is transmitted without encryption.
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: High (Exposure of all transmitted data)
            - Effort: Low
            - Skill Level: Low
            - Detection Difficulty: Low
        * **1.1.1.b Encryption is improperly implemented or configured (e.g., weak ciphers, MITM vulnerabilities):**
            - Attack Step: Encryption is used, but weak ciphers are employed, or TLS/SSL is misconfigured allowing for Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
            - Likelihood: Medium
            - Impact: High (Exposure of transmitted data, MITM attacks)
            - Effort: Medium
            - Skill Level: Medium
            - Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * **1.2 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**
        * **1.2.1 Lack of Mutual Authentication:**
            * **1.2.1.a No client-side certificate verification:**
                - Attack Step: Server authenticates to the client, but the client does not verify the server's identity, allowing an attacker to impersonate the server.
                - Likelihood: Medium
                - Impact: High (MITM attacks, data interception and modification)
                - Effort: Medium
                - Skill Level: Medium
                - Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * **1.3 Replay Attacks:**
        * **1.3.2 Weak or No Message Signing:**
            * **1.3.2.a Messages are not digitally signed:**
                - Attack Step: Communication messages are not digitally signed, allowing an attacker to capture and replay valid messages for malicious purposes.
                - Likelihood: Medium
                - Impact: High (Replay of sensitive actions, potential financial or state manipulation)
                - Effort: Medium

                - Likelihood: Medium
                - Impact: High (SQL injection - data breach, system compromise; XSS - user compromise, session hijacking)
