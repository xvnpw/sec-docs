# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, AppJoint, is a framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of complex, modular applications. The primary business goal is to provide developers with a robust and extensible platform that reduces development time, promotes code reusability, and enhances application maintainability. This framework targets organizations that need to build and manage applications efficiently, especially those with evolving requirements and a need for adaptable systems.

Key business priorities are:
- Rapid application development and deployment.
- Increased developer productivity and efficiency.
- Enhanced application modularity and maintainability.
- Support for building scalable and extensible applications.
- Reduced long-term maintenance costs through code reusability and simplified architecture.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could be inherited by all applications built upon it, leading to widespread impact.
- Performance bottlenecks within the framework could limit the scalability and responsiveness of applications.
- Lack of adoption and developer support could render the framework ineffective and underutilized.
- Incompatibility issues with existing systems and technologies could hinder integration efforts.
- Complexity of the framework could lead to a steep learning curve and slow down initial development.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Repository hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. Implemented by: GitHub platform.
- security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and potential security contributions. Implemented by: Open-source nature of the project.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Prototype stage, implying security is not the primary focus initially, and vulnerabilities may exist.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security improvements, which may be inconsistent or delayed.
- accepted risk: Lack of formal security audits or penetration testing at this stage.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- recommended security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Define and document secure coding guidelines for framework development and application development using the framework.
- recommended security control: Implement input validation and output encoding mechanisms within the framework.
- recommended security control: Provide secure configuration management practices and guidance for applications built on the framework.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Applications built with AppJoint may require authentication. The framework should provide mechanisms or guidance for integrating authentication solutions.
  - Framework components and CLI tools should have appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms if they expose management interfaces.
- Authorization:
  - Applications built with AppJoint will need authorization controls. The framework should facilitate the implementation of role-based access control or other authorization models.
  - Access to framework configuration and management functions should be restricted based on roles and permissions.
- Input validation:
  - The framework must enforce or guide developers to implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
  - All external inputs to the framework and applications built with it should be validated.
- Cryptography:
  - The framework should provide secure cryptographic functions or libraries for applications that require encryption, hashing, or digital signatures.
  - Sensitive data handled by the framework itself, such as configuration secrets, should be encrypted at rest and in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Application development and deployment lifecycle.
- Operation of applications built using the AppJoint framework.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of the AppJoint framework and applications: Highly sensitive, as it contains intellectual property and potential vulnerabilities.
- Configuration data: Potentially sensitive, especially if it includes secrets, API keys, or database credentials.
- Application data: Sensitivity depends on the specific applications built with AppJoint. Could range from public data to highly confidential personal or financial information.
- Build artifacts and container images: Sensitive, as they represent the deployable application and could contain vulnerabilities if compromised.
- Logs and audit trails: Moderately sensitive, as they can contain information about system behavior and potential security incidents.
