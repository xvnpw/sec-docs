# Attack Surface Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Module Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_module_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code by exploiting vulnerabilities in AppJoint's module loading mechanism. This occurs when the application fails to adequately control the source and integrity of modules loaded by AppJoint.
*   **AppJoint Contribution:** AppJoint's dynamic module loading feature, designed for flexibility, becomes an attack vector if module sources and paths are not strictly validated and controlled by the application developer.
*   **Example:** An application uses user-provided input to dynamically determine module paths for AppJoint to load. An attacker injects a malicious path pointing to a compromised module. AppJoint, without sufficient validation in the application, loads and executes this malicious module, granting the attacker control within the application context.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, remote code execution, data theft, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Whitelist Module Sources:**  Configure AppJoint to only load modules from explicitly whitelisted and trusted sources (e.g., specific local directories, private repositories).
    *   **Implement Module Integrity Verification:**  Utilize mechanisms to verify the integrity of modules before AppJoint loads them. This can include checksum validation, code signing, or subresource integrity checks.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Module Paths from Untrusted Input:**  Never construct module paths based on unsanitized user input or data from untrusted external sources when using AppJoint's module loading.

## Attack Surface: [Event Injection and Spoofing within AppJoint Event System](./attack_surfaces/event_injection_and_spoofing_within_appjoint_event_system.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject or spoof events within AppJoint's inter-module event system to manipulate application logic or bypass security controls. This exploits the communication channel provided by AppJoint.
*   **AppJoint Contribution:** AppJoint's event-based communication, while enabling modularity, can be abused if event origins and data are not properly validated within modules and the application.
*   **Example:** A security-sensitive module in an AppJoint application relies on specific events for authorization decisions. An attacker, by compromising another less secure module or exploiting an injection point, crafts and injects a forged event that mimics a legitimate authorization event. The security module, trusting the AppJoint event system implicitly, grants unauthorized access based on the spoofed event.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Event Origin Validation:**  Within modules, validate the origin of events received through AppJoint's event system. Ensure modules only react to events originating from trusted modules or components.
    *   **Define and Enforce Event Schemas:**  Establish strict schemas for event data used in AppJoint applications. Validate event data against these schemas to prevent unexpected or malicious data injection through events.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Event Access:**  Restrict module access to the event system. Modules should only be able to subscribe to and publish events necessary for their intended functionality, minimizing the potential attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [DI Container Misconfiguration Leading to Unintended Service Exposure](./attack_surfaces/di_container_misconfiguration_leading_to_unintended_service_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit misconfigurations in AppJoint's Dependency Injection (DI) container to gain unauthorized access to services or resources managed by the container.
*   **AppJoint Contribution:** AppJoint's DI container manages dependencies and shared services for modules. Misconfigurations in how services are registered and accessed within AppJoint can lead to unintended exposure and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A sensitive service, intended for internal use within specific modules, is inadvertently registered in AppJoint's DI container with overly broad access permissions. An attacker, through a compromised or malicious module, leverages AppJoint's DI container to access and exploit this sensitive service, gaining unauthorized capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive services and data, privilege escalation, potential for further exploitation depending on the nature of the exposed service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure DI Container Configuration:**  Carefully configure AppJoint's DI container, adhering to the principle of least privilege.  Restrict service visibility and access to only those modules that genuinely require them.
    *   **Regularly Review DI Container Configuration:**  Periodically audit the DI container configuration to identify and rectify any unintended service exposures or overly permissive access settings.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Service Registration:** When registering services in AppJoint's DI container, explicitly define and enforce the scope and access permissions, ensuring services are only accessible where absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Practices Affecting AppJoint Functionality](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_practices_affecting_appjoint_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities arising from insecure storage or handling of configuration data that directly impacts AppJoint's core functionalities like module loading or event routing.
*   **AppJoint Contribution:** AppJoint relies on configuration to define module loading paths, event system behavior, and other framework-level settings. Insecure configuration management directly weakens the security posture of AppJoint-based applications.
*   **Example:** Configuration files for an AppJoint application, containing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials required by modules, are stored in a publicly accessible location or with insufficient access controls. An attacker gains access to these configuration files and retrieves sensitive credentials, potentially compromising the entire application and related systems.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, potential for full application compromise depending on the nature of exposed secrets and configuration settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Storage:**  Avoid storing sensitive configuration data in plain text files directly within the application codebase or deployment environment. Utilize secure configuration storage mechanisms like environment variables, dedicated secrets management systems, or encrypted configuration stores.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Data:** Implement strict access controls to configuration files and secrets, limiting access to only authorized personnel and processes.
    *   **Regularly Audit Configuration Security:**  Conduct periodic security audits of configuration practices and storage mechanisms to identify and remediate any insecure configurations related to AppJoint and its modules.
