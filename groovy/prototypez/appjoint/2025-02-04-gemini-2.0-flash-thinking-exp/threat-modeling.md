# Threat Model Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

## Threat: [Malicious Component Injection](./threats/malicious_component_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could replace a legitimate component with a malicious one during the component loading process. This might be achieved by compromising the component repository, intercepting network traffic during component download (MITM), or exploiting vulnerabilities in the component loading mechanism itself. The attacker's malicious component would then be executed within the application's context.
*   **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, data theft, data manipulation, denial of service, and potentially gaining control of user accounts or the server.
*   **Affected AppJoint Component:** Component Loading Mechanism, potentially the module responsible for fetching and registering components.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement component integrity checks using cryptographic signatures or checksums.
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all component downloads to prevent MITM attacks.
    *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict allowed component sources.
    *   Regularly audit and secure the component repository or source.

## Threat: [Component Dependency Confusion](./threats/component_dependency_confusion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a malicious component with the same name or identifier as a legitimate component in the component registry or dependency management system. When the application attempts to load the legitimate component, it might inadvertently load the attacker's malicious component instead.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code, data theft, data manipulation, denial of service, similar to malicious component injection.
*   **Affected AppJoint Component:** Component Registry/Dependency Management, the system responsible for resolving component names to their locations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure component registration processes with authentication and authorization.
    *   Use namespaces or prefixes for components to prevent naming collisions.
    *   Verify component sources and authors during registration and loading.
    *   Regularly audit the component registry for suspicious entries.

## Threat: [Insecure Component Delivery](./threats/insecure_component_delivery.md)

*   **Description:** Components are delivered over insecure HTTP connections instead of HTTPS. An attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can intercept the HTTP traffic and replace legitimate components with malicious ones before they reach the application.
*   **Impact:** Malicious component injection, leading to code execution and full application compromise.
*   **Affected AppJoint Component:** Component Loading Mechanism, specifically the network communication part.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS for all component delivery.** This is the primary and most crucial mitigation.
    *   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) if possible to further verify component integrity after download.
    *   Educate developers about the importance of using HTTPS for all network requests.

## Threat: [Message Spoofing and Tampering (Inter-Component Communication)](./threats/message_spoofing_and_tampering__inter-component_communication_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, potentially a malicious component or a compromised legitimate component, can send forged messages to other components, pretending to be a legitimate source. They can also intercept and modify messages in transit between components, altering the intended data or commands.
*   **Impact:** Application logic bypass, data corruption, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation if messages control critical functionalities, and potential denial of service.
*   **Affected AppJoint Component:** Inter-Component Communication System, the mechanism used for components to exchange data and events.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure communication channels between components, ideally using encryption and authentication.
    *   Use message signing to ensure message integrity and authenticity.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all inter-component messages to prevent malicious payloads.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for component communication permissions.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Component Access via Route Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_component_access_via_route_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates URL routes or routing parameters to bypass authorization checks and gain access to components or functionalities they are not authorized to use. This could involve directly crafting URLs or exploiting vulnerabilities in the routing logic.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive features, data, or administrative functions. Potential for privilege escalation and data breaches.
*   **Affected AppJoint Component:** Routing Mechanism, the module responsible for mapping URLs to components and handling navigation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization checks at the routing level, before components are loaded.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining route access and component permissions.
    *   Avoid exposing sensitive components or functionalities through easily guessable or predictable routes.
    *   Regularly audit route configurations for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Route Injection or Redirection](./threats/route_injection_or_redirection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious routes or redirects users to unintended components or external sites by manipulating user-controlled input that influences routing decisions (e.g., URL parameters, configuration). This can be exploited to access unauthorized components or functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to components, potential for privilege escalation, and redirection to malicious content.
*   **Affected AppJoint Component:** Routing Mechanism, specifically the part that handles dynamic route generation or user input related to routing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all user input that influences routing decisions.**
    *   Avoid dynamic route generation based on untrusted user input if possible.
    *   Implement proper URL encoding and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Use robust authorization checks to ensure routes only lead to authorized components based on user roles and permissions.
