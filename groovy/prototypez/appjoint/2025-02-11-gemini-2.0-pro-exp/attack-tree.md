## Attack Tree Path: [1. Escalate Privileges (Assume Host has Higher Privileges) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__escalate_privileges__assume_host_has_higher_privileges___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The overarching goal of this branch is to gain the privileges of the host application, which are assumed to be higher than those of the attacker-controlled joint application or environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities in `appjoint`'s IPC Handling](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in__appjoint_'s_ipc_handling.md)

This involves finding and exploiting flaws in how `appjoint` handles the inter-process communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1  `**[CRITICAL]**` Buffer Overflow in Message Parsing (Host or Joint) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1____critical___buffer_overflow_in_message_parsing__host_or_joint___high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1.1.1 Send oversized JSON payload to trigger overflow.**
    *   *Description:*  The attacker crafts a JSON payload that exceeds the buffer size allocated for message parsing in either the host or joint application. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* High
    *   *Effort:* Medium
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Type Confusion in Deserialization [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_type_confusion_in_deserialization__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1.3.1 Send unexpected JSON types to cause misinterpretation.**
    *   *Description:* The attacker sends a JSON payload with data types that are different from what the application expects.  This can cause the deserialization process to misinterpret the data, potentially leading to code execution or data corruption.  For example, sending a string where an integer is expected, or an object where an array is expected.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* High
    *   *Effort:* Medium
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 `**[CRITICAL]**` Inject Malicious Code into Joint Application [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2___critical___inject_malicious_code_into_joint_application__high-risk_.md)

This is a critical attack vector because if successful, the attacker gains complete control over the code that interacts with the host application's API.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 `**[CRITICAL]**` Supply Malicious Joint Application to User [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2___critical___supply_malicious_joint_application_to_user__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.2.2.1 Trick user into installing a compromised joint.**
    *   *Description:* The attacker uses social engineering or other methods (e.g., fake websites, malicious advertisements) to convince the user to download and install a joint application that contains malicious code.  This is a very direct and effective attack.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* Medium
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Leverage Host Application API for Privilege Escalation](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_leverage_host_application_api_for_privilege_escalation.md)

This involves using the legitimate API, but in ways that were not intended by the developers, to gain higher privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Call API Methods with Unexpected Parameters [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_call_api_methods_with_unexpected_parameters__high-risk_.md)

*   **1.3.1.1 Fuzz API inputs to discover vulnerabilities.**
    *   *Description:* The attacker uses a fuzzing tool to send a large number of requests to the API with various combinations of valid and invalid parameters.  The goal is to find inputs that cause unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* Medium to High
    *   *Effort:* Low
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Host Application Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_host_application_behavior.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Exploit Logic Flaws in the Host Application's API Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_exploit_logic_flaws_in_the_host_application's_api_implementation.md)

This involves finding and exploiting flaws in the *logic* of the host application's API, rather than low-level vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Bypass Authentication/Authorization Checks [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_bypass_authenticationauthorization_checks__high-risk_.md)

*   **2.2.1.1 Exploit flaws in how the API verifies user identity or permissions.**
    *   *Description:*  The attacker finds a way to circumvent the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the API.  This could involve exploiting flaws in session management, token validation, or access control logic.  The result is that the attacker can access API functions or data they should not be able to access.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low
    *   *Impact:* High
    *   *Effort:* High
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
