# Threat Model Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

## Threat: [Malicious Package Impersonation (Typosquatting/Repository Compromise)](./threats/malicious_package_impersonation__typosquattingrepository_compromise_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a package with a name similar to a legitimate package (typosquatting) or compromises the package repository to replace a legitimate package with a malicious one. The attacker crafts the malicious package to execute arbitrary code when installed or run. This directly exploits `appjoint`'s package management mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains control over the application and potentially the host system, allowing data theft, malware installation, and further network attacks.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:**
        *   `Package Manager`: The component responsible for downloading and installing packages.
        *   `Repository Interface`: The code that interacts with the package repository (if applicable).
        *   `Dependency Resolver`: If the malicious package is a dependency, this component is also affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Package Signing and Verification:** Implement mandatory cryptographic signing of all packages. The `Package Manager` should verify signatures before installation using trusted public keys.
        *   **Secure Repository:** If a central repository is used, ensure it has robust access controls, intrusion detection, and regular security audits.  Use HTTPS with strong TLS configuration.
        *   **Package Naming Conventions:** Enforce strict naming conventions to minimize the risk of typosquatting.  Consider a namespace system (e.g., `author/package`).
        *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Require 2FA for package publishers to prevent account takeover.

## Threat: [Tampered `appjoint` Installer/Bootstrapper](./threats/tampered__appjoint__installerbootstrapper.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker distributes a modified version of the `appjoint` installer or bootstrapper. This modified version could install a compromised version of `appjoint` itself or directly inject malicious code during the installation process. This is a direct attack on the `appjoint` distribution mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker controls the entire `appjoint` environment from the outset, allowing them to install malicious packages and control the application.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:**
        *   `Installer/Bootstrapper`: The initial setup script or executable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Digitally Signed Installer:** Provide a digitally signed installer that users can verify before execution.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Publish SHA-256 (or stronger) checksums for the installer on a trusted website.  Users should verify the downloaded installer's checksum against the published value.
        *   **Secure Hosting:** Host the installer on a secure server (HTTPS with strong TLS) and protect it from unauthorized modification.

## Threat: [Post-Installation Package Modification](./threats/post-installation_package_modification.md)

*   **Description:** After a legitimate package is installed, an attacker with local file system access (or exploiting another vulnerability) modifies the package's files, injecting malicious code. This exploits the lack of ongoing integrity checks within `appjoint`.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, potential privilege escalation. The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially leading to data breaches or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:**
        *   `Package Manager`:  Specifically, the component that manages installed packages and their files.
        *   `Runtime Environment`: The environment in which `appjoint` packages are executed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Runtime Integrity Checks:** The `Package Manager` should periodically verify the integrity of installed packages using checksums or digital signatures.  This could be done at application startup or at regular intervals.
        *   **Secure Package Storage:** Store installed packages in a location with restricted file system permissions, preventing unauthorized modification by non-privileged users.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate packages using sandboxing or containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, `chroot`) to limit the impact of a compromised package.

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration/Dependency Manipulation](./threats/malicious_configurationdependency_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies `appjoint`'s configuration files or dependency manifests to force the installation of malicious packages or alter the behavior of legitimate packages. This directly targets `appjoint`'s configuration and dependency management.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, potential denial of service. The attacker can control which packages are installed and how they are configured, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or application instability.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:**
        *   `Configuration Manager`: The component that reads and processes configuration files.
        *   `Dependency Resolver`: The component that determines which packages to install based on dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configuration File Integrity:** Protect configuration files with strong file system permissions and use checksums or digital signatures to verify their integrity.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Validate configuration files and dependency manifests against a predefined schema to prevent unexpected or malicious entries.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input from configuration files and dependency manifests to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates a malicious package that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space, network bandwidth). This leverages `appjoint`'s package execution to cause a DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for the application or the host system.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:**
        *   `Package Manager`:  Needs to enforce resource limits.
        *   `Runtime Environment`:  Needs to provide mechanisms for resource isolation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits for `appjoint` packages using operating system features like `cgroups` (Linux) or similar mechanisms.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage of installed packages and alert on suspicious activity.
        *   **Package Blacklisting/Disabling:** Provide a mechanism to quickly disable or uninstall malicious packages.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via `appjoint`](./threats/privilege_escalation_via__appjoint_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious package exploits a vulnerability in `appjoint` *itself* or the host system to gain elevated privileges. This focuses on vulnerabilities *within* `appjoint`'s code.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains control over the host system with elevated privileges.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:**
        *   Potentially any component, depending on the vulnerability.  Components that interact with the operating system or handle file system operations are higher risk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run `appjoint` and its components with the least privilege necessary. Avoid running as root/administrator.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate `appjoint` packages using sandboxing or containerization.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the `appjoint` codebase and its dependencies.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices to prevent common privilege escalation vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, path traversal, command injection).
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate all input from packages and configuration files.
