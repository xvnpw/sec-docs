Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving AppJoint:

*   **Threat:** Compromised AppJoint Library within the Native Application
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the AppJoint library within the legitimate native application (e.g., through malware or a supply chain attack). This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or inject messages sent to the web application.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, unauthorized actions performed with the privileges of the legitimate application, manipulation of data sent to the web application, and potential compromise of user data.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:** The core message handling and communication modules within the native application's AppJoint library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the AppJoint library is obtained from a trusted source and its integrity is verified (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures).
        *   Implement code signing for the native application to ensure its integrity and authenticity.
        *   Employ runtime application self-protection (RASP) techniques within the native application to detect and prevent tampering with the AppJoint library.
        *   Regularly update the AppJoint library to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage through Unencrypted AppJoint Communication
    *   **Description:** Sensitive data transmitted between the native application and the web application through AppJoint is not properly encrypted, allowing an attacker to intercept and read the data if the communication channel is compromised (e.g., through a man-in-the-middle attack on the network).
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, including personal information, authentication credentials, or financial details.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:** The underlying communication mechanism used by AppJoint to transmit messages (if not enforced to use HTTPS/TLS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all communication between the native application and the web application.** This should be a mandatory configuration for AppJoint.
        *   Avoid transmitting highly sensitive data through AppJoint if possible. If necessary, implement an additional layer of end-to-end encryption on top of HTTPS/TLS for sensitive payloads.

*   **Threat:** Unvalidated Input from AppJoint Leading to Web Application Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The web application trusts data received through AppJoint without proper validation and sanitization. A malicious native application (or a compromised legitimate one) could send crafted data that exploits vulnerabilities in the web application's processing logic (e.g., leading to injection attacks, though the focus is on AppJoint-specific risks).
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for various web application vulnerabilities to be exploited, leading to data breaches, application crashes, or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:** The interface on the web application side that receives and processes messages from AppJoint.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Treat all data received through AppJoint as untrusted input.**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the web application side for all data received through AppJoint. This includes checking data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   Apply context-sensitive encoding to prevent injection attacks.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in the AppJoint Library Itself
    *   **Description:** The AppJoint library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, logic errors) that could be exploited by a malicious actor.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches in either the native or web application.
    *   **Affected AppJoint Component:** Any module or function within the AppJoint library that contains the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep the AppJoint library updated to the latest version.** This is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor the AppJoint repository for reported security issues and updates.
        *   Consider performing security audits or penetration testing of the application's integration with AppJoint.
