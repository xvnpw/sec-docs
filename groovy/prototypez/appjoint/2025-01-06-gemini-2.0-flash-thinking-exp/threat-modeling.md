# Threat Model Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

## Threat: [Insecure Data Serialization/Deserialization](./threats/insecure_data_serializationdeserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send maliciously crafted serialized data through AppJoint's communication channels. If the receiving module uses an insecure deserialization mechanism facilitated by AppJoint's data passing, this could lead to remote code execution or other security vulnerabilities within the receiving module's process.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain full control over the affected module or potentially the entire application.

**Affected AppJoint Component:** The `data passing` mechanism within AppJoint.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using known-vulnerable serialization libraries or configurations within modules communicating via AppJoint.
* Prefer safer data exchange formats like JSON with strict schema validation for data passed through AppJoint.
* Implement integrity checks or signatures for serialized data exchanged via AppJoint.
* Restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized when received through AppJoint.

## Threat: [Lack of Mutual Authentication Between Modules](./threats/lack_of_mutual_authentication_between_modules.md)

**Description:** A compromised module could impersonate another legitimate module and send malicious commands or data through AppJoint's communication framework, as there's no strong authentication mechanism within AppJoint to verify the sender's identity.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed by the impersonating module, data manipulation, or disruption of service within other modules.

**Affected AppJoint Component:** The `module communication` mechanism within AppJoint.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for inter-module communication facilitated by AppJoint.
* Use unique identifiers or cryptographic signatures to verify the origin of messages or events passed through AppJoint.
* Consider using a secure channel for communication between modules if sensitive data is exchanged via AppJoint.

## Threat: [Malicious Component Registration](./threats/malicious_component_registration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in AppJoint's module registration process to register a malicious module. This malicious module could then intercept communication, inject malicious code, or disrupt the application's functionality by leveraging AppJoint's inter-module communication features.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's inter-module communication, allowing the attacker to control interactions and potentially gain full access.

**Affected AppJoint Component:** The `module registration` mechanism within AppJoint.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure AppJoint's module registration process with authentication and authorization.
* Implement checks within AppJoint to ensure only trusted modules can be registered.
* Use a secure and trusted source for module definitions or configurations used by AppJoint.

## Threat: [Component Hijacking or Redirection](./threats/component_hijacking_or_redirection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate AppJoint's module resolution or discovery mechanism to redirect communication intended for a legitimate module to a malicious one they control, exploiting AppJoint's component lookup functionality.

**Impact:** The attacker can intercept sensitive data, manipulate application logic, or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users by controlling the communication flow managed by AppJoint.

**Affected AppJoint Component:** The `module resolution` or `discovery` mechanism within AppJoint.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust and secure module resolution mechanisms within AppJoint.
* Use secure naming conventions and potentially cryptographic verification of module identities managed by AppJoint.
* Ensure AppJoint's module resolution process cannot be easily manipulated by unauthorized entities.

## Threat: [Compromised AppJoint Library](./threats/compromised_appjoint_library.md)

**Description:** If the AppJoint library itself or its dependencies are compromised (e.g., through a supply chain attack), all applications using it could be vulnerable, directly impacting the core functionality provided by AppJoint.

**Impact:** A wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the library, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, all stemming from a compromise within AppJoint's code.

**Affected AppJoint Component:** The core `AppJoint library` and its `dependencies`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the AppJoint library and its dependencies to the latest secure versions.
* Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in AppJoint's dependencies.
* Verify the integrity of the AppJoint library and its dependencies during build and deployment processes.
