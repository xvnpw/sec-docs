# Attack Tree Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

Objective: To execute arbitrary code within the application's context or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data by exploiting weaknesses in AppJoint's inter-module communication or reflection mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Introduce Malicious Module During Development/Build](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_introduce_malicious_module_during_developmentbuild.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromise Development Environment (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **How:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the development machines, accounts, or infrastructure. This could be through phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities in development tools, or insider threats.
        * **Impact:** Full control over the codebase, ability to inject malicious code, modify build processes, and steal sensitive development secrets.
        * **Why it's High-Risk:**  A successful compromise at this stage has a critical impact, allowing for the insertion of persistent and difficult-to-detect vulnerabilities directly into the application.
    * **Gain Access to Source Code Repository:**
        * **How:** Attackers obtain credentials or exploit vulnerabilities in the source code repository (e.g., Git, SVN).
        * **Impact:** Ability to modify the codebase, introduce malicious code, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.
    * **Compromise Build Pipeline:**
        * **How:** Attackers target the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to inject malicious code during the automated build process.
        * **Impact:** Malicious code is included in the official application builds, affecting all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Malicious Module Injection](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_malicious_module_injection.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Introduce Malicious Module During Development/Build (HIGH-RISK PATH - see above)**
    * **Introduce Malicious Module at Runtime (If Dynamically Loaded):**
        * **How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's dynamic module loading mechanism to load and execute a malicious module after the application is installed.
        * **Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary code, access data, and interact with other modules within the running application.
* **Why it's Critical:** Successfully injecting a malicious module, regardless of the method, provides the attacker with a powerful foothold within the application, allowing for a wide range of malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Message Interception and Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_message_interception_and_manipulation.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Lack of Encryption in Communication Channel (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **How:** The communication between AppJoint modules is not encrypted, allowing attackers with network access or device access to eavesdrop on the messages.
        * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data being transmitted between modules.
        * **Why it's High-Risk:** The lack of encryption is a fundamental security flaw that makes interception easy and has a direct impact on data confidentiality.
    * **Leverage Debugging or Logging Information Leakage:**
        * **How:** Sensitive information is inadvertently included in debug logs or logging statements that are accessible to attackers.
        * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data.
    * **Modify Intercepted Messages:**
        * **How:** After intercepting messages, attackers alter their content to inject malicious payloads or change parameters to trigger unintended actions in other modules.
        * **Impact:** Manipulation of application behavior, data corruption, and potential for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Encryption in Communication Channel](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_lack_of_encryption_in_communication_channel.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Lack of Encryption in Communication Channel (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **How:** The communication between AppJoint modules is not encrypted, allowing attackers with network access or device access to eavesdrop on the messages.
        * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data being transmitted between modules.
        * **Why it's High-Risk:** The lack of encryption is a fundamental security flaw that makes interception easy and has a direct impact on data confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Replay Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_replay_attacks.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Lack of Nonces or Message Sequencing (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **How:** AppJoint does not implement mechanisms to prevent replay attacks, such as using unique nonces or sequence numbers for messages.
        * **Impact:** Attackers can capture valid messages and resend them to re-trigger actions, bypass authentication, or perform unauthorized operations.
        * **Why it's High-Risk:** The lack of replay protection allows attackers to easily reuse legitimate messages for malicious purposes, potentially bypassing security controls.
    * **Trigger Sensitive Actions by Replaying Authentication or Authorization Messages:**
        * **How:** Attackers capture and replay authentication tokens or authorization requests to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Impact:** Bypassing authentication and gaining access to sensitive functionality or data.
