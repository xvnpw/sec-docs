# Attack Surface Analysis for prototypez/appjoint

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Dynamic Module Loading](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_dynamic_module_loading.md)

*   **Description:** The application loads and executes code from external modules at runtime without proper validation of the source or integrity of the module.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:** AppJoint's core functionality is to facilitate dynamic module loading, making the application susceptible if the source of these modules is not strictly controlled and verified.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could convince the application to load a malicious module from a compromised server or a local, writable directory, injecting arbitrary code into the application's process.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict Module Sources: Only allow loading modules from trusted and explicitly defined sources (e.g., specific internal repositories, signed packages).
        *   Implement Integrity Checks: Verify the integrity of modules before loading using cryptographic hashes or digital signatures.
        *   Use Secure Protocols: If loading modules remotely, use HTTPS to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of a compromised module.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Injection Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/dependency_injection_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the dependency injection mechanism provided by AppJoint to inject malicious components or replace legitimate ones with compromised versions.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:** AppJoint's dependency injection framework provides a mechanism for managing and providing dependencies, which can be targeted if not properly secured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in how AppJoint resolves dependencies to inject a malicious service that gets instantiated and used by the application, leading to data breaches or code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service, or remote code execution depending on the injected component's capabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Dependency Registration: Implement strict controls over how dependencies are registered and resolved within AppJoint.
        *   Input Validation for Dependency Configuration: If the dependency configuration is influenced by external input, rigorously validate and sanitize it.
        *   Regularly Audit Dependencies: Ensure that all dependencies used by AppJoint and the loaded modules are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): To track and manage dependencies effectively.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Remote Module Loading](./attack_surfaces/insecure_remote_module_loading.md)

*   **Description:** When AppJoint loads modules from remote sources without proper security measures, it becomes vulnerable to attacks during the transfer process.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:** The ability to load modules from remote URLs or repositories introduces the risk of interception and manipulation during transit.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept the download of a module and replace it with a malicious version before it's loaded by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, as the application will execute the attacker's malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce HTTPS: Always use HTTPS for fetching remote modules to ensure encrypted communication and prevent interception.
        *   Implement Integrity Checks: Verify the integrity of downloaded modules using checksums or digital signatures obtained from a trusted source.
        *   Restrict Remote Sources: Limit the remote locations from which modules can be loaded to known and trusted repositories.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities Related to Module Loading](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities_related_to_module_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure storage or handling of AppJoint's configuration related to module loading can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:** AppJoint relies on configuration to determine where and how to load modules. If this configuration is vulnerable, the module loading process becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** If the configuration specifying the module download URL is stored in plain text and is accessible to an attacker, they could modify it to point to a malicious server.
    *   **Impact:** Loading of malicious modules leading to Remote Code Execution or other forms of compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Configuration Storage: Store sensitive configuration information securely (e.g., encrypted, protected by file system permissions).
        *   Restrict Access to Configuration: Limit who can read and modify AppJoint's configuration files or settings.
        *   Input Validation for Configuration: If configuration values are derived from external input, rigorously validate and sanitize them.

## Attack Surface: [ClassLoader Manipulation (If Applicable and Exposed)](./attack_surfaces/classloader_manipulation__if_applicable_and_exposed_.md)

*   **Description:** If AppJoint allows for manipulation of the classloader used to load modules, attackers could potentially introduce malicious classes or modify existing ones.
    *   **How AppJoint Contributes:**  If AppJoint's design exposes or allows direct interaction with the classloader, it creates an opportunity for this type of attack.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a malicious class that replaces a legitimate system class, allowing them to intercept and manipulate critical operations.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution, complete control over the application's execution environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict ClassLoader Access:  Limit or completely prevent direct manipulation of the classloader by loaded modules.
        *   Enforce Strong Security Boundaries: Isolate loaded modules within secure sandboxes or containers to limit the impact of classloader manipulation.
