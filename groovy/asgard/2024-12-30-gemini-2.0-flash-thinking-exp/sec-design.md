```

**Detailed Steps:**

* **User Initiates Action in Browser:** The user interacts with the Asgard web interface, for example, by clicking a button to create a new load balancer.
* **Asgard Frontend: Sends API Request:** The frontend application constructs and sends an API request to the Asgard backend, specifying the desired action and any necessary parameters.
* **Optional: AWS API Gateway: Request Routing & Security:** If implemented, the API Gateway receives the request, potentially performing tasks like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request routing.
* **Asgard Backend: Authentication & Authorization:** The backend services receive the request and verify the user's identity and permissions to perform the requested action on the target AWS resources. This typically involves checking IAM roles and policies associated with the user or the Asgard application itself.
* **User Authorized?:** A decision point based on the outcome of the authentication and authorization checks.
* **Asgard Backend: Constructs & Sends AWS API Call:** If the user is authorized, the backend constructs the appropriate API call using the AWS SDK, targeting the relevant AWS service (e.g., `elb.createLoadBalancer`).
* **AWS Service (e.g., EC2 API):** The designated AWS service receives the API call.
* **AWS Service: Processes Request:** The AWS service processes the request according to its defined functionality.
* **AWS Service: Returns Response:** The AWS service sends a response back to the Asgard backend, indicating the success or failure of the operation and any relevant data or status information.
* **Asgard Backend: Processes AWS Response:** The backend receives and processes the response from the AWS service. This might involve updating internal state, logging the event, or transforming the data.
* **Asgard Backend: Sends Response to Frontend:** The backend sends a response back to the frontend application, indicating the outcome of the user's action.
* **Asgard Frontend: Updates User Interface:** The frontend receives the response and updates the user interface to reflect the result of the operation, providing feedback to the user.
* **Asgard Backend: Sends Error Response:** If the user is not authorized, the backend sends an error response to the frontend, indicating the reason for the failure.

## 6. Key Technologies

* **Primary Backend Language:** Java (predominantly).
* **Backend Frameworks:** Spring Framework (commonly used for dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, etc.).
* **Frontend Languages:** JavaScript.
* **Frontend Frameworks/Libraries:** AngularJS (historically), potentially React or other modern JavaScript frameworks.
* **AWS SDK:** AWS SDK for Java (for backend interaction with AWS services).
* **Data Storage (Optional):** Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases may be used for storing application configuration, user preferences, or other persistent data.
* **Caching Mechanisms:**  Potentially utilizes caching solutions (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to improve performance by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch data from AWS.
* **Message Queues (Optional):** May leverage message queues like Amazon SQS for asynchronous task processing and decoupling components.
