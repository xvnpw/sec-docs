### High and Critical Buildstep Threats

This list details high and critical threats directly involving the `progrium/buildstep` tool.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Dockerfile
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the application by injecting malicious commands or scripts directly into the `Dockerfile` used by Buildstep. Buildstep's core function is to execute the instructions within this `Dockerfile`, making it a direct point of attack. This could happen if a developer unknowingly includes a compromised base image or introduces malicious instructions. Buildstep would then execute these instructions during the image build process.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromised application image containing backdoors, data theft, or other malicious functionalities. This could lead to full control of the application's runtime environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dockerfile execution within the Buildstep container.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review all `Dockerfile` instructions before committing them.
        *   Use trusted and verified base images from reputable sources.
        *   Implement static analysis tools to scan `Dockerfiles` for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly update base images to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Employ a "least privilege" approach when defining user permissions within the `Dockerfile`.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection through Build Arguments or Environment Variables
    *   **Description:** If the Buildstep configuration or the application using Buildstep allows users to influence the build process through arguments or environment variables without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious commands. Buildstep would then execute these commands within the build container, potentially gaining control of the build environment or accessing sensitive data. This directly leverages Buildstep's mechanism for parameterizing builds.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the Buildstep container, potentially leading to data exfiltration, access to build secrets, or compromise of the Buildstep host.
    *   **Affected Component:** Build process, specifically the handling of build arguments and environment variables by Buildstep.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing user-controlled input directly into build arguments or environment variables.
        *   If user input is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection before it reaches Buildstep.
        *   Use parameterized builds where possible to separate code from data.
        *   Run Buildstep containers with restricted privileges.

*   **Threat:** Pulling Compromised Base Images from Untrusted Registries
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a Docker registry or create a malicious image with the same name as a legitimate one. If Buildstep is configured to pull images from this untrusted registry, it could inadvertently use the compromised image as the base for the application, introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code. This directly exploits Buildstep's dependency on external image registries.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of known vulnerabilities or malicious code into the application from the base layer, potentially leading to various security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Image pulling mechanism within Buildstep.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only pull base images from trusted and verified registries.
        *   Implement image scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities in pulled images *before* Buildstep uses them.
        *   Use image signing and verification mechanisms to ensure image integrity.
        *   Consider using a private registry to host trusted base images.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets in the Build Context or Image Layers
    *   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or certificates within the build context (files copied during the build) or directly in the `Dockerfile` that Buildstep processes. This information can then be baked into the final Docker image layers by Buildstep, making it accessible to anyone with access to the image.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to external services or internal resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker image creation process within Buildstep.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid including secrets directly in the `Dockerfile` or build context.
        *   Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to inject secrets at runtime, bypassing Buildstep's direct handling of them.
        *   Utilize multi-stage builds to minimize the number of layers containing sensitive information.
        *   Scan Docker images for exposed secrets *after* Buildstep has created them.
