    D --> E
    E --> F
    E --> G
    E --> H
    H --> I
    I --> J
    J --> K
```

**Detailed Flow:**

1. **User initiates build command:** The user executes a `buildstep` command, providing the application source code or a reference to it.
2. **buildstep CLI:** The CLI receives the command, parses it, and prepares the build environment.
3. **Docker Daemon: Create Build Container:** The CLI instructs the Docker daemon to create a temporary container to execute the build process. This container typically includes a base image with necessary build tools.
4. **Buildpack Detection & Selection:**  The `buildstep` CLI or the initial buildpack(s) analyze the application source code to determine the appropriate buildpacks to use.
5. **Docker Daemon: Execute Buildpack(s):** The Docker daemon executes the selected buildpacks within the build container.
6. **Buildpack: Dependency Installation:** The buildpack(s) download and install the necessary dependencies for the application, potentially interacting with external package repositories.
7. **Buildpack: Application Compilation:** The buildpack(s) compile the application source code and prepare it for execution.
8. **Buildpack: Slug Creation:** The buildpack(s) package the compiled application and its dependencies into a self-contained artifact known as the "slug."
9. **Slug Store: Save Slug:** The generated slug is saved to the designated Slug Store location.
10. **Docker Daemon: Create Application Image from Slug:** The Docker daemon uses the stored slug and a base image to create the final application Docker image. This often involves adding the slug as a layer in the image.
11. **Application Image:** The resulting Docker image, containing the built application, is ready for deployment.

**6. Security Considerations (For Threat Modeling)**

This section expands on potential security concerns to facilitate more effective threat modeling.

* **Buildpack Integrity and Provenance:**
    * **Risk:** Malicious actors could compromise buildpacks, injecting backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities into the application image.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Buildpack Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of buildpacks (e.g., digital signatures, checksums).
        * **Trusted Sources:**  Restrict the use of buildpacks to trusted and well-maintained sources.
        * **Buildpack Sandboxing:** Isolate buildpack execution to limit the impact of potential compromises.
* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Risk:**  The build process might introduce dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the build process to identify and flag vulnerable dependencies.
        * **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate SBOMs to track the components included in the final image.
        * **Dependency Pinning:** Encourage or enforce the pinning of dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates with vulnerabilities.
* **Source Code Exposure:**
    * **Risk:**  Sensitive information within the source code could be exposed during the build process or in the final image.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Secure Source Code Handling:** Ensure secure storage and transfer of source code.
        * **Secret Management:** Implement secure mechanisms for handling secrets and credentials during the build process (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools).
        * **Avoid Embedding Secrets:**  Prevent embedding secrets directly in the source code.
* **Docker Daemon Security:**
    * **Risk:**  A compromised Docker daemon could allow attackers to gain control over the build process and the resulting images.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep the Docker daemon updated with the latest security patches.
        * **Secure Configuration:** Follow Docker security best practices for daemon configuration.
        * **Access Control:** Restrict access to the Docker daemon.
* **Slug Store Security:**
    * **Risk:**  Unauthorized access to the Slug Store could allow attackers to modify or replace the compiled application.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Access Controls:** Implement appropriate access controls on the Slug Store location.
        * **Integrity Checks:**  Use checksums or other mechanisms to verify the integrity of the stored slug.
* **buildstep CLI Security:**
    * **Risk:**  Vulnerabilities in the CLI could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands or manipulate the build process.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate user input to prevent command injection attacks.
        * **Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding practices during CLI development.
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep the `buildstep` CLI updated with security patches.
* **Network Security during Build:**
    * **Risk:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks could compromise downloaded dependencies or other external resources.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **HTTPS Enforcement:** Ensure all communication with external resources (e.g., package repositories) uses HTTPS.
        * **Certificate Verification:**  Verify the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates.
* **Logging and Auditing:**
    * **Risk:**  Insufficient logging can hinder incident response and security investigations.
    * **Considerations:**
        * **Comprehensive Logging:** Log all significant build activities, including buildpack execution, dependency downloads, and image creation.
        * **Secure Log Storage:** Store logs securely and protect them from unauthorized access or modification.

**7. Future Considerations (Beyond Initial Scope)**

* **Caching Mechanisms and Security:** How are build layers and dependencies cached? What are the risks associated with cache poisoning or insecure cache storage?
* **Multi-Tenancy Security:** If `buildstep` is used in a multi-tenant environment, how is isolation enforced between different users' builds to prevent cross-tenant contamination or information leakage?
* **Integration with CI/CD Systems Security:** How are credentials and access tokens managed when `buildstep` is integrated with CI/CD pipelines? What are the potential security implications of these integrations?
* **Custom Buildpack Management and Security:** How are custom buildpacks registered, managed, and secured? Are there mechanisms to scan custom buildpacks for vulnerabilities?
* **Supply Chain Security:** How does `buildstep` contribute to the overall software supply chain security? Are there mechanisms to track the provenance of the final application image?

**8. Conclusion**
