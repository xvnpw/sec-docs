# Attack Surface Analysis for jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite

## Attack Surface: [SOAP Injection](./attack_surfaces/soap_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SOAP elements into SOAP requests, leading to unintended actions or data manipulation on the remote SOAP service.
    - **groovy-wslite Contribution:** `groovy-wslite` facilitates SOAP request construction. If user-controlled data is directly embedded into SOAP requests built using `groovy-wslite` without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to SOAP injection.
    - **Example:** An application uses `groovy-wslite` to create a SOAP request with a `<username>` field populated by user input. An attacker inputs `</username><adminAccess>true</adminAccess><username>`. If the backend SOAP service processes this injected element, it might grant unauthorized admin access.
    - **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, data manipulation, denial of service on the backend SOAP service.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into SOAP requests constructed with `groovy-wslite`.
        - **Use Parameterized Queries/Safe Construction:** Employ secure methods for constructing SOAP requests using `groovy-wslite`, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input. Consider XML templating with proper escaping or libraries offering parameterized SOAP request building.

## Attack Surface: [REST API Manipulation via URL Injection](./attack_surfaces/rest_api_manipulation_via_url_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attackers manipulate the target REST API endpoint by injecting malicious URLs, potentially accessing unauthorized resources or bypassing access controls.
    - **groovy-wslite Contribution:** `groovy-wslite`'s REST client allows dynamic URL construction. If user input is used to construct REST API URLs for requests made by `groovy-wslite` without proper validation, it opens this attack surface.
    - **Example:** An application uses `groovy-wslite` to make a REST request to `/api/users/{id}`, where `{id}` is derived from user input. An attacker inputs `../../admin/deleteUser` instead of an ID, potentially accessing an administrative endpoint if URL validation is missing in the application using `groovy-wslite`.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, bypassing access controls, unintended actions on the backend REST API.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs used to construct URLs for `groovy-wslite` REST requests.
        - **URL Encoding:** Properly URL encode user inputs used in URLs within `groovy-wslite` requests to prevent interpretation of special characters.
        - **Whitelisting Allowed Paths:** If possible, whitelist allowed URL paths or patterns to restrict user-controlled URL segments to expected values when using `groovy-wslite`.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTTP headers into requests, leading to various attacks like XSS, session fixation, or bypassing access controls.
    - **groovy-wslite Contribution:** `groovy-wslite` provides mechanisms to set custom headers in requests. If the application allows user input to influence HTTP headers when making requests with `groovy-wslite`, this attack surface is introduced.
    - **Example:** An application using `groovy-wslite` allows users to set a custom header. An attacker injects `X-Forwarded-For: <script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If the backend service reflects this header in responses without sanitization, it can lead to XSS.
    - **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Session Fixation or Hijacking, Bypassing Access Controls, other header-related vulnerabilities depending on backend service behavior.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user inputs used for setting header values in `groovy-wslite` requests.
        - **Avoid User Control over Sensitive Headers:** Limit or completely prevent user control over sensitive HTTP headers like `Cookie`, `Authorization`, etc., when using `groovy-wslite`.
        - **Secure Header Settings:** Use secure default header settings with `groovy-wslite` and avoid adding unnecessary custom headers based on user input.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Injection (REST & SOAP)](./attack_surfaces/request_body_injection__rest_&_soap_.md)

- **Description:** Attackers inject malicious payloads into request bodies (XML for SOAP, JSON/XML for REST), potentially leading to command injection or data manipulation on the server-side.
    - **groovy-wslite Contribution:** `groovy-wslite` handles sending request bodies for REST and SOAP requests. If user input is used to construct these request bodies without proper encoding or sanitization in the application using `groovy-wslite`, it creates this vulnerability.
    - **Example (REST JSON):** An application uses `groovy-wslite` to send a JSON request. User input is used to build the JSON body. An attacker injects `{"name": "user", "command": "$(malicious_command)"}`. If the backend service processes this JSON and is vulnerable to command injection via JSON processing, it can execute arbitrary commands.
    - **Impact:** Command Injection, Data Manipulation, Server-Side Vulnerabilities Exploitation, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs used in request bodies sent via `groovy-wslite`.
        - **Parameterized Requests/Safe Construction:** Use parameterized requests or secure methods for constructing request bodies for `groovy-wslite`, avoiding direct string concatenation.
        - **Appropriate Encoding:** Use proper encoding (JSON encoding, XML encoding) when constructing request bodies for `groovy-wslite` to prevent injection.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

- **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in XML parsing to access local files, perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), or cause Denial of Service (DoS) through malicious XML responses.
    - **groovy-wslite Contribution:** `groovy-wslite` handles XML parsing for SOAP and potentially XML REST responses. If `groovy-wslite` or its underlying XML parser is vulnerable to XXE and processes malicious XML responses from SOAP or XML REST services, it becomes a conduit for this attack.
    - **Example:** A malicious SOAP response processed by `groovy-wslite` contains an external entity definition like `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" > ]><root>&xxe;</root>`. When `groovy-wslite` parses this response, it might attempt to resolve the external entity, leading to local file access.
    - **Impact:** Local File Disclosure, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Denial of Service (DoS), potentially leading to further exploitation.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Disable External Entity Processing:** Configure the XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` to disable external entity processing. This is the most effective mitigation. Consult `groovy-wslite` documentation and underlying XML parser documentation for configuration options.
        - **Use Updated XML Libraries:** Ensure `groovy-wslite` and its dependencies, especially XML parsing libraries, are up-to-date to patch known XXE vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

- **Description:** Weak TLS/SSL configuration when communicating over HTTPS, leading to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where attackers can eavesdrop or modify communication.
    - **groovy-wslite Contribution:** `groovy-wslite` handles HTTPS connections. If `groovy-wslite` is not configured to enforce strong TLS versions and cipher suites when making HTTPS requests, it can be vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    - **Example:** `groovy-wslite` is used to connect to a web service over HTTPS, but the application or `groovy-wslite`'s default settings allow outdated TLS versions like TLS 1.0 or weak cipher suites. An attacker performing a MITM attack can downgrade the connection and intercept traffic.
    - **Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping on sensitive communication, modification of requests and responses, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Enforce Strong TLS Versions:** Configure `groovy-wslite` to use only strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher). Refer to `groovy-wslite` documentation for TLS configuration options.
        - **Use Secure Cipher Suites:** Configure `groovy-wslite` to use only secure cipher suites, avoiding weak or deprecated ones.
        - **Certificate Validation:** Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate validation is enabled in `groovy-wslite` to prevent MITM attacks using forged certificates.
