## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure XML Processing Configuration for SOAP Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_xml_processing_configuration_for_soap_interactions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Understand `groovy-wslite`'s XML Handling:** Recognize that `groovy-wslite` relies on Groovy's XML parsing capabilities (primarily `XmlSlurper` and `XmlParser`) for processing SOAP messages. These, in turn, use Java's XML processing libraries.
2.  **Identify XML Parsing Contexts:** Determine if your application directly manipulates XML using `XmlSlurper` or `XmlParser` in conjunction with `groovy-wslite`, especially when pre-processing requests or post-processing responses *before or after* using `groovy-wslite`'s `SOAPClient`.
3.  **Configure Underlying XML Parsers (if directly used):** If you are directly using `XmlSlurper` or `XmlParser`, configure the underlying `SAXParserFactory` or `DocumentBuilderFactory` to disable external entity resolution. This is crucial to prevent XXE vulnerabilities if you are handling XML outside of `groovy-wslite`'s core request/response handling but still within the application's interaction flow with web services.
    *   Example (Conceptual Groovy code for direct XML parsing):
        ```groovy
        import javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory

        def factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance()
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false)
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false)
        factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false)
        def parser = factory.newSAXParser()
        // ... use parser for XML processing related to groovy-wslite ...
        ```
4.  **Indirect Protection via Global XML Configuration:** If your project has a global XML configuration mechanism (as described in "Currently Implemented" below), ensure this configuration, which disables external entities, is consistently applied to *all* XML parsing within the application, including any XML processing related to `groovy-wslite` usage.
5.  **Testing:** Test SOAP interactions and any custom XML processing logic to confirm that external entity resolution is disabled in the context of your `groovy-wslite` usage.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (in context of SOAP/XML processing related to `groovy-wslite`):** Severity: **High**. XXE vulnerabilities arising from XML processing during SOAP interactions (even if indirectly through application-level XML handling around `groovy-wslite` usage) can be mitigated.

**Impact:**
*   **XXE Injection:** **Significantly reduces** the risk of XXE vulnerabilities that could be exploited through XML processing related to `groovy-wslite` interactions.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The project globally disables external entity resolution for all XML parsing operations using a custom XML configuration utility class. This utility is designed to be used wherever XML parsing is performed within the application, providing indirect protection for XML processing related to `groovy-wslite` usage.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No known missing implementations in terms of global XML configuration. However, it's crucial to maintain awareness and ensure that *any* new XML parsing code introduced in the project, especially if it's in the context of SOAP request/response handling or data manipulation around `groovy-wslite`, utilizes this secure XML configuration to prevent XXE vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews should verify this.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized SOAP Request Construction in `groovy-wslite`](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_soap_request_construction_in__groovy-wslite_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize `groovy-wslite` Parameterization Features:**  Employ `groovy-wslite`'s built-in features for constructing SOAP requests using parameters or data maps. This is the primary way to safely incorporate dynamic data into SOAP requests when using this library. Consult the `groovy-wslite` documentation for specific methods of parameterization (e.g., using maps for request bodies in `SOAPClient.send()`).
2.  **Avoid String Concatenation for Request Bodies:**  Refrain from constructing SOAP request XML bodies by directly concatenating strings, especially when including user-provided data. This practice is highly vulnerable to SOAP injection.
3.  **XML Encode Parameter Values (if manual construction is unavoidable):** In rare cases where you might need to manually construct parts of the XML request (ideally avoid this), *always* XML-encode any user-provided data before embedding it into the XML string. Use a reliable XML encoding function to escape characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `"`.
4.  **Code Review for Request Construction:**  Conduct code reviews specifically focusing on how SOAP requests are built using `groovy-wslite`. Ensure that parameterized methods are used and that direct string concatenation of user input into XML is avoided.
5.  **Testing for SOAP Injection:**  Perform security testing, including attempting SOAP injection attacks, to verify that your request construction methods using `groovy-wslite` are secure and prevent injection vulnerabilities.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SOAP Injection (via `groovy-wslite` request construction):** Severity: **High**.  Improperly constructed SOAP requests using `groovy-wslite`, especially when directly embedding user input, can lead to SOAP injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   **SOAP Injection:** **Significantly reduces** the risk of SOAP injection by promoting secure request construction practices within `groovy-wslite`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   For most SOAP operations, the project uses `groovy-wslite`'s parameterized request construction. The `SoapRequestService` class is designed to build requests using maps for parameters, which is the recommended approach with `groovy-wslite`. XML encoding is also applied to parameter values within this service.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Legacy SOAP endpoints in the `LegacyAdminSoapClient` class still utilize string templates for request construction with potentially incomplete manual escaping. These sections need to be refactored to fully leverage `groovy-wslite`'s parameterized request features and the existing XML encoding utility to ensure consistent and robust protection against SOAP injection across all `groovy-wslite` interactions.
