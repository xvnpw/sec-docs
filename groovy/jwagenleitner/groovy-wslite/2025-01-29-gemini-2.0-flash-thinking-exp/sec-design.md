# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `groovy-wslite`, provides a Groovy-based SOAP client library. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.  The library simplifies the process of interacting with SOAP-based web services from Groovy applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enable integration with existing SOAP-based systems: Many enterprises still rely on SOAP for legacy systems or external partner integrations. This library allows Groovy applications to interact with these systems.
- Simplify SOAP interaction for Groovy developers:  Provides a higher-level API to handle the complexities of SOAP, such as XML parsing, request/response handling, and WSDL (Web Services Description Language) processing.
- Reduce development time and effort: By providing a ready-to-use SOAP client, developers don't need to implement SOAP communication from scratch.

Business Risks:
- Dependency on legacy SOAP services:  If the reliance on SOAP services is a long-term strategy, there's a risk of being tied to outdated technology.
- Security vulnerabilities in SOAP communication: SOAP, like any web service protocol, can be vulnerable to attacks if not implemented and used securely. This includes risks related to XML parsing, message manipulation, and insecure transport.
- Library vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the `groovy-wslite` library itself could expose applications using it to security risks.
- Integration complexity:  Interacting with external SOAP services can introduce integration complexities and potential points of failure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: HTTPS for transport layer security when communicating with SOAP services (assuming the library supports and encourages HTTPS).  (Implemented in application using the library and configured for HTTP client).
- security control: Dependency management using build tools like Gradle or Maven to manage library dependencies. (Implemented in application build process).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk:  Reliance on external SOAP service security: The security of the overall system depends on the security of the external SOAP services being consumed.
- accepted risk:  Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies:  The library may depend on other libraries, which could have vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Input validation and sanitization of data received from SOAP responses to prevent injection attacks. (To be implemented in application using the library).
- security control: Output encoding of data sent in SOAP requests to prevent injection attacks on the SOAP service. (To be implemented in application using the library).
- security control: Regular security scanning of the application and its dependencies, including `groovy-wslite`, for known vulnerabilities. (To be implemented in application development lifecycle).
- security control: Secure configuration of the HTTP client used by `groovy-wslite`, including TLS/SSL settings and timeouts. (To be implemented in application using the library).
- security control: Implement proper error handling and logging to detect and respond to security incidents. (To be implemented in application using the library).
- security control: Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the application consuming SOAP services to protect against common web attacks. (To be implemented in application deployment environment).

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Support for various SOAP authentication mechanisms (e.g., WS-Security, Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication) to securely authenticate with SOAP services.
    - requirement: Secure storage and handling of authentication credentials used to access SOAP services. (Implemented in application using the library).
- Authorization:
    - requirement:  The application using the library should implement proper authorization controls to ensure that only authorized users or systems can access and interact with SOAP services. (Implemented in application using the library).
- Input Validation:
    - requirement:  Strict validation of all data received from SOAP responses to prevent injection attacks and data corruption. (To be implemented in application using the library).
    - requirement:  Validation of input data before sending SOAP requests to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior in the SOAP service. (To be implemented in application using the library).
- Cryptography:
    - requirement:  Use HTTPS for all communication with SOAP services to encrypt data in transit. (Implemented in application using the library and network configuration).
    - requirement:  Support for handling encrypted data within SOAP messages if required by the SOAP service (e.g., using WS-Security encryption). (Potentially implemented by the library or application using it).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Integration with external systems via SOAP:  The core business process enabled by this library is the ability to integrate with external SOAP-based services. Disruption or compromise of this integration could impact business operations that depend on these external systems.
- Data exchange with external partners: If the SOAP services are used to exchange data with external partners, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data are critical.

Data Sensitivity:
- Potentially sensitive data exchanged via SOAP: Depending on the specific SOAP services being used, the data exchanged could include sensitive information such as:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    - Financial data
    - Business confidential data
    - Authentication credentials

The sensitivity of the data depends entirely on the specific use case and the nature of the SOAP services being integrated with. It is crucial to identify and classify the data being handled to determine appropriate security controls.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific SOAP services will the application integrate with? Understanding the nature of these services is crucial for threat modeling and security requirements.
- What type of data will be exchanged with these SOAP services, and what is the sensitivity of this data? This will determine the required data protection measures.
- What are the authentication and authorization mechanisms required to access these SOAP services? This will impact the security implementation within the application.
- What is the expected deployment environment for the application? Cloud, on-premise, hybrid? This will influence deployment security considerations.
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the application and its integration with SOAP services must adhere to?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - The primary business goal is to enable integration with existing SOAP-based systems to extend the functionality of Groovy applications.
    - The business values the ability to quickly and easily integrate with SOAP services using Groovy.
- SECURITY POSTURE:
    - HTTPS will be used for all communication with external SOAP services.
    - The application will be responsible for implementing input validation and output encoding.
    - Standard secure software development lifecycle practices will be followed for the application.
- DESIGN:
    - The application will be deployed in a cloud environment using containers.
    - GitHub Actions will be used for the CI/CD pipeline.
    - The application will use a standard HTTP client library for making HTTP requests.
    - The `groovy-wslite` library functions as intended and does not introduce inherent security vulnerabilities. (This needs to be verified through dependency scanning and potentially code review of the library itself if deemed high risk).
