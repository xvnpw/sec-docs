# Threat Model Analysis for jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate user-controlled input used to construct URLs or endpoints for `groovy-wslite` requests. By injecting malicious URLs, they can force the application to make requests to internal resources or unintended external services. This allows bypassing firewalls, accessing sensitive internal data, or performing actions on behalf of the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Disclosure of sensitive internal information.
    *   **Availability:** Denial of service of internal or external services.
    *   **Integrity:** Potential modification of internal data or systems.
*   **Affected Component:** `groovy-wslite`'s request construction logic, specifically when handling user-provided input for URLs or endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used in URL construction. Use allow-lists of permitted characters and URL components.
    *   **URL Allow-listing:** Implement allow-lists of permitted target domains or IP ranges for outbound requests. Reject requests to URLs outside of the allowed list.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate application servers from internal resources and sensitive networks to limit the impact of SSRF.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses `groovy-wslite` to interact with SOAP services or processes XML responses, and the underlying XML parser is vulnerable to XXE, an attacker can inject malicious XML entities into SOAP requests or responses. When parsed, these entities can be processed, allowing the attacker to read local files on the server, cause denial of service, or trigger SSRF.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Access to local files and sensitive data on the server.
    *   **Availability:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion or XML parsing errors.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Ability to make requests to internal or external services from the server.
*   **Affected Component:**  `groovy-wslite`'s XML parsing functionality, potentially within the SOAP client module if used. Underlying XML parser libraries used by `groovy-wslite`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Entity Processing:** Configure the XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` to disable processing of external entities by default.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** If external entities are absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate XML input to prevent injection of malicious entities.
    *   **Prefer JSON:** Where possible, use JSON-based web services instead of SOAP/XML to avoid XML-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the XML parser libraries used by `groovy-wslite` up-to-date to patch known XXE vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `groovy-wslite` relies on other libraries that may contain known security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities in dependencies can compromise the application using `groovy-wslite`.
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, potentially including:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Complete compromise of the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Application unavailability.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Leakage of sensitive data.
*   **Affected Component:**  All dependencies of `groovy-wslite`, including HTTP client libraries, XML/JSON parsing libraries, and any other transitive dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `groovy-wslite`'s dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `groovy-wslite` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories for `groovy-wslite` and its dependencies to be informed of new vulnerabilities.
