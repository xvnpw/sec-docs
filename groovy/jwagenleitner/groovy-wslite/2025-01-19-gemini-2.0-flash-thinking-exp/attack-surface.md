## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

* **Description:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
    * **How groovy-wslite Contributes:** `groovy-wslite` is used to construct and send SOAP requests, which are XML-based. If the application embeds user-controlled data directly into the XML request without proper sanitization, it can introduce XXE vulnerabilities. `groovy-wslite` also handles receiving XML SOAP responses, and if the application doesn't process these securely, a malicious server can inject XXE payloads.
    * **Example:** An application takes user input for a product ID and includes it in the SOAP request. An attacker provides a malicious product ID like: `<productId>&lt;!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" &gt;&amp;x;</productId>`. If the server processes this without proper sanitization, it could expose the contents of `/etc/passwd`. Similarly, a malicious SOAP service could send a response containing an XXE payload that the application, using `groovy-wslite` to receive and potentially parse, processes insecurely.
    * **Impact:**
        * Local file disclosure on the server hosting the application.
        * Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), allowing the attacker to make requests to internal or external systems from the server.
        * Denial of Service (DoS) by exploiting the XML parser.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Sanitize User Input:**  Never directly embed unsanitized user input into XML requests.
        * **Use Secure XML Processing:** Configure the XML parser used by the application (and potentially within `groovy-wslite`'s dependencies if configurable) to disable or restrict external entity resolution for both request construction and response parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
    * **How groovy-wslite Contributes:** `groovy-wslite` allows for custom `SSLSocketFactory` configuration. If the application disables certificate validation or uses a weak trust manager when configuring the client, it becomes vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. This directly involves how `groovy-wslite` establishes secure connections.
    * **Example:** The application configures `groovy-wslite` to trust all certificates, even self-signed or invalid ones, to connect to a SOAP service. An attacker intercepts the communication and presents a malicious certificate, allowing them to eavesdrop on or modify the SOAP messages exchanged via `groovy-wslite`.
    * **Impact:**
        * Interception of sensitive data transmitted in SOAP messages (credentials, personal information, etc.).
        * Modification of SOAP messages in transit, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on the remote service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce Certificate Validation:** Ensure the application validates the server's SSL/TLS certificate when configuring `groovy-wslite`. Do not disable certificate validation in production environments.
        * **Use a Strong Trust Manager:** Use the default or a properly configured trust manager that only trusts valid and trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) when setting up `groovy-wslite`'s connection.
        * **Enforce Strong TLS Versions:** Configure the application (and potentially `groovy-wslite`'s underlying HTTP client) to use the latest and most secure TLS versions.
