# Threat Model Analysis for jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite

## Threat: [XML Injection (SOAP Payload Manipulation)](./threats/xml_injection__soap_payload_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input sanitization in the application when constructing the SOAP message. They inject malicious XML code into data fields that are incorporated into the SOAP payload. When `groovy-wslite` sends this crafted message, the injected XML can alter the intended structure or content of the request. This directly involves how the application uses `groovy-wslite` to build the request.
*   **Impact:** The injected XML can lead to the execution of unintended operations on the remote service, potentially bypassing security checks or manipulating data in unexpected ways.
*   **Affected Component:** `groovy-wslite`'s mechanisms for building and serializing SOAP requests, particularly if the application uses string concatenation or similar methods to construct the XML that is then passed to `groovy-wslite`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid string concatenation for building SOAP messages. Utilize `groovy-wslite`'s features for programmatically constructing SOAP requests, which often provide built-in encoding.
    *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided data *before* incorporating it into the SOAP message that will be sent using `groovy-wslite`. Use appropriate XML escaping or encoding techniques.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks (Response Parsing)](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__attacks__response_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious SOAP service sends a response containing an external entity declaration. If the XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` (or its underlying dependencies *during the response parsing initiated by `groovy-wslite`*) is not configured to prevent external entity processing, it will attempt to resolve the external entity, potentially leading to the disclosure of local files on the application server or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This is a direct vulnerability related to how `groovy-wslite` processes responses.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the application server or use the server to make requests to internal or external systems.
*   **Affected Component:** The XML parsing mechanism used by `groovy-wslite` to process SOAP responses. This is directly within `groovy-wslite`'s response handling logic or in a dependency it uses for XML parsing.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure the underlying XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` to disable the processing of external entities. This typically involves setting specific parser features like `XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` to `true` and disabling features related to external entities.
    *   Ensure that the dependencies used by `groovy-wslite` for XML parsing are up-to-date and do not have known XXE vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Insufficient TLS Configuration)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__insufficient_tls_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application does not enforce HTTPS for communication with the SOAP service, or if the underlying HTTP client used by `groovy-wslite` is configured to accept invalid or weak TLS certificates, an attacker can intercept the communication between the application and the SOAP service. This directly relates to how `groovy-wslite` makes network requests.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially gaining access to sensitive data within the SOAP messages (including credentials or business data). They might also be able to modify the messages in transit.
*   **Affected Component:** The underlying HTTP client used by `groovy-wslite` for making network requests, and the configuration options provided by `groovy-wslite` for setting up this client.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that the application is configured to use HTTPS for all communication with the SOAP service when using `groovy-wslite`.
    *   Configure the underlying HTTP client used by `groovy-wslite` to strictly validate server certificates and use strong TLS protocols. Avoid accepting self-signed or untrusted certificates in production environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying HTTP Client Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_http_client_library.md)

*   **Description:** `groovy-wslite` relies on an underlying HTTP client library. If this underlying library has known security vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through the network requests made by `groovy-wslite`.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the HTTP client, but it could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution, all within the context of `groovy-wslite`'s network operations.
*   **Affected Component:** The underlying HTTP client library used by `groovy-wslite`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the underlying HTTP client library used by `groovy-wslite` up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Regularly review security advisories for the specific HTTP client being used by `groovy-wslite` and update accordingly.
