# Attack Tree Analysis for jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite

Objective: Compromise the application using vulnerabilities within the `groovy-wslite` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Objective:** Compromise the application using vulnerabilities within the `groovy-wslite` library.

**Attacker Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality of the application by exploiting weaknesses in how it uses `groovy-wslite` to interact with web services.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   Compromise Application Using groovy-wslite
    *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in SOAP Request Handling
        *   Inject Malicious XML into SOAP Request
            *   XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
                *   Target SOAP service processes the malicious XXE payload, potentially leading to:
                    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (Critical Node)
                    *   Local File Disclosure (Critical Node)
        *   Exploit Insecure Handling of Attachments (IF Applicable)
            *   Attacker includes malicious content (e.g., executable files, scripts) in attachments, leading to:
                *   Remote Code Execution on the target service (Critical Node)
    *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in SOAP Response Handling
        *   XML Bomb/Billion Laughs Attack
            *   groovy-wslite's XML parsing mechanism is vulnerable to excessive resource consumption when processing such responses, leading to Denial of Service (Critical Node)
    *   Exploit Insecure Configuration or Usage of groovy-wslite
        *   Insecure Credential Management
            *   Attacker uses the compromised credentials to impersonate the application and access the web service (Critical Node)
        *   Reliance on Default or Insecure HTTP Client Settings
            *   Attacker can exploit these weaknesses through Man-in-the-Middle attacks (Critical Node)

## Attack Tree Path: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or Local File Disclosure:](./attack_tree_paths/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_leading_to_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__or_local_file_disc_9b2f78eb.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application constructs a SOAP request that includes user-controlled data within the XML structure.
    *   `groovy-wslite` processes this request without properly sanitizing the XML or disabling external entity processing.
    *   An attacker injects a malicious XML payload containing an external entity declaration.
    *   When the target SOAP service parses this malicious payload, it attempts to resolve the external entity.
    *   This can lead to:
        *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The target service makes an outbound request to a URL specified by the attacker, potentially accessing internal resources or external services.
        *   **Local File Disclosure:** The target service attempts to read a local file from its server and includes its content in the response.

## Attack Tree Path: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection leading to Local File Disclosure (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_leading_to_local_file_disclosure__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** (Same as above, focusing on the Local File Disclosure outcome)
    *   The application constructs a SOAP request that includes user-controlled data within the XML structure.
    *   `groovy-wslite` processes this request without properly sanitizing the XML or disabling external entity processing.
    *   An attacker injects a malicious XML payload containing an external entity declaration that points to a local file on the target SOAP service.
    *   When the target SOAP service parses this malicious payload, it reads the content of the specified local file and includes it in the response, exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Handling of Attachments leading to Remote Code Execution on the target service (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_handling_of_attachments_leading_to_remote_code_execution_on_the_target_service__critical_no_b318885e.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application uses `groovy-wslite` to send or receive SOAP messages with attachments.
    *   `groovy-wslite` does not properly sanitize or validate the content or metadata of these attachments.
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious attachment containing executable code or scripts.
    *   When the target SOAP service processes this attachment, it executes the malicious code, allowing the attacker to gain control of the target service.

## Attack Tree Path: [XML Bomb/Billion Laughs Attack leading to Denial of Service (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/xml_bombbillion_laughs_attack_leading_to_denial_of_service__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The target SOAP service returns a maliciously crafted XML response.
    *   This response contains deeply nested or recursively defined XML entities (an "XML bomb").
    *   `groovy-wslite`'s XML parsing mechanism is vulnerable to excessive resource consumption when attempting to parse this deeply nested structure.
    *   This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the application server as it exhausts its resources trying to process the malicious response.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Credential Management leading to Account Impersonation (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_credential_management_leading_to_account_impersonation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application stores or passes web service credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) directly within the code or configuration files used by `groovy-wslite`.
    *   An attacker gains access to these insecurely stored credentials through methods like code review, accessing configuration files, or memory dumps.
    *   The attacker then uses these compromised credentials to make requests to the web service, impersonating the legitimate application and potentially performing unauthorized actions or accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reliance on Default or Insecure HTTP Client Settings leading to Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/reliance_on_default_or_insecure_http_client_settings_leading_to_man-in-the-middle_attacks__critical__310ada36.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application relies on the default HTTP client settings provided by `groovy-wslite`.
    *   These default settings might include insecure configurations such as disabling SSL certificate verification or allowing communication over insecure protocols like HTTP instead of HTTPS.
    *   An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by intercepting the communication between the application and the web service.
    *   Because SSL certificate verification is disabled or insecure protocols are allowed, the attacker can successfully intercept and potentially modify the communication without being detected, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged.
