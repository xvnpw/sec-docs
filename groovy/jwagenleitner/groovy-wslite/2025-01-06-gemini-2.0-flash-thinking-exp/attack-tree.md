## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious XML Payload](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_xml_payload.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious XML structures into the SOAP request.

**Exploitation:**
*   **Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** If `groovy-wslite` or the underlying XML parser doesn't properly sanitize XML input, an attacker can inject external entities that, when parsed by the server, can lead to:
    *   **Read Local Files:** Accessing sensitive files on the application server.
    *   **Trigger Remote Code Execution (via SSRF):** Forcing the server to make requests to attacker-controlled external resources, potentially leading to internal network scanning or exploitation of other services.

**Critical Node: Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in XML parsing to include external entities.
*   **Impact:** Potential for sensitive data disclosure (reading local files) or achieving Remote Code Execution via Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Critical Node: Read Local Files**

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully exploiting an XXE vulnerability to access and read sensitive files on the application server.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of configuration files, secrets, credentials, or other critical information.

**Critical Node: Trigger Remote Code Execution (via SSRF)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully exploiting an XXE vulnerability to force the application server to make requests to attacker-controlled internal or external resources, leading to potential exploitation of other services or RCE.
*   **Impact:** Full control of the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into SOAP Request Parameters](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_soap_request_parameters.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious data into the parameters of the SOAP request.

**Exploitation:**
*   **Trigger SQL Injection:** If the data from the SOAP request is used in database queries without proper sanitization on the server-side.

**Critical Node: Trigger SQL Injection (if data is passed to database)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL queries through SOAP request parameters.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) in Response Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xml_external_entity__xxe__in_response_parsing.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application parses the SOAP response XML.

**Exploitation:**
*   **Read Local Files (on the application server):** If the application server itself is vulnerable and processes the response.
*   **Trigger Remote Code Execution (via SSRF from application server):** Similar to request handling, but the SSRF originates from the application server processing the malicious response.

**Critical Node: Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) in Response Parsing**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in XML response parsing to include external entities.
*   **Impact:** Potential for sensitive data disclosure (reading local files on the application server) or achieving Remote Code Execution via Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) from the application server.

**Critical Node: Read Local Files (on the application server)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully exploiting an XXE vulnerability in response parsing to access and read sensitive files on the application server.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of configuration files, secrets, credentials, or other critical information on the application server.

**Critical Node: Trigger Remote Code Execution (via SSRF from application server)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully exploiting an XXE vulnerability in response parsing to force the application server to make requests to attacker-controlled internal or external resources, leading to potential exploitation of other services or RCE on the application server.
*   **Impact:** Full control of the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deserialization of SOAP Response](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization_of_soap_response.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application deserializes objects from the SOAP response.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution on the application server.

**Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution**

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully exploiting an insecure deserialization vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the application server.
*   **Impact:** Full control of the application server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers intercept network traffic between the application and the SOAP service.

**Exploitation:**
*   **Inject Malicious Data into Requests/Responses:** Once the connection is intercepted, the attacker can modify requests and responses.

**Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data into Requests/Responses (via MitM)**

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious data into the communication stream after successfully performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, potential for further exploitation by modifying requests or injecting malicious responses.
