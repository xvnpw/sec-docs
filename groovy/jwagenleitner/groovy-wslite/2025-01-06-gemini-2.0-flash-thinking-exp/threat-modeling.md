# Threat Model Analysis for jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts a malicious SOAP request containing an XML payload with an external entity declaration. This declaration points to a local file or an external resource.
    * **How:** The vulnerable XML parser **within `groovy-wslite`** processes this declaration and attempts to fetch the specified resource.
**Impact:**
    * **Impact:**
        * **Local File Disclosure:** The attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
        * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can make the server send requests to internal or external systems.
        * **Denial of Service:** The attacker can cause resource exhaustion by referencing very large or recursively defined external entities.
**Affected Component:**
    * **Component:** The underlying XML parsing mechanism **used by `groovy-wslite`** to process SOAP requests and responses (likely within the `WslClient` or related classes handling XML).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Mitigation:** Configure the XML parser **used by `groovy-wslite`** to disable the processing of external entities. This typically involves setting the `XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING` feature to `true` or disabling features like `FEATURE_LOAD_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `FEATURE_EXTERNAL_GENERAL_ENTITIES`. Ensure the application explicitly sets these properties when creating the SOAP client or processing responses.

## Threat: [SOAP Injection](./threats/soap_injection.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious SOAP elements or attributes into the SOAP request payload.
    * **How:** This is possible if **`groovy-wslite`'s methods for constructing SOAP messages** do not properly sanitize or encode input, allowing the inclusion of malicious XML structures.
**Impact:**
    * **Impact:**
        * **Manipulation of Business Logic:** The attacker can alter the intended functionality of the remote service.
        * **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify data on the remote system.
        * **Authentication Bypass (potentially):** In some cases, depending on the remote service's implementation, the attacker might be able to craft requests that bypass authentication.
**Affected Component:**
    * **Component:** The request construction logic **within `groovy-wslite`'s methods** for creating SOAP messages (e.g., methods for setting parameters or building the XML structure).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Mitigation:** When using **`groovy-wslite`'s API** to construct SOAP requests, ensure that any user-provided data is properly encoded for XML to prevent the injection of malicious elements or attributes. Avoid directly embedding raw, unsanitized user input into the XML structure.

## Threat: [Insecure HTTP Communication (if not enforced by `groovy-wslite`'s configuration)](./threats/insecure_http_communication__if_not_enforced_by__groovy-wslite_'s_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the SOAP service if the communication is not encrypted using HTTPS.
    * **How:** By performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication. **If `groovy-wslite` is not configured to enforce HTTPS or allows fallback to HTTP**, this vulnerability is present.
**Impact:**
    * **Impact:**
        * **Exposure of Sensitive Data:**  Confidential information within the SOAP requests and responses (including credentials, business data) can be intercepted.
        * **Tampering with Data:** The attacker can modify SOAP requests in transit, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data corruption on the remote service.
**Affected Component:**
    * **Component:** The underlying HTTP client used by **`groovy-wslite`** (likely a library like Apache HttpClient) and **`groovy-wslite`'s configuration options** for specifying the endpoint URL and potentially security settings.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Mitigation:**  Ensure that when using **`groovy-wslite`**, the SOAP service endpoint is specified using `https://`. Verify that **`groovy-wslite`'s configuration** does not allow fallback to insecure HTTP connections.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_dependencies.md)

**Description:**
    * **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the libraries that **`groovy-wslite`** depends on (e.g., XML parsing libraries, HTTP client libraries).
    * **How:** By targeting these underlying vulnerabilities, the attacker can potentially compromise the application using **`groovy-wslite`**.
**Impact:**
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency but could range from information disclosure and DoS to remote code execution.
**Affected Component:**
    * **Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency library **used by `groovy-wslite`**.
**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Mitigation:** Regularly update **`groovy-wslite`** to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its dependencies. Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in the libraries **`groovy-wslite`** relies on and update them as needed.
