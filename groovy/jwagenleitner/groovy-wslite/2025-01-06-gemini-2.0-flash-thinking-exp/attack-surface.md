# Attack Surface Analysis for jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite

## Attack Surface: [SOAP Injection](./attack_surfaces/soap_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SOAP elements or attributes into requests, potentially altering the intended operation or exploiting vulnerabilities on the server-side.

**How groovy-wslite contributes to the attack surface:** If the application uses `groovy-wslite`'s API to construct SOAP requests by directly concatenating user-provided input without proper sanitization or encoding, it becomes vulnerable. The library's design and available methods for request construction play a direct role.

**Example:** An attacker could manipulate a parameter intended for a simple string value to include additional SOAP elements that execute a different function on the remote server.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data or functionality, privilege escalation on the remote server, or triggering server-side vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Parameterized Queries or Safe API Methods:** Utilize `groovy-wslite`'s features, if available, for building SOAP requests with parameterized values or methods that handle encoding, instead of manual string manipulation.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** While not directly a `groovy-wslite` feature, ensure robust input sanitization *before* passing data to `groovy-wslite` for request construction.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection during Response Processing](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_during_response_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SOAP response containing external entity references that, when parsed by the application, can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or server-side request forgery.

**How groovy-wslite contributes to the attack surface:** `groovy-wslite` uses an underlying XML parser to process SOAP responses. If this parser is not configured to disable the processing of external entities, the application becomes vulnerable. The library's choice of XML parser and its default configuration are key factors.

**Example:** A malicious SOAP response includes a reference like `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><response><data>&xxe;</data></response>`. When `groovy-wslite` parses this, it might attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files on the server, internal network scanning, or denial of service by attempting to access large external resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable External Entity Processing:** Configure the underlying XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` to disable the processing of external entities and DTDs. This often involves configuring the `SAXParserFactory` or `DocumentBuilderFactory` used by the library.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `groovy-wslite` relies on other libraries for its functionality. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be indirectly exploited through `groovy-wslite`.

**How groovy-wslite contributes to the attack surface:** By including and using these dependencies, `groovy-wslite` inherently introduces the risk of vulnerabilities present in those libraries. The specific dependencies chosen by `groovy-wslite`'s developers are the contributing factor.

**Example:** If `groovy-wslite` uses an outdated version of an HTTP client library with a known vulnerability allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks or arbitrary code execution, the application is at risk.

**Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific dependency vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the dependency)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `groovy-wslite` itself updated, as updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `groovy-wslite`'s dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Web Service Security Features (e.g., WS-Security)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_web_service_security_features__e_g___ws-security_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `groovy-wslite` to implement security features like WS-Security (for signing or encrypting SOAP messages), improper configuration or usage can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How groovy-wslite contributes to the attack surface:** The library provides the mechanisms and API for implementing these security features. Flaws or insecure defaults in `groovy-wslite`'s implementation of WS-Security directly contribute to this risk.

**Example:** Using weak cryptographic algorithms for message encryption due to `groovy-wslite`'s default settings or allowing insecure configuration options.

**Impact:**  Circumvention of authentication or authorization, exposure of sensitive data due to weak encryption, or message tampering.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Follow Security Best Practices for WS-Security:** Ensure the application utilizes `groovy-wslite`'s WS-Security features according to established security guidelines.
* **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms:** Configure `groovy-wslite` to use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms for encryption and signing.
* **Proper Key Management:**  While not solely a `groovy-wslite` issue, ensure secure key management practices are followed when using its security features.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Contextual to Library Usage)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__contextual_to_library_usage_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and the web service, potentially eavesdropping or manipulating data.

**How groovy-wslite contributes to the attack surface:** If the application, through `groovy-wslite`, doesn't enforce HTTPS or doesn't properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate, it becomes vulnerable to MitM attacks. The library's configuration options related to SSL/TLS are a direct contributing factor.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts the connection and presents a forged certificate, and `groovy-wslite`, if not configured to validate properly, accepts it.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted in the SOAP messages, manipulation of requests leading to unintended actions on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure `groovy-wslite` to only communicate over HTTPS.
* **Validate Server Certificates:** Configure `groovy-wslite` to strictly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate to prevent accepting forged certificates.
