## Attack Tree Path: [1. Deserialization Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/1__deserialization_vulnerability.md)

**1a. Crafted Payload to Exploit Known Vulnerable Class**

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object (a "payload") that, when deserialized by the application using `groovy-wslite`, triggers a vulnerability in a known vulnerable class within the application's classpath (including transitive dependencies). This often involves exploiting "gadget chains" â€“ sequences of method calls that ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on the presence of vulnerable classes and the application's handling of deserialization. Groovy's dynamic nature can increase the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires research to find suitable gadget chains or create new ones.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires understanding of serialization, object graphs, and vulnerability research.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Can be difficult to detect without specialized security tools that analyze deserialization behavior. Standard logging might not catch it.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
    *   Use a safe deserialization mechanism (e.g., whitelist-based deserialization, look-ahead deserialization).
    *   If using XML, consider a format less prone to deserialization issues (e.g., JSON with a secure parser).
    *   Keep all dependencies up-to-date.
    *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify vulnerable dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/2__xml_external_entity__xxe__vulnerability.md)

**2a. Inject External Entities to Read Files**

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious XML external entities into a SOAP/REST request processed by `groovy-wslite`. If the XML parser is misconfigured or vulnerable, the server will process these entities, potentially allowing the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on the XML parser configuration. Many modern parsers are secure by default, but misconfigurations are common. The use of `groovy-wslite` for web services increases the likelihood of XML processing.
*   **Impact:** High. Can expose sensitive data (configuration files, credentials, etc.), leading to further compromise.
*   **Effort:** Low. Basic XXE attacks are relatively easy to craft.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires understanding of XML and entities.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Might be detected by monitoring file access or network traffic. Blind XXE is harder to detect.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable DTD processing completely if it's not absolutely necessary. This is the most effective defense.
    *   If DTDs are required, disable external entity resolution.
    *   Use a secure XML parser that is configured to prevent XXE by default.
    *   Explicitly configure the XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` to be secure.
    *   Validate and sanitize all user input before it's included in XML documents.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Groovy Injection](./attack_tree_paths/3__groovy_injection.md)

**3a. Inject Groovy Code via SOAP/REST Parameters**

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious Groovy code into parameters of SOAP/REST requests handled by `groovy-wslite`. If user input is directly concatenated into the request without proper sanitization or is otherwise evaluated as Groovy code, the injected code will be executed on the server.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if proper input validation is in place), but Very High if input validation is weak or bypassed.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Successful Groovy injection leads to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Effort:** Low. Crafting the injection payload is often straightforward if input validation is weak.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate. Requires understanding of how user input is handled and basic Groovy syntax.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Might be detected by input validation or security tools that look for code injection patterns.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization. Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.
    *   Avoid using user input to construct Groovy code that is then evaluated.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if interacting with databases via Groovy.
    *   Encode output appropriately to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) if user input is displayed.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Dynamic SOAP/REST Client Creation](./attack_tree_paths/4__dynamic_soaprest_client_creation.md)

**4a. Craft Malicious Endpoint**
* **Description:** Attacker provides a URL to a malicious SOAP endpoint they control.
* **Mitigation:** Validate URLs and WSDL locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Unvalidated Input to SOAP/REST Methods](./attack_tree_paths/5__unvalidated_input_to_soaprest_methods.md)

**5a. Provide Malicious Input**
* **Description:** Attacker provides crafted input that exploits vulnerabilities in the *target* web service.
* **Mitigation:** Validate and sanitize all input, even if it's being sent to another service.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Dependency Confusion/Hijacking](./attack_tree_paths/6__dependency_confusionhijacking.md)

**6a. Leverage a known vulnerability in a transitive dependency**
* **Description:** Attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a dependency of groovy-wslite.
* **Mitigation:** Keep dependencies up-to-date, use dependency scanning tools, and pin dependency versions.
