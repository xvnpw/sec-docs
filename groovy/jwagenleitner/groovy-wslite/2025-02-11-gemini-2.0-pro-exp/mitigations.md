## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All Input Points:** List every point where `groovy-wslite` interacts with external data.  This includes request parameters, headers, request bodies (if `groovy-wslite` processes them), response bodies from external services, and any configuration files used by the library *that are then processed by Groovy*.
2.  **Define Whitelists:** For each input point, create a *whitelist* specifying exactly what is allowed. This should be as restrictive as possible.
3.  **Implement Validation:** In the code, *before* any `groovy-wslite` processing that involves Groovy evaluation, validate the input against the whitelist. Reject anything that doesn't match.
4.  **Sanitize (If Necessary):** If you *must* accept input that contains potentially dangerous characters, use appropriate escaping functions *before* passing the data to any `groovy-wslite` component that might interpret it as Groovy code.
5.  **Encoding:** Use proper encoding when handling data.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Groovy Script Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious Groovy code into parts of the application that `groovy-wslite` processes using Groovy.
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of XXE if `groovy-wslite`'s Groovy components are used to handle the XML.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Helps prevent DoS by limiting the size and complexity of input that Groovy might process.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **XXE:** Reduces the risk.
*   **DoS:** Provides some protection.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Partially implemented. Basic validation for numeric IDs in `ServiceA.getData()` where it's used in a `RESTClient` call, but no validation for XML responses in `ServiceB.processResponse()` that are then parsed with `XmlSlurper` within a `groovy-wslite` closure."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Missing validation for XML responses in `ServiceB.processResponse()` that are parsed using `XmlSlurper` within a `groovy-wslite` closure. Missing whitelist validation for the `query` parameter in `ServiceC.search()` if that parameter influences Groovy code execution within `groovy-wslite`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic Script Generation (within `groovy-wslite` usage)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_script_generation__within__groovy-wslite__usage_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Code:** Examine all code that uses `groovy-wslite`. Identify any instances where Groovy scripts or closures *passed to or used within* `groovy-wslite` are being constructed dynamically based on user input. This is the key distinction: we're focusing on Groovy code *within* the `groovy-wslite` context.
2.  **Refactor to Static Scripts:** If possible, rewrite the code to use pre-defined, static Groovy scripts or closures within the `groovy-wslite` calls.
3.  **Parameterized Approach (If Unavoidable):** If dynamic script generation within a `groovy-wslite` context is *absolutely* necessary, use a highly restricted, parameterized approach. Pass user input as *data* to the script/closure, *not* as part of the script itself.
4.  **Example (Conceptual):**
    *   **Bad (Vulnerable):**
        ```groovy
        def userInput = params.userInput // Untrusted input
        def client = new RESTClient('http://example.com')
        client.get(path: '/data') { req ->
            // DANGEROUS: Direct injection into a Groovy closure
            req.queryString "query", "someStaticText ${userInput}"
        }
        ```
    *   **Better (Parameterized):**
        ```groovy
        def userInput = params.userInput // Untrusted input
        def client = new RESTClient('http://example.com')
        client.get(path: '/data') { req ->
            // Safer: Pass userInput as a separate parameter
            req.queryString 'query', 'someStaticText'
            req.queryString 'userInput', userInput
        }
        ```
        *(The best approach depends on how the API you're calling handles parameters. The key is to avoid string concatenation that builds Groovy code.)*

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Groovy Script Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Specifically targets RCE within the Groovy code used by `groovy-wslite`.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Eliminates or drastically reduces the risk of RCE via script injection *within the `groovy-wslite` context*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Dynamic script generation is avoided in all `RESTClient` closures. SOAP requests in `ServiceD` use a parameterized approach within the `groovy-wslite` closures."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Dynamic script generation is used within the closure passed to `RESTClient.get()` in `ServiceE.generateReport()`, directly incorporating user input into the Groovy script that processes the response."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable External Entities and DTDs (for XML *within* `groovy-wslite`)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_external_entities_and_dtds__for_xml_within__groovy-wslite__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify XML Parsing within `groovy-wslite`:** Locate all instances where `groovy-wslite`'s Groovy components (e.g., closures, `XmlSlurper` used within a `RESTClient` or `SOAPClient` context) are used to parse XML data.  This is crucial: we're focusing on XML parsing *done by Groovy code within the `groovy-wslite` usage*.
2.  **Configure XML Parser:** Modify the code to explicitly configure the underlying XML parser *used within the `groovy-wslite` context* to disable external entities and DTDs.
    ```groovy
    // Example (adjust as needed - this is within a groovy-wslite context)
    def client = new RESTClient('http://example.com')
    client.parser.'text/xml' = { resp, reader ->
        def factory = javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory.newInstance()
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false)
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false)
        factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true)
        def parser = factory.newSAXParser()
        // Use the configured parser within XmlSlurper or similar
        def root = new XmlSlurper(parser).parse(reader)
        return root
    }
    ```
3.  **Test:** Thoroughly test.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** (Severity: High) - Prevents XXE attacks where the XML parsing is handled by Groovy code within `groovy-wslite`.

**Impact:**
*   **XXE:** Effectively eliminates the risk of XXE attacks if implemented correctly *within the `groovy-wslite` context*.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "External entities and DTDs are disabled for all XML parsing done by `XmlSlurper` within `RESTClient` response closures."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "XML parsing within the `groovy-wslite` closure in `LegacySOAPClient.handleResponse()` does not disable external entities."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Timeouts and Response Size Limits (within `groovy-wslite` calls)](./mitigation_strategies/set_timeouts_and_response_size_limits__within__groovy-wslite__calls_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Network Calls:** Locate all instances where `groovy-wslite` makes network requests (e.g., `RESTClient`, `SOAPClient`).
2.  **Set Timeouts:** Configure timeouts for all network requests *made by `groovy-wslite`*.
    ```groovy
    def client = new RESTClient('http://example.com')
    client.timeout = 5000 // 5 seconds
    ```
3.  **Set Response Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size of responses that `groovy-wslite` will process, *especially if those responses are then processed by Groovy code*. This is often done *within* the `groovy-wslite` closures.
4. **Test:** Verify.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents DoS attacks that rely on slow or excessively large responses being processed by `groovy-wslite`'s Groovy components.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Timeouts are set for all `RESTClient` instances. Response size limits are checked within the response processing closures for REST responses in `ServiceA`."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "No response size limits are implemented for SOAP responses processed by Groovy code within `groovy-wslite` closures. Timeouts are not set for `LegacySOAPClient`."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing (of Groovy code *within* `groovy-wslite`)](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing__of_groovy_code_within__groovy-wslite__.md)

**Description:**
1. **Assess Necessity:** Determine if dynamic Groovy execution *within the `groovy-wslite` context* is absolutely necessary.
2. **Choose a Sandboxing Technique:** If dynamic Groovy execution *within `groovy-wslite`* is required, use `SecureASTCustomizer`.  This is the most direct way to control the Groovy code executed as part of `groovy-wslite`'s operation.
    ```groovy
    import org.codehaus.groovy.control.customizers.SecureASTCustomizer
    import org.codehaus.groovy.control.CompilerConfiguration

    def secure = new SecureASTCustomizer()
    // ... configure SecureASTCustomizer as shown in previous examples ...

    def config = new CompilerConfiguration()
    config.addCompilationCustomizers(secure)

    // Example using RESTClient (apply the configuration to the GroovyShell)
    def client = new RESTClient('http://example.com', config) // Pass the config

    client.get(path: '/data') { req ->
        // The closure here will be executed in the sandboxed environment
        // ...
    }
    ```
3. **Restrict Permissions:** Carefully configure the sandbox.
4. **Test Thoroughly:** Extensively test.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Groovy Script Injection:** (Severity: Critical) - Significantly reduces the risk, even if malicious code is injected into the Groovy portions of `groovy-wslite`'s operation.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Provides a strong layer of defense.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Example: "Sandboxing is implemented using `SecureASTCustomizer` for all Groovy closures used within `RESTClient` calls. File system and network access are disabled within those closures."

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Example: "Sandboxing is not currently implemented for Groovy code used within `SOAPClient` calls. We should apply `SecureASTCustomizer` to the Groovy closures used for processing SOAP responses."
