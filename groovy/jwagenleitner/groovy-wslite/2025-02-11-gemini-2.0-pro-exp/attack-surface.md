# Attack Surface Analysis for jwagenleitner/groovy-wslite

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Groovy Script Injection](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via_groovy_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Execution of arbitrary Groovy code on the server due to attacker-influenced input being evaluated by the `groovy-wslite` library or within a Groovy context related to its operation.  This is the most direct and severe threat related to the library's core functionality.
*   **How `groovy-wslite` Contributes:** The library's fundamental design relies on executing Groovy code to handle web service requests and responses.  This inherent dynamic nature creates the vulnerability if input is not meticulously sanitized.  `groovy-wslite` *directly* executes the potentially malicious Groovy code.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a SOAP or REST response to include a Groovy script snippet:  `{"data": "123; Runtime.getRuntime().exec('rm -rf /');"}`.  If this response field is used directly within a Groovy closure or expression (e.g., `response.data.toInteger() + 5`), the injected `Runtime.getRuntime().exec('rm -rf /')` code will be executed.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker could gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, modify files, and potentially pivot to other systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Whitelist):**  Validate *all* data received from external services using a strict whitelist approach. Only allow known-good characters and patterns. Reject any input that doesn't conform.  This is the most crucial preventative measure.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Groovy with External Data:**  Refactor the code to *eliminate* the use of dynamic Groovy code that incorporates data from external sources. Use `groovy-wslite` *only* for data retrieval and parsing. Perform data manipulation and any logic that might involve evaluation using safer methods (e.g., Java code, static Groovy methods that do not evaluate external input).  This is the most effective long-term solution.
    *   **Secure Configuration:** Ensure that configuration values (endpoints, headers, request bodies, etc.) are loaded from trusted sources and are not susceptible to attacker modification. Validate configuration data before use, treating it as potentially malicious.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful RCE.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider running the Groovy code within a secure sandbox that restricts its capabilities (e.g., limiting file system access, network access, system calls). This is a complex but highly effective mitigation, providing a strong layer of defense even if input validation fails.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (SOAP Specific)](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__soap_specific_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` to process SOAP requests, allowing an attacker to access local files, perform SSRF, or cause a DoS. This is specific to the SOAP client functionality of `groovy-wslite`.
    *   **How `groovy-wslite` Contributes:** When used with SOAP services, `groovy-wslite` *directly* utilizes an XML parser to handle the SOAP messages. The library's choice and configuration of the XML parser determine the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted SOAP request containing: `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><foo>&xxe;</foo>`. If the parser used by `groovy-wslite` is vulnerable, it will attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file and include its contents in the response.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive files), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable External Entities and DTDs:** Configure the underlying XML parser used by `groovy-wslite` to *explicitly* disable the resolution of external entities and DTDs. This is the primary and most crucial defense against XXE. The specific configuration method depends on the XML parser being used.  You must ensure that `groovy-wslite` is using a parser configured in this way.  This often involves setting specific properties or features on the parser factory. For example:
            ```groovy
            // Example (may need adjustment based on the specific parser)
            def factory = javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory.newInstance()
            factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false)
            factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false)
            factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true)
            // ... use this factory when creating the SOAP client ...
            ```
        *   **Use a Secure XML Parser:** If possible, explicitly configure `groovy-wslite` to use a known-secure XML parser that is configured to prevent XXE attacks by default. Research and choose a parser with a strong security record.
