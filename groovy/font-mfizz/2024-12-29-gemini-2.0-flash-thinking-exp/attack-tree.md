## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using font-mfizz - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise application using font-mfizz by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using font-mfizz
    * **AND Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities**
        * **OR Inject Malicious SVG Content**  --> HIGH-RISK PATH
            * **Directly Provide Malicious SVG**
                * Application allows user-uploaded SVGs processed by font-mfizz
    * AND Exploit Font Generation Vulnerabilities
        * **OR Introduce Malicious Code via Font Glyphs** --> HIGH-RISK PATH
            * Craft SVG that, when converted to glyphs, contains exploitable data
                * Exploitable by specific font rendering engines or client-side code
    * **AND Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities**
        * **OR Serve Malicious Font File** --> HIGH-RISK PATH
            * Attacker can replace the generated font file with a malicious one
        * **OR Exploit Font File Format Vulnerabilities** --> HIGH-RISK PATH
            * Craft SVG that results in a font file with format-specific vulnerabilities
                * Exploitable by the browser's font rendering engine
                    * Leads to code execution or information disclosure

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Node: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities**

* This node is critical because it represents the initial point where an attacker can introduce malicious data into the font-mfizz processing pipeline. Successful exploitation here can lead to various downstream attacks.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious SVG Content -> Directly Provide Malicious SVG**

* **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to upload SVG files that are subsequently processed by font-mfizz, an attacker can craft a malicious SVG file and upload it.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Embedding `<script>` tags or event handlers within the SVG that execute malicious JavaScript in the user's browser when the icon font is rendered.
    * **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:**  Including external entity declarations in the SVG that, if not properly parsed, can allow the attacker to access local files on the server or internal network resources.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crafting SVG files with excessive complexity or recursive structures that consume significant server resources during processing, leading to a denial of service.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Font Generation Vulnerabilities -> Introduce Malicious Code via Font Glyphs**

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker with a deep understanding of font file formats and rendering engines can craft a specific SVG file that, when processed by font-mfizz and converted into font glyphs, contains data that can be interpreted as executable code or trigger vulnerabilities in the font rendering engine.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **Font Rendering Engine Exploits:** Specific vulnerabilities in browser font rendering engines could be triggered by carefully crafted glyph data, potentially leading to code execution on the client's machine.
    * **Client-Side Code Exploitation:**  While less direct, the crafted glyph data might interact unexpectedly with client-side JavaScript, potentially leading to security issues.

**Critical Node: Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities**

* This node is critical because it represents the final stage where an attacker can influence the resources delivered to the client's browser, potentially leading to direct compromise.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities -> Serve Malicious Font File**

* **Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the server or Content Delivery Network (CDN) where the generated font files are stored, they can replace the legitimate font file with a malicious one.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **Client-Side Code Execution:** The malicious font file could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's font rendering engine, leading to arbitrary code execution on the client's machine when the application attempts to load the font.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Font File Format Vulnerabilities**

* **Attack Vector:** By carefully crafting the input SVG, an attacker can influence the font generation process of font-mfizz to create a font file that conforms to the font format specification but contains subtle vulnerabilities or unexpected data structures.
* **Potential Exploits:**
    * **Font Rendering Engine Exploits:** These crafted font files can trigger specific vulnerabilities in the browser's font rendering engine when the browser attempts to parse and render the font, potentially leading to:
        * **Code Execution:** Executing arbitrary code on the client's machine.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Leaking sensitive information from the client's browser process.
