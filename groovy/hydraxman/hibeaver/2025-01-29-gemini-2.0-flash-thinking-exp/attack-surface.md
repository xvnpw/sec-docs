# Attack Surface Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Route Definitions](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_route_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can access files or directories outside the intended application scope by manipulating route paths.
*   **Hibeaver Contribution:** Hibeaver's routing mechanism, if it allows overly flexible route definitions or lacks proper path normalization, can enable developers to unintentionally create vulnerable routes. If Hibeaver doesn't enforce secure route definition practices or provides insufficient tools for path sanitization within routes, it directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A route defined as `/files/{filepath}` where `filepath` is directly used to access files. If Hibeaver's routing doesn't prevent it, an attacker could request `/files/../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access sensitive system files.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive files, potential for further system compromise if configuration or executable files are accessed.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Carefully design routes and strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used in file paths within route handlers. Avoid directly using raw route parameters for file system operations.
    *   **Framework (Hibeaver):** Implement robust path normalization within the routing mechanism to automatically prevent traversal attempts. Provide clear documentation and secure coding examples for route definitions, emphasizing path sanitization and validation.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection in Route Paths](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_in_route_paths.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious payloads through route parameters within the URL path, exploiting insecure parameter parsing or usage in backend operations.
*   **Hibeaver Contribution:** If Hibeaver's route parameter parsing is not robust and allows for injection, or if the framework design encourages developers to directly use route parameters in sensitive operations (like database queries or system commands) without explicit security considerations. If Hibeaver lacks built-in mechanisms or clear guidance for secure parameter handling in routes, it increases this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A route `/users/{id}` where `id` is directly embedded into an SQL query. If Hibeaver doesn't warn against this or provide secure alternatives, an attacker could request `/users/1' OR '1'='1 --` to inject SQL code and potentially bypass authentication or extract data.
*   **Impact:** SQL Injection, Command Injection, or other injection vulnerabilities, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Treat route parameters as untrusted input. Always sanitize and validate route parameters before using them in backend operations, especially database queries or system commands. Utilize parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Framework (Hibeaver):** Provide strong guidance and best practices for secure parameter handling within routes. Consider offering built-in sanitization or validation utilities for route parameters.  Discourage direct parameter interpolation into sensitive operations in framework documentation and examples.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Parsing Vulnerabilities (Specifically XXE and Memory Corruption)](./attack_surfaces/request_body_parsing_vulnerabilities__specifically_xxe_and_memory_corruption_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the libraries or methods Hibeaver uses to parse request bodies (e.g., JSON, XML, form data) can lead to severe attacks like XML External Entity injection or memory corruption.
*   **Hibeaver Contribution:** Hibeaver's choice of parsing libraries and its integration with them. If Hibeaver uses vulnerable parsing libraries by default, or if it doesn't provide secure configuration options for parsing (like disabling XXE processing in XML), it directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:**
    *   **XXE:** If Hibeaver uses an XML parser without disabling external entity processing by default, an attacker can send a malicious XML payload containing external entity definitions to read local files or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Memory Corruption:** If Hibeaver uses a parsing library with buffer overflow vulnerabilities and doesn't implement sufficient input size limits or validation, sending specially crafted large or malformed request bodies could lead to memory corruption and potentially Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection leading to information disclosure or SSRF, Memory Corruption potentially leading to Denial of Service or Remote Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for Memory Corruption and XXE leading to RCE), High (for XXE leading to information disclosure or SSRF)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Be aware of the parsing libraries used by Hibeaver, especially for XML. Ensure Hibeaver and its dependencies are updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developer:** When handling XML, explicitly disable external entity processing in the XML parser configuration. Implement input validation and size limits on request bodies.
    *   **Framework (Hibeaver):** Use secure and up-to-date parsing libraries. For XML parsing, ensure external entity processing is disabled by default or provide clear configuration options to disable it.  Document secure parsing practices and highlight the risks of XXE and memory corruption.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws or vulnerabilities in custom or built-in middleware components can introduce significant security weaknesses, potentially bypassing core security mechanisms.
*   **Hibeaver Contribution:** Hibeaver's middleware system design and the potential for developers to create insecure middleware. If Hibeaver's middleware API is complex or lacks clear security guidelines, it can lead to developers creating vulnerable middleware. If Hibeaver itself includes vulnerable built-in middleware, it directly introduces this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A poorly written custom authentication middleware in Hibeaver might contain logic flaws that allow unauthorized users to bypass authentication checks. A vulnerable built-in middleware in Hibeaver could have an XSS vulnerability that affects all applications using it.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of critical security controls (authentication, authorization), introduction of new vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection if middleware interacts with databases), potentially leading to full application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature and impact of the middleware vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly test and security review all custom middleware components. Follow secure coding practices when developing middleware.  Minimize the complexity of custom middleware and reuse well-vetted libraries where possible.
    *   **Developer:** Carefully evaluate and audit any third-party or community middleware used with Hibeaver.
    *   **Framework (Hibeaver):** Design the middleware system to be robust and easy to use securely. Provide clear and comprehensive guidelines and secure coding examples for writing middleware.  Thoroughly security test all built-in middleware components.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Hibeaver, like most frameworks, relies on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly and critically impact applications built on Hibeaver.
*   **Hibeaver Contribution:** Hibeaver's dependency management and the specific libraries it chooses to depend on. If Hibeaver relies on outdated or vulnerable libraries, or if it doesn't provide clear dependency information and update guidance, it directly contributes to this attack surface. Transitive dependencies also fall under this category.
*   **Example:** Hibeaver depends on an older version of a widely used library that is later discovered to have a critical Remote Code Execution vulnerability. Applications using Hibeaver become vulnerable through this transitive dependency.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure, or other severe impacts depending on the vulnerability in the dependency.  This can affect all applications using the vulnerable Hibeaver version.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if dependencies have RCE or other critical vulnerabilities), High (for other serious vulnerabilities in dependencies)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Regularly check for and update to the latest versions of Hibeaver and all its dependencies. Use dependency scanning tools to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   **Framework (Hibeaver):** Maintain a clear and up-to-date list of dependencies. Regularly audit and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.  Proactively communicate security updates and encourage users to upgrade to patched versions. Consider using dependency vulnerability scanning tools as part of the Hibeaver development and release process.
