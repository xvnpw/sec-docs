# Threat Model Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Threat: [Tampering with Audit Logs](./threats/tampering_with_audit_logs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., compromised database administrator account, compromised application account with write access to audit tables) directly modifies or deletes audit logs in the database. This is done to conceal malicious activities, manipulate historical records, or disrupt audit trails.  While not *caused* by Hibeaver code itself, the *value* of the audit logs created by Hibeaver makes them a target, and improper database security directly impacts the integrity of Hibeaver's audit trail.
*   **Impact:** Loss of audit trail integrity, inability to detect security breaches or fraud, compromised accountability, regulatory non-compliance, undermining trust in audit data.
*   **Hibeaver Component Affected:** Database Storage (Audit Tables), Data Integrity (Indirectly affected by database security)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict separation of duties and least privilege for database access.
    *   Consider Write-Once Read-Many (WORM) storage for audit logs if required by regulations or security policy.
    *   Utilize database-level audit trails or triggers to monitor and protect audit log integrity.
    *   Regularly monitor audit logs for suspicious modifications or deletions.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for database and application administrative functions.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Hibeaver Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_hibeaver_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered security vulnerabilities exist within the Hibeaver library code. If exploited, these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to bypass audit logging, manipulate audit data, cause application crashes, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the application or underlying system. This is a direct threat stemming from the Hibeaver library itself.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, integrity issues, availability issues, potential full system compromise depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Hibeaver Component Affected:** Hibeaver Library (Core Code)
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with Hibeaver releases and security advisories.
    *   Regularly update Hibeaver library to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor security vulnerability databases and mailing lists for reports related to Hibeaver or Hibernate Envers.
    *   Consider using static and dynamic code analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application and its dependencies, including Hibeaver.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process for third-party libraries.
