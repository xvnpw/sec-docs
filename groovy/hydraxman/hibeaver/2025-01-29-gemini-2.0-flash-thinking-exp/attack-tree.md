## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration via Crawled Data](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration_via_crawled_data.md)

**Description:** This attack path focuses on extracting sensitive information from the application by leveraging Hibeaver to crawl and retrieve data from targeted URLs. The attacker aims to indirectly access data they shouldn't have direct access to, by manipulating the application's crawling functionality.

* **1.1. High-Risk Sub-Path: Crawl Sensitive Data**

    * **Description:** Within Data Exfiltration, this sub-path specifically targets scenarios where the attacker can instruct the application to crawl URLs that are known or suspected to contain sensitive information.

    * **1.1.1. Critical Node: Target URLs Containing Sensitive Information**

        * **Attack Vector Description:**
            * **Attack Description:** The attacker identifies URLs that, while publicly accessible, contain sensitive data. This could include accidentally exposed documents, internal dashboards with weak security, or publicly available but confidential information. The attacker then provides these URLs as input to the application's crawling functionality, instructing Hibeaver to fetch and potentially store this sensitive data.
            * **Vulnerability Exploited:**  Insufficient input validation and sanitization of URLs provided to the crawling function. Lack of URL whitelisting or blacklisting. Over-permissive crawling configuration in the application.
            * **Potential Impact:**  Confidentiality breach, data exfiltration of sensitive personal information (PII), financial data, trade secrets, or internal company documents. Reputational damage, legal and regulatory penalties, financial losses.
            * **Mitigation Strategies:**
                * **Strict URL Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of all URLs provided for crawling.
                * **URL Whitelisting:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed domains or URL patterns that the application is permitted to crawl. Reject any URLs outside of this whitelist.
                * **Principle of Least Privilege for Crawling:**  Ensure the crawling process runs with the minimum necessary permissions. Isolate the crawling component if possible.
                * **Regular Security Audits of Crawling Targets:** Periodically review the URLs being crawled and the data collected to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently being processed.
                * **Data Minimization:** Only crawl and store the data that is absolutely necessary for the application's intended functionality. Avoid broad, indiscriminate crawling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Integrity Compromise via Crawled Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/data_integrity_compromise_via_crawled_data_manipulation.md)

**Description:** This attack path focuses on compromising the integrity of the application's data and potentially its users by manipulating the content of websites crawled by Hibeaver. The attacker aims to inject malicious content that will be processed and potentially executed by the application or its users.

* **4.1. High-Risk Sub-Path: Inject Malicious Content via Crawled Data**

    * **Description:** Within Data Integrity Compromise, this sub-path specifically targets scenarios where the attacker leverages Hibeaver to crawl websites that can be manipulated to contain malicious content, and then exploits the application's lack of sanitization of this crawled content.

    * **4.1.2. Critical Node: Exploit Application's Lack of Sanitization of Crawled Data**

        * **Attack Vector Description:**
            * **Attack Description:** The attacker targets websites, especially those allowing user-generated content (forums, blogs, comment sections), to inject malicious content such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads, malicious links, or other harmful code. When Hibeaver crawls these manipulated pages, it retrieves this malicious content. If the application then uses this crawled data without proper sanitization, for example, by displaying it to users or using it in dynamic web pages, the injected malicious content can be executed in the context of the application or the user's browser.
            * **Vulnerability Exploited:**  Lack of output sanitization of crawled data within the application. Failure to properly encode or escape crawled content before displaying it or using it in contexts where it could be interpreted as code (HTML, JavaScript).
            * **Potential Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement, client-side malware injection, and other client-side vulnerabilities. Data corruption if malicious data is processed and stored without validation.
            * **Mitigation Strategies:**
                * **Mandatory Output Sanitization:**  **Critically important:** Sanitize *all* crawled data before displaying it to users or using it in any context where it could be interpreted as code. Use appropriate output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping) based on the context of use.
                * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy to further mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities, even if sanitization is missed. CSP can restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the effectiveness of injected malicious scripts.
                * **Regular Security Testing for XSS:** Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and remediate any potential XSS vulnerabilities related to crawled data.
                * **Input Validation (of Crawled Data - to a degree):** While output sanitization is paramount, consider some level of input validation on the *structure* of crawled data to detect and reject obviously malicious or malformed content before further processing. However, rely primarily on output sanitization for security.
