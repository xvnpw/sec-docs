# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Hibeaver, aims to provide a simplified interface for interacting with Honeycomb, a popular observability platform. It likely targets developers and operations teams who want to leverage Honeycomb's capabilities for monitoring and troubleshooting their applications but seek a more user-friendly or streamlined experience.

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Goal: Simplify observability workflows for developers and operations teams using Honeycomb.
- Goal: Reduce the learning curve and complexity associated with direct Honeycomb API interaction.
- Goal: Potentially offer a more tailored or opinionated approach to observability compared to the raw Honeycomb platform.
- Priority: User experience and ease of use are paramount to drive adoption.
- Priority: Reliability and accuracy of data relayed to Honeycomb are crucial for effective observability.

Business Risks:

- Risk: Data loss or corruption during the translation or relay of observability data to Honeycomb, leading to inaccurate insights and potentially impacting incident response.
- Risk: Performance bottlenecks in Hibeaver that could delay or impede the flow of observability data, reducing the real-time visibility of application behavior.
- Risk: Security vulnerabilities in Hibeaver that could expose sensitive observability data or provide unauthorized access to Honeycomb or the monitored systems.
- Risk: Lack of adoption if the simplified interface does not adequately address user needs or if it introduces new complexities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
- security control: Potentially using standard library security features in the chosen programming language (Go, based on repository content). (Implemented: Within application code)

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on open-source components and libraries, with potential vulnerabilities that may not be immediately identified or patched.
- accepted risk: Initial versions might lack comprehensive security testing and penetration testing.
- accepted risk: Security configurations might be based on default settings and require hardening.

Recommended Security Controls:

- recommended security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- recommended security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- recommended security control: Enforce code review processes, including security-focused reviews, before merging code changes.
- recommended security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of Hibeaver itself to detect and respond to security incidents.
- recommended security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Hibeaver should authenticate users accessing its interface.
    - security requirement: Authentication mechanism should be secure and resistant to common attacks (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).
    - security requirement: Consider using existing identity providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) for authentication to simplify management and improve security.

- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Hibeaver should implement authorization to control user access to different features and data within the application.
    - security requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be considered to manage permissions effectively.
    - security requirement: Authorization should be enforced at the API level to prevent unauthorized actions.

- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: All inputs to Hibeaver, especially API requests and user interface inputs, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - security requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.
    - security requirement: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.

- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Sensitive data at rest (if any is stored) should be encrypted.
    - security requirement: Communication between Hibeaver components and external systems (e.g., Honeycomb API, monitored applications) should be encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
    - security requirement: Secrets management should be implemented to securely store and access API keys, credentials, and other sensitive information. Avoid hardcoding secrets in the codebase.

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Version Control System (VCS), which is GitHub in this case.
2. The CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by code changes.
3. The Build & Test stage compiles the code, runs unit tests, and creates build artifacts (e.g., container images).
4. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is performed on the codebase to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
5. Dependency Scanning is performed to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the project.
6. If all security checks pass, the build artifacts (container images) are pushed to a Container Registry.
7. The Deployment stage pulls the container images from the Container Registry and deploys them to the Deployment Environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).

- security control: Secure storage of build artifacts in a private Container Registry with access control (Implemented: Container Registry configuration).
- security control: Immutable infrastructure and infrastructure-as-code to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments (Implemented: Infrastructure automation).
- security control: Principle of least privilege applied to CI/CD pipeline permissions and access to build artifacts and deployment environments (Implemented: CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure configuration).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Ensuring application observability for performance monitoring and incident response.
- Maintaining the availability and reliability of the monitoring system itself (Hibeaver).
- Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of observability data.

Data Sensitivity:

- Observability data (metrics, traces, logs) collected by Hibeaver.
- Sensitivity: Moderate to High. While not directly PII, observability data can contain sensitive information about application behavior, performance, and potentially business logic. Exposure or manipulation of this data could lead to:
    - Business disruption due to inaccurate monitoring and delayed incident response.
    - Competitive disadvantage if performance insights are revealed to competitors.
    - Security breaches if observability data reveals vulnerabilities in applications.
    - Compliance issues depending on the type of data logged and industry regulations.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
