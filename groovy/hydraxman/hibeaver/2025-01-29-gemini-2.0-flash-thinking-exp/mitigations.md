        *   **Tampering with Hibeaver Audit Logs:** Medium impact. Reduces the risk of tampering with the audit trail, maintaining its integrity as much as possible through access controls.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. `hibeaver` audit logs are stored in the application database, which has general database access controls, but not specifically tailored for audit logs.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No dedicated secure storage specifically for `hibeaver` audit logs, separate from general application data.
        *   Granular role-based access control *specifically* for `hibeaver` audit logs is not implemented.
        *   No formal process for regularly reviewing and auditing access to `hibeaver` audit logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encrypt Hibeaver Audit Logs at Rest and in Transit](./mitigation_strategies/encrypt_hibeaver_audit_logs_at_rest_and_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Encryption at Rest for Hibeaver Logs:** Implement encryption for `hibeaver` audit logs when they are stored. This could involve database encryption features for the audit log tables, file system encryption for log files, or dedicated encryption solutions for the chosen log storage.
    2.  **Encryption in Transit for Hibeaver Logs:** Ensure that `hibeaver` audit logs are encrypted when transmitted to a separate storage location or when accessed remotely. Use secure protocols like HTTPS or TLS for web-based log access or secure transport protocols for log shipping.
    3.  **Key Management for Hibeaver Log Encryption:** Implement secure key management practices specifically for encryption keys used to protect `hibeaver` audit logs. Store keys securely, rotate them regularly, and control access to these keys.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Hibeaver Audit Logs (Data Breach):** Protects the confidentiality of `hibeaver` audit logs even if the storage media or communication channels are compromised (Severity: High - Confidentiality breach of audit data).
        *   **Information Disclosure via Hibeaver Audit Logs:** Reduces the risk of sensitive information being exposed from `hibeaver` logs if they are intercepted or accessed without authorization (Severity: Medium - Confidentiality breach).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Hibeaver Audit Logs (Data Breach):** High impact. Encryption is a strong defense, making `hibeaver` logs unreadable to unauthorized parties even if they gain access to the storage.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Hibeaver Audit Logs:** High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of information disclosure from compromised `hibeaver` logs by rendering them unusable without decryption.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented. `hibeaver` audit logs are currently stored in the database without specific encryption at rest. Transit encryption (HTTPS) is used for web application access, but not specifically for log access.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No encryption at rest specifically for `hibeaver` audit logs in the database or dedicated log storage.
        *   No specific encryption mechanisms for `hibeaver` log data in transit beyond general application HTTPS.
        *   No formal key management strategy for `hibeaver` audit log encryption.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Regular Review and Monitoring of Hibeaver Audit Logs](./mitigation_strategies/implement_regular_review_and_monitoring_of_hibeaver_audit_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Review Schedule for Hibeaver Logs:** Define a regular schedule for reviewing audit logs *specifically generated by `hibeaver`* (e.g., daily, weekly).
    2.  **Define Review Process for Hibeaver Logs:** Establish a clear process for reviewing `hibeaver` logs. This may involve manual review by security personnel or automated analysis using SIEM or log analysis tools, focusing on the specific format and content of `hibeaver` logs.
    3.  **Identify Key Events in Hibeaver Logs:** Define specific events within `hibeaver` logs to focus on during review, such as unauthorized data modifications tracked by `hibeaver`, suspicious entity changes, or audit log anomalies.
    4.  **Automated Monitoring for Hibeaver Logs (Consider):** Implement automated monitoring and alerting for critical security events *detected within `hibeaver` audit logs*. This allows for real-time detection and response to security incidents related to data changes being audited by `hibeaver`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Security Incidents (Delayed Detection related to Audited Data):** Enables timely detection of security incidents and malicious activities *related to data changes tracked by `hibeaver`* by actively monitoring its audit trails (Severity: High - can prevent or minimize damage from attacks on data integrity).
        *   **Policy Violations (related to data access and modification):** Helps identify and address violations of security policies or compliance requirements *related to data access and modification events audited by `hibeaver`* (Severity: Medium - Compliance, Governance related to data integrity and access).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Security Incidents (Delayed Detection related to Audited Data):** High impact. Significantly reduces the time to detect and respond to security incidents *affecting data integrity and tracked by `hibeaver`*, minimizing potential damage and data loss.
        *   **Policy Violations (related to data access and modification):** Medium impact. Improves compliance and governance by providing visibility into data modification activities audited by `hibeaver` and enabling proactive identification of policy breaches related to data handling.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not implemented. No regular or systematic review of `hibeaver` audit logs is currently performed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No defined schedule or process for reviewing `hibeaver` audit logs specifically.
        *   No automated monitoring or alerting for security events *within `hibeaver` audit logs*.
        *   `hibeaver` audit log review is not integrated into the incident response plan.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Minimization in Hibeaver Audit Logging Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/data_minimization_in_hibeaver_audit_logging_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Hibeaver Audit Requirements:** Clearly define what data *needs* to be audited by `hibeaver` based on security, compliance, and operational requirements. Avoid enabling auditing for all entities and all fields by default.
    2.  **Review Hibeaver Audit Configuration:** Review the `hibeaver` configuration (e.g., entity annotations, programmatic configuration) to ensure you are only logging necessary information through `hibeaver`.
    3.  **Exclude Sensitive Data from Hibeaver Auditing (If Possible):**  Avoid using `hibeaver` to audit highly sensitive data (like passwords, full credit card numbers, or personal health information) unless absolutely essential and with strong justification and controls. Consider auditing changes to entities containing sensitive data but excluding the sensitive fields themselves from audit logging if feasible.
    4.  **Regularly Re-evaluate Hibeaver Audit Scope:** Periodically re-evaluate your `hibeaver` audit logging requirements and configuration to ensure data minimization is still being practiced and that you are not logging unnecessary information through `hibeaver`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Hibeaver Audit Logs:** Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data if `hibeaver` audit logs are compromised by minimizing the amount of sensitive data stored in these logs (Severity: Medium - Confidentiality breach).
        *   **Hibeaver Log Storage Overload:** Minimizes the volume of `hibeaver` audit logs generated, reducing storage requirements and potential performance impact *related to `hibeaver`'s logging activities* (Severity: Low - Availability, Performance of audit logging).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure via Hibeaver Audit Logs:** Medium impact. Reduces the potential damage from a `hibeaver` log breach by limiting the amount of sensitive information exposed within `hibeaver` logs.
        *   **Hibeaver Log Storage Overload:** Low impact. Primarily improves efficiency of `hibeaver` logging and reduces storage costs for audit data, with a minor security benefit by reducing the attack surface of `hibeaver` log data.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Some consideration is given to what entities and fields are audited by `hibeaver`, but no formal data minimization policy or review process *specifically for `hibeaver` auditing* is in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal data minimization policy for `hibeaver` audit logging configuration.
        *   No regular review of `hibeaver` audit logging configuration to ensure data minimization.
        *   Potential for over-auditing and inclusion of unnecessary sensitive data in `hibeaver` audit logs.
