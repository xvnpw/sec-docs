**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [HR] [CN] Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities**

*   **[HR] [CN] Inject Malicious Input via Prompts/Forms**
    *   **[HR] [CN] Execute Arbitrary Commands (Command Injection)**
        *   **Description:** If Hibeaver provides mechanisms for applications to take user input, and this input is directly used in system calls or passed to external processes without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Common mistake if input isn't sanitized)
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Full system compromise possible)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple to attempt with common command injection payloads)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice (Basic understanding of command injection)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with proper input validation and monitoring)
        *   **Conditions:** Application uses Hibeaver input directly in system calls; Hibeaver doesn't sanitize input before passing to external processes.

*   **[HR] [CN] Exploit Format String Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** If Hibeaver uses user-provided input in format strings (e.g., for logging or displaying messages) without proper sanitization, attackers can leverage format string vulnerabilities to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Less common in modern code but possible)
    *   **Impact:** High (Memory read/write, potential code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of format string syntax)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires some technical knowledge)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with static analysis and careful logging)
    *   **Conditions:** Hibeaver uses unsanitized user input in format strings (e.g., logging).

*   **[HR] [CN] Trigger Buffer Overflow in Input Processing**
    *   **Description:** If Hibeaver doesn't properly handle the length of user input, sending excessively long input could lead to buffer overflows, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on Hibeaver's input handling implementation)
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential code execution, denial of service)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of buffer overflow concepts and potentially crafting specific payloads)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires technical knowledge of memory management)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with memory safety checks and anomaly detection)
    *   **Conditions:** Sending excessively long input to Hibeaver components.

**2. [HR] [CN] Exploit Rendering/Display Vulnerabilities**

*   **[HR] [CN] Inject Malicious Terminal Escape Sequences**
    *   **Description:** Terminal emulators interpret special escape sequences to control formatting, colors, and even execute commands. If Hibeaver doesn't sanitize output containing user-controlled data, attackers can inject malicious escape sequences.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common in terminal applications if not careful)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Can execute commands, manipulate display, potentially phish users)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Simple to inject common escape sequences)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (Basic understanding of terminal escape codes)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by monitoring for unusual escape sequences)
    *   **Conditions:** Hibeaver doesn't sanitize output containing user-controlled data.

**3. [HR] [CN] Exploit Dependencies or Underlying Libraries (Specific to Hibeaver's Implementation)**

*   **Description:** Hibeaver might rely on other libraries for specific functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the dependencies and their known vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:** High (Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution)
*   **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the specific vulnerability and available exploits)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (Can range from novice to advanced depending on the exploit)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (Depends on the specific vulnerability and available detection methods)
*   **Conditions:** Vulnerabilities exist in libraries used by Hibeaver for specific functionalities.
