# Attack Surface Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User Input](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system by providing malicious input that is then executed by the server.

**How Hibeaver Contributes:** If Hibeaver allows direct execution of user-provided input received through the terminal interface on the server-side (e.g., using `os.system`, `subprocess` without proper sanitization), it creates a direct pathway for command injection.

**Example:** A user types `; rm -rf /` into the Hibeaver terminal, and the server-side code directly executes this command.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data loss, service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid direct execution of user input:**  Never directly pass user input to shell commands or system functions.
* **Use parameterized commands or libraries:** If executing commands is necessary, use libraries that support parameterized commands to prevent injection.
* **Implement strict input validation and sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received from the Hibeaver terminal, allowing only expected characters and formats.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the server-side process with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Terminal Output](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_terminal_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the terminal output that will be executed in another user's browser when they view the terminal.

**How Hibeaver Contributes:** If Hibeaver doesn't properly sanitize or encode server-generated output before displaying it in the terminal within the browser, it can become a vector for XSS. Malicious scripts embedded in the output can then be executed in the context of the user viewing the terminal.

**Example:** The server sends output containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which is rendered by the browser viewing the Hibeaver terminal, executing the script.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the terminal interface.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all server-generated output before sending it to the client for display in the Hibeaver terminal. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and configure a strong CSP header to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Review the code that generates terminal output to ensure proper encoding is applied.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via User Input](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_user_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker can access files or directories outside of the intended scope by manipulating file paths provided as input.

**How Hibeaver Contributes:** If Hibeaver allows users to specify file paths (e.g., for viewing logs, editing files) without proper validation, attackers can use ".." sequences or absolute paths to access sensitive files on the server.

**Example:** A user enters `../../../../etc/passwd` as a file path in the Hibeaver terminal, and the server attempts to access this file.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential for arbitrary file read or write depending on the application's functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate all file paths provided by the user, ensuring they conform to the expected format and are within the allowed directory.
* **Canonicalization:** Canonicalize file paths to resolve symbolic links and remove redundant separators before accessing files.
* **Chroot Environments:**  Consider using chroot environments to restrict the server-side process's access to the file system.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the server-side process only the necessary file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** If Hibeaver uses serialization to transmit data between the client and server, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

**How Hibeaver Contributes:** If Hibeaver serializes data (e.g., terminal state, commands) and then deserializes it on the server without proper safeguards, an attacker could manipulate the serialized data to inject malicious code that gets executed during deserialization.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts and modifies serialized data sent from the client, injecting a payload that executes code when the server deserializes it.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**  If possible, avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
* **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** If deserialization is necessary, use secure serialization libraries and ensure they are up-to-date.
* **Implement Integrity Checks:**  Use cryptographic signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity of serialized data before deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Security Issues](./attack_surfaces/websocket_security_issues.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the WebSocket communication channel used by Hibeaver can be exploited.

**How Hibeaver Contributes:** Hibeaver likely relies on WebSockets for real-time communication between the client-side terminal and the server. Lack of proper authentication, authorization, or encryption (beyond HTTPS) at the WebSocket level can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts WebSocket messages due to lack of encryption or impersonates a legitimate user due to weak authentication.

**Impact:** Data interception, session hijacking, unauthorized access to terminal sessions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**  Authenticate and authorize users before establishing WebSocket connections and for each action performed through the terminal.
* **Use WSS (WebSocket Secure):** Ensure WebSocket communication is encrypted using WSS (WebSocket over TLS).
* **Validate WebSocket Messages:**  Validate the format and content of messages received over the WebSocket to prevent injection attacks.
