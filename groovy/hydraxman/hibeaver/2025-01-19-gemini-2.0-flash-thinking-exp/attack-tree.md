## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities leading to Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities_leading_to_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access sensitive user presence data.
    *   **CRITICAL NODE - Expose Sensitive Presence Data:** This node represents the successful exposure of sensitive information, a major security breach.
        *   **CRITICAL NODE - Lack of Proper Access Control on Presence Data:** If access controls are missing or weak, unauthorized access is trivial.
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH - Directly Access Presence Data Without Authentication/Authorization (CRITICAL NODE):**  This is a direct exploitation of missing access controls, leading to immediate data exposure.
                *   Likelihood: Medium - Depends on Hibeaver's default configuration and developer implementation. If not explicitly secured, it's likely.
                *   Impact: High - Exposure of user online status, activity, potentially location or other sensitive information.
                *   Effort: Low - Requires basic understanding of network requests and potentially browser developer tools.
                *   Skill Level: Low - Beginner.
                *   Detection Difficulty: Low - Easy to detect through monitoring unauthorized access to presence data endpoints.
        *   Insecure Storage/Transmission of Presence Data:
            *   **HIGH RISK PATH - Intercept Unencrypted WebSocket Communication (CRITICAL NODE):** If WSS is not enforced, communication is vulnerable to interception.
                *   Likelihood: Medium - If WSS is not enforced or misconfigured.
                *   Impact: High - Exposure of all real-time communication, including presence data.
                *   Effort: Medium - Requires setting up a network interception tool (e.g., Wireshark, Burp Suite).
                *   Skill Level: Medium - Requires understanding of network protocols and interception techniques.
                *   Detection Difficulty: Low - Can be detected by monitoring for unencrypted WebSocket connections.
    *   Manipulate Presence Data:
        *   Inject False Presence Information:
            *   **CRITICAL NODE - Exploit Lack of Server-Side Validation on Presence Updates:**  Without server-side validation, attackers can inject false information.
                *   Likelihood: Medium - Common vulnerability if developers rely solely on client-side logic.
                *   Impact: Medium - Similar to forging messages, but highlights the root cause.
                *   Effort: Low - Requires understanding of how the application processes presence updates.
                *   Skill Level: Low - Beginner to Intermediate.
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium - Requires careful analysis of server-side logs and application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses leading to Impersonation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses_leading_to_impersonation.md)

*   This path allows attackers to impersonate other users.
    *   **CRITICAL NODE - Impersonate Other Users:** This node represents the successful impersonation of another user.
        *   **CRITICAL NODE - Forge User Identifiers in Presence Updates:** If user identifiers can be forged, impersonation is possible.
            *   Likelihood: Medium - If Hibeaver relies on client-provided user identifiers without server-side verification.
            *   Impact: High - Ability to act as another user, potentially accessing their data or performing actions on their behalf.
            *   Effort: Low - Requires understanding of how user identifiers are transmitted in presence updates.
            *   Skill Level: Low - Beginner to Intermediate.
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium - Requires tracking user sessions and verifying the consistency of user identifiers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channel Vulnerabilities leading to Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channel_vulnerabilities_leading_to_data_manipulation.md)

*   This path focuses on manipulating communication through the WebSocket channel.
    *   **CRITICAL NODE - Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on WebSocket:**  A successful MitM attack compromises the communication channel.
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH - Intercept and Modify Presence Messages (CRITICAL NODE):**  This is the direct consequence of a MitM attack, allowing for data manipulation.
            *   Likelihood: Medium - If WSS is not enforced or certificates are not properly validated.
            *   Impact: High - Ability to eavesdrop on and manipulate all real-time communication.
            *   Effort: Medium - Requires setting up a MitM proxy and potentially bypassing certificate pinning.
            *   Skill Level: Medium - Intermediate.
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low - Can be detected by monitoring for unencrypted connections or certificate errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities leading to XSS](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_injection_vulnerabilities_leading_to_xss.md)

*   This path allows attackers to inject malicious code into the application.
    *   **CRITICAL NODE - Inject Malicious Payloads via Presence Data:** This node represents the injection of malicious content through presence data.
        *   **CRITICAL NODE - Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Presence Data Handling:**  Failure to sanitize input allows for the injection of malicious payloads.
            *   Likelihood: Medium - Common vulnerability if developers don't sanitize user-provided data.
            *   Impact: High - Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection attacks affecting other users.
            *   Effort: Low to Medium - Requires understanding of injection techniques and the structure of presence data.
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate.
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium - Requires monitoring for suspicious characters and patterns in presence data.
        *   **HIGH RISK PATH - Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other Injection Attacks (CRITICAL NODE):** This is the successful execution of the injected code, leading to various attacks.
            *   Likelihood: Medium - If presence data is displayed to other users without proper encoding.
            *   Impact: High - Stealing user credentials, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites.
            *   Effort: Medium - Requires crafting malicious payloads that exploit the lack of sanitization.
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate.
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium - Can be detected by web application firewalls (WAFs) and monitoring for suspicious client-side behavior.
