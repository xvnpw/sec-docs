# Threat Model Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Threat: [Command Injection](./threats/command_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious shell commands by manipulating input that is directly processed and executed by Hibeaver on the server. This occurs when user-provided data is used to construct shell commands without proper sanitization or validation. For example, if Hibeaver takes user input as part of a command string, an attacker could inject commands using delimiters like `;`, `&&`, or `||`.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, installation of malware, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:**  `hibeaver` core functionality responsible for executing commands, including input processing and command execution modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before it is used in commands executed by Hibeaver.
*   Avoid directly constructing shell commands from user input within Hibeaver.
*   Use parameterized commands or whitelisting of allowed commands within Hibeaver's logic.
*   Implement the principle of least privilege for the user account running the Hibeaver process.
*   Consider using secure command execution libraries that offer built-in protection against command injection, if applicable within Hibeaver's architecture.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Unsanitized Terminal Output](./threats/data_exposure_through_unsanitized_terminal_output.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick the application or the underlying commands executed by Hibeaver into outputting sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, internal file paths) to the terminal. If Hibeaver directly transmits this output to the web interface without proper sanitization, the attacker or other unauthorized users could view this information.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive credentials leading to further attacks, information leakage about the system's internal workings.

**Affected Component:** `hibeaver`'s output handling mechanism, specifically the part that transmits terminal output to the web client.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict output encoding and escaping within Hibeaver before displaying terminal output in the web browser to prevent interpretation of sensitive characters.
*   Filter or redact sensitive information from the terminal output generated by Hibeaver before it is displayed.
*   Carefully review all commands executed by Hibeaver and their potential output for sensitive data.
*   Avoid displaying verbose error messages generated by Hibeaver or the underlying commands that might reveal internal system details.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Commands](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_commands.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send commands through the Hibeaver interface that are directly executed by Hibeaver and consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This could involve executing commands that create infinite loops, fork bombs, or perform intensive operations, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation for legitimate users, potential server crash.

**Affected Component:** `hibeaver`'s command execution module, potentially lacking resource management or limitations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting on the number of commands that can be executed through Hibeaver within a specific timeframe.
*   Set timeouts for command execution initiated by Hibeaver to prevent long-running processes.
*   Monitor server resource usage related to Hibeaver processes and implement alerts for unusual activity.
*   Consider using resource control mechanisms (e.g., cgroups) to limit the resources available to Hibeaver processes.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Output](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unescaped_output.md)

**Description:** If the terminal output handled and displayed by Hibeaver is not properly escaped before being rendered in the web browser, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the output. This code would then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the terminal output provided by Hibeaver.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the web page, execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**Affected Component:** `hibeaver`'s output rendering mechanism in the web client integration, or the server-side component within Hibeaver responsible for preparing the output for the client.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always encode or escape terminal output generated and handled by Hibeaver before rendering it in HTML. Use context-aware escaping (e.g., HTML escaping for HTML content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript content).
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk of XSS attacks related to Hibeaver's output.

## Threat: [Lack of Proper Authentication and Authorization for Hibeaver Access](./threats/lack_of_proper_authentication_and_authorization_for_hibeaver_access.md)

**Description:** If Hibeaver itself does not implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, or if the integration with the application's authentication is flawed, unauthorized users could gain access to Hibeaver's functionalities and execute commands.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to server resources, potential for malicious actions by unauthenticated or unauthorized users through the Hibeaver interface.

**Affected Component:** `hibeaver`'s authentication and authorization modules, or the integration points with the application's security framework.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication mechanisms within or for accessing Hibeaver to verify user identity.
*   Implement authorization controls within or around Hibeaver to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to Hibeaver functionalities. Ensure that only authorized users can interact with the Hibeaver interface.
