**4. Component Details**

*   **Tracking Script:**
    *   **Purpose:** To collect anonymous user activity data on websites where it is integrated.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Captures basic user information such as page views, the referring URL, screen resolution, and browser type.
        *   Transmits the collected data to the Ingestion API via HTTP POST requests.
        *   May utilize cookies or local storage for session management (e.g., to distinguish unique visitors within a timeframe).
    *   **Inputs:** User interactions within the browser environment.
    *   **Outputs:** HTTP requests containing analytics data (e.g., page URL, timestamp, referrer) sent to the Ingestion API.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   Susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if not implemented with proper encoding and output sanitization.
        *   Potential for unauthorized data collection if the script is injected or tampered with.
        *   Privacy implications related to cookie usage and data collection practices.

*   **Ingestion API:**
    *   **Purpose:** To receive, validate, and persist the analytics data transmitted by the Tracking Script.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Exposes an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/api/collect`) to accept incoming data payloads.
        *   Performs validation checks on the received data to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious input.
        *   Stores the validated data into the designated Data Storage.
        *   Returns an acknowledgment response to the Tracking Script.
    *   **Inputs:** HTTP POST requests from the Tracking Script containing analytics data in a defined format (e.g., JSON).
    *   **Outputs:** HTTP response codes indicating success or failure to the Tracking Script. Data records written to the Data Storage.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   Vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks if not protected by rate limiting or other mitigation techniques.
        *   Risk of data injection vulnerabilities if input validation is insufficient or improperly implemented.

    *   **Inputs:** User requests through a web browser (HTTP requests).
    *   **Outputs:** Rendered web pages displaying analytics reports and administrative interfaces.
    *   **Security Considerations:**
        *   Requires strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password with hashing, multi-factor authentication).
        *   Vulnerable to common web application vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if a relational database is used and queries are not properly parameterized).
        *   Sensitive data displayed in the UI needs to be protected from unauthorized access and disclosure. Secure communication over HTTPS is essential.

**5. Data Flow**

The typical sequence of data movement within the Hibeaver system is as follows:

1. A "Website Visitor" interacts with a webpage containing the embedded "Tracking Script".
2. The "Tracking Script" collects relevant user activity data (e.g., page viewed, timestamp, referrer).
3. The "Tracking Script" sends this data as an HTTP POST request to the "Ingestion API".
4. The "Ingestion API" receives the request, validates the data, and stores the validated data in the "Data Storage".
5. The "Processing Engine" periodically (or on-demand) retrieves raw data from the "Data Storage".
6. The "Processing Engine" processes the raw data to generate aggregated analytics metrics (e.g., total page views, unique visitors).
7. The "Processing Engine" stores the processed, aggregated data back into the "Data Storage".
8. An "Admin User" accesses the "Admin/Reporting UI" through a web browser.
9. The "Admin/Reporting UI" authenticates the "Admin User".
10. The "Admin/Reporting UI" retrieves processed analytics data from the "Data Storage".
11. The "Admin/Reporting UI" displays the analytics reports to the "Admin User".

**6. Security Considerations (Detailed)**

*   **Tracking Script Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the script is not properly sanitized or if user-provided data is reflected without encoding.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust output encoding and sanitization techniques. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized data collection or manipulation if the script is compromised or injected.
    *   **Mitigation:** Serve the tracking script over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Implement integrity checks (e.g., Subresource Integrity - SRI) to ensure the script has not been tampered with.
    *   **Threat:** Privacy violations due to excessive data collection.
    *   **Mitigation:** Adhere to privacy best practices by minimizing data collection and anonymizing data where possible. Clearly communicate data collection practices to users.

*   **Ingestion API Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks overwhelming the API endpoint.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe. Utilize a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   **Threat:** Data injection vulnerabilities allowing attackers to insert malicious data into the system.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict input validation on all received data, checking for expected data types, formats, and ranges. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection if a relational database is used.
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized data submission.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement a basic authentication mechanism, such as requiring an API key to be included in requests.

*   **Data Storage Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to sensitive analytics data.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong access control lists (ACLs) or role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the database.
    *   **Threat:** Data breaches or leaks due to compromised storage.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement data at rest encryption to protect data even if the storage medium is compromised. Regularly patch and update the database software.
    *   **Threat:** Data loss due to hardware failure or other incidents.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement regular backup and recovery procedures, including offsite backups.

*   **Admin/Reporting UI Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Brute-force attacks on login credentials.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts. Consider using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks.
    *   **Threat:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the UI.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust output encoding and sanitization techniques for all user-generated content or data retrieved from the database.
    *   **Threat:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement CSRF protection mechanisms, such as synchronizer tokens.
    *   **Threat:** Injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection).
    *   **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database.
    *   **Threat:** Insecure communication exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the user's browser and the server.

**7. Technologies Used (Likely and Potential)**
