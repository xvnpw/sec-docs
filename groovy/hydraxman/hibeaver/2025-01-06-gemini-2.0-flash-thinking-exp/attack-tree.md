## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Inadequate Input Sanitization (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_inadequate_input_sanitization__xss_.md)

**Attack Steps:**
* Attacker injects malicious content (e.g., JavaScript payload) into the shared document.
* Hibeaver fails to properly sanitize this input.
* The malicious content is broadcast to other users.
* The malicious script executes in the context of other users' browsers.
* **Critical Node: Exploit Inadequate Input Sanitization in Hibeaver**
    * This is the core vulnerability that enables the XSS attack. If Hibeaver properly sanitized input, this path would be blocked.
* **Impact:** High (Account Takeover, Data Theft, Session Hijacking)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding within Hibeaver. Treat all user-generated content as untrusted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Lack of WebSocket Encryption/Integrity](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_lack_of_websocket_encryptionintegrity.md)

**Attack Steps:**
* Attacker intercepts WebSocket communication between clients and the server.
* Due to the lack of encryption (beyond HTTPS) or integrity checks, the attacker can understand and modify the messages.
* The attacker alters messages to manipulate the shared document state or impersonate users.
* **Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Encryption or Integrity Checks in Hibeaver's WebSocket Handling (Beyond HTTPS)**
    * This vulnerability allows attackers to eavesdrop and tamper with communication.
* **Impact:** High (Data Manipulation, Impersonation, Unauthorized Actions)
* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on whether HTTPS is considered sufficient and other protections are in place)
* **Mitigation:** Enforce secure WebSocket communication using WSS. Implement message integrity checks to detect tampering. Consider end-to-end encryption for sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Weak WebSocket Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_weak_websocket_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Attack Steps:**
* Attacker crafts WebSocket messages that appear to originate from a legitimate user.
* Hibeaver's authentication or authorization mechanisms on the WebSocket layer are weak or flawed.
* The attacker's forged messages are accepted, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions, modify data, or impersonate other users.
* **Critical Node: Exploit Weak Authentication or Authorization Mechanisms in Hibeaver's WebSocket Layer**
    * This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass access controls.
* **Impact:** High (Unauthorized Actions, Data Modification, Impersonation)
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for WebSocket connections. Verify the identity of users sending messages. Use secure session management and consider message signing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Server-Side Authorization Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_server-side_authorization_checks.md)

**Attack Steps:**
* Attacker attempts to access or modify documents or perform actions they are not authorized to.
* Hibeaver's server-side authorization logic contains flaws or vulnerabilities.
* The attacker's unauthorized requests are accepted, granting them access or allowing them to perform privileged actions.
* **Critical Node Potential: Exploit Flaws in Hibeaver's Authorization Logic for Document Access/Modification**
    * This vulnerability directly undermines access control and data security.
* **Impact:** High (Unauthorized Access to Data, Data Breach, Privilege Escalation)
* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust and well-tested authorization checks on the server-side. Follow the principle of least privilege. Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of authorization logic.
