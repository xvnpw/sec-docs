# Attack Surface Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Hibeaver Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_hibeaver_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can directly access `hibeaver`'s endpoints without providing valid application credentials.
    *   **How Hibeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hibeaver introduces new endpoints for managing real-time connections (e.g., for establishing streams). If these endpoints are not integrated with the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms, they become directly accessible attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could directly send a request to `/hibeaver/connect` (or a similar endpoint exposed by `hibeaver`) without being logged into the main application.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure from the streams, denial of service by exhausting connection limits, potential for injecting malicious data into the streams.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization checks on all `hibeaver`-exposed endpoints. Ensure these checks are consistent with the application's existing security model.
        *   Restrict access to `hibeaver` endpoints based on user roles or permissions.
        *   If possible, integrate `hibeaver`'s authentication mechanisms with the application's existing authentication system.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Hibeaver Streams](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_hibeaver_streams.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information broadcasted through `hibeaver` streams is accessible to unauthorized parties.
    *   **How Hibeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hibeaver facilitates the transmission of data in real-time. If the application sends sensitive data through these streams without proper encryption or access control, it becomes vulnerable to eavesdropping.
    *   **Example:** User private messages, real-time financial data, or internal application state being broadcasted through `hibeaver` streams without encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, potential regulatory violations, damage to user trust.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement TLS/SSL encryption for all connections to `hibeaver` endpoints (if using WebSockets) or ensure the main application uses HTTPS (if using Server-Sent Events).
        *   Avoid broadcasting highly sensitive information directly through `hibeaver` streams.
        *   Implement access controls within the application logic to filter which users receive specific data streams.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data payloads before sending them through `hibeaver`.

## Attack Surface: [Message Injection and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/message_injection_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious or manipulated messages into the `hibeaver` streams.
    *   **How Hibeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hibeaver handles the transmission of messages. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate data before sending it through `hibeaver`, or if clients don't sanitize received data, it creates an opportunity for injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injecting malicious JavaScript code into a chat message broadcasted via `hibeaver`, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side vulnerabilities (XSS), manipulation of application logic, potential for privilege escalation if the application trusts the data without validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the server-side before sending data through `hibeaver`.
        *   Implement output encoding and sanitization on the client-side when rendering data received from `hibeaver` streams.
        *   Consider using a secure message format that prevents injection, such as structured data with defined schemas.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Hibeaver's Implementation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_hibeaver's_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist within the `hibeaver` library itself.
    *   **How Hibeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By integrating `hibeaver`, the application inherits any vulnerabilities present in the library's code.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in `hibeaver` that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `hibeaver` updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to `hibeaver` and its dependencies.
        *   Perform security code reviews of the application's integration with `hibeaver`.
        *   Consider using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on Data Sent to Hibeaver](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_data_sent_to_hibeaver.md)

*   **Description:** The application sends untrusted data to `hibeaver` without proper validation.
    *   **How Hibeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While `hibeaver` primarily transmits data, the vulnerability lies in the application's handling of data *before* sending it through `hibeaver`. If the application trusts user input implicitly, it can send malicious data that could be exploited by clients.
    *   **Example:**  An application directly sending user-provided HTML content through `hibeaver`, which could lead to XSS on the receiving clients.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side vulnerabilities (XSS), potential for application logic errors if the data is used for processing on the receiving end.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side *before* sending any data to `hibeaver`.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when handling user input.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Hibeaver Connections](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_hibeaver_connections.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept and potentially manipulate communication between clients and the server using `hibeaver`.
    *   **How Hibeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hibeaver establishes and manages connections. If these connections are not encrypted, they are vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepting WebSocket traffic between a client and the server using `hibeaver`, reading private messages or modifying data being transmitted.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality, data integrity compromise, potential for unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of TLS/SSL for all connections to `hibeaver` endpoints (HTTPS for Server-Sent Events, WSS for WebSockets).
        *   Ensure proper certificate validation is in place on both the client and server sides.
