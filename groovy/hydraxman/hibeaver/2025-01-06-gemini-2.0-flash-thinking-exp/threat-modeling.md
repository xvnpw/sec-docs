# Threat Model Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Threat: [Weak Encryption Configuration](./threats/weak_encryption_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker might attempt to decrypt secrets stored by Hibeaver if the library is configured to use a weak or outdated encryption algorithm, or if the key configuration is weak due to Hibeaver's default settings or insufficient guidance. This could involve brute-force attacks or exploiting known weaknesses in the chosen algorithm.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data managed by Hibeaver, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and compromise of the application's functionality.

**Affected Component:** Encryption module/functions within Hibeaver, default configuration settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the application configuration explicitly overrides any insecure default encryption algorithms offered by Hibeaver with strong, modern alternatives.
* Avoid relying on default key generation or management practices within Hibeaver if they are not sufficiently robust. Consult Hibeaver's documentation for secure configuration options.

## Threat: [Key Management Vulnerabilities within Hibeaver](./threats/key_management_vulnerabilities_within_hibeaver.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to the encryption keys used by Hibeaver if the library itself has vulnerabilities in its key management mechanisms. This could involve flaws in how Hibeaver generates, stores, or handles encryption keys internally.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of all secrets managed by Hibeaver, as the attacker can now decrypt them.

**Affected Component:** Key storage and management mechanisms within Hibeaver.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rely on Hibeaver's recommended and secure key management practices.
* If Hibeaver offers options for custom key management, ensure these are implemented securely and according to security best practices.
* Keep Hibeaver updated to the latest version to patch any known key management vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Secret Retrieval via Hibeaver](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_secret_retrieval_via_hibeaver.md)

**Description:** If Hibeaver's API for retrieving secrets allows for any form of injection (e.g., through dynamically constructed secret names or paths within Hibeaver's internal logic), an attacker might manipulate this to access secrets they are not authorized to view.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive secrets managed by Hibeaver.

**Affected Component:** Secret retrieval API or functions within Hibeaver.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Adhere strictly to Hibeaver's documented API for secret retrieval, avoiding any patterns that could lead to injection.
* If Hibeaver provides mechanisms for specifying secret identifiers, ensure these are treated as opaque values and not constructed from potentially attacker-controlled input.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities within Hibeaver](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_within_hibeaver.md)

**Description:** If Hibeaver internally uses deserialization of data (e.g., for caching or internal processing of secret configurations), vulnerabilities in the deserialization library used by Hibeaver could be exploited by an attacker providing malicious serialized data, potentially leading to remote code execution within the application's context.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the application.

**Affected Component:** Serialization/deserialization functions or modules within Hibeaver.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Hibeaver is updated to versions that use secure and patched serialization libraries.
* As a user, be aware of the dependencies used by Hibeaver and any known vulnerabilities in those dependencies.

## Threat: [Bypass of Access Controls within Hibeaver](./threats/bypass_of_access_controls_within_hibeaver.md)

**Description:** If Hibeaver implements its own access control mechanisms for secrets, vulnerabilities in these mechanisms could allow an attacker to bypass them and access secrets they are not authorized to view.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive secrets managed by Hibeaver.

**Affected Component:** Access control modules or functions within Hibeaver.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly understand and correctly configure Hibeaver's access control mechanisms if they are utilized.
* Regularly review and audit the configured access controls within Hibeaver.
* Keep Hibeaver updated to patch any vulnerabilities in its access control implementation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Hibeaver itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_hibeaver_itself.md)

**Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the Hibeaver library itself could be exploited by attackers. This includes memory safety issues, logic errors, or cryptographic vulnerabilities within Hibeaver's code.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the Hibeaver library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Hibeaver updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to Hibeaver.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation within Hibeaver](./threats/insufficient_input_validation_within_hibeaver.md)

**Description:** If Hibeaver does not properly validate inputs it receives (e.g., secret names, configuration parameters), it could be susceptible to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities triggered by malformed input that is processed by Hibeaver.

**Impact:** Can range from denial of service to potential exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities within Hibeaver.

**Affected Component:** Input processing within Hibeaver's modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* As a developer using Hibeaver, provide valid and expected inputs according to the library's documentation.
* Keep Hibeaver updated, as newer versions may include fixes for input validation issues.
