## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Message Schema Validation and Sanitization within HiBeaver Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/strict_message_schema_validation_and_sanitization_within_hibeaver_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Schemas:** Within your `hibeaver` message handlers, define formal schemas for *every* expected message type. Use a validation library like `pydantic`, `cerberus`, or `marshmallow`.  These schemas define the structure, data types, and constraints of the message payload.
    2.  **Validate in Handler:**  *Immediately* upon receiving a message within the `hibeaver` handler (using the `@subscribe` decorator or equivalent), pass the message payload to the validation library.
    3.  **Reject Invalid Messages:** If validation fails, *immediately* reject the message.  `hibeaver` might not have built-in rejection mechanisms, so you might need to:
        *   Log the error.
        *   Optionally, send an error response (if the protocol supports it).
        *   *Crucially*, prevent any further processing of the invalid message within the handler.  Return early from the handler function.
    4.  **Sanitize (if necessary):** Even after validation, if any part of the message data is used in a potentially dangerous context (file paths, SQL, shell commands, HTML), sanitize it *within the handler* using appropriate escaping or encoding functions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Prevents injection of malicious code through crafted messages.
    *   **Injection Attacks (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection) (Critical/High):** Sanitization prevents injection of malicious code.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium):** Ensures only valid data is processed.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium/High):** Rejection of invalid messages prevents resource exhaustion.
    *   **Bypass of Security Controls (High):** Prevents manipulation of application logic via unexpected data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **DoS:** Risk moderately reduced.
    *   **Bypass of Security Controls:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `handlers/user_registration.py`: The `@subscribe("user.registration")` handler uses a `pydantic` model (`UserRegistrationMessage`) to validate the message payload *before* any database operations.
    *   Example: `handlers/comment_processing.py`: Sanitization is performed within the handler before database insertion.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `handlers/notification_sender.py`: The `@subscribe("notification.send")` handler does *not* validate the message schema.  It needs a `pydantic` model and validation logic *inside the handler*.
    *   Example: `handlers/file_upload.py`: Filename sanitization is missing *within the handler*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Asynchronous Operation Timeouts and Cancellation within HiBeaver Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/asynchronous_operation_timeouts_and_cancellation_within_hibeaver_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Long-Running Operations:** Within each `hibeaver` handler, identify any asynchronous operations (network requests, database calls, etc.) that could potentially block or take a long time.
    2.  **Implement Timeouts:** Use `asyncio.wait_for` to wrap these operations *within the handler*. Set a reasonable timeout value.
    3.  **Handle Timeout Exceptions:**  Catch `asyncio.TimeoutError` *within the handler* and handle it gracefully (log, retry, or send an error response).  Do *not* let the exception propagate and crash the handler or the `hibeaver` event loop.
    4.  **Implement Cancellation (if applicable):** If the handler supports cancellation (e.g., a user cancels a request), use `asyncio.Task.cancel()` to cancel the relevant task.
    5.  **Handle Cancellation Exceptions:** Within the asynchronous operation, periodically check `asyncio.Task.cancelled()`. If cancelled, clean up resources and exit gracefully. Handle `asyncio.CancelledError` appropriately *within the handler*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Prevents handlers from blocking the `hibeaver` event loop due to long-running operations.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium):** Prevents excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness (Medium):** Keeps the application responsive.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: `handlers/external_api_call.py`: Network requests within the handler use `asyncio.wait_for` with a timeout.
    *   Example: `handlers/data_retrieval.py`: Database queries within the handler have timeouts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `handlers/complex_calculation.py`: The computationally intensive calculation within the handler lacks timeouts and cancellation.
    *   Example: A global default timeout is missing for all asynchronous operations within handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Deserialization within HiBeaver Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/safe_deserialization_within_hibeaver_handlers.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Avoid `pickle`:**  *Never* use `pickle` for deserializing message payloads within `hibeaver` handlers, especially if the messages come from potentially untrusted sources.
    2. **Prefer JSON or Protocol Buffers:** Use safer serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers for message payloads.
    3. **Schema Validation (JSON):** If using JSON, *always* validate the deserialized JSON data against a predefined schema (using `pydantic`, etc.) *within the handler* and *before* using the data.
    4. **Safe Deserialization Libraries (if needed):** If a more complex format is absolutely required, use a library specifically designed for secure deserialization, and perform this deserialization *within the handler*.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Prevents code injection via malicious serialized data.
    *   **Injection Attacks (High):** Schema validation helps prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium):** Schema validation ensures data validity.

* **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination by avoiding `pickle`).
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (with schema validation).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: All handlers use JSON for message payloads.
    *   Example: Deserialized JSON is validated against `pydantic` schemas within most handlers.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: `handlers/legacy_data_import.py`: This handler *still* uses `pickle`. It needs immediate refactoring to use JSON and schema validation *within the handler*.
    *   Example: Some handlers lack rigorous schema validation *after* JSON deserialization *within the handler function itself*.
