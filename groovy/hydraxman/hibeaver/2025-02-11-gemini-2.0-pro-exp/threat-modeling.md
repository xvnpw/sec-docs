# Threat Model Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive File Size](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_file_size.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads an extremely large file, exceeding server limits or available disk space. The attacker sends a single, very large file in a `multipart/form-data` request, and `hibeaver` attempts to process it.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application becomes unavailable due to resource exhaustion (disk space, memory, potentially CPU).
    *   **Affected HiBeaver Component:** Core parsing loop and buffering mechanisms within `hibeaver.parser` (or equivalent). Functions that read and store the body of each part.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-emptive Size Limits:** Implement request size limits *before* `hibeaver` processes the request.
        *   **HiBeaver Configuration (if available):** If `hibeaver` has options for maximum part/request size, set them.
        *   **Streaming (if supported):** Use `hibeaver`'s streaming capabilities (if available) to avoid buffering the entire file in memory.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Number of Parts](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_excessive_number_of_parts.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a `multipart/form-data` request with a huge number of parts. Each part might be small, but the sheer number overwhelms `hibeaver` and the server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application becomes unavailable due to excessive memory allocation for handling each part's headers and metadata within `hibeaver`.
    *   **Affected HiBeaver Component:** Main parsing loop in `hibeaver.parser` (or equivalent) that iterates through parts. Data structures storing part information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-emptive Part Count Limit:** Limit the number of parts *before* `hibeaver` processes the request.
        *   **HiBeaver Configuration (if available):** Use `hibeaver`'s configuration options (if any) to limit the number of parts.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor memory usage.

## Threat: [Invalid Content-Type/Content-Disposition Manipulation (Directly Affecting hibeaver's Parsing)](./threats/invalid_content-typecontent-disposition_manipulation__directly_affecting_hibeaver's_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**  While the *impact* is often realized at the application level, a cleverly crafted *invalid* `Content-Type` or `Content-Disposition` could, in theory, cause `hibeaver` itself to malfunction *during parsing*. This is distinct from simply passing incorrect values to the application.  For example, extremely long or malformed header values could trigger buffer overflows or other parsing errors *within hibeaver*.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially crashes `hibeaver` (DoS), or causes it to enter an unstable state, leading to unpredictable behavior.  Less likely, but more severe than simply misinterpreting the headers.
    *   **Affected HiBeaver Component:** Header parsing logic in `hibeaver.parser` (or a separate header parsing module). Functions extracting and storing header values.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Header Parsing in hibeaver:**  Ensure `hibeaver` itself has robust header parsing that can handle malformed or excessively long header values without crashing or entering an unstable state. This is primarily a responsibility of the `hibeaver` developers.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz `hibeaver` with malformed headers to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Input validation before hibeaver:** If possible, perform basic validation of header lengths *before* passing the request to `hibeaver`.

## Threat: [Outdated hibeaver Version](./threats/outdated_hibeaver_version.md)

* **Description:** The application is using an outdated version of hibeaver that contains known vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerabilities in the outdated version. Could range from DoS to RCE (if a vulnerability exists that allows arbitrary code execution within hibeaver's context).
    * **Affected HiBeaver Component:** Potentially any part of hibeaver, depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability), potentially Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep hibeaver updated to the latest version.
        * **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners.
