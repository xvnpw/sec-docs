# Attack Surface Analysis for hydraxman/hibeaver

## Attack Surface: [1. WebView2/Chromium Vulnerability Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/1__webview2chromium_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the underlying WebView2 (Chromium) engine.
    *   **HiBeaver Contribution:** HiBeaver *directly* relies on WebView2 for rendering and execution of web content.  The application is inherently vulnerable to any security flaws in the specific WebView2 version being used. This is a *direct* consequence of using HiBeaver.
    *   **Example:** A zero-day vulnerability in Chromium's JavaScript engine could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the WebView2 context by crafting a malicious webpage or injecting malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Ensure the application uses the Evergreen distribution of WebView2, which automatically updates.
            *   Implement a mechanism to check the WebView2 runtime version at application startup and warn/block execution if an outdated version is detected.
            *   Monitor Chromium security advisories and CVEs.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Keep their operating system and any installed WebView2 runtime up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unsafe Native Function Exposure (via the Bridge)](./attack_surfaces/2__unsafe_native_function_exposure__via_the_bridge_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Python functions exposed to JavaScript through HiBeaver's native bridge.
    *   **HiBeaver Contribution:** HiBeaver *provides the core mechanism* (the bridge) that enables JavaScript to call Python functions. The security of this interaction is *entirely* dependent on the developer's implementation, but the *existence* of the bridge and its intended purpose is a HiBeaver-specific feature.
    *   **Example:** If a Python function exposed to JavaScript takes a filename as input and uses it in an `os.system()` call without sanitization, an attacker could inject shell commands (e.g., `"; rm -rf /; #"`).
    *   **Impact:** RCE on the host system, file system manipulation, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Minimize Exposure:** Expose *only* essential Python functions.
            *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* input from JavaScript. Use type checking, length limits, whitelists, and regular expressions. Assume all JavaScript input is malicious.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Python backend with minimal privileges.
            *   **Avoid Dangerous Functions:** Do not expose functions like `os.system`, `eval`, `exec`, or direct file system access without extreme caution.
            *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider running the Python backend in a separate process or container.

## Attack Surface: [3. Uncontrolled File System Access (via the Bridge)](./attack_surfaces/3__uncontrolled_file_system_access__via_the_bridge_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized reading, writing, or deletion of files on the user's system, facilitated by the native bridge.
    *   **HiBeaver Contribution:** While file system access *itself* isn't unique to HiBeaver, the *primary and intended* way to provide controlled file system access in a HiBeaver application is *through the native bridge*. This makes the bridge the central point of concern for this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An exposed Python function could allow JavaScript to specify an arbitrary file path for reading/writing, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, system compromise (if system files are modified), data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Restrict Access:** Avoid granting the WebView direct file system access.
            *   **Controlled API:** If file access is necessary, provide a *highly* restricted API through the native bridge. This API should:
                *   Use a whitelist of allowed directories and file types.
                *   Perform rigorous path sanitization and validation.
                *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
            *   **User Confirmation:** Require explicit user confirmation for sensitive file operations.

## Attack Surface: [4. Devtools Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/4__devtools_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving developer tools enabled in a production build allows attackers to inspect and modify the application's code and data.
    *   **HiBeaver Contribution:** HiBeaver, by using WebView2, inherently includes the possibility of enabling devtools. The developer must actively disable this.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could open devtools, inspect network requests, modify JavaScript code, or access data stored in the WebView.
    *   **Impact:** Code analysis, data exfiltration, potential for code modification and exploitation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Disable Devtools:** Ensure that devtools are explicitly disabled in production builds of the application. This is typically a configuration option within the HiBeaver setup or WebView2 settings.
