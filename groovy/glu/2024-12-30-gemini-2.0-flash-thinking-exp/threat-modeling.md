* **Threat:** Glu Message Spoofing
    * **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious Glu messages and send them to either the frontend or backend, impersonating a legitimate client or server. This could involve forging message headers or content to trigger unintended actions.
    * **Impact:**  The attacker could trigger unauthorized actions on the backend, manipulate data, or cause the frontend to display incorrect information or execute malicious scripts.
    * **Affected Glu Component:** `glu.ws.WebSocketChannel` (for WebSocket communication), `glu.http.HttpChannel` (for HTTP-based communication).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for Glu communication.
        * Use secure protocols like WSS for WebSocket communication.
        * Implement message signing or encryption to verify the authenticity and integrity of Glu messages.
        * Validate the source of incoming Glu messages on both the frontend and backend.

* **Threat:** Glu Message Tampering
    * **Description:** An attacker could intercept Glu messages in transit and modify their content before they reach the intended recipient. This could involve altering data values, function arguments, or event payloads.
    * **Impact:** The attacker could manipulate application state, inject malicious data, or cause the application to behave unexpectedly.
    * **Affected Glu Component:** `glu.ws.WebSocketChannel`, `glu.http.HttpChannel`, the underlying serialization mechanism.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use secure protocols like WSS and HTTPS to encrypt communication channels.
        * Implement message signing or encryption to detect and prevent tampering.
        * Implement checksums or other integrity checks on Glu messages.
        * Avoid transmitting sensitive information directly within Glu messages if possible.

* **Threat:** Java Deserialization Vulnerabilities via Glu
    * **Description:** If the backend uses Java serialization for Glu communication, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects within Glu messages. When these objects are deserialized on the backend, they could trigger arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the backend server, including data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.
    * **Affected Glu Component:** The underlying serialization mechanism used by Glu (often Java's default serialization).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strongly recommended:** Avoid using Java's default serialization for Glu communication.
        * Use alternative, safer serialization libraries like Jackson or Gson.
        * If Java serialization is unavoidable, implement robust input validation and filtering on deserialized objects.
        * Consider using object stream filtering introduced in newer Java versions.
        * Regularly update Java and all dependencies to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

* **Threat:** Unintended Backend Method Invocation
    * **Description:** If the backend exposes methods through Glu without proper authorization checks, an attacker could craft Glu messages to invoke methods they should not have access to.
    * **Impact:** The attacker could execute privileged operations, access sensitive data, or modify application state in unauthorized ways.
    * **Affected Glu Component:** The mechanism for mapping Glu messages to backend method calls (likely within the backend application's Glu integration).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust authorization checks on the backend before executing any method invoked through Glu.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when exposing backend functionality through Glu. Only expose necessary methods.
        * Carefully design the Glu message structure to avoid ambiguity and potential for unintended method calls.

* **Threat:** Frontend Code Injection via Glu Data
    * **Description:** If the frontend does not properly sanitize data received through Glu messages before displaying it or using it in dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval()`), an attacker could inject malicious scripts or HTML.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
    * **Affected Glu Component:** The frontend application's code that handles and displays data received via Glu.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement proper output encoding and sanitization on the frontend for all data received through Glu.
        * Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution functions with data received from Glu.
        * Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
