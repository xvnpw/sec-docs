## Project Design Document: Glu - Modular Application Framework

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

### 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed design overview of the Glu project, a framework designed to facilitate the creation of modular applications. The primary goal of this document is to clearly articulate the architecture, components, and data flow within Glu, serving as a solid foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities.

Glu enables the development of applications as a cohesive collection of independent, dynamically loadable modules. This modular approach significantly enhances code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and promotes extensibility.

### 2. Goals and Objectives

* **Enhanced Modularity:** To facilitate the development of applications as a collection of truly independent and self-contained modules.
* **Seamless Dynamic Loading:** To provide robust support for the runtime loading and unloading of modules without requiring application restarts or service interruptions.
* **Sophisticated Dependency Management:** To offer a declarative and efficient mechanism for modules to define and resolve dependencies on other modules or external services.
* **Flexible Extensibility:** To allow for the seamless extension of core framework functionalities through well-defined plugin or extension points.
* **Strict Loose Coupling:** To enforce minimal dependencies between modules, thereby improving maintainability, enabling independent development cycles, and reducing the impact of changes.
* **Transparent Abstraction:** To offer clear, well-defined interfaces and abstractions that govern module interactions and framework usage.

### 3. Architectural Overview

Glu adopts a plugin-based architecture where the core framework acts as the central orchestrator, providing the essential infrastructure for managing and coordinating modules. Modules are designed as self-contained units of functionality, allowing for independent development and deployment.

**Key Architectural Components:**

* **Module Loader:** Responsible for the dynamic discovery, loading, and unloading of modules during runtime. This component typically scans designated directories, repositories, or utilizes service discovery mechanisms to locate module artifacts.
* **Dependency Injector:** Manages the intricate web of dependencies between modules and services. It allows modules to explicitly declare their required dependencies, which are then automatically resolved and injected by the framework.
* **Service Registry:** A centralized directory where modules can register the services they provide and discover services offered by other modules. This promotes loose coupling and facilitates service-oriented interactions within the application.
* **Event Bus:** Provides a robust mechanism for asynchronous, decoupled communication between modules. Modules can publish events without needing to know the recipients, and other modules can subscribe to specific event types to react to relevant occurrences.
* **Configuration Manager:** Handles the loading, management, and provision of configuration parameters for both the application and individual modules. It supports various configuration sources and formats.
* **Extension Point Manager:** Facilitates the extension of the core framework's functionality. It defines specific points where extensions can be plugged in to modify or enhance the framework's behavior.
* **Modules:** Independent, self-contained units of functionality that contribute to the overall application capabilities. They interact with each other through well-defined interfaces and services.
* **Extensions:** Components that extend or modify the behavior of the core framework. They are typically loaded and managed by the Extension Point Manager.
* **Application Host:** The runtime environment in which the Glu framework and its constituent modules are deployed and executed. This could be a standalone application, a containerized environment (like Docker), or an application server.

### 6. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

This section outlines potential security considerations that will be further analyzed during the threat modeling process.

* **Module Integrity:**
    * **Threat:** Malicious or compromised modules could be loaded, potentially injecting harmful code or exfiltrating data.
    * **Consideration:** Implementing mechanisms for verifying module authenticity and integrity (e.g., digital signatures, checksums).
* **Module Isolation:**
    * **Threat:** A compromised module could access resources or data belonging to other modules or the core framework.
    * **Consideration:** Enforcing strong isolation between modules using techniques like separate classloaders and security managers.
* **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Threat:** Modules might depend on third-party libraries with known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Consideration:** Implementing dependency scanning and management practices to identify and mitigate vulnerable dependencies.
* **Service Access Control:**
    * **Threat:** Unauthorized modules could access sensitive services.
    * **Consideration:** Implementing access control mechanisms to restrict service access based on module identity or roles.
* **Event Tampering:**
    * **Threat:** Malicious modules could publish forged or manipulated events, leading to incorrect application behavior.
    * **Consideration:** Implementing mechanisms for verifying the source and integrity of events.
* **Configuration Security:**
    * **Threat:** Sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) could be exposed if not stored and managed securely.
    * **Consideration:** Encrypting sensitive configuration data and restricting access to configuration sources.
* **Communication Security:**
    * **Threat:** If modules communicate over a network, the communication channel could be vulnerable to eavesdropping or tampering.
    * **Consideration:** Using secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for inter-module communication.
* **Permissions and Roles:**
    * **Threat:** Lack of proper authorization could allow modules to perform actions they are not intended to.
    * **Consideration:** Implementing a robust permissions and roles system to control module capabilities.
* **Extension Security:**
    * **Threat:** Malicious extensions could compromise the core framework or other modules.
    * **Consideration:** Implementing a review process for extensions and potentially sandboxing extension execution.
* **Input Validation:**
    * **Threat:** Modules might not properly validate input received from other modules, leading to vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
    * **Consideration:** Emphasizing the importance of input validation at module boundaries.

### 7. Deployment Diagram
