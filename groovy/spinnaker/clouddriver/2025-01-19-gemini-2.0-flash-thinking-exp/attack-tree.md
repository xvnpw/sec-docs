## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Clouddriver Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_clouddriver_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. It signifies the successful compromise of the application by leveraging weaknesses within Clouddriver.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Clouddriver Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_clouddriver_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical entry point for attackers. It involves identifying and exploiting security flaws within Clouddriver's codebase, dependencies, or configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject malicious code into Clouddriver, which is then executed by the application. This can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit insecure parsing or validation of Clouddriver's configuration files (e.g., YAML). By crafting malicious configuration values, they can inject and execute arbitrary code during startup or runtime.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via API Input (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_api_input__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage a lack of input sanitization in Clouddriver's API endpoints. By providing malicious input, they can inject commands or scripts that are executed on the Clouddriver server or the target cloud environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit known security flaws in third-party libraries used by Clouddriver. These vulnerabilities can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers circumvent security mechanisms designed to verify identity and control access, allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized for.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Authentication Mechanisms (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_authentication_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit flaws in how Clouddriver authenticates to cloud providers. This could involve bypassing authentication checks, exploiting default credentials, or compromising weak password policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authorization Flaws (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authorization_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Clouddriver's authorization logic, allowing them to access resources or perform actions that should be restricted based on their roles or permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure (Potential HIGH-RISK PATH if credentials are leaked)](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure__potential_high-risk_path_if_credentials_are_leaked_.md)

Attackers gain access to sensitive information that can be used for further attacks or direct compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Configuration Data (Potential HIGH-RISK PATH if credentials are leaked)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_configuration_data__potential_high-risk_path_if_credentials_are_leaked_.md)

Attackers access configuration files or environment variables that contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Cloud Provider Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leak_cloud_provider_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers retrieve the credentials used by Clouddriver to interact with cloud providers. This grants them significant control over the cloud infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cloud Provider API Abuse (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cloud_provider_api_abuse__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers leverage Clouddriver's access to cloud provider APIs to perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Cloud Provider Permissions (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_cloud_provider_permissions__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit overly permissive IAM roles granted to Clouddriver. This allows them to access or modify cloud resources beyond the intended scope, potentially causing significant damage or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Clouddriver's Access to Cloud Providers (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_clouddriver's_access_to_cloud_providers__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers directly target the credentials or API keys that Clouddriver uses to interact with cloud providers. Success here grants broad access to cloud resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Compromise (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/credential_compromise__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain access to the stored credentials used by Clouddriver.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Stored Credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/steal_stored_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers directly access the storage mechanism (e.g., Vault, encrypted files) where Clouddriver's cloud provider credentials are kept.

## Attack Tree Path: [API Key Theft (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/api_key_theft__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers gain access to the API keys used by Clouddriver.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access API Keys Used by Clouddriver (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/access_api_keys_used_by_clouddriver__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers retrieve API keys stored within Clouddriver's configuration files, environment variables, or other storage locations.
