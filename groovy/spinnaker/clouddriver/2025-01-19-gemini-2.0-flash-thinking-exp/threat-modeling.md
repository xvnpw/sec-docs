# Threat Model Analysis for spinnaker/clouddriver

## Threat: [Hardcoded Cloud Provider Credentials](./threats/hardcoded_cloud_provider_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could find hardcoded cloud provider credentials (API keys, access keys, etc.) within Clouddriver's codebase or configuration files. This could be achieved by gaining access to the source code repository, configuration files on the server, or through a supply chain attack.

**Impact:**  If successful, the attacker can gain full control over the associated cloud provider account, leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, deletion of resources, and potentially significant financial losses.

**Affected Component:**  Configuration loading mechanisms, potentially within various modules responsible for interacting with specific cloud providers (e.g., `titus`, `kubernetes`, `aws`, `gcp`, `azure` modules).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never hardcode credentials directly in the codebase or configuration files.
*   Utilize secure credential management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.
*   Implement regular security audits and code reviews to identify and remove any accidentally hardcoded credentials.
*   Enforce strict access controls on the Clouddriver server and its configuration files.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Cloud Provider Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_cloud_provider_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how Clouddriver stores cloud provider credentials. This might involve accessing weakly encrypted files, exploiting insecure file permissions on the server, or leveraging vulnerabilities in the credential storage mechanism itself.

**Impact:** Compromised credentials allow the attacker to impersonate Clouddriver and perform unauthorized actions on the connected cloud provider accounts. This can lead to data breaches, resource manipulation, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:**  Credential provider implementations within Clouddriver (e.g., specific implementations for AWS, GCP, Azure), potentially the underlying storage mechanisms used by these providers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Employ strong encryption for storing credentials at rest.
*   Ensure proper file system permissions are configured to restrict access to credential files.
*   Regularly review and update the credential storage mechanisms used by Clouddriver.
*   Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) for enhanced security of sensitive keys.

## Threat: [Credential Leakage in Logs](./threats/credential_leakage_in_logs.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to Clouddriver's log files, which might inadvertently contain cloud provider credentials or sensitive information related to them. This could happen due to misconfigured logging levels or insufficient log sanitization.

**Impact:** Exposure of credentials allows the attacker to directly access and control the associated cloud provider accounts.

**Affected Component:**  Logging framework used by Clouddriver (likely Spring Boot's logging), potentially affecting any module that logs information related to cloud provider interactions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust logging practices that sanitize sensitive information before logging.
*   Configure Clouddriver to avoid logging credentials or sensitive data.
*   Secure access to log files through appropriate permissions and access controls.
*   Utilize centralized logging solutions with secure storage and access controls.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise through Exposed Endpoints](./threats/api_key_compromise_through_exposed_endpoints.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially discover and exploit unsecured or improperly secured API endpoints within Clouddriver that might inadvertently expose cloud provider API keys or allow unauthorized manipulation of cloud resources.

**Impact:**  Compromised API keys grant the attacker the ability to perform actions within the cloud provider environment, potentially leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:**  Clouddriver's API layer (using Spring MVC or similar), specifically endpoints related to credential management or cloud provider interactions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.
*   Regularly audit API endpoints for security vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure proper input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Insufficient Permissioning of Clouddriver's Cloud Provider Access](./threats/insufficient_permissioning_of_clouddriver's_cloud_provider_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains control of the Clouddriver instance could leverage its overly permissive access to the connected cloud provider accounts to perform actions beyond what is necessary for its intended function.

**Impact:**  The attacker can access and manipulate a wider range of cloud resources than intended, increasing the potential damage from a compromise.

**Affected Component:**  The security context and roles assumed by Clouddriver when interacting with cloud provider APIs, configured within the respective cloud provider modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring Clouddriver's access to cloud provider accounts.
*   Grant only the necessary permissions required for Clouddriver to perform its intended tasks.
*   Regularly review and refine the permissions granted to Clouddriver.
*   Utilize cloud provider's IAM features to enforce fine-grained access control.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Deployment Configurations](./threats/data_injection_through_deployment_configurations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate deployment configurations managed by Clouddriver to inject malicious code or configurations that are then deployed to the target environment. This could happen if access controls to configuration repositories are weak or if Clouddriver doesn't properly validate configurations.

**Impact:**  Compromise of deployed applications or infrastructure, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further lateral movement within the environment.

**Affected Component:**  Modules responsible for handling deployment configurations and interacting with deployment targets (e.g., pipeline execution modules, specific deployment target modules like `kubernetes`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls for deployment configuration repositories.
*   Enforce code review processes for changes to deployment configurations.
*   Implement validation and sanitization of deployment configurations within Clouddriver.
*   Utilize infrastructure-as-code scanning tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in configurations.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/insecure_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit insecure deserialization vulnerabilities within Clouddriver if it processes untrusted data in a deserialized format. This could allow for remote code execution.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Clouddriver instance, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Affected Component:**  Any component that handles deserialization of data, potentially within API endpoints or internal communication mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and libraries.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious data from being processed.
