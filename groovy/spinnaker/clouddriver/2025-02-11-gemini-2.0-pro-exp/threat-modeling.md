# Threat Model Analysis for spinnaker/clouddriver

## Threat: [Cloud Provider Credential Exfiltration](./threats/cloud_provider_credential_exfiltration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Clouddriver instance and extracts stored cloud provider credentials. The attacker might exploit a vulnerability within Clouddriver itself, use debugging tools, memory dumps, or access to improperly secured credential storage. This directly involves Clouddriver's credential handling.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the cloud resources managed by that Clouddriver instance. The attacker can create, modify, or delete any resource, exfiltrate data, launch attacks, and incur significant costs.
    *   **Affected Clouddriver Component:**
        *   `CredentialsRepository` (and related classes for credential storage/retrieval).
        *   Caching mechanisms that might temporarily store credentials.
        *   Cloud provider-specific modules (e.g., `AmazonCredentials`, `GoogleCloudCredentials`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use a dedicated secrets management service (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).** Clouddriver should *never* store credentials directly.
        *   **Implement strict network segmentation for the Clouddriver instance.**
        *   **Enable host-based intrusion detection (HIDS) and file integrity monitoring (FIM).**
        *   **Regularly rotate cloud provider credentials.**
        *   **Encrypt credentials at rest and in transit.**

## Threat: [Unauthorized Cloud Resource Creation via API Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_cloud_resource_creation_via_api_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having gained some access (e.g., compromised user, separate vulnerability), crafts malicious API requests *directly to Clouddriver* to create unauthorized cloud resources, bypassing Spinnaker's UI. This directly exploits Clouddriver's API.
    *   **Impact:** Creation of unauthorized resources (VMs, databases, etc.), leading to increased costs, resource exhaustion, and potential use of these resources for malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Clouddriver Component:**
        *   API controllers handling resource creation (e.g., `TaskController`, provider-specific controllers like `AmazonInstanceController`).
        *   `TaskRepository` (if task definitions are manipulated).
        *   Cloud provider-specific modules interacting with cloud APIs (e.g., `AmazonCloudProvider`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly enforce RBAC *within Clouddriver* and Spinnaker.**
        *   **Robust input validation and sanitization for *all* Clouddriver API requests.**
        *   **Use API gateways with request validation and rate limiting *in front of Clouddriver*.**
        *   **Monitor Clouddriver API logs for suspicious activity.**
        *   **Implement "dry-run" functionality where supported.**

## Threat: [Unauthorized Cloud Resource Deletion via API Manipulation](./threats/unauthorized_cloud_resource_deletion_via_api_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to creation, but the attacker crafts API requests *directly to Clouddriver* to delete existing resources. This directly exploits Clouddriver's API and resource management capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, data loss, and potential business interruption.
    *   **Affected Clouddriver Component:**
        *   API controllers handling resource deletion (e.g., `TaskController`, provider-specific controllers).
        *   `TaskRepository` (if task definitions are manipulated).
        *   Cloud provider-specific modules interacting with cloud APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Same mitigations as for unauthorized creation (RBAC, input validation, API gateway, monitoring, dry-run).**
        *   **Enable deletion protection for critical resources (if supported by the cloud provider).**
        *   **Implement robust backup and recovery procedures.**

## Threat: [Exploitation of a Vulnerability in a Cloud Provider SDK *Used by Clouddriver*](./threats/exploitation_of_a_vulnerability_in_a_cloud_provider_sdk_used_by_clouddriver.md)

*   **Description:** Clouddriver relies on cloud provider SDKs. A vulnerability in one of these SDKs, *when exploited through Clouddriver's interaction with it*, could lead to compromise. This is direct because Clouddriver is the execution context.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution *within the Clouddriver process*.
    *   **Affected Clouddriver Component:**
        *   Cloud provider-specific modules that directly use the SDKs (e.g., `AmazonCloudProvider`, `GoogleCloudProvider`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (dependent on the SDK vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep cloud provider SDKs up-to-date.**
        *   **Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool.**
        *   **Monitor security advisories from cloud providers and SDK vendors.**

## Threat: [Cross-Account Resource Access via Misconfigured IAM Roles *Used by Clouddriver*](./threats/cross-account_resource_access_via_misconfigured_iam_roles_used_by_clouddriver.md)

*   **Description:** Clouddriver, configured for multi-account management, uses IAM roles. Misconfiguration in these roles or trust policies could allow Clouddriver (and thus an attacker) to access resources in unintended accounts. This is a direct threat to Clouddriver's multi-account handling.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, resource compromise, and service disruption across accounts.
    *   **Affected Clouddriver Component:**
        *   Cloud provider-specific modules handling IAM role assumption (e.g., `AmazonCredentials`).
        *   Configuration files defining account mappings and IAM roles.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Carefully review and audit IAM roles and trust policies.**
        *   **Use condition keys in IAM policies for further restriction.**
        *   **Regularly audit Clouddriver's configuration and IAM role usage.**
        *   **Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for IAM role management.**

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Cloud Provider Metadata *Accessed by Clouddriver*](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_cloud_provider_metadata_accessed_by_clouddriver.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a request to Clouddriver that causes it to make an unintended request to a cloud provider's metadata service or another internal service, leveraging Clouddriver's interaction with cloud metadata.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (instance credentials, internal network details), potential for further attacks.
    * **Affected Clouddriver Component:**
        * Cloud provider-specific modules interacting with the metadata service.
        * Code handling user-provided URLs/hostnames used in requests.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided input used in URLs/hostnames.**
        * **Use a whitelist of allowed URLs/hostnames for internal services.**
        * **Avoid unnecessary requests to the metadata service.**
        * **Implement network segmentation to limit Clouddriver's access.**
        * **Use an HTTP client with SSRF protection.**
