# Attack Surface Analysis for spinnaker/clouddriver

## Attack Surface: [1. Cloud Account Access via Clouddriver Credentials](./attack_surfaces/1__cloud_account_access_via_clouddriver_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access to cloud provider accounts (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) through compromised Clouddriver credentials.
    *   **How Clouddriver Contributes:** Clouddriver *requires* and *stores* credentials for each configured cloud provider to manage resources. It acts as a central point of access, making it a high-value target.  This is a *direct* attack surface of Clouddriver.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Clouddriver server via an RCE vulnerability and extracts the AWS access keys stored in Clouddriver's configuration. The attacker then uses these keys to launch EC2 instances.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of cloud resources, data breaches, financial loss, reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege:** Configure Clouddriver's cloud provider accounts with the *absolute minimum* permissions required. Use separate accounts for different environments. Leverage cloud-provider IAM roles.
        *   **Credential Rotation:** Implement automated, frequent credential rotation.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.). *Never* hardcode credentials.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Clouddriver instances in a secure network segment.
        *   **Auditing & Monitoring:** Enable detailed audit logs for both Clouddriver and the cloud providers.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unauthorized Clouddriver API Access](./attack_surfaces/2__unauthorized_clouddriver_api_access.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Clouddriver API, allowing them to manipulate cloud resources.
    *   **How Clouddriver Contributes:** Clouddriver *exposes* a REST API. This API is the *direct* control point for managing cloud resources through Clouddriver.  The security of this API is entirely Clouddriver's responsibility.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers that the Clouddriver API is exposed without authentication. They send API requests to delete all running virtual machines.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of services, data loss, unauthorized resource creation/deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication for the Clouddriver API (OAuth 2.0, etc.). Integrate with Spinnaker's Gate.
        *   **RBAC:** Implement fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
        *   **API Rate Limiting:** Prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all API input.
        *   **Network Restrictions:** Limit network access to the Clouddriver API.

## Attack Surface: [3. Exploitation of Clouddriver Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/3__exploitation_of_clouddriver_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party library or dependency *used by Clouddriver*.
    *   **How Clouddriver Contributes:** Clouddriver *directly* relies on these external libraries.  A vulnerability in a dependency is a *direct* vulnerability in Clouddriver.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a Java library used by Clouddriver. An attacker crafts a malicious request that exploits this vulnerability, gaining remote code execution on the Clouddriver server.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Clouddriver instance, potentially leading to cloud account compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep Clouddriver and *all* dependencies updated.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependencies to specific versions, and review updates carefully.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories.
