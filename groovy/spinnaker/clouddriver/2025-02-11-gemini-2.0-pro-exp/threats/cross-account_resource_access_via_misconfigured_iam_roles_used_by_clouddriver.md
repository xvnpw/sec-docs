# Deep Analysis: Cross-Account Resource Access via Misconfigured IAM Roles in Clouddriver

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Cross-Account Resource Access via Misconfigured IAM Roles" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within Clouddriver's implementation and configuration, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to provide the development team with the knowledge and tools to prevent this threat from materializing.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **Clouddriver's IAM Role Assumption Mechanism:**  How Clouddriver interacts with cloud provider APIs (specifically AWS, but principles apply to GCP, Azure, etc.) to assume IAM roles.  We'll examine the code responsible for this process.
*   **Configuration Files:**  How account mappings, IAM role ARNs, and other relevant settings are defined and used within Clouddriver's configuration.
*   **Trust Policies:**  The specific conditions and principals defined in IAM role trust policies that govern which entities can assume the roles used by Clouddriver.
*   **Condition Keys:** How condition keys (e.g., `aws:SourceAccount`, `aws:SourceArn`, `sts:ExternalId`) can be leveraged to restrict role assumption.
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Practices:**  How IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) can be used to manage IAM roles and trust policies in a consistent and auditable manner.
* **Cloud Provider Specific Modules:** Deep dive into `AmazonCredentials` and similar modules for other cloud providers.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General Spinnaker security best practices unrelated to IAM role assumption.
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying cloud provider's IAM service itself.
*   Attacks that do not involve exploiting misconfigured IAM roles (e.g., direct compromise of Clouddriver's credentials).

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the relevant Clouddriver source code (primarily within the cloud provider-specific modules like `clouddriver-aws`) to understand the role assumption process.  We'll look for potential weaknesses in how roles are assumed, validated, and used.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  Review example Clouddriver configuration files and documentation to identify how IAM roles are specified and how potential misconfigurations could arise.
3.  **Trust Policy Analysis:**  Analyze example IAM role trust policies to identify common misconfigurations and best practices for restricting access.
4.  **Condition Key Exploration:**  Investigate the use of AWS condition keys (and their equivalents in other cloud providers) to limit role assumption based on source account, ARN, and external ID.
5.  **IaC Best Practices Review:**  Examine how IaC tools can be used to manage IAM roles and trust policies in a secure and repeatable manner.
6.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Use the findings from the above steps to refine the existing threat model and identify specific attack scenarios.
7.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Develop concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Code Review (Focusing on `clouddriver-aws`)

The core of Clouddriver's interaction with AWS IAM is within the `clouddriver-aws` module, specifically in classes related to `AmazonCredentials`.  Key areas to examine:

*   **`AWSCredentialsProvider` and its implementations:**  These classes are responsible for obtaining AWS credentials.  We need to understand how they handle:
    *   **Role ARN Input:**  How is the role ARN provided to Clouddriver (configuration files, environment variables, etc.)?  Is there any validation of the ARN format?
    *   **`AssumeRoleRequest` Construction:**  How is the `AssumeRoleRequest` object (part of the AWS SDK) constructed?  Are parameters like `ExternalId`, `RoleSessionName`, and condition keys properly set?
    *   **Error Handling:**  What happens if the `AssumeRole` call fails?  Are errors logged and handled appropriately?  Is there a risk of fallback to less secure credentials?
    *   **Credential Caching:**  How are assumed role credentials cached?  Is there a risk of stale credentials being used?  Are credentials properly invalidated when roles are updated?
*   **`AmazonClientProvider`:** This class likely uses the `AWSCredentialsProvider` to obtain credentials and create AWS clients.  We need to ensure that the correct credentials (from the assumed role) are used for all API calls.
*   **Configuration Parsing:**  How are configuration files (e.g., `clouddriver.yml`) parsed to extract account and role information?  Are there any potential injection vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the parsing logic?

**Potential Vulnerabilities (Code Review):**

*   **Missing or Insufficient ARN Validation:**  If Clouddriver doesn't properly validate the format of the provided role ARN, it could be susceptible to injection attacks or misconfigurations.
*   **Incorrect `AssumeRoleRequest` Construction:**  Failure to set `ExternalId` or condition keys in the `AssumeRoleRequest` could allow unauthorized access.
*   **Poor Error Handling:**  If `AssumeRole` fails, Clouddriver might fall back to using default credentials (e.g., from the EC2 instance profile), which could have excessive permissions.
*   **Credential Leakage:**  Improper logging or error messages could expose assumed role credentials.
*   **Lack of Session Tagging:** Not using session tags can make auditing and tracing actions performed by Clouddriver difficult.

### 2.2 Configuration Analysis

Clouddriver's configuration files (typically `clouddriver.yml` or similar) define the accounts and roles it manages.  Key areas to examine:

*   **Account Definitions:**  How are AWS accounts defined?  What information is required (account ID, role ARN, etc.)?
*   **Role ARN Specification:**  How are role ARNs specified for each account?  Is there a clear mapping between accounts and roles?
*   **`externalId` Configuration:**  Is there a mechanism to configure `ExternalId` values for each role?  Is this configuration mandatory or optional?
*   **Default Credentials:**  Are there any default credentials configured that could be used if role assumption fails?

**Potential Vulnerabilities (Configuration Analysis):**

*   **Hardcoded Role ARNs:**  Hardcoding role ARNs directly in the configuration file is a bad practice.  It makes it difficult to manage and update roles.
*   **Missing `externalId`:**  If `ExternalId` is not configured, it significantly weakens the security of the role assumption process.
*   **Overly Permissive Default Credentials:**  If default credentials have broad permissions, they could be exploited if role assumption fails.
*   **Incorrect Account-Role Mapping:**  Typographical errors or misconfigurations in the account-role mapping could lead to Clouddriver accessing the wrong account.
*   **Lack of Comments/Documentation:** Poorly documented configurations can lead to accidental misconfigurations.

### 2.3 Trust Policy Analysis

The trust policy of an IAM role defines *who* can assume the role.  This is a critical security control.

**Example (Vulnerable Trust Policy):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy allows *any* principal in account `111122223333` to assume the role.  This is extremely dangerous.

**Example (More Secure Trust Policy):**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/ClouddriverRole"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "MyUniqueExternalId"
        },
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:instance/*"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy:

*   **Limits the Principal:**  Only the `ClouddriverRole` in account `111122223333` can assume this role.
*   **Uses `sts:ExternalId`:**  Requires a specific `ExternalId` to be provided during role assumption.
*   **Uses `aws:SourceArn`:** Restricts assumption to EC2 instances in the `us-east-1` region of account `111122223333`.

**Potential Vulnerabilities (Trust Policy Analysis):**

*   **Overly Permissive Principals:**  Allowing `root` access, wildcard principals (`*`), or overly broad roles to assume the role.
*   **Missing `sts:ExternalId`:**  Not requiring an `ExternalId` makes the role vulnerable to cross-account attacks.
*   **Missing or Weak Condition Keys:**  Not using condition keys like `aws:SourceAccount`, `aws:SourceArn`, or `aws:PrincipalOrgID` to further restrict access.
*   **Incorrect Condition Key Values:**  Using incorrect or easily guessable values for condition keys.

### 2.4 Condition Key Exploration

Condition keys are crucial for implementing the principle of least privilege.  Key condition keys for this threat:

*   **`sts:ExternalId`:**  A unique identifier that must be provided during role assumption.  This prevents "confused deputy" attacks where an attacker tricks Clouddriver into assuming a role in a different account.
*   **`aws:SourceAccount`:**  Specifies the AWS account ID from which the role assumption request originates.
*   **`aws:SourceArn`:**  Specifies the ARN of the resource making the role assumption request (e.g., an EC2 instance, a Lambda function).
*   **`aws:PrincipalOrgID`:** Specifies the AWS Organizations ID of the principal making the request. Useful for restricting access to roles within your organization.
*   **`aws:PrincipalTag`:** Allows restricting access based on tags associated with the principal.

**Best Practices (Condition Keys):**

*   **Always use `sts:ExternalId`:**  This is a fundamental security control for cross-account role assumption.
*   **Use `aws:SourceAccount` and/or `aws:SourceArn` whenever possible:**  These keys provide strong restrictions on *where* the role assumption request can originate.
*   **Use `aws:PrincipalOrgID` if applicable:**  This helps prevent unauthorized access from outside your organization.
*   **Regularly review and update condition key values:**  Ensure that the values are still accurate and reflect the current security requirements.

### 2.5 Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Best Practices

Using IaC tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.) is essential for managing IAM roles and trust policies securely.

**Best Practices (IaC):**

*   **Define IAM roles and trust policies as code:**  This ensures consistency, repeatability, and auditability.
*   **Use modules or templates:**  Create reusable modules or templates for common IAM role configurations.
*   **Implement peer review and code review:**  All changes to IAM roles and trust policies should be reviewed by multiple people.
*   **Use automated testing:**  Test your IaC code to ensure that it creates the expected IAM resources and that the trust policies are correctly configured.
*   **Use a version control system:**  Track all changes to your IaC code in a version control system (e.g., Git).
*   **Implement least privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to IAM roles.
*   **Regularly audit IAM roles and trust policies:**  Use tools like AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, or third-party security tools to monitor and audit IAM configurations.

### 2.6 Refined Threat Model and Attack Scenarios

Based on the analysis, we can refine the threat model and identify specific attack scenarios:

**Attack Scenario 1: Missing ExternalId**

1.  An attacker gains access to an AWS account (`111122223333`) where Clouddriver is running.
2.  The attacker discovers that Clouddriver is configured to assume a role in another account (`444455556666`), but the trust policy for that role does *not* require an `ExternalId`.
3.  The attacker crafts an `AssumeRole` request using the AWS CLI or SDK, specifying the target role ARN but omitting the `ExternalId`.
4.  The `AssumeRole` request succeeds, and the attacker obtains temporary credentials for the target role.
5.  The attacker uses these credentials to access resources in account `444455556666`.

**Attack Scenario 2: Overly Permissive Trust Policy**

1.  An attacker gains access to an AWS account (`111122223333`) where Clouddriver is running.
2.  The attacker discovers that Clouddriver is configured to assume a role in another account (`444455556666`).
3.  The trust policy for the target role allows *any* principal in account `111122223333` to assume the role (e.g., `Principal: { AWS: "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root" }`).
4.  The attacker uses their existing credentials (or any credentials in account `111122223333`) to assume the target role.
5.  The attacker uses these credentials to access resources in account `444455556666`.

**Attack Scenario 3: Weak Condition Key**
1. An attacker gains access to an AWS account (`111122223333`) where Clouddriver is running.
2. The attacker discovers that Clouddriver is configured to assume a role in another account (`444455556666`).
3. The trust policy for the target role uses a condition key, but the value is easily guessable or publicly known (e.g., `sts:ExternalId: "test"`).
4. The attacker crafts an `AssumeRole` request, providing the guessable `ExternalId`.
5. The request succeeds, granting the attacker access to resources in the target account.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies

Based on the deep analysis, here are concrete mitigation strategies:

1.  **Mandatory `ExternalId`:**
    *   **Code Change:** Modify Clouddriver's code to *require* an `ExternalId` to be configured for *every* account and role.  Throw an error if an `ExternalId` is missing.
    *   **Configuration Change:** Update Clouddriver's configuration schema to make `ExternalId` a mandatory field.
    *   **Documentation:** Clearly document the importance of `ExternalId` and how to configure it.

2.  **Restrictive Trust Policies:**
    *   **IaC Implementation:** Use IaC to define trust policies that:
        *   Limit the `Principal` to the specific IAM role used by Clouddriver in the source account.  *Never* use wildcard principals or allow `root` access.
        *   Include the `sts:ExternalId` condition with a strong, unique value.
        *   Use `aws:SourceAccount` and/or `aws:SourceArn` to further restrict the source of the role assumption request.
        *   Consider using `aws:PrincipalOrgID` if applicable.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit trust policies to ensure they adhere to these best practices.

3.  **ARN Validation:**
    *   **Code Change:** Implement strict validation of role ARNs provided in Clouddriver's configuration.  Ensure they conform to the expected format.

4.  **Robust Error Handling:**
    *   **Code Change:** Ensure that Clouddriver handles `AssumeRole` failures gracefully.  *Never* fall back to using default credentials with excessive permissions.  Log detailed error messages (without exposing sensitive information).

5.  **Credential Management:**
    *   **Code Change:** Review how Clouddriver caches and manages assumed role credentials.  Ensure that credentials are:
        *   Cached securely.
        *   Invalidated when roles are updated.
        *   Not exposed in logs or error messages.
    * **Use short-lived credentials:** Configure Clouddriver to request short-lived credentials whenever possible.

6.  **IaC for IAM:**
    *   **Mandatory IaC:**  Require that *all* IAM roles and trust policies used by Clouddriver be managed through IaC (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.).
    *   **Code Review:**  Implement strict code review and peer review processes for all IaC changes.
    *   **Automated Testing:**  Implement automated tests to verify the correctness of IAM configurations.

7.  **Regular Auditing:**
    *   **Automated Audits:**  Use tools like AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, and third-party security tools to regularly audit IAM roles, trust policies, and Clouddriver's configuration.
    *   **Manual Reviews:**  Conduct periodic manual reviews of IAM configurations and Clouddriver's code.

8. **Session Tagging:**
    * **Code Change:** Implement session tagging when assuming roles. Include tags that identify the Clouddriver instance, the operation being performed, and other relevant metadata. This improves auditability and helps track down the source of actions.

9. **Least Privilege for Clouddriver's Own Role:**
    * Ensure that the IAM role *under which Clouddriver itself runs* (e.g., the EC2 instance profile) has only the minimum necessary permissions. It should *not* have broad permissions to assume roles in other accounts. The role assumption should be the *only* mechanism for cross-account access.

10. **Configuration Sanitization:**
    * **Code Change:** Implement input sanitization and validation for all configuration parameters related to IAM roles and accounts. This helps prevent injection attacks.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of cross-account resource access via misconfigured IAM roles in Clouddriver. This will enhance the security of Spinnaker deployments and protect sensitive data and resources.
