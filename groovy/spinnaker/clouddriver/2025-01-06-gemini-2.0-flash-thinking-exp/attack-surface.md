# Attack Surface Analysis for spinnaker/clouddriver

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Cloud Provider Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposed_cloud_provider_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Clouddriver stores and utilizes credentials (API keys, access keys, service accounts, etc.) for various cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) to manage resources.
    *   **How Clouddriver Contributes:** Clouddriver's core functionality relies on authenticating to cloud provider APIs using stored credentials. The storage mechanism and access controls within Clouddriver directly impact the security of these credentials.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Clouddriver host or its data stores and retrieves the stored AWS access keys, allowing them to control resources within the associated AWS account.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the targeted cloud provider account, leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, service disruption, and financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault to store and retrieve cloud provider credentials instead of directly embedding them in configuration.
        *   Implement strong access controls within Clouddriver to restrict who can access credential configurations.
        *   Regularly rotate cloud provider credentials.
        *   Audit access to credential stores.
        *   Encrypt credentials at rest within Clouddriver's data store.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to Clouddriver's service accounts or IAM roles.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization Controls within Clouddriver](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_controls_within_clouddriver.md)

*   **Description:** Weak or missing authorization mechanisms within Clouddriver allow users or components to perform actions on cloud providers beyond their intended permissions.
    *   **How Clouddriver Contributes:** Clouddriver needs to translate user actions into cloud provider API calls. If this translation or the enforcement of permissions within Clouddriver is flawed, unauthorized actions can occur.
    *   **Example:** A user with limited deployment permissions in Spinnaker can leverage a vulnerability in Clouddriver's authorization logic to delete critical infrastructure components in AWS.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of cloud resources, privilege escalation, and potential security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) within Spinnaker and ensure Clouddriver correctly enforces these roles when interacting with cloud providers.
        *   Adopt the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to Spinnaker users and Clouddriver.
        *   Regularly review and audit Clouddriver's authorization rules and configurations.
        *   Implement fine-grained authorization policies that map Spinnaker user roles to specific cloud provider actions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Deployment Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_deployment_data.md)

*   **Description:** Clouddriver handles sensitive information related to deployments, such as application configurations, environment variables (potentially containing secrets), and infrastructure details.
    *   **How Clouddriver Contributes:** Clouddriver stores and processes deployment configurations and related data. If access to Clouddriver's data stores or APIs is not properly secured, this sensitive information can be exposed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to Clouddriver's database and retrieves application deployment configurations that contain database credentials or API keys used by the deployed application.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of application secrets, potential compromise of deployed applications, and information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt sensitive deployment data at rest within Clouddriver's data store.
        *   Implement strong access controls to restrict access to Clouddriver's data stores and APIs.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in deployment configurations whenever possible; utilize secure secret management solutions instead.
        *   Regularly audit access to deployment data within Clouddriver.

## Attack Surface: [API Injection Vulnerabilities in Cloud Provider Interactions](./attack_surfaces/api_injection_vulnerabilities_in_cloud_provider_interactions.md)

*   **Description:** Clouddriver constructs and sends requests to cloud provider APIs. If input sanitization is inadequate, attackers might inject malicious code or commands into these API calls.
    *   **How Clouddriver Contributes:** Clouddriver's responsibility is to translate internal requests into cloud provider API calls. Flaws in this translation process, particularly around handling user-provided data, can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates input parameters in a Spinnaker pipeline, causing Clouddriver to send a crafted AWS API request that creates a publicly accessible S3 bucket with malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification or creation of cloud resources, potential for data breaches, and execution of arbitrary commands within the cloud environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data used in constructing cloud provider API requests.
        *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with cloud provider APIs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security code reviews.
