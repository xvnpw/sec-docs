## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Clouddriver (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_clouddriver__critical_node_.md)

**Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security posture through vulnerabilities in or related to Clouddriver.
* **Attack Vectors:** All the high-risk paths listed below lead to this critical node.
* **Mitigation Focus:**  Implementing strong security measures across all areas related to Clouddriver, its configuration, dependencies, and interactions with cloud providers.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Clouddriver Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_clouddriver_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path involves directly exploiting weaknesses within the Clouddriver application itself.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Code Vulnerabilities in Clouddriver:**
        * **Description:** Leveraging flaws in Clouddriver's code, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE) or insecure deserialization, to gain control.
        * **Mitigation Focus:** Regular security audits, penetration testing, secure coding practices, and input validation.
    * **Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in Clouddriver:**
        * **Description:** Taking advantage of misconfigurations like exposed admin APIs or weak authentication to gain unauthorized access.
        * **Mitigation Focus:** Secure configuration management, regular configuration reviews, and the principle of least privilege.
    * **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Clouddriver:**
        * **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Clouddriver.
        * **Mitigation Focus:** Dependency scanning, keeping dependencies updated, and a robust vulnerability management process.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Cloud Provider Interactions (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_cloud_provider_interactions__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting the way Clouddriver interacts with cloud providers.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Abuse Cloud Provider API Permissions:**
        * **Description:** Utilizing Clouddriver's potentially over-permissive IAM roles to perform unauthorized actions on cloud resources.
        * **Mitigation Focus:** Implementing the principle of least privilege for IAM roles, regularly reviewing IAM policies, and using cloud provider guardrails.
        * **Clouddriver has Over-Permissive IAM Roles (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Description:** This specific configuration weakness directly enables the abuse of API permissions.
            * **Mitigation Focus:**  Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM roles to Clouddriver.
    * **Credential Compromise of Cloud Provider Accounts Used by Clouddriver:**
        * **Description:** Obtaining the credentials used by Clouddriver to authenticate with cloud providers, allowing the attacker to impersonate Clouddriver.
        * **Mitigation Focus:** Secure credential storage, encryption at rest, role-based access control to credentials, and regular credential rotation.
        * **Credential Compromise of Cloud Provider Accounts Used by Clouddriver (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Description:**  Compromising these credentials grants broad access to cloud resources, bypassing Clouddriver itself in many cases.
            * **Mitigation Focus:**  Implement robust secrets management solutions and strictly control access to these credentials.
            * **Steal Credentials from Clouddriver Configuration/Storage (HIGH RISK PATH):**
                * **Description:** Directly accessing Clouddriver's server or storage to extract stored credentials.
                * **Mitigation Focus:** Secure Clouddriver's environment, encrypt configuration files, and implement strong access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Manipulate Clouddriver Input/Data (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/4__manipulate_clouddriver_inputdata__high_risk_path_.md)

**Description:** This path involves manipulating the data that Clouddriver processes to achieve malicious goals.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Inject Malicious Deployment Manifests:**
        * **Description:** Injecting malicious code or configurations into deployment manifests that Clouddriver will execute.
        * **Mitigation Focus:** Secure deployment pipelines, manifest validation, and consider using immutable infrastructure.
        * **Gain Access to Deployment Pipeline/Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Description:**  Compromising the systems where deployment manifests are managed, allowing for their manipulation.
            * **Mitigation Focus:** Implement strong security controls for CI/CD pipelines, including access control and code review.
