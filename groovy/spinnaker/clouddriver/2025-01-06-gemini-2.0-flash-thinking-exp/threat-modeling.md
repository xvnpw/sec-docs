# Threat Model Analysis for spinnaker/clouddriver

## Threat: [Compromised Cloud Provider Credentials](./threats/compromised_cloud_provider_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Cloud Provider Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the credentials Clouddriver uses to interact with cloud providers. This could happen through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in Clouddriver's credential storage, phishing, or insider threats. Once compromised, the attacker can use these credentials to provision resources, access data, modify configurations, or even delete infrastructure within the connected cloud accounts.
    *   **Impact:** The impact can be severe, including data breaches due to unauthorized access to cloud resources, service disruption caused by resource deletion or misconfiguration, financial loss due to unauthorized resource usage, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Credential Management module within Clouddriver.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong credential storage mechanisms (e.g., using secrets managers like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secrets services) integrated with Clouddriver.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege by granting Clouddriver only the necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly rotate cloud provider credentials used by Clouddriver.
        *   Implement robust access controls and audit logging for credential access within Clouddriver.
        *   Employ multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible for accessing credential stores used by Clouddriver.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker manages to install a malicious plugin into Clouddriver. This plugin could contain code designed to exfiltrate sensitive information handled by Clouddriver, compromise the Clouddriver instance itself, or manipulate cloud resources through Clouddriver's established connections.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Clouddriver instance, potential data breaches of information processed by Clouddriver, unauthorized access to cloud resources managed by Clouddriver, and the ability to inject malicious code into deployment pipelines managed through Clouddriver.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin Management module within Clouddriver.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict controls over plugin installation and management within Clouddriver.
        *   Only allow installation of plugins from trusted and verified sources within Clouddriver.
        *   Implement a plugin review process, including security scanning and code analysis, before allowing installation in Clouddriver.
        *   Utilize plugin sandboxing or isolation techniques within Clouddriver if available.
        *   Regularly audit installed plugins and their permissions within Clouddriver.

## Threat: [Insecure API Interaction with Cloud Providers](./threats/insecure_api_interaction_with_cloud_providers.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure API Interaction with Cloud Providers
    *   **Description:** Clouddriver communicates with cloud provider APIs using insecure protocols or configurations (e.g., unencrypted HTTP, weak authentication *within Clouddriver's implementation*). This could allow an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept and potentially modify API requests and responses originating from Clouddriver, leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches related to cloud resources managed by Clouddriver.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of communication initiated by Clouddriver with cloud providers, potentially leading to unauthorized resource manipulation, data interception during Clouddriver operations, or denial of service against cloud resources managed by Clouddriver.
    *   **Affected Component:** Cloud provider integration modules within Clouddriver (e.g., `clouddriver-aws`, `clouddriver-gcp`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all communication initiated by Clouddriver with cloud provider APIs is performed over HTTPS with strong TLS configurations.
        *   Utilize secure authentication mechanisms provided by the cloud providers (e.g., IAM roles, API keys with proper signing) *and ensure Clouddriver is configured to use them correctly*.
        *   Regularly update cloud provider SDKs used by Clouddriver to benefit from security patches and improvements.
        *   Enforce secure coding practices when implementing cloud provider interactions within Clouddriver.

## Threat: [API Abuse through Clouddriver](./threats/api_abuse_through_clouddriver.md)

*   **Threat:** API Abuse through Clouddriver
    *   **Description:** An attacker, having gained some level of access to Clouddriver itself (e.g., through a compromised account or vulnerability in Clouddriver), abuses Clouddriver's API to directly interact with cloud provider APIs in a malicious way, bypassing Spinnaker's intended orchestration flows. This could involve creating backdoors in managed infrastructure, exfiltrating data from cloud resources accessible through Clouddriver, or launching denial-of-service attacks against the cloud provider using Clouddriver's established connections.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access and manipulation of cloud resources via Clouddriver, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption of applications managed by Spinnaker, and financial loss due to unauthorized resource usage orchestrated through Clouddriver.
    *   **Affected Component:** Clouddriver's API endpoints and authentication/authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Clouddriver's API.
        *   Enforce rate limiting and input validation on Clouddriver's API endpoints to prevent abuse.
        *   Regularly audit Clouddriver's API access logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege for API access to Clouddriver, granting only necessary permissions to users and services interacting with it.
