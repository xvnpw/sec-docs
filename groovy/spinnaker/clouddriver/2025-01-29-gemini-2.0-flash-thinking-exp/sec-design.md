# BUSINESS POSTURE

The `clouddriver` project, based on its name and context within the Spinnaker ecosystem, is likely a core component responsible for interacting with various cloud providers. Its primary business purpose is to enable multi-cloud deployments and management of applications. It acts as an abstraction layer, allowing Spinnaker and its users to interact with different cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.) through a unified interface.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enable multi-cloud application deployments and management.
- Provide a consistent interface for interacting with diverse cloud providers.
- Automate cloud resource provisioning and management.
- Improve application deployment speed and reliability across clouds.
- Reduce operational complexity of managing multi-cloud environments.

Business Risks:
- Cloud provider API changes breaking integration and deployment processes.
- Security vulnerabilities in `clouddriver` leading to unauthorized access to cloud resources.
- Performance bottlenecks in `clouddriver` impacting deployment speed and application availability.
- Lack of support for new cloud providers or features hindering adoption and future growth.
- Operational complexity in managing and maintaining `clouddriver` itself.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code reviews are likely performed as part of the development process. (Location: GitHub repository - pull request process)
- security control: Unit and integration tests are likely in place to ensure code quality and functionality. (Location: GitHub repository - test suites)
- security control: Dependency management is likely used to manage third-party libraries. (Location: Build files - pom.xml, gradle.build)
- security control: Version control system (Git) is used for source code management and tracking changes. (Location: GitHub repository)
- security control: Build automation is likely in place to compile, test, and package the application. (Location: Likely CI/CD pipelines - GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- security control: Deployment to production environments likely follows a defined process. (Location: Deployment documentation or operational procedures)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries introduces potential vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Complexity of multi-cloud environment increases the attack surface.
- accepted risk: Misconfigurations in cloud provider settings can lead to security breaches.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) in the build pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
- security control: Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) to identify vulnerabilities in the running application.
- security control: Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- security control: Regularly perform penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of security-relevant events.
- security control: Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) security scanning to identify misconfigurations in deployment configurations.
- security control: Implement secret management solution to securely store and access sensitive credentials.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: `clouddriver` should authenticate requests from Spinnaker components and authorized users.
    - security requirement: Authentication mechanism should be secure and resistant to common attacks (e.g., replay attacks, brute-force attacks).
    - security requirement: Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication within Spinnaker.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: `clouddriver` should enforce fine-grained authorization to control access to cloud resources and operations.
    - security requirement: Authorization should be based on the principle of least privilege.
    - security requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be implemented to manage user and service permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: All inputs to `clouddriver`, especially API requests and data from cloud providers, must be thoroughly validated.
    - security requirement: Input validation should prevent common injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - security requirement: Data received from cloud providers should be validated to ensure integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Sensitive data at rest (e.g., credentials, configuration) should be encrypted.
    - security requirement: Sensitive data in transit (e.g., API requests, communication with cloud providers) should be encrypted using TLS.
    - security requirement: Cryptographic keys should be securely managed and rotated regularly.

    style SecurityChecks fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style ArtifactRepository fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code and commits changes to the Source Code repository (Git).
2. Build System (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes.
3. Build System compiles the code, runs Automated Tests (unit and integration tests).
4. If tests pass, Build System performs Security Checks:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to analyze source code for vulnerabilities.
    - Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - Linters to enforce code quality and style guidelines.
5. If security checks pass, Build System builds and pushes artifacts (e.g., Docker images, JAR files) to the Artifact Repository (e.g., Docker Registry, Maven Repository).
6. If tests or security checks fail, the Build System notifies the Developer, and the process stops until the issues are resolved.
7. Deployment System (e.g., Kubernetes, Spinnaker Pipelines) retrieves artifacts from the Artifact Repository and deploys them to target environments.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Secure Build Environment: Use hardened build agents and infrastructure.
- security control: Code Scanning (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build pipeline to detect code vulnerabilities.
- security control: Dependency Scanning (SCA): Integrate SCA tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.
- security control: Container Image Scanning: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before pushing to the registry.
- security control: Code Signing: Sign build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- security control: Access Control: Restrict access to the build system and artifact repository to authorized personnel and systems.
- security control: Audit Logging: Log all build activities and security checks for auditing and monitoring.
- security control: Build Pipeline Security: Secure the CI/CD pipeline configuration and prevent unauthorized modifications.
