# Attack Surface Analysis for spinnaker/clouddriver

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Cloud Provider Credential Management](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_cloud_provider_credential_management.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure storage or handling of cloud provider credentials (API keys, access tokens) required for Clouddriver to interact with cloud environments.
*   **Clouddriver Contribution:** Clouddriver is responsible for managing and utilizing cloud provider credentials. Vulnerabilities in how Clouddriver stores, accesses, or handles these credentials directly expose this attack surface.
*   **Example:** Cloud provider credentials are stored in plain text within Clouddriver's configuration files. An attacker gains access to the Clouddriver server and retrieves these credentials, compromising the associated cloud accounts.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of cloud provider accounts, leading to data breaches, resource manipulation, service disruption, and financial losses.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault) for credential storage and retrieval.
        *   Encrypt credentials at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for cloud provider access, granting Clouddriver only necessary permissions.
        *   Implement regular credential rotation policies.
    *   **Users/Operators:**
        *   Configure Clouddriver to use a secure secret management system.
        *   Restrict access to Clouddriver's configuration and server environment.
        *   Conduct regular security audits of Clouddriver's credential management practices.

## Attack Surface: [Cloud Provider API Vulnerability Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/cloud_provider_api_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Indirect exploitation of vulnerabilities in cloud provider APIs through Clouddriver's interactions. While the vulnerability is in the provider API, Clouddriver's interaction patterns can trigger or amplify the risk.
*   **Clouddriver Contribution:** Clouddriver's core function is to interact with cloud provider APIs.  Its code and interaction logic determine how it uses these APIs, and thus how it might inadvertently trigger or be affected by API vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability exists in a specific version of a cloud provider's API related to resource filtering. Clouddriver, using this API, constructs requests in a way that triggers the vulnerability, allowing unauthorized resource enumeration or manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to cloud resources, data breaches, service disruption, and potential escalation of privileges within the cloud environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Stay informed about cloud provider API security updates and advisories.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data received from cloud provider APIs.
        *   Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for API calls.
        *   Manage API versions and update to patched versions regularly.
    *   **Users/Operators:**
        *   Monitor cloud provider security bulletins.
        *   Regularly update Clouddriver to benefit from potential fixes related to API interactions.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Clouddriver API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_clouddriver_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of strong authentication or missing authentication on Clouddriver's API endpoints, allowing unauthorized access and control.
*   **Clouddriver Contribution:** Clouddriver itself exposes API endpoints. The security of these endpoints, including authentication and authorization, is directly managed by Clouddriver's configuration and implementation.
*   **Example:** Clouddriver's API endpoints are exposed without any authentication. An attacker with network access can directly interact with the API to perform unauthorized actions, such as triggering deployments or modifying configurations.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized control over Spinnaker operations, potential data breaches, service disruption, and compromise of managed cloud environments.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for all Clouddriver API endpoints (e.g., OAuth 2.0, mutual TLS, API keys).
        *   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage API access.
        *   Consider using an API gateway for enhanced API security.
    *   **Users/Operators:**
        *   Enable and properly configure authentication for Clouddriver's API endpoints.
        *   Restrict network access to Clouddriver's API to authorized networks and users.
        *   Regularly audit API access controls and authentication configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Language Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/expression_language_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in expression languages (like SpEL) used within Clouddriver, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Clouddriver Contribution:** Clouddriver's codebase utilizes expression languages for dynamic configuration and pipeline processing.  If Clouddriver doesn't properly sanitize inputs used in these expressions, it creates a direct pathway for injection attacks.
*   **Example:** A malicious pipeline configuration containing a crafted SpEL expression is processed by Clouddriver. This expression executes arbitrary system commands on the Clouddriver server, leading to a full compromise.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Clouddriver server, leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and control over Spinnaker operations and managed cloud environments.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-supplied input before using it in expression language evaluation.
        *   Restrict the capabilities of the expression language engine to minimize the impact of injection.
        *   Conduct regular security audits of expression language usage.
        *   Consider safer alternatives to expression languages where possible.
    *   **Users/Operators:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and review processes for pipeline configurations.
        *   Provide security training to pipeline authors on the risks of expression language injection.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by Clouddriver.
*   **Clouddriver Contribution:** Clouddriver, as a software application, directly incorporates and relies on numerous third-party libraries.  The security posture of these dependencies directly impacts Clouddriver's overall security.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a Java library used by Clouddriver. An attacker exploits this vulnerability in Clouddriver, potentially achieving remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Ranging from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the vulnerability. Can lead to system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions, including security patches.
        *   Continuously monitor security advisories for dependencies.
        *   Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) into the development pipeline.
    *   **Users/Operators:**
        *   Regularly update Clouddriver to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Spinnaker and its components.
