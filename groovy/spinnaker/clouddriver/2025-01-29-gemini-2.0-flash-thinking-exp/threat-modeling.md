# Threat Model Analysis for spinnaker/clouddriver

## Threat: [Compromise of Cloud Provider Credentials](./threats/compromise_of_cloud_provider_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to cloud provider credentials stored by Clouddriver. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Clouddriver's credential storage, gaining access to the Clouddriver server, or through other means. Once compromised, the attacker can directly control cloud resources.
**Impact:**
*   Data breaches in cloud services.
*   Manipulation or deletion of critical cloud infrastructure.
*   Denial of service by disrupting cloud services.
*   Significant financial losses due to unauthorized resource usage.
**Affected Component:**
*   Credential Storage Module.
*   Credential Retrieval Functions.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secret managers.
*   Encrypt credentials at rest within Clouddriver's storage.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege for Clouddriver's cloud provider permissions.
*   Implement regular, automated credential rotation.
*   Restrict access to Clouddriver instances and credential storage.
*   Implement monitoring and auditing of credential access.

## Threat: [Insufficient Credential Rotation and Management](./threats/insufficient_credential_rotation_and_management.md)

**Description:** Cloud provider credentials used by Clouddriver are not rotated frequently enough or managed securely throughout their lifecycle. This extended validity period increases the window of opportunity for attackers if credentials are compromised.
**Impact:**
*   Prolonged unauthorized access to cloud resources if credentials are compromised.
*   Increased risk of undetected breaches and greater potential damage.
**Affected Component:**
*   Credential Management Module.
*   Credential Rotation Scheduling.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement automated credential rotation on a regular schedule.
*   Enforce credential expiration policies to limit validity periods.
*   Use a centralized secret management system for streamlined management.
*   Monitor credential expiration and proactively rotate them.

## Threat: [Insecure Credential Storage](./threats/insecure_credential_storage.md)

**Description:** Clouddriver stores cloud provider credentials using weak or no encryption, making them easily accessible to attackers who gain access to Clouddriver's configuration or data storage.
**Impact:**
*   Immediate compromise of cloud provider accounts.
*   All impacts associated with "Compromise of Cloud Provider Credentials".
**Affected Component:**
*   Credential Storage Module.
*   Configuration Loading Functions.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never store credentials in plaintext.
*   Use strong encryption algorithms and secure key management for stored credentials.
*   Integrate with dedicated secret management systems instead of local storage.
*   Conduct regular security audits of credential storage mechanisms.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Cached Data](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_cached_data.md)

**Description:** Clouddriver uses deserialization on cached data and is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. An attacker could inject malicious serialized objects into the cache, leading to remote code execution when Clouddriver processes this data.
**Impact:**
*   Remote code execution on Clouddriver instances.
*   Full system compromise of Clouddriver servers.
*   Potential lateral movement within the Spinnaker infrastructure and managed cloud environments.
**Affected Component:**
*   Caching Modules.
*   Data Deserialization Functions.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing data from the cache if possible, especially untrusted data.
*   Use safe serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers instead of Java serialization.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization before deserialization if unavoidable.
*   Keep Clouddriver and dependencies updated to patch insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   Perform security testing for insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Clouddriver Plugins/Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_clouddriver_pluginsextensions.md)

**Description:** Clouddriver plugins or extensions contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure dependencies). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise Clouddriver and potentially the managed cloud environments.
**Impact:**
*   Data breaches within Clouddriver or managed cloud environments.
*   Remote code execution within Clouddriver.
*   Impact depends on the specific plugin vulnerability and its privileges.
**Affected Component:**
*   Plugin Loading and Management Module.
*   Individual Plugins/Extensions.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce secure coding practices for plugin development.
*   Conduct security audits and code reviews of plugins before deployment.
*   Implement plugin sandboxing or isolation to limit vulnerability impact.
*   Use vulnerability scanning tools for plugins and their dependencies.
*   Implement a plugin whitelisting and review process.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugins/Extensions](./threats/malicious_pluginsextensions.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges installs a malicious plugin into Clouddriver. This plugin is designed to perform malicious actions, such as stealing credentials, manipulating cloud resources, or compromising Clouddriver's functionality.
**Impact:**
*   Full compromise of Clouddriver and potential control over managed cloud infrastructure.
*   Data breaches and denial of service.
**Affected Component:**
*   Plugin Loading and Management Module.
*   Potentially all Clouddriver components, depending on plugin capabilities.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls for plugin installation, limiting it to authorized administrators.
*   Implement plugin verification and signing to ensure authenticity and integrity.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of all plugins before installation, even from trusted sources.
*   Monitor Clouddriver activity for signs of malicious plugin behavior.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to plugin design, limiting resource access.

## Threat: [Insecure Clouddriver Configuration](./threats/insecure_clouddriver_configuration.md)

**Description:** Clouddriver is misconfigured in a way that introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This includes overly permissive access controls, insecure logging configurations that might expose secrets, or disabled security features.
**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to Clouddriver management interfaces.
*   Information disclosure, potentially including sensitive data.
*   Weakened overall security posture, making further exploitation easier.
**Affected Component:**
*   Configuration Management Module.
*   All components relying on configuration settings.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow security best practices for Clouddriver configuration.
*   Use secure configuration templates and automation tools.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege for access control to Clouddriver interfaces.
*   Conduct regular security configuration reviews to identify and remediate misconfigurations.
*   Follow security hardening guides and best practices for Clouddriver deployment.
*   Use automated configuration management to enforce consistent and secure settings.
