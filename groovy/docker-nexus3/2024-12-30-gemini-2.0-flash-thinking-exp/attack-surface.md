Here are the high and critical attack surface elements directly involving `docker-nexus3`:

* **Attack Surface: Default Administrator Credentials**
    * **Description:** The Docker image might ship with default administrator credentials that, if not changed, provide immediate full access to the Nexus Repository Manager.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:** The image provides the initial state of the Nexus instance, potentially including these default credentials.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses the default "admin" username and "admin123" password (or similar defaults) to log in and gain administrative control.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the Nexus instance, including access to all repositories, artifacts, and configuration. Potential for data breaches, malware injection, and supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Mandatory Password Change:** Force users to change the default administrator password upon the first login.
        * **Secure Credential Management:**  Do not hardcode default credentials in the image build process.
        * **Configuration as Code:** Use configuration management tools to set secure initial passwords during deployment.

* **Attack Surface: Exposed Ports**
    * **Description:** The Docker image exposes network ports (typically 8081 for HTTP) that are entry points for network-based attacks.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:** The `Dockerfile` defines the `EXPOSE` directive, making these ports accessible from outside the container.
    * **Example:** An attacker performs a brute-force attack against the login page on port 8081 or exploits a known vulnerability in the underlying Jetty web server listening on this port.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access, denial of service, exploitation of web application vulnerabilities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Nexus container within a private network.
        * **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the exposed ports to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
        * **Use HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt communication and protect against eavesdropping. Configure TLS termination appropriately.

* **Attack Surface: Underlying Operating System and Package Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** The Docker image is built upon a base operating system (likely a Linux distribution) and includes various packages. Vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:** The image inherits the vulnerabilities present in the base image and any added packages.
    * **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a library included in the base image (e.g., `glibc`). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the container.
    * **Impact:** Container compromise, potential for privilege escalation within the container, and potentially escaping the container to compromise the host.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Image Updates:** Regularly rebuild the Docker image to incorporate the latest security patches for the base OS and packages.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning of the Docker image during the build process and in the registry.
        * **Minimal Base Images:** Use minimal base images to reduce the attack surface.

* **Attack Surface: Docker Image Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities can be introduced during the creation of the `docker-nexus3` image itself, such as insecure configurations or the inclusion of vulnerable libraries.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:** The specific build process and included components of the `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image determine its inherent vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** The image might include an outdated version of a Java library with a known security flaw.
    * **Impact:** Container compromise, potential for malicious code injection, and unauthorized access to the container's file system.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Official Images:** Rely on the official `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image from trusted sources.
        * **Image Scanning:** Regularly scan the pulled image for vulnerabilities before deployment.
        * **Review Dockerfile:** Understand the `Dockerfile` and the components being added to the image.

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Configuration via Environment Variables**
    * **Description:** Sensitive information or insecure configurations might be passed to the container through environment variables, which can be exposed or logged.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:** The image might rely on environment variables for configuration, and if not handled carefully, this can introduce risks.
    * **Example:** Database credentials or API keys are passed as plain text environment variables, which could be exposed through container inspection or logging.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, leading to unauthorized access to other systems or data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secrets Management:** Use dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to securely manage and inject sensitive information.
        * **Avoid Sensitive Data in Environment Variables:**  Minimize the use of environment variables for sensitive data.

* **Attack Surface: Docker Daemon and Container Runtime Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying Docker daemon or container runtime environment can be exploited to compromise the container or the host system.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:** The `docker-nexus3` container runs on top of this infrastructure, making it susceptible to these vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A container escape vulnerability in the Docker runtime allows an attacker to break out of the container and gain access to the host system.
    * **Impact:** Host system compromise, access to other containers on the same host.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Docker Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the Docker daemon and container runtime to the latest stable versions with security patches.
        * **Secure Docker Daemon:** Follow security best practices for securing the Docker daemon.

* **Attack Surface: Supply Chain Attacks on the Docker Image**
    * **Description:** The official `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image itself could be compromised at the source, potentially containing malicious code.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:**  Direct reliance on the integrity of the published image.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the Sonatype's image build pipeline and injects a backdoor into the `docker-nexus3` image.
    * **Impact:** Widespread deployment of compromised software, leading to significant security breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Verify Image Signatures:** If available, verify the digital signatures of the Docker image.
        * **Use Trusted Registries:** Primarily pull images from official and trusted registries.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scan the pulled image for known vulnerabilities.

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Image Pulling from Public Registry**
    * **Description:** Pulling the `docker-nexus3` image from a public registry without proper verification can lead to pulling a malicious or outdated image.
    * **How docker-nexus3 contributes to the attack surface:** The initial step of obtaining the image introduces this risk.
    * **Example:** An attacker creates a malicious Docker image with the same name and tag as the official `sonatype/docker-nexus3` image and pushes it to a public registry. A user unknowingly pulls this malicious image.
    * **Impact:** Deployment of compromised software, potentially leading to any of the impacts mentioned above.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Trusted Registries:** Pull images from the official Docker Hub or a private, trusted registry.
        * **Verify Image Names and Tags:** Double-check the image name and tag before pulling.
        * **Content Trust:** Enable Docker Content Trust to verify the publisher of the image.
