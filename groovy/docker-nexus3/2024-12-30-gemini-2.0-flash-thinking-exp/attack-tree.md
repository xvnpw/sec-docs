Okay, here's the sub-tree containing only the High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes, along with a detailed breakdown of their attack vectors:

**Title:** High-Risk Attack Paths and Critical Nodes for Application Using docker-nexus3

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in the docker-nexus3 Image [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Identifying known vulnerabilities in the base image or the specific version of Nexus used in the Docker image.
    *   Exploiting these identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code within the container.
    *   This often involves using publicly available exploits or developing custom exploits.

**2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Discover Misconfigurations or Exposed Secrets in the Image [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Analyzing the layers of the Docker image to find accidentally included sensitive information.
    *   Discovering exposed environment variables containing credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
    *   Finding misconfigurations in the image's setup that could lead to vulnerabilities.

**3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfigurations in the Docker Deployment of Nexus [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Weak or Default Credentials for Nexus Admin:** Attempting to log in with default credentials or easily guessable passwords for the Nexus administrator account.
    *   Exploiting exposed ports on the Docker container without proper firewall rules to access Nexus services directly.
    *   Leveraging insecure volume mounts that expose sensitive data from the host system into the container.

**4. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Credentials Used to Access Nexus [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Phishing or social engineering attacks targeting users with Nexus access to steal their credentials.
    *   Credential stuffing or brute-force attacks against the Nexus login page.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in other systems (like LDAP or Active Directory) that manage Nexus user credentials.

**5. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Artifacts into Nexus [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Gaining write access to a Nexus repository by exploiting weak access controls.
    *   Using compromised credentials with write access to upload malicious artifacts.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Nexus API or UI that allow unauthorized artifact uploads.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Backdoored Libraries or Components:** Uploading seemingly legitimate libraries or components that contain malicious code designed to compromise the application.

**6. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Leverage Compromised Nexus to Impact the Application [CRITICAL NODE]**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Artifacts:** The application downloads and uses the malicious artifacts injected into Nexus, leading to its compromise.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exfiltrate Application Secrets or Configuration from Nexus:** Accessing sensitive information stored within Nexus that is used by the application, such as database credentials or API keys.

This focused sub-tree and the detailed breakdown highlight the most critical areas of concern and provide actionable insights for prioritizing security efforts.
