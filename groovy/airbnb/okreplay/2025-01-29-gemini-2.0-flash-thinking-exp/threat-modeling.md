# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Threat: [Accidental Recording of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_recording_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might gain access to OkReplay recordings that inadvertently contain sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII, tokens) due to misconfiguration or lack of proper filtering during recording. This could happen if developers don't carefully configure OkReplay to exclude sensitive data from requests and responses.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Unauthorized Access, Compliance Violations.
*   **OkReplay Component Affected:** Recording Interceptor, Configuration (URL/Header/Body filtering).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict filtering rules in OkReplay configuration to exclude sensitive URLs, headers, and request/response bodies.
    *   Utilize OkReplay's data sanitization or redaction features to mask or remove sensitive data before recording.
    *   Regularly review recorded data to identify and address any unintentional capture of sensitive information.
    *   Educate developers on secure recording practices and the importance of data minimization.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Recordings](./threats/insecure_storage_of_recordings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the storage location of OkReplay recordings could read and potentially exfiltrate the recorded data. This could occur if recordings are stored in publicly accessible directories, without proper file system permissions, or in insecure cloud storage.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Exposure of Application Logic.
*   **OkReplay Component Affected:** Storage Mechanism (File System, Custom Storage).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store recordings in secure directories with restricted file system permissions, limiting access to authorized users only.
    *   Encrypt recordings at rest, especially if they contain sensitive data.
    *   Avoid storing recordings in publicly accessible locations or in version control systems without careful access control.
    *   Implement access control lists (ACLs) or similar mechanisms to manage access to recording storage.

## Threat: [Replay Attacks with Malicious Recordings](./threats/replay_attacks_with_malicious_recordings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could create or inject malicious recordings into the system. When these recordings are replayed, they could exploit application vulnerabilities by providing crafted responses that trigger unexpected behavior, bypass security controls, or inject malicious data. In a worst-case scenario, this could lead to significant application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Application Crashes, Denial of Service, Data Corruption, Potential Remote Code Execution.
*   **OkReplay Component Affected:** Replay Mechanism, Response Handling in Application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat recordings from untrusted sources with extreme caution and avoid using them in production-like environments without careful review.
    *   Validate and sanitize data from replayed responses as if they were coming from a real external service.
    *   Do not solely rely on OkReplay for security testing. Use it primarily for functional testing and complement it with dedicated security testing methodologies.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the application to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious responses.

## Threat: [Leaving OkReplay Enabled in Production](./threats/leaving_okreplay_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental or intentional deployment of OkReplay in a production environment. This can lead to performance overhead, unexpected replay behavior, and potentially recording sensitive production data. In a critical scenario, unexpected replay behavior or recording of sensitive production data could have severe consequences.
*   **Impact:** Performance Issues, Unexpected Application Behavior, Potential Data Breaches, Operational Instability.
*   **OkReplay Component Affected:** Configuration, Deployment Process, Application Lifecycle Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict environment-specific configurations to ensure OkReplay is disabled in production.
    *   Use build processes and deployment pipelines to automatically disable OkReplay for production builds.
    *   Include automated checks in deployment pipelines to verify that OkReplay is disabled in production.
    *   Clearly document and communicate the intended usage of OkReplay and the risks of enabling it in production.
    *   Implement monitoring to detect unexpected OkReplay activity in production environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in OkReplay Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_okreplay_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** OkReplay, like any software, might contain security vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could compromise the application using OkReplay. Depending on the vulnerability, the impact could be critical.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, other severe impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **OkReplay Component Affected:** Core Library Code, Dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep OkReplay and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known vulnerabilities in OkReplay.
    *   Consider performing security audits or code reviews of OkReplay's integration within your application, especially if using it in security-sensitive contexts.
    *   Subscribe to OkReplay's release notes and security announcements to stay informed about updates and potential vulnerabilities.
