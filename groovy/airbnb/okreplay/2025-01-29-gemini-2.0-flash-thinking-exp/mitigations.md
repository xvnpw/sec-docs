## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Redaction (using OkReplay Interceptors)](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_redaction__using_okreplay_interceptors_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Data Sanitization and Redaction (using OkReplay Interceptors)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Catalog all types of sensitive data that might be present in network requests and responses (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII, credit card numbers, session tokens) that OkReplay might record.
    2.  **Define Redaction Rules:** Create a set of rules (e.g., regular expressions, keyword lists) to identify and redact sensitive data within request headers, request bodies, response headers, and response bodies *before* OkReplay stores them.
    3.  **Implement OkReplay Interceptor:** Develop a custom OkReplay interceptor. This interceptor will be registered with OkReplay's configuration.
        *   **Interceptor Logic:** Within the interceptor's `intercept` method, access the `RecordedRequest` and `RecordedResponse` objects. Apply the defined redaction rules to modify the request and response objects in memory. This might involve:
            *   Replacing sensitive header values with placeholder strings.
            *   Replacing sensitive data within request/response bodies (e.g., JSON, XML, text) with placeholder strings or masking characters.
        *   **Return Modified Objects:** Return the modified `RecordedRequest` and `RecordedResponse` objects from the interceptor. OkReplay will then store these *sanitized* objects.
    4.  **Register Interceptor:** Configure OkReplay to use the custom sanitization interceptor when recording.
    5.  **Regular Review and Update:** Periodically review and update the redaction rules and the interceptor logic to account for new types of sensitive data and changes in application behavior.
    6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the sanitization interceptor to ensure it effectively redacts all identified sensitive data without inadvertently removing necessary information or breaking replay functionality.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Recordings (High Severity):** Recordings might contain sensitive data that, if compromised, could lead to identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to systems. This is directly mitigated by sanitizing data *before* OkReplay records it.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Recordings:** High reduction. Redaction *within OkReplay's recording process* removes sensitive data from recordings, significantly reducing the impact of a recording compromise. This is a direct and effective mitigation within the OkReplay context.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic redaction for common API keys and password fields is implemented using a simple interceptor.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Redaction rules within the interceptor are not comprehensive and do not cover all types of PII or edge cases. Regular review and update process for redaction rules within the interceptor is not established. Testing of the redaction interceptor logic is not automated or systematic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Replay Usage to Controlled Environments (via OkReplay Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_replay_usage_to_controlled_environments__via_okreplay_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Replay Usage to Controlled Environments (via OkReplay Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment-Specific OkReplay Mode:** Configure OkReplay to operate in different modes based on the environment. Utilize environment variables or configuration files to control OkReplay's mode.
        *   **Development/Testing/Staging:** Configure OkReplay to operate in `RECORD` or `PLAYBACK` mode in these environments, allowing recording and replay functionality for testing purposes.
        *   **Production:** Configure OkReplay to operate in `DISABLED` or `NONE` mode in production. This effectively disables OkReplay's recording and replay capabilities in the live production environment.
    2.  **Configuration Management:** Use a robust configuration management system to manage OkReplay's environment-specific settings. This ensures consistent and reliable configuration across different environments.
    3.  **Verification in Production Configuration:**  Thoroughly verify the production configuration to ensure that OkReplay is indeed disabled and cannot be accidentally or maliciously activated through configuration changes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Replay in Production (Medium Severity):** Accidental replay of test recordings in production could lead to unexpected application behavior or data corruption if recordings are not compatible with the production environment. This is directly prevented by disabling replay via OkReplay configuration.
    *   **Malicious Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** If replay functionality is enabled in production, attackers could potentially exploit it to replay captured requests and responses against the live system. Disabling replay in OkReplay configuration directly removes this attack vector.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Replay in Production:** Medium reduction. Configuring OkReplay to disable replay in production directly prevents accidental misuse of replay functionality within the OkReplay library itself.
    *   **Malicious Replay Attacks:** Medium reduction. Disabling replay in OkReplay configuration eliminates the attack vector of replaying captured interactions *through OkReplay* against the live system.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. OkReplay configuration is managed through environment variables, and replay is intended to be disabled in production via configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal verification process for production OkReplay configuration is not in place to guarantee replay is disabled. Configuration management system for OkReplay settings could be more robust and centrally managed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure OkReplay Configuration (Principle of Least Privilege)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_okreplay_configuration__principle_of_least_privilege_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure OkReplay Configuration (Principle of Least Privilege)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Configuration:** Review OkReplay's default configuration settings and identify any settings that might be overly permissive or insecure in your context.
    2.  **Restrict Recording Scope:** Configure OkReplay to record only the *necessary* network interactions for testing. Avoid overly broad recording scopes that might capture more data than intended.
        *   **Specific Interceptors:** Use specific OkReplay interceptors to target only particular APIs or network requests for recording, rather than recording all network traffic.
        *   **Path-Based Filtering:** If OkReplay provides path-based filtering, use it to limit recording to specific API endpoints or URL patterns.
    3.  **Minimize Interceptor Usage:** Use only the necessary OkReplay interceptors. Avoid adding interceptors that are not strictly required for testing or sanitization, as each interceptor adds complexity and potential for misconfiguration.
    4.  **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store OkReplay configuration securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive configuration values (like storage paths or encryption keys, if directly configured in OkReplay - though encryption is handled externally in other mitigations). Use environment variables, secure configuration files with restricted access, or dedicated secrets management services for sensitive configuration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-Recording of Data (Medium Severity):**  Broad recording scopes might capture more sensitive data than necessary, increasing the potential impact of a recording compromise.
    *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** Insecure or overly permissive OkReplay configurations could potentially be exploited, though this is less direct than code vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-Recording of Data:** Medium reduction. Restricting recording scope minimizes the amount of potentially sensitive data captured by OkReplay, reducing the risk associated with recording compromise.
    *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities:** Low reduction. Secure configuration practices reduce the surface area for potential configuration-related vulnerabilities in OkReplay usage.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Recording scope is generally limited to API interactions under test.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal review of OkReplay configuration against security best practices is not regularly conducted. More fine-grained control over recording scope using specific interceptors or path-based filtering could be implemented. Configuration storage is not fully secured using dedicated secrets management for all sensitive settings (though minimal sensitive settings are directly in OkReplay config).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update OkReplay Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_okreplay_library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update OkReplay Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Gradle, Maven, npm, pip) to manage the OkReplay dependency.
    2.  **Vulnerability Monitoring (for OkReplay):** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD, GitHub Security Advisories) specifically for the OkReplay library itself. Monitor OkReplay's release notes and changelogs for security-related updates.
    3.  **Regular Updates (of OkReplay):** Establish a schedule for regularly checking for and applying updates to the OkReplay library. Integrate this into the software development lifecycle (e.g., monthly or quarterly dependency updates).
    4.  **Testing After OkReplay Updates:** After updating the OkReplay library, thoroughly test the application's OkReplay functionality to ensure compatibility and that the update has not introduced any regressions or broken existing tests that rely on OkReplay.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known OkReplay Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated versions of the OkReplay library might contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to potentially compromise the application or its testing environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known OkReplay Vulnerabilities:** High reduction. Regularly updating OkReplay patches known vulnerabilities within the library itself, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation of OkReplay-specific flaws.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency management is in place using Gradle, allowing for updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No formal vulnerability monitoring process specifically for OkReplay is established. Regular update schedule for OkReplay library is not strictly defined or enforced. Testing specifically after OkReplay updates is not a dedicated process.
