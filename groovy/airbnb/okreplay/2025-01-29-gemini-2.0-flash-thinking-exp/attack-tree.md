## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Cassette Manipulation (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_cassette_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to alter the behavior of the application by manipulating the cassette files that OkReplay uses to replay network responses. This path is high-risk because successful manipulation directly impacts the application's logic and data flow.

    *   **1.1 Modify Existing Cassette Content (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers modify the content of legitimate cassette files. This could involve changing response bodies, headers, or status codes to inject malicious data or bypass security checks.
            *   **Critical Node: 1.1.1 Access Cassette Storage Location:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Gaining unauthorized access to the location where cassette files are stored. This is the foundational step for all cassette manipulation attacks.  Common access methods include:
                    *   Local File System Access (e.g., on Android devices if cassettes are on external storage with weak permissions).
                    *   Network Share Access (if cassettes are stored on a network share with compromised credentials or weak security).
                    *   Server-Side Access (if cassettes are stored on a server accessible through web application vulnerabilities or compromised server accounts).

    *   **1.2 Replace Cassette with Malicious Cassette (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers replace legitimate cassette files entirely with their own crafted malicious cassettes. This allows for complete control over the replayed responses and application behavior.
            *   **Critical Node: 1.2.1 Access Cassette Storage Location:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Same as 1.1.1 - Unauthorized access to the cassette storage location is required to replace cassettes.

    *   **Critical Node: 1.3.1 Access Cassette Storage Location:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  While "Corrupt Cassette Data" path itself is not marked as High-Risk, accessing the storage location (1.3.1) is still a critical node because it's a prerequisite for potential Denial of Service attacks by corrupting cassettes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Cassette Storage Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_cassette_storage_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in how and where cassettes are stored. This path is high-risk because it can lead to both cassette manipulation and data leakage.

    *   **2.1 Unsecured Cassette Storage Location (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Cassettes are stored in locations that are easily accessible to unauthorized parties due to misconfiguration or weak default settings.
            *   **Critical Node: 2.1.1 Identify Storage Location:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Discovering the location where cassettes are stored. This is often achieved through:
                    *   Static analysis of the application code to find hardcoded paths.
                    *   Predictable default storage locations used by OkReplay or common development practices.
            *   **Critical Node: 2.1.2 Lack of Access Controls:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** The storage location lacks proper access controls, making cassettes readable and writable by unauthorized users or processes. Examples include:
                    *   World-readable directories on servers.
                    *   External storage on Android with insufficient permission restrictions.

    *   **2.2 Cassette Data Leakage (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Cassettes inadvertently contain sensitive data, and insecure storage or transmission leads to the exposure of this data.
            *   **Critical Node: 2.2.1 Cassettes Contain Sensitive Data:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Cassettes are recorded with sensitive information included in requests or responses. This can include:
                    *   API keys and authentication tokens.
                    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
                    *   Other confidential business data.

    *   **Critical Node: 2.3.1 Access Cassette Storage Location:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Similar to 1.3.1, accessing the storage location is critical even for less impactful attacks like Denial of Service via cassette manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Misconfiguration/Accidental Production Use (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_misconfigurationaccidental_production_use__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This path focuses on risks arising from improper configuration or accidental deployment of OkReplay in production environments. This is high-risk because it can directly expose production systems to vulnerabilities intended for development/testing.

    *   **4.1 OkReplay Enabled in Production Build (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  OkReplay interceptors and recording/playback mechanisms are mistakenly included and active in a production build of the application.
            *   **Critical Node: 4.1.1 Application Deployed with OkReplay Interceptor Active:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  The application is deployed to a production environment with OkReplay's network interception functionality still enabled. This can lead to:
                    *   Recording of live production traffic into cassettes, potentially capturing sensitive data.
                    *   The application relying on cassettes in production, making it vulnerable to cassette manipulation attacks.

    *   **4.3 Accidental Exposure of Cassettes in Production (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Even if OkReplay is not actively used in production, cassettes created during development or testing are accidentally deployed to production servers and become publicly accessible.
            *   **Critical Node: 4.3.1 Cassette Storage Location Becomes Publicly Accessible:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  The directory or location where cassettes are stored on a production server is misconfigured, making it publicly accessible via the web or other means. This can lead to:
                    *   Data leakage if cassettes contain sensitive information.
                    *   Potential replay attacks if the application logic in production can be influenced by these exposed cassettes.
