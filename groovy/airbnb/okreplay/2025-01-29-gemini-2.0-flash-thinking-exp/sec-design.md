# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Improve software testing efficiency and reliability by enabling deterministic replay of network interactions.
 - Reduce the flakiness of integration and end-to-end tests, leading to faster development cycles and higher quality software.
 - Facilitate offline testing and debugging of applications that rely on external services.
 - Enable easier reproduction of bug scenarios by capturing and replaying the exact network conditions.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk of exposing sensitive data if recordings are not properly secured, potentially leading to data breaches or compliance violations.
 - Risk of test environment instability if the replay system itself is unreliable or vulnerable, impacting development velocity.
 - Risk of misinterpreting test results if the replay mechanism is not accurate or introduces unintended side effects.
 - Risk of increased development complexity if the integration of the replay system is cumbersome or poorly documented.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code review process for contributions to the open-source project. (Implemented in: GitHub repository contribution workflow)
 - security control: Publicly accessible codebase for community security review. (Implemented in: GitHub repository visibility)
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by the project.
 - accepted risk: Lack of formal security audits or penetration testing for the open-source project.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in code and dependencies.
 - security control: Establish a process for reporting and triaging security vulnerabilities, including a security contact and response plan.
 - security control: Provide security guidelines for users on how to handle sensitive data when using the replay system, emphasizing data minimization and anonymization.
 - security control: Consider implementing Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to assess the security of deployed replay infrastructure if applicable.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Access to the replay system's configuration and management interfaces (if any) should be authenticated to prevent unauthorized modifications.
  - Requirement: If recordings are stored centrally, access to these recordings should be authenticated and authorized.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if multiple users or teams are using the replay system, to restrict access to recordings and configurations based on roles and responsibilities.
  - Requirement: Ensure that only authorized processes can write and read recordings to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Validate all inputs to the replay system, including configuration parameters, recording filters, and replay requests, to prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior.
  - Requirement: Sanitize and validate data extracted from recordings before replaying it to prevent injection attacks into the application under test.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: If sensitive data is expected to be recorded, provide options for encrypting recordings at rest and in transit to protect confidentiality.
  - Requirement: Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for any management interfaces or data transfer between components of the replay system.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Software Development Lifecycle: okreplay directly supports testing and debugging phases, impacting the speed and reliability of software development.
 - Quality Assurance: okreplay enhances the quality of software by enabling more robust and deterministic testing.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Network Interaction Recordings: These recordings might contain sensitive data depending on the applications being tested. Sensitivity varies greatly based on the application and data being recorded (e.g., API keys, personal data, financial transactions).
 - Configuration Data: Configuration settings for okreplay itself, including filtering rules and access control policies, need to be protected to maintain system security and integrity.
 - Logs and Audit Trails: Logs generated by okreplay and audit trails of user actions can contain sensitive information and are important for security monitoring and incident response. Sensitivity depends on the level of detail and data included in logs.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What type of data is expected to be recorded using okreplay in typical use cases? Is sensitive data (PII, financial data, secrets) commonly recorded?
 - What are the typical deployment environments for okreplay? Is it primarily used in local development, CI/CD pipelines, or dedicated testing environments?
 - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) that need to be considered for the use of okreplay and the handling of recordings?
 - Is there a need for multi-user support and role-based access control for okreplay in typical deployment scenarios?
 - What is the expected scale of recordings and replay sessions? Does okreplay need to handle large volumes of data or concurrent users?

- Assumptions:
 - Assumption: okreplay is primarily used in development and testing environments, not in production.
 - Assumption: Users of okreplay are developers and QA engineers with some level of technical expertise.
 - Assumption: Security is a secondary consideration for the open-source project itself, but users deploying and using okreplay in their environments need to consider security implications.
 - Assumption: Recordings are stored temporarily for testing purposes and are not intended for long-term archival unless explicitly configured.
 - Assumption: The deployment environment is assumed to be a typical development workstation or a controlled testing infrastructure.
