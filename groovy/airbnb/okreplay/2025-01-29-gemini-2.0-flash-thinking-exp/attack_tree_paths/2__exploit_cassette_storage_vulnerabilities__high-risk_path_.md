#### 2.1 Unsecured Cassette Storage Location (High-Risk Path)

**Description:** This sub-path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from storing OkReplay cassettes in locations that are easily accessible to unauthorized parties. This is often due to misconfigurations, weak default settings, or a lack of security awareness during development and deployment.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Direct Access to Cassettes:** Attackers can directly read, modify, or delete cassette files.
*   **Prerequisite for other attacks:** Unsecured storage is often a necessary first step for data leakage and manipulation attacks.

##### 2.1.1 Identify Storage Location (Critical Node)

**Attack Vector:** Discovering the location where OkReplay cassettes are stored. This is a critical node because knowing the storage location is essential for further exploitation.

**Attack Methods:**

*   **Static Analysis of Application Code:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers analyze the application's source code (if available or decompiled) to identify hardcoded file paths or configuration settings related to cassette storage.
    *   **Example:** Examining code for calls to OkReplay configuration methods or file system operations that reveal the storage directory.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Avoid Hardcoding Paths:**  Use configuration files, environment variables, or secure configuration management systems to define cassette storage paths.
        *   **Code Obfuscation (Client-Side):**  While not a primary security measure, obfuscation can make static analysis more difficult for client-side applications.
        *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct code reviews to identify and eliminate hardcoded sensitive information, including file paths.

*   **Predictable Default Storage Locations:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit knowledge of OkReplay's default storage locations or common development practices to guess where cassettes might be stored.
    *   **Example:**  Assuming cassettes are stored in a predictable directory within the application's data directory on Android or a common temporary directory on a server.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Override Default Locations:**  Always explicitly configure OkReplay to use a non-default, securely chosen storage location.
        *   **Document Secure Configuration:**  Provide clear documentation and examples on how to securely configure cassette storage, emphasizing the importance of avoiding default locations.
        *   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit application configurations to ensure default settings have been overridden and secure configurations are in place.

##### 2.1.2 Lack of Access Controls (Critical Node)

**Attack Vector:** The storage location lacks proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users or processes to read and write cassettes.

**Attack Methods:**

*   **World-Readable Directories on Servers:**
    *   **Description:** Cassettes are stored in directories on a server with overly permissive file permissions (e.g., world-readable, world-writable).
    *   **Example:**  Storing cassettes in `/tmp` or a publicly accessible web directory without proper access restrictions.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Configure file system permissions to grant access only to the necessary users and processes.
        *   **Regular Permission Audits:**  Periodically review and enforce appropriate file system permissions on cassette storage directories.
        *   **Secure Deployment Practices:**  Follow secure server configuration guidelines and deployment practices to minimize the risk of misconfigured permissions.

*   **External Storage on Android with Insufficient Permission Restrictions:**
    *   **Description:** On Android, cassettes are stored on external storage (e.g., SD card) without proper permission enforcement, making them accessible to other applications or even users with physical access to the device.
    *   **Example:**  Storing cassettes in a publicly accessible directory on external storage without using Android's permission system to restrict access.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Internal Storage Preference:**  Prioritize storing cassettes on internal storage, which is generally more secure on Android.
        *   **Android Permissions:**  If external storage is necessary, utilize Android's permission system (e.g., `MODE_PRIVATE` for file creation) to restrict access to the application itself.
        *   **Context-Specific Storage:**  Use `Context.getFilesDir()` or `Context.getCacheDir()` for application-specific private storage on Android.

#### 2.2 Cassette Data Leakage (High-Risk Path)

**Description:** This sub-path focuses on the risk of sensitive data being inadvertently included in OkReplay cassettes and subsequently leaked due to insecure storage or transmission.

**Potential Impact:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  Direct leakage of API keys, authentication tokens, PII, and other confidential data.
*   **Account Takeover:** Leaked API keys or authentication tokens can be used to impersonate legitimate users or applications.
*   **Privacy Violations:** Exposure of PII can lead to privacy breaches and legal repercussions.

##### 2.2.1 Cassettes Contain Sensitive Data (Critical Node)

**Attack Vector:** Cassettes are recorded with sensitive information included in requests or responses. This is a critical node because if cassettes contain sensitive data, insecure storage becomes a high-risk vulnerability.

**Attack Methods (Data Inclusion):**

*   **API Keys and Authentication Tokens in Requests:**
    *   **Description:**  API keys, bearer tokens, session IDs, or other authentication credentials are included in HTTP request headers or bodies and are recorded in cassettes.
    *   **Example:**  Recording requests with `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` headers or cookies containing session tokens.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Request Header/Body Filtering:**  Configure OkReplay to filter out sensitive headers and request body parameters during recording. Utilize OkReplay's configuration options to specify headers and body fields to be excluded or redacted.
        *   **Environment Variable Injection:**  Inject API keys and tokens as environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the application, reducing the chance of accidental recording.
        *   **Secure Credential Management:**  Employ secure credential management practices and avoid logging or recording sensitive credentials unnecessarily.

*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Requests/Responses:**
    *   **Description:**  Cassettes record requests and responses containing PII such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, or financial information.
    *   **Example:**  Recording API calls that retrieve or submit user profiles containing PII.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Response Body Filtering/Redaction:**  Configure OkReplay to filter or redact sensitive data from response bodies before recording. Implement custom response interceptors to sanitize or mask PII.
        *   **Data Minimization:**  Minimize the amount of PII processed and recorded during testing. Use anonymized or synthetic data whenever possible.
        *   **Data Privacy Awareness:**  Educate developers about data privacy principles and the risks of recording PII in cassettes.

*   **Other Confidential Business Data:**
    *   **Description:** Cassettes may inadvertently record other confidential business data, such as internal system information, trade secrets, or proprietary algorithms.
    *   **Example:**  Recording API calls that expose internal system configurations or business logic.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Careful Cassette Scope Definition:**  Clearly define the scope of cassettes and only record interactions that are necessary for testing and development. Avoid recording interactions with sensitive internal systems or APIs.
        *   **Regular Cassette Review:**  Periodically review recorded cassettes to identify and remove any inadvertently captured sensitive business data.
        *   **Data Classification and Handling Policies:**  Establish data classification policies and guidelines for handling sensitive business data within the development and testing environment.
