# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Attack Surface: [1. Storage of Sensitive Data in Recordings](./attack_surfaces/1__storage_of_sensitive_data_in_recordings.md)

*   **Description:** OkReplay's core function of recording HTTP interactions leads to the storage of potentially sensitive data (API keys, tokens, PII, etc.) within recording files.  If this storage is insecure, it creates a direct attack surface.
*   **OkReplay Contribution:** OkReplay is designed to record and persist HTTP traffic, inherently capturing any sensitive data transmitted during those interactions.
*   **Example:** OkReplay records API calls containing authentication tokens in request headers. These recordings are stored in a publicly accessible directory. An attacker gains access to this directory and extracts the tokens, gaining unauthorized access to the API.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to protected resources, severe privacy violations, compliance breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage Location:**  Mandatory secure storage for recordings. Use locations with restricted access permissions, not default or easily accessible directories.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:**  Implement encryption for recording files at rest to protect sensitive data even if storage is compromised. This is crucial for mitigating data breaches.
    *   **Data Sanitization (Pre-Storage):**  Proactively sanitize recordings *before* storage to remove or redact sensitive data. Automate this process where feasible to minimize risk.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Enforce the principle of least privilege. Only authorized personnel should have access to recording storage locations. Regularly review and audit access.

## Attack Surface: [2. Insecure Deserialization of Recorded Interactions](./attack_surfaces/2__insecure_deserialization_of_recorded_interactions.md)

*   **Description:** OkReplay deserializes recorded HTTP interactions during replay. If vulnerabilities exist in the deserialization process, or in libraries used by OkReplay for deserialization, malicious recordings could be crafted to exploit these flaws.
*   **OkReplay Contribution:** OkReplay's replay mechanism relies on deserializing recorded data. This deserialization step is a point where vulnerabilities can be introduced if not handled securely.
*   **Example:**  While less common with standard HTTP data, if OkReplay or its underlying deserialization libraries have a flaw, a specially crafted recording could be designed to trigger code execution when OkReplay attempts to replay it.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, Denial of Service (DoS), significant application instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep OkReplay and Dependencies Updated:**  Immediately update OkReplay and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Patching deserialization vulnerabilities is paramount.
    *   **Minimize Custom Deserialization:** Avoid implementing custom deserialization logic if possible. Rely on well-established and secure libraries for standard data formats.
    *   **Input Validation (Deserialized Data):**  Even for recordings, implement validation on deserialized data to detect and prevent exploitation of potential deserialization flaws.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on potential deserialization vulnerabilities related to OkReplay's replay functionality.

## Attack Surface: [3. Accidental Recording in Production Environments](./attack_surfaces/3__accidental_recording_in_production_environments.md)

*   **Description:**  If OkReplay is unintentionally enabled in production, it will record live production traffic, including real user data and sensitive system interactions. This leads to unintended exposure and storage of sensitive production information.
*   **OkReplay Contribution:** OkReplay's configuration and activation mechanisms, if not rigorously controlled, can lead to accidental activation in production, directly causing unintended recording of production data.
*   **Example:**  A configuration error or oversight results in OkReplay being active in the production deployment.  Real user transactions, including sensitive personal and financial data, are recorded and stored, potentially in a less secure location than production databases.
*   **Impact:** Data breach of production user data, severe privacy violations, significant compliance failures, potential reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment-Based Activation:**  Enforce strict environment-based activation of OkReplay. Use environment variables or dedicated configuration files to ensure it is *only* enabled in non-production environments (development, testing).
    *   **Build-Time Stripping (Production):**  Implement build processes that completely remove or disable OkReplay code from production builds to eliminate the possibility of accidental activation.
    *   **Automated Deployment Verification:**  Include automated checks in deployment pipelines to verify that OkReplay is definitively disabled in production environments post-deployment.
    *   **Production Monitoring & Alerting:**  Implement monitoring to detect any unexpected OkReplay activity in production and trigger immediate alerts for investigation and remediation.
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require code reviews for all changes related to OkReplay configuration and activation logic to prevent accidental production enablement.
