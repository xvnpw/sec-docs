# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_recordings.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the stored recordings (cassettes) and extracts sensitive information like API keys, passwords, personal data, or authentication tokens that were inadvertently recorded by `okreplay` during normal application usage or testing. This could happen through unauthorized access to the file system, cloud storage, or other storage mechanisms used by `okreplay`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, identity theft, or compliance violations.

**Affected Component:** `okreplay.cassette`, `okreplay.storage.fs` (if using filesystem storage), or any custom storage implementation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust filtering mechanisms within `okreplay`'s configuration to exclude sensitive headers, request bodies, and response bodies from being recorded.
* Avoid using `okreplay` in production environments where real user data is processed.
* Encrypt the stored cassettes at rest using appropriate encryption methods.
* Implement strict access controls on the storage location of the cassettes.
* Regularly review and sanitize existing recordings to remove any inadvertently captured sensitive data.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Recorded Interactions](./threats/manipulation_of_recorded_interactions.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains write access to the stored recordings managed by `okreplay` and modifies the recorded HTTP requests or responses. During replay, the application will interact with these tampered interactions, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, bypassing security checks, or injecting malicious data. The attacker might modify request parameters, response status codes, or response bodies within the `okreplay` cassettes.

**Impact:** Application malfunction, bypassing authentication or authorization, data corruption, introduction of vulnerabilities in testing or development environments that are then promoted to production.

**Affected Component:** `okreplay.cassette`, `okreplay.storage.fs` (if using filesystem storage), or any custom storage implementation, `okreplay.replay`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong access controls on the storage location of the cassettes, ensuring only authorized personnel or processes can modify them.
* Consider using a version control system for the cassettes to track changes and detect unauthorized modifications.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) on the cassettes to detect tampering.
* Avoid relying solely on replayed interactions for critical security decisions.

## Threat: [Replay in Incorrect Environment Leading to Unintended Side Effects](./threats/replay_in_incorrect_environment_leading_to_unintended_side_effects.md)

**Description:** Recorded interactions managed by `okreplay`, and intended for a test or development environment, are accidentally or maliciously replayed in a production or staging environment. This can lead to unintended side effects, such as triggering real-world actions (e.g., sending emails, making payments) based on the replayed interactions managed by `okreplay`.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unintended financial transactions, sending unwanted notifications, disruption of services.

**Affected Component:** `okreplay.replay`, application code that integrates with `okreplay`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict environment checks and controls to prevent `okreplay` replay in unintended environments.
* Clearly differentiate between recordings intended for different environments.
* Disable or remove `okreplay` functionality in production deployments.
* Implement safeguards in the application logic to prevent unintended actions based on replayed interactions, especially in sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `okreplay` Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__okreplay__library_itself.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered within the `okreplay` library code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses a vulnerable version of the library. This could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability (e.g., remote code execution, denial of service) within the context of how `okreplay` operates.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application or the underlying system, denial of service, data breaches.

**Affected Component:** All `okreplay` modules and components.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `okreplay` library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with `okreplay`.
* Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, including `okreplay`.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting `okreplay`](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting__okreplay_.md)

**Description:** The `okreplay` library or its dependencies are compromised by malicious actors, leading to the introduction of malicious code into the application. This could happen through compromised maintainer accounts, compromised package repositories, or other supply chain attack vectors directly affecting the `okreplay` library.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application or the underlying system, data theft, introduction of backdoors.

**Affected Component:** All `okreplay` modules and components, potentially transitive dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent versions of `okreplay` and its dependencies are used.
* Verify the integrity of the `okreplay` package using checksums or signatures.
* Use reputable package repositories and consider using private registries for internal dependencies.
* Employ software composition analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities and malicious code.
