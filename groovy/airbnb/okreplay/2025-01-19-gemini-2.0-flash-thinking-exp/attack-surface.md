# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_recordings.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, PII) present in HTTP requests or responses is unintentionally captured and stored by `okreplay`.
* **How okreplay Contributes:** `okreplay`'s core function is to record HTTP interactions, including request and response bodies and headers, which can contain sensitive data.
* **Example:** A developer records an authentication flow where the `Authorization` header contains a bearer token. This token is now stored in the `okreplay` recording file.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the recording files can lead to the exposure of sensitive credentials or personal data, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or regulatory violations.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Data Redaction:** Implement mechanisms to redact sensitive data from requests and responses *before* they are recorded by `okreplay`.
    * **Secure Storage:** Ensure that the storage location for `okreplay` recordings has appropriate access controls and encryption.
    * **Avoid Recording Sensitive Flows:** Carefully consider which interactions need to be recorded and avoid recording sensitive flows unless absolutely necessary with proper redaction.
    * **Temporary Recordings:** Use temporary storage for recordings and delete them after use.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Recorded Interactions](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_recorded_interactions.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain write access to the storage location of `okreplay` recordings and modify existing recordings.
* **How okreplay Contributes:** `okreplay` relies on a storage mechanism to persist recorded interactions. If this storage is not properly secured, it becomes a target for manipulation.
* **Example:** An attacker modifies a recorded response to inject malicious JavaScript code. When this recording is replayed, the application serves the malicious script to users.
* **Impact:** Replaying manipulated recordings can lead to various attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data corruption, or incorrect application behavior, potentially leading to further exploitation.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Storage Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls on the storage location for `okreplay` recordings.
    * **Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of recordings before replay.
    * **Immutable Storage:** Consider using immutable storage solutions for recordings.

## Attack Surface: [Insertion of Malicious Content via Recordings](./attack_surfaces/insertion_of_malicious_content_via_recordings.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that, when recorded by `okreplay`, introduce harmful content into the replay data.
* **How okreplay Contributes:** `okreplay` faithfully records the interactions it observes. If an attacker can influence the requests being made during the recording phase, they can inject malicious content.
* **Example:** During a recording session, an attacker sends a request with a malicious payload designed to exploit a vulnerability in the application when the response is replayed.
* **Impact:** When these recordings are replayed, the application might process the malicious content, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection (if the replayed data is used in database queries), or other injection attacks.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Recording Environment:** Ensure that recording sessions are conducted in a controlled and secure environment.
    * **Input Validation on Replayed Data:** Treat replayed data as potentially untrusted input and apply appropriate input validation and sanitization.
    * **Code Reviews:** Carefully review the code that handles replayed data to identify and mitigate potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in okreplay Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_okreplay_itself.md)

* **Description:** Bugs or security vulnerabilities exist within the `okreplay` library's code.
* **How okreplay Contributes:** By using `okreplay`, the application inherits any vulnerabilities present in the library.
* **Example:** A vulnerability in `okreplay`'s HTTP parsing logic could be exploited by crafting specific malicious HTTP responses that, when replayed, cause a buffer overflow.
* **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in `okreplay` can lead to various security issues, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical / High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Keep okreplay Updated:** Regularly update `okreplay` to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Audits:** Periodically audit the dependencies of `okreplay` for known vulnerabilities.
    * **Security Scanners:** Use static and dynamic analysis tools to scan the application and its dependencies, including `okreplay`, for potential vulnerabilities.
