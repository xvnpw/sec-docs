## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Recording Phase Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_recording_phase_weaknesses.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Data During Recording:** This path focuses on injecting harmful data into the recorded interactions that will later be replayed by the application.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack During Recording [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Intercept and Modify Requests/Responses Before Recording:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the services it interacts with during the recording phase.
            *   **Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., XSS, Command Injection):** The attacker injects malicious scripts or commands into the intercepted requests or responses. When these tampered interactions are replayed, the malicious payloads can be executed within the application's context.
            *   **Alter Data to Cause Application Errors or State Changes:** The attacker modifies data within the intercepted requests or responses. When replayed, this altered data can lead to unexpected application behavior, errors, or changes in the application's state, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities.
    *   **Compromise Recording Environment [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Gain Access to Server/Client Performing Recording:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the server or client machine where the recording process is taking place.
            *   **Modify Application Logic to Record Malicious Interactions:** With access, the attacker can modify the application's code responsible for recording interactions. This allows them to manipulate what is being recorded, potentially injecting malicious interactions directly.
            *   **Inject Malicious Data Directly into Recording Storage:** The attacker directly modifies the files or storage mechanism where the recorded interactions are stored, injecting malicious data that will be replayed later.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Replay Phase Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_replay_phase_weaknesses.md)

*   **Bypass or Manipulate Replay Logic [CRITICAL NODE]:** This path focuses on circumventing or altering how OkReplay replays recorded interactions.
    *   **Tamper with Replay Configuration:** The attacker targets the configuration settings that govern the replay process.
        *   **Modify Configuration Files to Skip Security Checks or Inject Malicious Data:** The attacker gains access to and modifies the configuration files to disable security checks during replay or to inject malicious data directly into the replay process.
        *   **Downgrade Replay Rules to Allow Malicious Interactions:** If OkReplay uses a rule-based system to determine which recordings to replay, the attacker attempts to downgrade these rules to force the replay of recordings known to contain malicious data.
    *   **Force Replay of Specific Recordings:** The attacker attempts to control which specific recordings are replayed by the application.
        *   **Identify and Trigger Replay of Recordings Containing Malicious Data:** The attacker identifies recordings that contain previously injected malicious data and manipulates the replay mechanism to ensure these specific recordings are replayed.
        *   **Prevent Replay of Benign Recordings, Forcing Malicious Ones:** The attacker manipulates the replay mechanism to prevent the replay of legitimate, benign recordings, effectively forcing the application to rely solely on potentially malicious recordings.

*   **Exploit Application's Trust in Replayed Interactions [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** This path exploits the application's assumption that replayed interactions are trustworthy and legitimate.
    *   **Replay Stale Data with Bypassed Security Checks [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker leverages the fact that security measures present during the original recording might be absent or ineffective during replay.
        *   **Application Relies on Replayed Data Without Proper Validation:** The application trusts the data being replayed without performing the same level of validation and sanitization it would for live, incoming requests. This allows stale or malicious data to be processed.
        *   **Security Measures Present During Recording are Absent During Replay:** Security checks like authentication, authorization, or input validation that were in place when the interaction was recorded are not enforced during the replay, allowing for bypasses.

*   **Information Disclosure via Replay:**
    *   **Extract Sensitive Data from Recording Files if Access is Compromised:** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of the recording files, they can directly access and extract any sensitive information contained within those recordings. This is a high-risk scenario if recordings contain personally identifiable information, API keys, or other confidential data.
