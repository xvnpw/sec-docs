# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Threat: [Accidental Recording of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_recording_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** OkReplay's interceptor module might inadvertently capture sensitive information present in HTTP requests or responses if not configured to filter such data. An attacker gaining access to these recordings could then exploit this information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, leading to potential account compromise, data breaches, and regulatory violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust filtering mechanisms within OkReplay configuration to explicitly exclude sensitive headers, request parameters, and response data.
    *   Regularly review and update the filtering configuration.
    *   Educate developers on best practices for avoiding the inclusion of sensitive data in recorded interactions.
    *   Consider using data masking or redaction techniques before recording.

## Threat: [Tampering with Recorded Interactions During Recording](./threats/tampering_with_recorded_interactions_during_recording.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the recording process could use OkReplay's interception capabilities to inject malicious or altered HTTP interactions into the recordings as they are being captured.
*   **Impact:** When these tampered recordings are replayed by OkReplay, they could lead to unexpected application behavior, bypass security checks, or introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While the previous classification was Medium, the direct involvement of OkReplay's interception makes a strong case for High impact if exploited effectively. Re-evaluating as High)*
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the environment where recording is performed. Implement strict access controls and monitoring.
    *   Ensure the integrity of the recording process by verifying the source of the recorded interactions.

## Threat: [Replaying Maliciously Modified Recordings](./threats/replaying_maliciously_modified_recordings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might replay recordings that have been tampered with, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities or bypassing security measures in the application through the replayed interactions facilitated by OkReplay.
*   **Impact:** Replaying these malicious recordings could directly exploit vulnerabilities in the application, bypass security measures, manipulate data, or cause denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement integrity checks for recordings before they are replayed by OkReplay.
    *   Ensure that the replay mechanism has appropriate authorization and authentication checks to prevent unauthorized replay.
    *   Treat replayed interactions with the same level of scrutiny as live incoming requests, including input validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure Through Unprotected Storage of OkReplay Recordings](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unprotected_storage_of_okreplay_recordings.md)

*   **Description:** If the storage mechanism used by OkReplay to persist recordings is not properly secured, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the stored recording files and potentially extract sensitive information contained within the HTTP interactions captured by OkReplay.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, leading to potential account compromise, data breaches, and regulatory violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls (authentication and authorization) for the recording storage used by OkReplay.
    *   Encrypt recordings at rest.
    *   Regularly audit the security of the storage infrastructure.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in OkReplay Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_okreplay_library.md)

*   **Description:** The OkReplay library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, buffer overflows) that an attacker could exploit if the application uses a vulnerable version of the library.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the OkReplay library updated to the latest version with security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to OkReplay and its dependencies.
    *   Perform security testing and code reviews of the application's integration with OkReplay.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting OkReplay Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_okreplay_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a dependency of the OkReplay library, injecting malicious code that is then used by OkReplay and consequently the application.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to vulnerabilities in the library itself, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in OkReplay's dependencies.
    *   Employ software composition analysis (SCA) to monitor the security of dependencies.
    *   Consider using dependency pinning and verifying checksums of dependencies.
    *   Stay informed about security advisories related to OkReplay's dependencies.
