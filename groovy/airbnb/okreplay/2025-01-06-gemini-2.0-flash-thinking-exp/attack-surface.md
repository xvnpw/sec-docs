# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Recorded Interactions](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_recorded_interactions.md)

* **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the storage mechanism of OkReplay recordings and modify the recorded HTTP requests and responses.
* **How OkReplay Contributes:** OkReplay's core functionality involves creating and storing these records, making them a potential target if the storage is not adequately secured.
* **Example:** An attacker modifies a recorded login response to always return a successful authentication, bypassing the actual authentication process during replay.
* **Impact:** Can lead to bypassing security controls, injecting malicious data into the application during replay, or causing unexpected application behavior.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the storage location of OkReplay recordings with appropriate file system permissions and access controls.
    * Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or signatures) on recording files to detect tampering.
    * Consider encrypting recording files at rest.
    * Limit access to the recording storage to authorized personnel or processes.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_recordings.md)

* **Description:** OkReplay records HTTP requests and responses, which might inadvertently contain sensitive information like API keys, passwords, personal data, or internal system details.
* **How OkReplay Contributes:** The very nature of OkReplay's recording process can capture sensitive data if not carefully configured.
* **Example:** Recording an API request that includes an authentication token in the header or a response containing user Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
* **Impact:** If the recording storage is compromised, sensitive data can be exposed, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict filtering rules in OkReplay to exclude sensitive headers, cookies, request bodies, and response bodies from being recorded.
    * Utilize OkReplay's configuration options to redact or mask sensitive data within recordings.
    * Secure the storage location of recordings with strong access controls and encryption.
    * Educate developers on the risks of recording sensitive data and best practices for avoiding it.

## Attack Surface: [Injection via Replayed Data](./attack_surfaces/injection_via_replayed_data.md)

* **Description:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate data received during replay, attackers can inject malicious payloads through manipulated recordings.
* **How OkReplay Contributes:** OkReplay provides the mechanism for introducing potentially untrusted data into the application's flow during replay.
* **Example:** Modifying a recorded API response to inject a `<script>` tag that will be executed in the browser during replay, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
* **Impact:** Can lead to various injection vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection (if replayed data interacts with a database), or even Remote Code Execution in extreme cases.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Treat data received during replay with the same level of scrutiny as data from external sources.
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data processed during replay.
    * Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
    * Follow secure coding practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
