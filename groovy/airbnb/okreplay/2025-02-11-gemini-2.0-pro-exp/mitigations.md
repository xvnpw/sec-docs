## Mitigation Strategy: [Tape Sanitization and Redaction (via OkReplay Interceptors)](./mitigation_strategies/tape_sanitization_and_redaction__via_okreplay_interceptors_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Tape Sanitization and Redaction (via OkReplay Interceptors)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Create a comprehensive, documented list of all sensitive data types potentially present in requests/responses (API keys, tokens, PII, etc.).
    2.  **Implement OkReplay Interceptors:** Utilize OkReplay's `Interceptor` interface. Create custom interceptor classes that hook into the request/response recording process.
    3.  **Redaction Logic (Within Interceptors):**
        *   **Request Headers:** Iterate through headers; redact/replace sensitive header values (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`).
        *   **Request Bodies:** Parse the body (JSON, XML, etc.); redact/replace sensitive values based on keys or patterns. Use regex for plain text.
        *   **Response Headers:** Redact sensitive headers.
        *   **Response Bodies:** Parse and redact sensitive data.
        *   **Consistent Placeholders:** Use placeholders like `[REDACTED_API_KEY]` to clearly indicate redactions.
        *   **(Optional) Hashing:** Consider hashing *some* values instead of full redaction (but be aware of rainbow table risks).
    4.  **Configuration-Driven Rules:** Store redaction rules (patterns, keys) in a separate configuration file for easy management without code changes.
    5.  **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test the sanitization with diverse inputs to ensure complete and accurate redaction.
    6.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review and update sanitization rules as the application and its API interactions evolve.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in Tapes (Severity: High):** Prevents leakage of credentials, PII, etc., if tapes are mishandled.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Severity: High):** Helps meet compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS) by preventing insecure storage of sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low with proper implementation).
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low, if all required data is sanitized).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented (e.g., in `src/test/java/com/example/MyServiceTest.java`). Basic `Authorization` header redaction exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive body redaction (request and response).
    *   Configuration-driven redaction rules.
    *   Formalized regular review process.
    *   Hashing is not used.
    *   Sanitization is not consistently applied across all OkReplay-using tests.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strategic Use of `MatchRules`](./mitigation_strategies/strategic_use_of__matchrules_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Strategic Use of `MatchRules`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Overly Broad Matching:** Do *not* rely solely on basic `MatchRules` like `MatchRule.method()`.
    2.  **Combine Specific Rules:** Use a combination of `MatchRules` to precisely match requests:
        *   `MatchRule.method()`: Match the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
        *   `MatchRule.uri()`: Match the request URI (or a pattern using regex).
        *   `MatchRule.headers()`: Match specific request headers and their values (important for authentication, content type, etc.).
        *   `MatchRule.body()`: Match the request body content (crucial for POST/PUT requests). Use with caution and consider partial matching if the body contains dynamic data.
    3.  **`MatchRule.times(n)`:** Use `MatchRule.times(n)` to limit how many times a tape can be replayed. This forces re-recording after `n` uses, helping detect API drift.
    4.  **Custom `MatchRule` (Advanced):** For complex scenarios, create custom `MatchRule` implementations to define highly specific matching logic. This allows for handling non-deterministic elements or ignoring specific parts of a request/response.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-Reliance on Mocked Data (Severity: Medium):** Encourages more comprehensive testing by requiring more specific matching.
    *   **Non-Deterministic Behavior Masking (Severity: Medium):** Precise matching helps reveal inconsistencies caused by non-deterministic elements.
    *   **Outdated Tapes (Severity: Medium):** `MatchRule.times(n)` helps detect when tapes are no longer valid.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-Reliance on Mocked Data:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Non-Deterministic Behavior Masking:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Outdated Tapes:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `MatchRules` are used, but often not precise enough.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of combined, specific `MatchRules` across all tests.
    *   Widespread use of `MatchRule.times(n)`.
    *   Custom `MatchRule` implementations are not present.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Tape Checksumming (via OkReplay Listeners/Interceptors)](./mitigation_strategies/tape_checksumming__via_okreplay_listenersinterceptors_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Tape Checksumming (via OkReplay Listeners/Interceptors)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Checksum Generation (Post-Sanitization):**  After a tape is *sanitized*, generate a cryptographic checksum (e.g., SHA-256) of the tape file.  This can be done within an OkReplay `Interceptor` or a custom `Listener`.
    2.  **Checksum Storage:** Store the checksum:
        *   In a separate file (e.g., `my_tape.json.sha256`).
        *   In a metadata file.
        *   (Ideally) Within a secrets management service, if used for tape storage.
    3.  **Checksum Verification (Pre-Playback):** Before OkReplay uses a tape, verify its integrity:
        *   Read the stored checksum.
        *   Calculate the checksum of the current tape file (again, within an `Interceptor` or `Listener`).
        *   Compare the calculated checksum with the stored checksum.
        *   If they *do not match*, throw an exception or otherwise prevent the test from running.  This signals tape tampering.
    4. **Integration:** Integrate this process seamlessly into the OkReplay setup, so it happens automatically for all tapes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Tape Tampering (Severity: Medium):** Detects unauthorized modifications to tapes.
    *   **Masking of Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium):** Ensures tests run against the *intended* recorded interactions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Tape Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Masking of Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects: checksum generation, storage, and verification within the OkReplay workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure OkReplay for Test-Only Usage](./mitigation_strategies/configure_okreplay_for_test-only_usage.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Configure OkReplay for Test-Only Usage**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Conditional OkReplay Initialization:** Wrap the OkReplay setup code (creating the `OkReplayConfig`, `OkReplayRule`, etc.) within a conditional block that checks for a test environment.  This prevents accidental inclusion in production code.  Example (using a system property):

        ```java
        if (System.getProperty("env.type", "prod").equals("test")) {
            // OkReplay setup code here...
            OkReplayConfig config = new OkReplayConfig.Builder()
                // ... configuration ...
                .build();
            okReplayRule = new OkReplayRule(config);
        }
        ```
    2.  **Build System Integration:**  Ensure your build system (Maven, Gradle, etc.) sets the appropriate environment variable (e.g., `env.type=test`) *only* during test execution.  This prevents OkReplay from being initialized in production builds.
    3. **Fail-Fast:** If, for some reason, OkReplay *is* initialized in a non-test environment, make it fail immediately and conspicuously. This prevents any recording or playback from happening.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Production Use (Severity: High):** Prevents OkReplay from being used in production, which could expose sensitive data or disrupt live services.
    *   **Misuse for Replay Attacks (Severity: Low):** Reduces the likelihood of OkReplay being misused, although network isolation is a stronger mitigation for this.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Production Use:** Risk eliminated (High to None).
    *   **Misuse for Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced (Low to Very Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
      * Partially implemented. OkReplay initialization is in test classes, but there isn't a robust, environment-based check.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A reliable, environment-based conditional check for OkReplay initialization.
    *   Integration with the build system to ensure the correct environment variable is set during testing.
    *   Fail-fast mechanism if OkReplay is initialized in a non-test environment.
