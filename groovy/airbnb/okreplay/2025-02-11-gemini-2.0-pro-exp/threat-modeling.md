# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Threat: [Threat 1: Sensitive Data Leakage via Tape Recording](./threats/threat_1_sensitive_data_leakage_via_tape_recording.md)

*   **Description:** OkReplay records HTTP interactions, including request bodies, headers, and responses.  If not properly configured, it will capture sensitive data like passwords, API keys, session tokens, PII, or internal API details within the recorded tape files (YAML). An attacker who gains access to these tapes can extract this information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** Compromise of user accounts, unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential financial loss, reputational damage, legal and regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   **Affected OkReplay Component:**
        *   `Recorder`: The core component responsible for capturing HTTP interactions and writing them to tape files (YAML format).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-Recording Filtering (Crucial):** Configure OkReplay's `matchers` and `filters` (e.g., `before_record` hooks) to *aggressively* redact or replace sensitive data *before* it's written to the tape. This is the most important mitigation. Specifically target:
            *   `Authorization` headers.
            *   `Cookie` headers (especially session cookies).
            *   Request bodies containing passwords, tokens, or PII (using regular expressions or custom logic).
            *   Response bodies containing sensitive data.
        *   **Post-Recording Sanitization (Secondary):** Implement a script that runs *after* recording (but before storage) to further sanitize tapes, removing any sensitive data that might have slipped through the pre-recording filters. This acts as a safety net.
        *   **Avoid Recording Sensitive Environments:** Never record interactions with production systems or environments containing real user data. Use mock services or synthetic data whenever possible.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Tape Tampering for Test Manipulation (Direct OkReplay Impact)](./threats/threat_2_tape_tampering_for_test_manipulation__direct_okreplay_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Although the *access* to tapes is an environmental concern, the *ability* to modify a tape and have OkReplay replay it without detection is a direct threat related to OkReplay's functionality. An attacker could modify request/response data within a tape to alter test outcomes or inject malicious payloads *that OkReplay will then replay*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** False positive test results, undetected vulnerabilities, potential for injected vulnerabilities to be deployed to production (because OkReplay is replaying the modified, malicious request).
    *   **Affected OkReplay Component:**
        *   `Replayer`: The component that reads and replays tapes.  It lacks built-in integrity checks by default.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Tape Integrity Checks:** Before replaying a tape, calculate a checksum (e.g., SHA-256) and compare it to a previously stored checksum. Reject the tape if the checksums don't match. This requires *external* tooling or scripting, as OkReplay doesn't natively support this.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures to sign tapes after recording. Verify the signature before replay.  Again, this requires external tooling.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Replay of Stale or Malicious Tapes (Direct OkReplay Impact)](./threats/threat_3_replay_of_stale_or_malicious_tapes__direct_okreplay_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to tampering, the *ability* of OkReplay to replay *any* tape without inherent validation of its age or context is a direct threat. An attacker could replay an old tape with expired credentials or a crafted tape to exploit vulnerabilities, and OkReplay will execute the requests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Unauthorized access, bypass of security controls, potential for exploitation of previously patched vulnerabilities (because OkReplay is replaying the old, potentially vulnerable request).
    *   **Affected OkReplay Component:**
        *   `Replayer`: The component that reads and replays tapes. It lacks built-in time-based or contextual validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Timestamping and Expiration:** Include timestamps in tape metadata (e.g., in the YAML file). During replay, *use external scripting* to check the timestamp and reject tapes older than a defined threshold. OkReplay does not do this natively.
        *   **Contextual Validation:** During replay, *use external scripting or application-level logic* to validate the context of the request. For example, check if a session token is still valid by querying the application's authentication system. OkReplay does not do this natively.

## Threat: [Threat 4: OkReplay Itself Contains Vulnerabilities](./threats/threat_4_okreplay_itself_contains_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within OkReplay's code (e.g., a buffer overflow in the YAML parser or a flaw in the replay logic). An attacker crafts a malicious tape that exploits this vulnerability when OkReplay attempts to read or replay it. This could lead to code execution within the context of the OkReplay process.
    *   **Impact:**
        * **High:** Code execution on the machine running OkReplay, potential for privilege escalation (if OkReplay is running with elevated privileges).
    *   **Affected OkReplay Component:**
        *   `Recorder`: Potentially vulnerable during tape writing (if the vulnerability is in the YAML serialization).
        *   `Replayer`: Potentially vulnerable during tape reading and replay (if the vulnerability is in the YAML parsing or replay logic).
        *   Any component that handles tape data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep OkReplay Updated:** Regularly update OkReplay to the latest version. This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Run with Least Privilege:** Avoid running OkReplay with unnecessary privileges (e.g., don't run it as root or administrator). Run it as a dedicated user with limited permissions.
