# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for airbnb/okreplay

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Data Scrubbing/Redaction within OkReplay](./mitigation_strategies/implement_data_scrubbingredaction_within_okreplay.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine the types of sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII, etc.) that might be present in API requests and responses recorded by OkReplay.
    2.  **Utilize OkReplay Interceptors/Customization:** Explore OkReplay's capabilities for request and response interception or modification.  This might involve using OkReplay's built-in mechanisms (if available, check OkReplay documentation for interceptors or middleware) or extending OkReplay with custom code.
    3.  **Develop Scrubbing Logic:**  Write code within the interceptor or customization point to identify and redact sensitive data. This could involve:
        *   Regular expressions to match patterns of sensitive data in headers and bodies.
        *   Keyword lists to identify specific sensitive fields.
        *   Data type detection (if feasible within OkReplay's context) to identify and redact data based on its type.
    4.  **Apply Scrubbing Before Recording:** Ensure the scrubbing logic is applied *before* OkReplay persists the request and response data to the recording file.
    5.  **Configure OkReplay with Scrubbing:** Integrate the scrubbing logic into your OkReplay configuration so it's automatically applied during recording creation.
    6.  **Test Scrubbing:** Verify that the scrubbing effectively removes sensitive data from recordings without breaking the functionality of your tests that rely on these recordings.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of committing recordings containing real API keys, passwords, PII, or other secrets to version control.
    *   Data Breach via Exposed Recordings (Severity: High) -  Lowers the impact if recordings are compromised, as sensitive data is redacted within the recordings themselves.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings: High Reduction - Directly addresses the risk by modifying the data OkReplay saves.
    *   Data Breach via Exposed Recordings: High Reduction -  Significantly reduces the value of compromised recordings to an attacker.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Data scrubbing *within OkReplay's configuration or extension points* is not currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to investigate OkReplay's documentation for interceptor or customization mechanisms. If available, implement the scrubbing logic within these mechanisms and configure OkReplay to use them. If OkReplay doesn't offer direct interception, consider wrapping OkReplay's recording functionality with a custom layer that performs scrubbing before calling OkReplay's save methods.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Exclude Sensitive Endpoints via OkReplay Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/exclude_sensitive_endpoints_via_okreplay_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Endpoints:** List API endpoints that handle sensitive operations (authentication, payments, user profiles, etc.) or are likely to return sensitive data.
    2.  **Utilize OkReplay's Exclusion Features:** Consult OkReplay's documentation to identify configuration options for excluding specific URLs or request patterns from being recorded.  This might involve:
        *   URL Path Matching:  Configuring OkReplay to ignore recordings for URLs matching specific patterns (e.g., `/api/auth/*`, `/api/payment/*`).
        *   Request Header Inspection:  Using request headers (if supported by OkReplay's exclusion features) to identify and exclude certain requests.
    3.  **Configure OkReplay Exclusions:**  Modify your OkReplay configuration file or setup code to define the exclusion rules for the identified sensitive endpoints.
    4.  **Verify Exclusion Configuration:**  Run tests with OkReplay enabled and confirm that requests to the excluded sensitive endpoints are *not* being recorded. Check the output logs or recording files to ensure the exclusions are working as expected.
    5.  **Maintain Exclusion List:** Regularly review and update the list of excluded endpoints in your OkReplay configuration as your application evolves and new sensitive endpoints are introduced.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings (Severity: High) - Prevents OkReplay from even attempting to record interactions with endpoints known to handle sensitive data.
    *   Over-Recording and Unnecessary Data Storage (Severity: Low) - Reduces the volume of recordings by excluding interactions that are less relevant for functional testing and more likely to contain sensitive information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings: Medium Reduction - Proactively prevents recording of high-risk interactions by OkReplay.
    *   Over-Recording and Unnecessary Data Storage: Low Reduction - Minor benefit in terms of reduced recording size and potential performance.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Endpoint exclusion is not currently configured within our OkReplay setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to review OkReplay's configuration documentation to find the appropriate settings for URL or pattern-based exclusion. Then, identify sensitive endpoints and configure these exclusions in our OkReplay setup. This might involve updating configuration files or code that initializes OkReplay.
