## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using OkReplay - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the OkReplay library or its integration.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Recording Phase Vulnerabilities
    * [CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Data into Recordings
    * [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Recording of Sensitive Data
        * Misconfigured Recording Rules
        * Lack of Data Masking
* [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Storage Phase Vulnerabilities
    * [CRITICAL NODE] Access and Modify Stored Recordings
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Storage Location
        * [HIGH RISK PATH] Lack of Encryption
* Exploit Replay Phase Vulnerabilities
    * [CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Replayed Responses
        * Modify Stored Recordings (See "Exploit Storage Phase")
* Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities
    * [CRITICAL NODE] Modify OkReplay Configuration

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Recording Phase Vulnerabilities:**

* This path focuses on compromising the application during the recording of HTTP interactions by OkReplay. Success here can lead to the application replaying malicious or sensitive data.

    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Data into Recordings:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to insert malicious payloads into the recorded requests and responses. This can be achieved through:
            * **Man-in-the-Middle Attack During Recording:** Intercepting network traffic during the recording process and modifying the data being captured. This requires the recording process to be vulnerable to interception (e.g., using unencrypted communication).
            * **Application Logic Flaws During Recording:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's logic that allow for the creation of crafted requests or responses that are then recorded by OkReplay.
            * **Vulnerable Data Sanitization in Recording Logic:** Bypassing or exploiting weaknesses in OkReplay's data sanitization or escaping mechanisms during the recording process to inject malicious scripts or code.

    * **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Recording of Sensitive Data:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The goal is to force OkReplay to record sensitive information that should not be persisted. This can happen due to:
            * **Misconfigured Recording Rules:**  Developers incorrectly configuring OkReplay to record requests and responses for endpoints that handle sensitive data (e.g., authentication credentials, personal information).
            * **Lack of Data Masking:**  Failure to implement or properly configure OkReplay's data masking features, resulting in sensitive information being recorded in plaintext.

**2. [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Storage Phase Vulnerabilities:**

* This path targets the storage mechanism used by OkReplay to persist the recorded interactions. Compromising the storage can lead to data breaches or manipulation of replayed responses.

    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Access and Modify Stored Recordings:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the stored recordings and alters their content. This can be achieved through:
            * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Storage Location:** Recordings are stored in a location with weak file permissions or are publicly accessible (e.g., on a web server without proper access controls).
            * **[HIGH RISK PATH] Lack of Encryption:** Recordings are stored without encryption, allowing an attacker with access to the storage location to read and modify the contents in plaintext.

**3. Exploit Replay Phase Vulnerabilities:**

* This path focuses on manipulating the application during the replay of recorded interactions.

    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Replayed Responses:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to control the responses served by the application during replay. This is primarily achieved by:
            * **Modify Stored Recordings (See "Exploit Storage Phase"):** As highlighted, compromising the storage allows for direct modification of the responses that will be replayed.
            * **Force Replay of Maliciously Crafted Recordings:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's logic to influence which recordings are replayed, allowing the attacker to force the replay of recordings they have previously injected with malicious content.

**4. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities:**

* This path targets the configuration of OkReplay itself, aiming to weaken its security or alter its behavior.

    * **[CRITICAL NODE] Modify OkReplay Configuration:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains the ability to change OkReplay's configuration settings. This can be done by:
            * **Access Configuration Files:** Exploiting file system vulnerabilities or weak permissions to access and modify OkReplay's configuration files.
            * **Manipulate Environment Variables:**  If OkReplay relies on environment variables for configuration, an attacker who can manipulate these variables can alter its behavior.

This focused sub-tree and detailed breakdown highlight the most critical areas of concern for applications using OkReplay. Prioritizing mitigation efforts on these high-risk paths and critical nodes will significantly improve the application's security posture.
