**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths:**

*   **High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Jenkins Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits an unpatched vulnerability in the Jenkins instance. This could be a known remote code execution vulnerability or a flaw allowing access to the script console.
    *   **Progression:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker unauthorized access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Impact:** With unauthorized access, the attacker can execute malicious scripts within Jenkins.
    *   **Further Impact:** This allows the attacker to compromise the application deployment pipeline, potentially modifying build scripts or configurations.
    *   **Final Stage:** The attacker injects malicious code into the application artifacts during the build process, leading to the deployment of a compromised application.

*   **High-Risk Path 2: Misconfigured Default Credentials for Jenkins**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The development team fails to change the default administrative credentials for the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Progression:** An attacker attempts to log in using well-known default usernames and passwords for Jenkins.
    *   **Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker full administrative access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Subsequent Actions:** From this point, the attacker can follow the same steps as in "Exploiting Jenkins Vulnerabilities" to compromise the application.

*   **High-Risk Path 3: Insecure Port Mappings Exposing Jenkins**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The Docker Compose configuration or network setup incorrectly exposes the internal port of the Jenkins container directly to the internet without proper access controls.
    *   **Progression:** An attacker can directly access the Jenkins service from the internet.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   If Jenkins has weak or missing authentication, the attacker gains immediate unauthorized access.
        *   Even with authentication, the exposed service becomes a prime target for exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Jenkins version being used.
    *   **Final Stage:**  Once access is gained, the attacker can proceed to compromise the application deployment pipeline as described in "Exploiting Jenkins Vulnerabilities".

**Detailed Breakdown of Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Jenkins:** This node is critical because successful exploitation provides a direct pathway to controlling the CI/CD pipeline and injecting malicious code.
*   **Exploit Unpatched Jenkins Vulnerability (e.g., script console access, remote code execution):** This is a critical entry point. Unpatched vulnerabilities are prime targets for attackers, and successful exploitation often leads to significant control.
*   **Gain unauthorized access to Jenkins instance:** This node represents a major breach. With access to Jenkins, an attacker can manipulate builds, access secrets, and control deployments.
*   **Compromise application deployment pipeline:** This node signifies a significant compromise. Control over the deployment pipeline allows for the systematic injection of malicious code into every application deployment.
*   **Use default credentials for Jenkins:** This is a critical misconfiguration. Default credentials are widely known and easily exploited, providing immediate administrative access.
*   **Gain administrative access to Jenkins:**  This level of access grants complete control over the Jenkins instance and its functionalities, making it a highly critical point of compromise.
*   **Insecure Port Mappings:** This misconfiguration creates a direct and easily exploitable attack surface, exposing internal services to the internet.
*   **Expose internal ports of tool stack components directly to the internet:** This node represents a critical security oversight, making internal services directly accessible to attackers.
*   **Jenkins instance has weak or no authentication:** This critical misconfiguration allows any attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Jenkins instance with minimal effort.
*   **Attacker gains access to the repository containing the docker-ci-tool-stack configuration:** This node is critical because it allows the attacker to manipulate the entire infrastructure setup, potentially introducing backdoors or malicious components at a foundational level.
*   **The docker-ci-tool-stack uses outdated or vulnerable versions of Jenkins, SonarQube, or Nexus:** This node represents a critical security weakness. Using outdated software exposes the system to known and readily exploitable vulnerabilities.
