Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `docker-ci-tool-stack`, focusing on high and critical severity:

* **Default Administrative Credentials for Web Interfaces:**
    * **Description:** Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus often come with default administrative credentials that are publicly known.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` *directly deploys instances* of these services. If the user doesn't change the default credentials upon deployment, the stack *immediately provides vulnerable entry points*.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses "admin:admin" (or similar default credentials) to log into the Jenkins, SonarQube, or Nexus web interface deployed by the stack.
    * **Impact:** Full administrative control over the respective service, allowing for code execution, data manipulation, and further attacks on the infrastructure managed by the stack.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Immediately change default passwords** for all services (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus) upon initial deployment of the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
        * **Document the necessity of changing default credentials prominently** in the stack's usage instructions.
        * **Consider providing mechanisms or scripts within the stack** to facilitate secure initial password configuration.

* **Exposed Jenkins Web Interface and API Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Jenkins, being a complex CI/CD server, has a wide attack surface through its web interface and API. This includes vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and API abuse.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The stack *explicitly configures Traefik to expose the Jenkins web interface*, making it accessible. The *default configuration provided by the stack* might not include strict security measures for the Jenkins instance itself.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability in a Jenkins job configuration page, accessible due to the stack's Traefik configuration, to inject malicious JavaScript that steals user credentials. Or, an attacker uses an unsecured API endpoint, exposed by the stack's Jenkins deployment, to trigger a build with malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Jenkins server managed by the stack, access to sensitive build artifacts and credentials used within the stack's CI/CD pipeline, manipulation of the CI/CD pipeline orchestrated by the stack.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Document the importance of regularly updating Jenkins and its plugins** within the context of the deployed stack.
        * **Provide guidance or configuration examples for implementing security measures** like CSP and CSRF protection within the Jenkins instance deployed by the stack.
        * **Recommend securing the Jenkins API** using API tokens and access control mechanisms as part of the stack's configuration.

* **Exposed Nexus Repository Manager Web Interface Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Nexus, as an artifact repository, can have vulnerabilities that allow for unauthorized access or manipulation of stored artifacts.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The stack *explicitly configures Traefik to expose the Nexus web interface*.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Nexus upload functionality, made accessible by the stack's Traefik configuration, to inject malicious artifacts into the repository used by the stack's CI/CD process.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of malicious dependencies into the build process managed by the stack, potential compromise of applications deployed using artifacts from the stack's Nexus instance, exposure of sensitive build artifacts stored within the stack's repository.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Document the necessity of regularly updating Nexus** within the context of the deployed stack.
        * **Recommend implementing strong access controls** for repositories and artifacts within the Nexus instance managed by the stack.
        * **Suggest enabling content scanning and vulnerability analysis** for uploaded artifacts in the stack's Nexus deployment.

* **Misconfigured Traefik Routing and Security:**
    * **Description:** Traefik acts as the entry point, and misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized access or exposure of internal services.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` *defines the initial Traefik configuration* that routes traffic to the different services. Incorrectly configured routing rules or lack of HTTPS enforcement *within the stack's configuration* can create vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s Traefik configuration allows access to the Jenkins dashboard without proper authentication, or HTTPS is not enforced by default, exposing login credentials in transit when using the stack.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal services managed by the stack, interception of sensitive data transmitted to or from services within the stack, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks targeting the stack's components.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Carefully review and configure Traefik routing rules within the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s configuration** to ensure only necessary services are exposed.
        * **Enforce HTTPS for all exposed services by default** within the stack's Traefik configuration.
        * **Provide clear documentation and examples for configuring authentication and authorization mechanisms** within Traefik when using the stack.
        * **Emphasize the importance of regularly updating Traefik** as part of maintaining the stack.
