# Threat Model Analysis for kezong/fat-aar-android

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution during Fat AAR Creation](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_during_fat_aar_creation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, potentially with access to the build environment or dependency management system, manages to replace a legitimate dependency with a malicious one *during the process of generating the fat AAR using the `fat-aar-android` library*. This malicious dependency is then bundled into the application, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. The vulnerability lies in the `fat-aar-android`'s aggregation process if not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:**  Code injection, remote code execution, data exfiltration, backdoors within the application, compromise of user devices.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The `fat-aar-android` library's bundling mechanism itself, specifically the steps where individual AARs are collected and packaged into the final fat AAR.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and authentication for the build environment and dependency management systems.
        *   Utilize checksum verification or similar mechanisms to ensure the integrity of downloaded dependencies *before they are processed by `fat-aar-android`*.
        *   Employ a secure supply chain approach for dependencies, potentially using private repositories with strict access controls.
        *   Regularly audit the dependencies included in the fat AAR and compare them against expected versions and sources *after the fat AAR is generated*.

## Threat: [Compromised Fat AAR Generation Environment](./threats/compromised_fat_aar_generation_environment.md)

*   **Description:** If the environment used to generate the fat AAR *using the `fat-aar-android` library* (e.g., developer's machine, build server) is compromised, an attacker could manipulate the bundling process within `fat-aar-android` to inject malicious code or replace legitimate dependencies within the generated fat AAR. The vulnerability resides in the trust placed in the execution environment of `fat-aar-android`.
    *   **Impact:**  Introduction of malware into the application, data breaches, remote code execution on user devices.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The execution environment of the `fat-aar-android` library and the build process that invokes it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the build environment with strong access controls, up-to-date security patches, and malware protection.
        *   Implement regular security audits of the build environment.
        *   Use dedicated and isolated build servers for generating release builds.
        *   Verify the integrity of the generated fat AAR using checksums or digital signatures *after it's produced by `fat-aar-android`*.
