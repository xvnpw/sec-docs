## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Bundled Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_bundled_dependencies.md)

This attack vector focuses on leveraging known security flaws within the third-party libraries bundled into the application via `fat-aar-android`. Because `fat-aar-android` combines all dependencies, vulnerabilities in any of these dependencies become attack vectors for the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Identify Vulnerable Dependency Version](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_identify_vulnerable_dependency_version.md)

Attackers first need to determine the exact versions of the dependencies included in the fat AAR. This is typically done by analyzing the `AndroidManifest.xml` files within the AAR or by inspecting the included JAR/AAR files. Once the versions are known, attackers can cross-reference them with public vulnerability databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify known weaknesses (CVEs).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Trigger Vulnerability in Bundled Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_trigger_vulnerability_in_bundled_dependency.md)

Once a vulnerable dependency and a specific vulnerability are identified, the attacker attempts to exploit that vulnerability. This can involve:
    *   **Crafting Malicious Input for Exposed API of Vulnerable Dependency:**  Sending specially crafted data to an API exposed by the vulnerable dependency to trigger the flaw. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or data manipulation.
    *   **Exploiting Side Effects of Vulnerable Dependency's Behavior:**  Manipulating the application's state or environment in a way that triggers the vulnerability in the bundled dependency indirectly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Replace legitimate class with malicious one](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_replace_legitimate_class_with_malicious_one.md)

In scenarios where dependency conflicts exist or can be engineered, an attacker might attempt to replace a legitimate class from a bundled dependency with a malicious class of the same name. This can be achieved by carefully crafting the malicious library and ensuring it's loaded before the legitimate one by the Android runtime's classloader. When the application attempts to use the original class, the malicious replacement is executed instead.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Add malicious DEX code](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_add_malicious_dex_code.md)

Attackers can directly modify the fat AAR file by adding their own malicious Dalvik Executable (DEX) code. This allows them to inject arbitrary functionality into the application. The injected code can then be triggered through various means, such as exploiting existing entry points or through dynamically loaded components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Replace legitimate libraries with backdoored versions](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_replace_legitimate_libraries_with_backdoored_versions.md)

Instead of adding new code, attackers can replace existing legitimate libraries within the fat AAR with modified, backdoored versions. These backdoored libraries maintain the original functionality but also include malicious code that performs actions like data exfiltration or remote control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Compromise the Build Environment](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_compromise_the_build_environment.md)

If the build environment used to create the fat AAR is compromised, attackers can manipulate the build process to inject malicious code or dependencies directly into the output AAR file. This can happen by:
    *   **Injecting malicious scripts into the build pipeline:**  Modifying build scripts (e.g., Gradle scripts) to include steps that introduce malicious elements.
    *   **Compromising developer machines:**  Gaining access to the machines of developers involved in the build process and injecting malicious code or modifying the build configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes: Leverage Insecure Merging or Packaging Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_leverage_insecure_merging_or_packaging_logic.md)

This attack vector targets potential weaknesses in the `fat-aar-android` library itself. If the library has flaws in how it merges or packages dependencies, attackers might be able to exploit these flaws to introduce vulnerabilities. For example, incorrect handling of resource merging could lead to resource hijacking, or flawed class merging could introduce conflicts that can be exploited.
