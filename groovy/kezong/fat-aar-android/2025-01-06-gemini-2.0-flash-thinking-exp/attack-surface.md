# Attack Surface Analysis for kezong/fat-aar-android

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Poisoning through Bundled AARs](./attack_surfaces/dependency_poisoning_through_bundled_aars.md)

**Description:** Malicious or vulnerable AAR dependencies are included within the fat AAR.

**How fat-aar-android Contributes:** `fat-aar-android`'s core functionality is to bundle multiple AARs into one. This process can inadvertently include compromised AARs if the source AARs are not thoroughly vetted. It simplifies the inclusion of external code without explicit declaration in the main project's dependencies.

**Example:** A developer includes a seemingly useful library as a bundled AAR using `fat-aar-android`. Unbeknownst to them, this bundled AAR contains a known remote code execution vulnerability. The application using the fat AAR becomes vulnerable to this exploit.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, data theft, unauthorized access, denial of service depending on the vulnerability within the poisoned dependency.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet all AAR dependencies before bundling them with `fat-aar-android`.
*   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis tools on the source AARs before bundling.
*   Maintain an inventory of all bundled AARs and their versions.
*   Regularly update bundled AARs to their latest secure versions.
*   Consider using a private repository for trusted AAR dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Build Script Manipulation for Malicious Inclusion](./attack_surfaces/build_script_manipulation_for_malicious_inclusion.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain control over the project's `build.gradle` file and modify the `fatAar` configuration to include malicious AARs.

**How fat-aar-android Contributes:** `fat-aar-android` relies on specific configurations within the `build.gradle` file to define which AARs to bundle. If this file is compromised, the library's functionality can be abused to inject malicious code.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's machine or the project's repository and modifies the `build.gradle` file to include a malicious AAR in the `fatAar` configuration. During the build process, this malicious AAR is bundled into the application.

**Impact:** Inclusion of arbitrary code, backdoors, data exfiltration, compromised application functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure access to the project's codebase and build environment.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to `build.gradle` files.
*   Use version control systems and track changes to build scripts.
*   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for accessing build systems.
*   Regularly scan build environments for malware and unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Introduction of Native Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/introduction_of_native_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Bundled AARs contain vulnerable native libraries (`.so` files).

**How fat-aar-android Contributes:** `fat-aar-android` bundles all components of the included AARs, including native libraries. This means vulnerabilities within the native libraries of bundled dependencies become part of the application's attack surface.

**Example:** A bundled AAR includes an outdated version of a cryptographic library with a known buffer overflow vulnerability in its native code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability in the application using the fat AAR.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Scan native libraries within bundled AARs for known vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure all bundled AARs use up-to-date and secure versions of their native libraries.
*   If possible, avoid bundling AARs with unnecessary native libraries.
*   Implement runtime checks and protections against common native library vulnerabilities.
