* **Attack Surface: Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks (Bundled Dependencies)**
    * **Description:** An attacker tricks the build system or runtime environment into using a malicious dependency instead of the intended legitimate one.
    * **How `fat-aar-android` Contributes:** By bundling multiple AARs into a single artifact, `fat-aar-android` can obscure the individual dependencies and their origins. This makes it harder to verify the integrity of each component and increases the risk of unknowingly including a compromised library. The lack of explicit dependency declarations in the final fat AAR exacerbates this.
    * **Example:** An attacker creates a malicious AAR with the same name as a legitimate library bundled by `fat-aar-android`. If the build process or a vulnerability at runtime doesn't properly verify the source or integrity, the malicious AAR could be used.
    * **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code, data exfiltration, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the capabilities of the substituted dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Maintain a clear inventory of bundled dependencies and their versions.
        * Verify the integrity of original dependencies before bundling.
        * Implement runtime integrity checks (if feasible).
        * Regularly update bundled dependencies.

* **Attack Surface: Supply Chain Attacks on Bundled Dependencies (Amplified Impact)**
    * **Description:** One of the original AAR dependencies bundled by `fat-aar-android` is compromised at its source (e.g., a malicious commit to the upstream repository).
    * **How `fat-aar-android` Contributes:**  `fat-aar-android` directly incorporates these dependencies into the final application. If a bundled dependency is compromised, the vulnerability is directly included in the application, affecting all users. The bundling amplifies the impact as the vulnerability is now part of a larger, distributed application.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the repository of a library that is later bundled using `fat-aar-android`. They introduce a backdoor into the library. Applications using the resulting fat AAR will unknowingly include this backdoor.
    * **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using the vulnerable bundled dependency, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and other severe consequences.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully vet and select dependencies.
        * Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        * Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
        * Consider using dependency scanning tools that can analyze the contents of fat AARs.

* **Attack Surface: Build Process Manipulation (Fat AAR Generation)**
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the environment or process used to generate the fat AAR, injecting malicious code or altering the bundled dependencies.
    * **How `fat-aar-android` Contributes:** `fat-aar-android` introduces a specific build step for merging AARs. This step becomes a potential target. If the build environment is compromised, the `fat-aar-android` process could be manipulated to create a malicious fat AAR.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the build server where `fat-aar-android` is used. They modify the `fat-aar-android` script or the dependencies it uses to inject malicious code into the resulting fat AAR.
    * **Impact:** Distribution of compromised application builds containing malware or backdoors to end-users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the build environment.
        * Use trusted and verified versions of `fat-aar-android`.
        * Implement build process integrity checks.
        * Isolate the build process.
