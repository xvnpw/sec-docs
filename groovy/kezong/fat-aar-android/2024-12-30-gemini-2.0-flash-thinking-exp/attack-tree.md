Threat Model: Compromising Application Using fat-aar-android - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application that uses the `fat-aar-android` library by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities introduced by the library itself.

High-Risk Sub-Tree:

Compromise Application via Fat-AAR [CRITICAL NODE]
- OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Bundled Dependencies [HIGH RISK PATH]
  - AND: Introduce Vulnerable Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Introduce Dependency with Known Vulnerabilities
    - Introduce Malicious Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH]
      - Supply Chain Attack on Dependency Repository
      - Compromise Developer Machine and Inject Malicious Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
  - AND: Vulnerability Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH]
    - Exploit Known Vulnerability in Bundled Library
- OR: Exploit Resource Conflicts/Overriding [HIGH RISK PATH]
  - AND: Introduce Malicious Resources [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Include Resource with Same Name as Application Resource
- OR: Exploit Build Process Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]
  - AND: Modify Fat-AAR Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Compromise Build Environment [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
  - AND: Tamper with Generated AAR [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Post-Processing of AAR

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Bundled Dependencies
- Attack Vector: Introduce Vulnerable Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]
  - Description: An attacker introduces a dependency with known security vulnerabilities into the project. `fat-aar-android` bundles this vulnerable dependency into the final AAR.
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: Significant
  - Effort: Minimal
  - Skill Level: Beginner
  - Detection Difficulty: Easy (with proper tooling)
- Attack Vector: Introduce Malicious Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH]
  - Description: An attacker intentionally introduces a malicious dependency designed to harm the application.
  - Sub-Vector: Supply Chain Attack on Dependency Repository
    - Description: The attacker uploads a malicious package to a public or private repository with a name similar to a legitimate dependency, hoping developers will mistakenly include it.
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Impact: Critical
    - Effort: Moderate
    - Skill Level: Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult (without proactive monitoring)
  - Sub-Vector: Compromise Developer Machine and Inject Malicious Dependency [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: The attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine and directly modifies the project's build configuration to include a malicious dependency.
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Impact: Critical
    - Effort: High
    - Skill Level: Advanced
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult (relies on endpoint security)
- Attack Vector: Vulnerability Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH]
  - Description: Once a vulnerable dependency is bundled, the attacker exploits the known vulnerabilities within that dependency to compromise the application.
  - Sub-Vector: Exploit Known Vulnerability in Bundled Library
    - Description: The attacker leverages publicly available exploits targeting the known vulnerabilities in the bundled dependency.
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Significant
    - Effort: Minimal (if exploit exists) to Moderate (if adaptation needed)
    - Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Moderate (depends on exploit and monitoring)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Resource Conflicts/Overriding
- Attack Vector: Introduce Malicious Resources [CRITICAL NODE]
  - Description: The attacker introduces a malicious resource into a bundled dependency that has the same name as a critical resource in the main application, causing the malicious resource to overwrite the legitimate one.
  - Sub-Vector: Include Resource with Same Name as Application Resource
    - Description: A malicious library contains a resource with the same name as a critical resource in the main application. This malicious resource is crafted to alter the application's behavior or data.
    - Likelihood: Medium
    - Impact: Moderate to Significant
    - Effort: Low to Moderate
    - Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Moderate (requires careful resource inspection)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Build Process Manipulation
- Attack Vector: Modify Fat-AAR Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]
  - Description: The attacker manipulates the configuration of the `fat-aar-android` plugin to include unintended or malicious dependencies or resources.
  - Sub-Vector: Compromise Build Environment [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
    - Description: The attacker gains unauthorized access to the project's build environment (e.g., developer machine, CI/CD server) and modifies the `build.gradle` file.
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Impact: Critical
    - Effort: High
    - Skill Level: Advanced
    - Detection Difficulty: Difficult (relies on build environment security)
- Attack Vector: Tamper with Generated AAR [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]
  - Description: The attacker modifies the generated AAR file after it's created but before it's distributed, injecting malicious code or resources.
  - Sub-Vector: Post-Processing of AAR
    - Description: The attacker intercepts and modifies the generated AAR archive before it reaches its intended destination.
    - Likelihood: Low
    - Impact: Critical
    - Effort: Moderate
    - Skill Level: Intermediate
    - Detection Difficulty: Moderate (requires AAR integrity checks)

Critical Nodes:
- Compromise Application via Fat-AAR: The ultimate goal of the attacker.
- Introduce Vulnerable Dependency: A key step in exploiting dependency vulnerabilities.
- Compromise Developer Machine: Provides a significant foothold for various attacks.
- Introduce Malicious Resources: Allows for direct manipulation of application behavior.
- Modify Fat-AAR Configuration: Enables the injection of malicious components.
- Tamper with Generated AAR: Allows for last-minute injection of malicious content.
