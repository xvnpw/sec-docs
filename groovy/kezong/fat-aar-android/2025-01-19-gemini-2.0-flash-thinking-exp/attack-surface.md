# Attack Surface Analysis for kezong/fat-aar-android

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./attack_surfaces/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker could introduce a malicious dependency with the same name as a legitimate dependency used by one of the AARs included in the fat AAR. The build process might incorrectly pick the malicious dependency.

**How `fat-aar-android` Contributes:** By merging multiple AARs, it increases the likelihood of dependency name collisions and potential for the build system to resolve to an unintended (malicious) dependency during the fat AAR creation.

**Example:** A legitimate AAR uses `com.example:utils:1.0.0`. An attacker creates a malicious AAR with `com.example:utils:1.0.0` containing malicious code. If the build process prioritizes the malicious AAR's dependencies during the fat AAR creation, the application might include the malicious code.

**Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities depending on the attacker's payload within the substituted dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Dependency Management:** Explicitly manage and verify the integrity of all dependencies used by the included AARs. Use tools like dependency lock files or BOMs (Bill of Materials) to ensure consistent dependency resolution.
* **Repository Security:** Use trusted and secure Maven repositories. Implement repository mirroring or proxying to control the source of dependencies.
* **Dependency Scanning:** Employ dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the dependencies of the included AARs *before* creating the fat AAR.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerability Aggregation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerability_aggregation.md)

**Description:** The resulting fat AAR inherits all the vulnerabilities present in each of the individual AARs it contains.

**How `fat-aar-android` Contributes:** It directly combines the code and dependencies of multiple AARs, effectively aggregating their security vulnerabilities into a single deliverable.

**Example:** One of the included AARs has a known SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability will now be present in the fat AAR and potentially exploitable in the application.

**Impact:** Exposure to a wider range of potential exploits, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Ensure all included AARs and their dependencies are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches *before* creating the fat AAR.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform thorough vulnerability scanning on the individual AARs *before* inclusion to identify and address potential issues.
* **Choose Reputable Libraries:** Carefully select and vet the AARs to be included, prioritizing those from trusted sources with good security practices.

## Attack Surface: [Build Process Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/build_process_manipulation.md)

**Description:** The process of creating the fat AAR involves build scripts and potentially external dependencies. A compromised build environment could be used to inject malicious code into the fat AAR during its creation.

**How `fat-aar-android` Contributes:** It introduces a specific step in the build process that could be targeted for manipulation to inject malicious code while merging the AARs.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the build server and modifies the `fat-aar-android` configuration or the scripts used to create the fat AAR, injecting malicious code into the final artifact.

**Impact:** Distribution of a compromised application containing malicious code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Build Environment:** Implement robust security measures for the build environment, including access controls, regular security audits, and malware scanning.
* **Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `fat-aar-android` library and the build scripts used.
* **Supply Chain Security for Build Tools:** Ensure the security of the tools and dependencies used in the build process.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Risks Amplification](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_risks_amplification.md)

**Description:** By relying on multiple external AARs, the application's supply chain risk is amplified. If any of the included AARs are compromised *before* being included in the fat AAR, the resulting fat AAR will also be compromised.

**How `fat-aar-android` Contributes:** It directly integrates dependencies from multiple sources into a single artifact, increasing the number of potential points of compromise in the supply chain.

**Example:** A developer account for one of the included AARs is compromised, and a malicious version of the AAR is uploaded. If this compromised AAR is included in the fat AAR, the application will be vulnerable.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code, backdoors, or other vulnerabilities into the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Vet AAR Sources:** Carefully evaluate the reputation and security practices of the sources of the AARs being included.
* **Dependency Scanning and Monitoring:** Continuously scan and monitor the dependencies of the included AARs for known vulnerabilities *before* creating the fat AAR.
* **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain an SBOM for the application, including the individual AARs and their dependencies, to facilitate vulnerability tracking and incident response.
