## Attack Tree Path: [(**CRITICAL NODE**) Inject Malicious Code/Resources during Merge (HIGH RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_coderesources_during_merge__high_risk_path_start_.md)

*   This critical node represents the attacker's goal of inserting harmful code or resources into the application during the AAR merging process. Success here opens up numerous avenues for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Conflicting Files with Malicious Content](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_conflicting_files_with_malicious_content.md)

*   The attacker crafts a malicious AAR file containing files (classes, resources) with the same names as legitimate files in other AARs being merged.
*   If `fat-aar-android` lacks robust conflict resolution, the malicious files can overwrite the legitimate ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious AAR with Higher Priority](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_aar_with_higher_priority.md)

*   The attacker attempts to ensure their malicious AAR is prioritized during the merge process, increasing the likelihood of their malicious files being used.

## Attack Tree Path: [(**CRITICAL NODE**) Compromise Internal/External Repository (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_internalexternal_repository__high_risk_path_.md)

*   This critical node represents a significant breach where the attacker gains control over the repositories where AAR files are stored.
*   This allows for the widespread injection of malicious AARs, potentially affecting multiple applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [(**CRITICAL NODE**) Introduce Vulnerable Dependencies (HIGH RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__introduce_vulnerable_dependencies__high_risk_path_start_.md)

*   This critical node focuses on the attacker's ability to introduce AAR files that contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   Even if the merging process itself is secure, including vulnerable libraries can expose the application to significant risks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Include AAR with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/include_aar_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   The attacker includes an AAR file that utilizes outdated or compromised libraries with publicly known security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Transitive Dependencies in Merged AARs (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_transitive_dependencies_in_merged_aars__high_risk_path_.md)

*   A malicious AAR might include a vulnerable library as a transitive dependency, meaning it's a dependency of a dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Outdated or Compromised Library Versions (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_outdated_or_compromised_library_versions__high_risk_path_.md)

*   The attacker includes an AAR that uses older versions of libraries known to have security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [(**CRITICAL NODE**) Leverage Injected Malicious Code/Resources (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__leverage_injected_malicious_coderesources__high_risk_path_.md)

*   This critical node represents the stage where the attacker actively uses the malicious code or resources they successfully injected earlier.

## Attack Tree Path: [(**HIGH RISK**) Abuse Injected Permissions (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__abuse_injected_permissions__high_risk_path_.md)

*   If the attacker successfully injected malicious permissions into the application's manifest, they can now exploit these permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data (Contacts, Location, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data__contacts__location__etc__.md)

*   Using the injected permissions, the attacker can access sensitive user data that the application shouldn't have access to.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Privileged Actions (SMS, Calls, etc.)](./attack_tree_paths/perform_privileged_actions__sms__calls__etc__.md)

*   The attacker can perform actions that require special permissions, such as sending SMS messages or making phone calls, without the user's consent or knowledge.

## Attack Tree Path: [(**CRITICAL NODE**) Exploit Introduced Vulnerable Dependencies (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_introduced_vulnerable_dependencies__high_risk_path_.md)

*   This critical node signifies the attacker's ability to leverage the known vulnerabilities present in the dependencies introduced through the merged AARs.
