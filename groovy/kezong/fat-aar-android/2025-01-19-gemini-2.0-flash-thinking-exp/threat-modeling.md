# Threat Model Analysis for kezong/fat-aar-android

## Threat: [Inclusion of Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies](./threats/inclusion_of_vulnerable_transitive_dependencies.md)

**Description:** By bundling all dependencies, including transitive ones, into a single AAR, `fat-aar-android` directly increases the likelihood of including libraries with known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities present in the bundled transitive dependencies to compromise the application's security.

**Impact:** Compromise of the application's security, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user data, device control, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** The `fat-aar-android` build task and the final bundled AAR file it generates, specifically the included transitive dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit the dependencies included in the fat AAR after it's built.
* Utilize dependency scanning tools that can analyze the output of `fat-aar-android` to identify known vulnerabilities in bundled dependencies.
* Investigate and update vulnerable dependencies by rebuilding the fat AAR.
* Consider using tools that can analyze the dependency tree *before* using `fat-aar-android` to identify potential risks.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution Attacks](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_attacks.md)

**Description:** During the dependency resolution and bundling process performed by `fat-aar-android`, there's a risk that a malicious dependency with the same name as a legitimate one could be included in the fat AAR if the build environment or dependency sources are compromised or not properly secured. `fat-aar-android` would then bundle this malicious library into the final AAR.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application through the `fat-aar-android` bundling process, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other harmful actions.

**Affected Component:** The dependency resolution and bundling logic within the `fat-aar-android` library itself.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust dependency verification mechanisms *before* `fat-aar-android` is used, ensuring the integrity of the dependencies being bundled.
* Utilize private or curated dependency repositories to minimize the risk of pulling in malicious dependencies.
* Employ software composition analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependency sources and detect anomalies *before* and *after* using `fat-aar-android`.
* Strictly control access to the dependency management configuration used by the build process involving `fat-aar-android`.
