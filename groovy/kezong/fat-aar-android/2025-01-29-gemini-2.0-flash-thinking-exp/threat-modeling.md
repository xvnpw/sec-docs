# Threat Model Analysis for kezong/fat-aar-android

## Threat: [Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies in Fat AAR](./threats/vulnerable_transitive_dependencies_in_fat_aar.md)

- **Threat:** Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies in Fat AAR
- **Description:** `fat-aar-android` bundles all transitive dependencies into a single AAR. If any of these bundled transitive dependencies contain known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities in applications using the fat AAR. Attackers might target vulnerable code paths within these dependencies, potentially leading to data breaches, application crashes, or remote code execution.
- **Impact:** Data breach, application crash, remote code execution, compromise of user devices.
- **Affected Component:** Bundled Transitive Dependencies (within the Fat AAR generated by `fat-aar-android`)
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly audit and update dependencies of the library project *before* creating the fat AAR.
    - Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies *before* using `fat-aar-android`.
    - Implement a process for monitoring and patching vulnerabilities in dependencies even after the fat AAR is built and integrated into applications.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Substitution during Fat-AAR Creation](./threats/dependency_confusionsubstitution_during_fat-aar_creation.md)

- **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution during Fat-AAR Creation
- **Description:** During the fat AAR creation process, if the build environment or dependency resolution is compromised, an attacker could substitute malicious dependencies for legitimate ones. `fat-aar-android` relies on the Gradle dependency resolution process, and vulnerabilities there could be exploited to inject malicious code into the fat AAR. This could lead to backdoors or malware being included in applications using the compromised fat AAR.
- **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code in the application, backdoors, data theft, remote control of application/device.
- **Affected Component:** Dependency Resolution Process (used by `fat-aar-android` during AAR creation)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure the build environment used for fat AAR creation and restrict access.
    - Implement dependency verification mechanisms (like Gradle's dependency verification) to ensure dependency integrity during the build.
    - Regularly audit dependency resolution configurations and build scripts used with `fat-aar-android`.
    - Use private or trusted dependency repositories to reduce the risk of supply chain attacks.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Updates of `fat-aar-android`](./threats/malicious_plugin_updates_of__fat-aar-android_.md)

- **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Updates of `fat-aar-android`
- **Description:** If the repository hosting the `fat-aar-android` plugin is compromised, or if an attacker gains control of the plugin's publishing process, they could distribute malicious updates to the `fat-aar-android` plugin itself. Developers unknowingly using a compromised version of the plugin would then have their build process infected, potentially leading to malicious code being injected into all fat AARs and applications built using that compromised plugin version.
- **Impact:** Widespread compromise of build processes, injection of malicious code into applications using `fat-aar-android`, large-scale malware distribution.
- **Affected Component:** `fat-aar-android` Gradle Plugin, Plugin Distribution Mechanism
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use plugin management mechanisms with version pinning and checksum verification to ensure plugin integrity.
    - Monitor for updates and changes to the `fat-aar-android` plugin from official and trusted sources only.
    - Consider using internally managed plugin repositories for greater control and security over Gradle plugins.
    - Regularly review plugin configurations and dependencies within the build environment.

## Threat: [Exploitable Vulnerabilities in `fat-aar-android` Plugin Code](./threats/exploitable_vulnerabilities_in__fat-aar-android__plugin_code.md)

- **Threat:** Exploitable Vulnerabilities in `fat-aar-android` Plugin Code
- **Description:** The `fat-aar-android` plugin itself is software and might contain vulnerabilities in its code (Gradle scripts, Java/Kotlin code). If these vulnerabilities exist, an attacker who can influence the build process or plugin execution could exploit them. This could lead to arbitrary code execution during the build process, manipulation of the generated fat AAR, or denial of service of the build system.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during build, compromised fat AAR generation, denial of service of build process, potential supply chain compromise.
- **Affected Component:** `fat-aar-android` Plugin Code
- **Risk Severity:** High (potential for arbitrary code execution and supply chain impact)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Keep the `fat-aar-android` plugin updated to the latest version, as updates may include security patches for plugin vulnerabilities.
    - Conduct security reviews or code audits of the `fat-aar-android` plugin's code, especially if used in security-sensitive projects.
    - Monitor for reported vulnerabilities related to Gradle plugins and specifically `fat-aar-android`.
    - Isolate the build environment to limit the potential impact of any plugin exploits.
