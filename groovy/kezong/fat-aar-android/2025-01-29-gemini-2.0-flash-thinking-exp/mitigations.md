## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Mitigation Strategy: Justify AAR Inclusion Before Fat AAR Creation](./mitigation_strategies/1__mitigation_strategy_justify_aar_inclusion_before_fat_aar_creation.md)

### 1. Mitigation Strategy: Justify AAR Inclusion Before Fat AAR Creation

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Necessity Assessment:** Before deciding to merge any AAR using `fat-aar-android`, rigorously assess if its inclusion is truly necessary for the application's core functionality.
    2.  **Alternative Exploration:** Explore alternative solutions to using the AAR. Could the required functionality be reimplemented in the main application code, or could a smaller, more focused library be used instead?
    3.  **Documentation of Justification:** If AAR inclusion is deemed necessary, document the specific reasons for its inclusion, outlining the functionalities it provides and why alternatives are not feasible. This documentation should be reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (High Severity):** Including unnecessary AARs through `fat-aar-android` expands the codebase and potential attack vectors.
    *   **Code Complexity Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**  Unnecessary code from merged AARs increases complexity, making vulnerability detection harder.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:** **High Reduction**.  Preventing unnecessary AAR inclusion directly minimizes the attack surface introduced by `fat-aar-android`.
    *   **Code Complexity Vulnerabilities:** **Medium Reduction**. Reducing unnecessary code simplifies the codebase and aids in vulnerability management.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **AAR Necessity Assessment:** Partially implemented. Developers generally consider the need for AARs, but it's not a formal, documented process specifically tied to `fat-aar-android` usage.
    *   **Alternative Exploration:** Partially implemented. Alternatives are sometimes considered, but not systematically documented or enforced before using `fat-aar-android`.
    *   **Documentation of Justification:** Not implemented.  Justification for AAR inclusion before fat AAR creation is not formally documented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal AAR Necessity Review Process for Fat AAR:**  Establish a documented process specifically for justifying each AAR's inclusion when using `fat-aar-android`.
    *   **Mandatory Alternative Exploration Step:**  Make exploring alternatives a mandatory step in the AAR inclusion justification process before using `fat-aar-android`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Mitigation Strategy: Analyze Feature Usage of AARs Before Fat AAR Creation](./mitigation_strategies/2__mitigation_strategy_analyze_feature_usage_of_aars_before_fat_aar_creation.md)

### 2. Mitigation Strategy: Analyze Feature Usage of AARs Before Fat AAR Creation

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Feature Identification:** For each AAR considered for merging with `fat-aar-android`, thoroughly identify the specific features and functionalities that are actually used by the application.
    2.  **Redundancy Detection:** Determine if any features provided by the AAR are redundant or overlap with functionalities already present in other AARs being merged or in the main application code.
    3.  **Usage Documentation:** Document the specific features of each AAR that are being utilized. This documentation helps in understanding the dependencies and potential impact of removing or replacing an AAR in the future.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Including unused features from AARs via `fat-aar-android` still contributes to a larger attack surface, although less directly than including entire unnecessary AARs.
    *   **Code Complexity Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** Unused code, even within necessary AARs, can slightly increase complexity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface:** **Medium Reduction**.  Identifying and potentially excluding unused features (though `fat-aar-android` doesn't directly support this exclusion, the analysis informs AAR necessity) helps limit the attack surface.
    *   **Code Complexity Vulnerabilities:** **Low Reduction**.  Understanding feature usage aids in managing complexity and potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Feature Identification:** Partially implemented. Developers have a general understanding of feature usage, but no systematic analysis is performed before using `fat-aar-android`.
