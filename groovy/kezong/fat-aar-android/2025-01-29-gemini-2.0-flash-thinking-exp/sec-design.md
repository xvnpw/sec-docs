# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `fat-aar-android`, aims to simplify the distribution and integration of Android libraries. By creating "fat" AAR files that bundle dependencies, it addresses the common problem of dependency conflicts and management complexity for Android developers.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Simplify Android library distribution for library developers.
  - Streamline Android library integration for application developers.
  - Reduce dependency conflicts in Android projects.
  - Improve developer experience by providing self-contained library artifacts.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Increased size of AAR artifacts, potentially impacting download times and application size.
  - Dependency conflicts if bundled dependencies clash with dependencies already present in the consuming application.
  - Security vulnerabilities arising from outdated or compromised bundled dependencies.
  - Potential for build process complexity and increased build times.

# SECURITY POSTURE

This section outlines the existing and recommended security posture for the `fat-aar-android` project.

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open source project hosted on GitHub, leveraging community review for code quality and potential security issues. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
  - security control: Use of Gradle and Android SDK, which are widely adopted and have established security practices. (Implemented: Build system and dependencies)
  - security control: Version control using Git, providing history and traceability of code changes. (Implemented: Git repository)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies bundled within the fat AAR.
  - accepted risk: Risk of supply chain attacks targeting dependencies used by the plugin.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying Gradle and Android SDK environments.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in bundled dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a process for regularly updating dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to identify potential code-level security issues in the plugin itself.
  - security control: Consider signing the generated fat AAR artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
  - security control: Implement input validation for Gradle plugin configurations to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the plugin itself, as it is a build-time tool. However, if distribution mechanisms are implemented (e.g., publishing to a repository), authentication for publishing would be required.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the plugin itself. Access control to the plugin's source code and build environment should be managed through standard repository and infrastructure access controls.
  - Input Validation: The plugin should validate all inputs from the Gradle build script (configurations, dependencies) to prevent unexpected behavior, injection attacks, or denial-of-service. Input validation should be implemented within the plugin's Groovy/Kotlin code.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography might be relevant if the plugin or its dependencies handle sensitive data or require secure communication. If cryptography is used, ensure proper implementation and key management practices are followed within the plugin and its dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Process:
  - Distribution and integration of Android libraries. The plugin aims to improve the efficiency and reduce errors in this process.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the Fat-AAR Gradle Plugin: Intellectual property, moderate sensitivity. Unauthorized access or modification could lead to compromised plugin versions.
  - Build artifacts (Plugin JAR): Publicly distributed, but integrity is critical. Compromised plugin JAR could be distributed to developers, posing a supply chain risk.
  - Dependencies of the plugin: Publicly available, but vulnerabilities in dependencies can introduce security risks.
  - Developer credentials and CI/CD secrets: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes, builds, and publishing of malicious plugin versions.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended distribution mechanism for the Fat-AAR Gradle Plugin itself? (e.g., Gradle Plugin Portal, Maven Central)
  - Are there specific performance requirements for the plugin in terms of build time overhead?
  - What is the expected scale of usage for this plugin? (Number of users, projects)
  - Are there any specific legal or compliance requirements related to the dependencies bundled in the fat AARs?
  - What is the process for users to report issues or security vulnerabilities related to the plugin?

- Assumptions:
  - The primary goal is to simplify Android library distribution and usage for developers.
  - Security is a secondary but important consideration.
  - The plugin is intended to be used in standard Android development environments with Gradle.
  - Developers using the plugin are expected to have a basic understanding of Gradle and Android development.
  - The plugin will be maintained and updated to address issues and security vulnerabilities.
