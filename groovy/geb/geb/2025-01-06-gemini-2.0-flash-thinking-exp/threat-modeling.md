# Threat Model Analysis for geb/geb

## Threat: [Unintended Data Modification through Malicious Geb Scripts](./threats/unintended_data_modification_through_malicious_geb_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to modify or inject Geb scripts could craft malicious scripts that perform unintended actions within the application, such as modifying data, deleting records, or altering system configurations. This is a direct consequence of Geb's ability to interact with the application's UI.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, loss of data integrity, business disruption, and potential financial loss.
*   **Geb Component Affected:** Entire Geb framework as it controls browser interactions; specifically `geb.Browser`, `geb.Navigator`, and custom Page Objects that interact with data manipulation elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access control and code review processes for Geb scripts.
    *   Store Geb scripts in secure repositories with version control and audit trails.
    *   Enforce code signing or other mechanisms to verify the integrity of Geb scripts.
    *   Separate environments for development, testing, and production, limiting the scope of potentially malicious scripts.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Geb Vulnerability](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_geb_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A critical vulnerability exists within the Geb library itself that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the Geb scripts. This could be triggered by a specially crafted web page interacted with by Geb or through a flaw in how Geb processes certain inputs. This is a direct vulnerability within Geb.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the system running Geb, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and further attacks on the network.
*   **Geb Component Affected:** Core Geb libraries, potentially related to browser interaction, event handling, or dependency management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Geb library and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor Geb's security advisories and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Isolate the environment where Geb scripts are executed to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement security scanning and vulnerability management processes for Geb and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in Geb Scripts or Configuration](./threats/credential_exposure_in_geb_scripts_or_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently hardcode credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) directly within Geb scripts or configuration files used by Geb. If an attacker gains access to these Geb-specific resources, they can obtain these credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application or related systems, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Geb Component Affected:** Geb scripts (Spock specifications, custom functions), `geb.Configuration` if credentials are stored there.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never hardcode credentials directly in Geb scripts or configuration files.
    *   Use secure credential management solutions (e.g., environment variables, secrets management tools) to store and access credentials.
    *   Implement regular security audits of Geb scripts and configurations to identify potential credential exposure.
    *   Educate developers on secure coding practices regarding credential management.
