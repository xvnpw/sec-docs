## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Geb's Browser Interaction ***HIGH RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_geb's_browser_interaction_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages Geb's ability to interact with the browser to inject malicious code, primarily JavaScript.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Exploiting a lack of input sanitization in Geb's `js()` or `executeScript()` methods. If the data passed to these methods originates from an untrusted source (e.g., user input, external data), an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Stealing session cookies, leading to account takeover.
    *   Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to alter the application's appearance or behavior, potentially redirecting users to phishing sites or performing unauthorized actions.
    *   Executing arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser context, potentially leading to further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The successful injection of malicious JavaScript code into the browser through Geb.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   As described in the "Inject Malicious Code via Geb's Browser Interaction" path, the primary mechanism is exploiting unsanitized input passed to Geb's JavaScript execution methods.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   This is a critical node because successful JavaScript injection can have a wide range of severe consequences, including complete compromise of the user's session and potential for further attacks on the application or user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Browser State for Malicious Purposes ***HIGH RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_browser_state_for_malicious_purposes_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uses Geb's functionalities to manipulate the browser's state, specifically targeting cookies and local storage.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Exploiting Geb's API for manipulating cookies or local storage. If Geb scripts have the ability to set, modify, or delete these browser storage mechanisms, an attacker can abuse this functionality.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Stealing session tokens stored in cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access.
    *   Modifying local storage to alter application settings or data, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access to information stored client-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Cookies or Local Storage **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_cookies_or_local_storage_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The successful manipulation of browser cookies or local storage through Geb.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   As described in the "Manipulate Browser State for Malicious Purposes" path, this involves abusing Geb's API for managing these storage mechanisms.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   This is a critical node because successful cookie or local storage tampering can directly lead to authentication bypass and unauthorized access, representing a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Geb's Integration with Groovy/Application Code ***HIGH RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_geb's_integration_with_groovyapplication_code_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits Geb's integration with the underlying Groovy application code to inject and execute malicious code on the server.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Exploiting insecure handling of Geb configuration files. If Geb configuration files are not properly secured or if they allow for the inclusion of arbitrary code, an attacker can inject malicious Groovy code that will be executed when Geb initializes or runs.
    *   Exploiting a lack of input validation in Geb's scripting features. If Geb allows for the execution of external scripts or code snippets without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious Groovy code.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via Geb Configuration or Scripting **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_geb_configuration_or_scripting_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The successful injection and execution of malicious Groovy code through Geb's configuration or scripting mechanisms.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   As described in the "Exploit Geb's Integration with Groovy/Application Code" path, this involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how Geb handles configuration files or executes scripts.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   This is a critical node due to the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, which is one of the most severe security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Geb Usage Patterns by Developers ***HIGH RISK PATH***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_geb_usage_patterns_by_developers_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits common developer mistakes in how Geb is used, specifically targeting the exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Hardcoding credentials or API keys directly within Geb scripts. If developers embed sensitive credentials directly in the Geb codebase, these credentials can be easily discovered by attackers who gain access to the source code.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Gaining unauthorized access to internal systems, databases, or third-party services using the exposed credentials. This can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information in Geb Scripts or Configuration **CRITICAL NODE**](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information_in_geb_scripts_or_configuration_critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The unintentional exposure of sensitive information, such as credentials or API keys, within Geb scripts or configuration files.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   As described in the "Exploit Insecure Geb Usage Patterns by Developers" path, this primarily involves developers directly embedding sensitive information in the codebase.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   This is a critical node because the exposure of credentials provides a direct pathway for attackers to compromise other systems and services, often with high privileges.
