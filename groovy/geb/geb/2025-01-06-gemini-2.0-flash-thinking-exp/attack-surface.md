# Attack Surface Analysis for geb/geb

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Test Automation Credentials](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_test_automation_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Credentials used by Geb scripts to interact with the application under test (e.g., usernames, passwords, API keys) are exposed, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **How Geb Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Geb scripts require authentication to interact with the application. Credentials might be hardcoded within the scripts, stored in configuration files alongside the scripts, or passed as command-line arguments during test execution.
    *   **Example:** A Geb script contains the line `browser.login("testuser", "P@$$wOrd!")`. This password is now directly visible in the script.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, potential data breaches, manipulation of application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in Geb scripts.
        *   Utilize secure credential management solutions (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secrets managers) and retrieve them dynamically within Geb scripts.
        *   Restrict access to test scripts and configuration files through appropriate access controls.
        *   Implement secrets scanning in the codebase to detect accidental credential commits.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Geb's Browser Control Capabilities in Non-Testing Contexts](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_geb's_browser_control_capabilities_in_non-testing_contexts.md)

*   **Description:** If Geb is used for automation tasks beyond testing (which is generally discouraged), vulnerabilities in the Geb scripts could be exploited to perform unintended and potentially harmful actions within the application.
    *   **How Geb Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Geb allows programmatic control of the browser, including navigation, form submission, and interaction with DOM elements. Maliciously crafted or compromised Geb scripts could leverage these capabilities for unauthorized actions.
    *   **Example:** A Geb script intended for automated data entry is modified to submit malicious data to the application, bypassing normal validation checks.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized actions, denial of service, potential compromise of the application's integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if used in non-testing contexts)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly limit the use of Geb to its intended purpose of testing.
        *   Implement rigorous code review and security audits for any Geb scripts used outside of standard testing procedures.
        *   Enforce strong input validation and authorization checks within the application to mitigate actions triggered by potentially malicious Geb scripts.
