Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using Geb - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application that uses the Geb browser automation framework by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Geb itself or its interaction with the application.

Sub-Tree:
* Compromise Application via Geb Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]
    * AND Exploit Geb Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
        * OR Insecure Defaults/Configuration
            * Exploit Default Credentials (if any)
                * Gain Initial Access with Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * OR Code Injection via Geb [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Inject Malicious Groovy Code
                * Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server/Client [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * Inject Malicious JavaScript via Geb's Browser Interaction
                * Perform XSS or other Client-Side Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * OR Vulnerabilities in Geb's Dependencies (exploited via Geb) [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Exploit Selenium Vulnerabilities via Geb's API
                * Trigger Selenium bugs leading to browser compromise [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * Exploit Groovy Vulnerabilities via Geb's Execution Environment
                * Execute arbitrary code through Groovy vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    * AND Abuse Geb's Intended Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]
        * OR Data Exfiltration via Geb
            * Use Geb to Scrape Sensitive Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * OR Action Manipulation via Geb
            * Use Geb to Perform Unauthorized Actions [HIGH-RISK PATH]

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

Critical Nodes:

* Compromise Application via Geb Exploitation:
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through Geb.

* Exploit Geb Vulnerabilities:
    * This node represents a broad category of attacks that target weaknesses within the Geb library itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can provide attackers with significant control over the application or the environment where Geb is running.

* Code Injection via Geb:
    * This critical node highlights the danger of allowing untrusted input to influence Geb's code execution. Successful code injection can lead to arbitrary code execution, the most severe type of vulnerability.

* Vulnerabilities in Geb's Dependencies (exploited via Geb):
    * This node emphasizes the importance of the security of Geb's dependencies. Attackers can leverage Geb as a pathway to exploit vulnerabilities in libraries like Selenium and Groovy.

* Abuse Geb's Intended Functionality:
    * This critical node focuses on the risks associated with the legitimate features of Geb being used for malicious purposes. Because these features are intended for use, exploiting them can be easier and harder to detect.

High-Risk Paths:

* Gain Initial Access with Default Credentials:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers attempt to log in or access systems using default usernames and passwords that may be present in Geb's configuration or related systems.
    * Risk: While the likelihood might be low if defaults are changed, the impact of gaining initial access is critical, potentially leading to full system compromise.

* Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server/Client (via Groovy Injection):
    * Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious Groovy code into Geb scripts, which is then executed by the Geb runtime, allowing them to run arbitrary commands on the server or client.
    * Risk: This is a critical risk as it allows attackers to take complete control of the execution environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system takeover, or denial of service.

* Perform XSS or other Client-Side Attacks:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through Geb's browser interaction capabilities. This code is then executed in the context of other users' browsers.
    * Risk: This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or the execution of malicious actions on behalf of legitimate users.

* Trigger Selenium bugs leading to browser compromise:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers use Geb's API to trigger known vulnerabilities in the underlying Selenium library, potentially leading to browser crashes, information disclosure, or even remote code execution within the browser context.
    * Risk: Exploiting browser vulnerabilities can have significant impact, potentially allowing attackers to gain control over the user's browsing session or access sensitive information.

* Execute arbitrary code through Groovy vulnerabilities:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the Groovy runtime environment that Geb relies on, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the system.
    * Risk: Similar to Groovy injection via Geb, this allows for complete control over the execution environment.

* Use Geb to Scrape Sensitive Data:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers write Geb scripts to automatically navigate through the application and extract sensitive information that they are not authorized to access.
    * Risk: This can lead to significant data breaches and privacy violations. The likelihood is higher because Geb is designed for web scraping.

* Use Geb to Perform Unauthorized Actions:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers use Geb scripts to automate actions within the application that they are not authorized to perform, such as modifying data, submitting forms, or initiating transactions.
    * Risk: This can lead to data corruption, financial loss, or other unauthorized changes to the application state.
