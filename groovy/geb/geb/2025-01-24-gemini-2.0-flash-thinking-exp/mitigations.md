# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for geb/geb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Script Storage and Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/secure_script_storage_and_access_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Script Storage and Access Control
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Secure Repository:** Store Geb scripts in a version control system like Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or a dedicated secure code repository. This is crucial as Geb scripts contain the logic of your automated tests and potentially sensitive information.
    2.  **Implement Access Control:** Utilize the repository's access control features to restrict access to Geb scripts.
        *   Grant access only to authorized developers, QA engineers, and security personnel who need to create, modify, or review scripts. This prevents unauthorized individuals from tampering with or viewing your Geb test automation logic.
        *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) if available to manage permissions based on job roles, ensuring only necessary access is granted.
    3.  **Regularly Review Access:** Periodically review and update access permissions to ensure they remain appropriate as team members change roles or leave the project. This maintains the security of your Geb script repository over time.
    4.  **Enable Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging within the repository to track who accessed or modified Geb scripts and when. This provides an audit trail for security and compliance purposes related to your Geb test automation assets.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data in Geb Scripts (High Severity):** Geb scripts might inadvertently contain or access sensitive information (credentials, API keys, etc.) used in testing. Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches or misuse of credentials exposed through your Geb automation.
    *   **Malicious Geb Script Modification (High Severity):** Unauthorized modification of Geb scripts could introduce malicious logic, leading to compromised test automation, potentially impacting application testing integrity or even introducing vulnerabilities into the test environment itself.
    *   **Information Disclosure through Geb Script Exposure (Medium Severity):** Exposure of Geb scripts to unauthorized individuals could reveal application testing logic, test strategies, or internal system details, potentially aiding attackers in understanding your application's behavior and security posture.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data in Geb Scripts:** High Reduction
    *   **Malicious Geb Script Modification:** High Reduction
    *   **Information Disclosure through Geb Script Exposure:** Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Geb scripts are stored in a private GitLab repository. Basic developer access control is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing granular role-based access control within the GitLab repository specifically for Geb script access. Audit logging is enabled but not regularly reviewed for Geb script related activities. Access reviews are not conducted periodically for Geb script repository access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Data in Geb Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_hardcoding_sensitive_data_in_geb_scripts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Data in Geb Scripts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Geb Scripts:**  Identify all sensitive information currently hardcoded directly within Geb scripts (usernames, passwords, API keys, security tokens, database connection strings, etc.) used for test automation.
    2.  **Implement Environment Variables for Geb Scripts:**  Utilize environment variables to store sensitive configuration values needed by Geb scripts.
        *   Configure your test environment (local, CI/CD pipeline, test servers) to set these environment variables that your Geb scripts will access.
        *   Access environment variables within Geb scripts using system properties or configuration libraries available in Groovy (the language Geb scripts are written in).
    3.  **Use Secure Configuration Files for Geb Scripts:**  Alternatively, use secure configuration files (e.g., encrypted configuration files) to store sensitive data accessed by Geb scripts.
        *   Ensure these files are stored outside the version control system where Geb scripts reside or are encrypted if stored within the repository.
        *   Implement secure mechanisms within your Geb script execution environment to decrypt and access these configuration files at runtime.
    4.  **Integrate with Secret Management Solutions for Geb Scripts:** For more robust security, integrate with dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to manage secrets used by Geb scripts.
        *   Store and manage secrets centrally in the secret management system, separate from your Geb script repository.
        *   Retrieve secrets dynamically from the secret management system within Geb scripts using appropriate APIs or SDKs provided by the secret management solution.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Credentials in Geb Scripts (High Severity):** Hardcoded credentials directly in Geb scripts are easily discoverable by anyone with access to the scripts and can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to systems and data used in testing.
    *   **Credential Leakage through Geb Script Version Control (High Severity):**  If Geb scripts with hardcoded credentials are committed to version control, credentials can be exposed in repository history, even if removed later, leading to potential security breaches related to your test automation.
    *   **Increased Attack Surface through Geb Scripts (Medium Severity):** Hardcoded secrets in Geb scripts increase the attack surface as attackers can target the scripts directly to extract sensitive information used in your test automation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Credentials in Geb Scripts:** High Reduction
    *   **Credential Leakage through Geb Script Version Control:** High Reduction
    *   **Increased Attack Surface through Geb Scripts:** Medium Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Environment variables are used for some configurations accessed by Geb scripts, but some scripts still contain hardcoded test usernames and passwords.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to migrate all hardcoded credentials from Geb scripts to environment variables or a secret management solution.  No secret management solution is currently integrated for managing secrets used in Geb scripts.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to formally incorporate security considerations into code review checklists for Geb scripts. Implement regular security audits of Geb scripts, potentially exploring static analysis tools suitable for Groovy/Geb.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation in Geb Scripts (when applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_in_geb_scripts__when_applicable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization and Validation in Geb Scripts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify External Input Sources for Geb Scripts:** Determine if Geb scripts are taking input from external sources (e.g., data files, databases, APIs, user input during test execution) to drive test data or script behavior.
    2.  **Sanitize Input Data within Geb Scripts:**  Sanitize input data within Geb scripts to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters or code before using it in your Geb automation logic or passing it to the application under test.
        *   For example, if Geb scripts are constructing inputs for web forms or API requests based on external data, sanitize input to prevent injection vulnerabilities (like XSS or other injection types) in the application under test *through your Geb automation*.
    3.  **Validate Input Data within Geb Scripts:** Validate input data within Geb scripts to ensure it conforms to expected formats, types, and ranges before using it in your Geb automation.
        *   Implement validation checks within Geb scripts to reject invalid or unexpected input that could lead to errors in your test automation or unintended behavior in the application under test due to malformed test inputs.
    4.  **Error Handling for Invalid Input in Geb Scripts:** Implement proper error handling within Geb scripts for cases where input data is invalid or fails sanitization.
        *   Log errors within your Geb script execution and gracefully handle invalid input to prevent Geb script failures or unexpected behavior during test automation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in Application Under Test via Geb Scripts (Medium Severity):** If Geb scripts construct inputs based on external data without sanitization, they could inadvertently trigger injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.) in the application being tested *through the test automation itself*.
    *   **Geb Script Errors due to Malformed Input (Low Severity):**  Invalid or malformed input can cause Geb scripts to fail or behave unexpectedly, disrupting your test automation process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in Application Under Test via Geb Scripts:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Geb Script Errors due to Malformed Input:** Low Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic validation is performed in some Geb scripts, but systematic input sanitization is not consistently applied across all Geb scripts handling external input.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to implement a consistent approach to input sanitization and validation in all Geb scripts that handle external input. Develop guidelines and reusable functions within Geb script libraries for robust input handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Geb Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_geb_scripts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege in Geb Scripts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Geb Test Scope:** Clearly define the scope and purpose of each Geb script to ensure it only performs necessary actions for testing.
    2.  **Minimize Geb Script Actions:** Design Geb scripts to perform only the minimum necessary actions required for testing specific functionalities. Avoid scripts that perform actions beyond the test scope or unnecessary operations that could introduce unintended side effects or security risks.
    3.  **Restrict User Roles in Geb Tests:** When Geb scripts are testing user roles and permissions within the application, use test accounts with the minimum necessary privileges to perform the tested actions. Avoid using administrator or overly privileged accounts for routine Geb tests to limit potential damage if a script malfunctions or is misused.
    4.  **Review Geb Script Permissions and Actions:** Periodically review Geb scripts to ensure they are not performing actions beyond their intended scope or using excessive privileges in the application under test.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended Actions by Geb Scripts (Medium Severity):** Geb scripts with excessive privileges or poorly defined scope could perform unintended actions within the application under test, potentially leading to data corruption, system misconfiguration, or unintended security implications.
    *   **Abuse of Geb Script Privileges (Low Severity):**  If Geb scripts are compromised or misused (though less likely in a testing context, still a consideration), excessive privileges granted to the scripts could amplify the potential damage they could cause within the application under test.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended Actions by Geb Scripts:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Abuse of Geb Script Privileges:** Low Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Geb scripts are generally designed for specific test cases, but privilege minimization is not explicitly considered as a primary security principle during Geb script development.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to incorporate the principle of least privilege into Geb script design guidelines. Review existing Geb scripts to minimize their scope and the level of privileges required for the test accounts they utilize.
