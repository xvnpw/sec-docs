# Threat Model Analysis for geb/geb

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Script Output/Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_script_outputlogs.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information (credentials, API keys, application data) if Geb scripts inadvertently log or output this data during execution. This could happen through standard logging mechanisms or debugging outputs. Attackers might target log files, console outputs, or monitoring systems to extract this data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data leakage, unauthorized access to systems, account compromise, potential regulatory violations, reputational damage.

**Geb Component Affected:** Geb Scripts (logging and output mechanisms), Logging Frameworks used with Geb

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid logging sensitive data in Geb scripts.
*   Implement secure logging practices, including log rotation, access controls, and secure storage.
*   Sanitize or mask sensitive data before logging if absolutely necessary.

## Threat: [Bypassing Client-Side Security Controls](./threats/bypassing_client-side_security_controls.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use Geb scripts to bypass client-side security controls implemented in JavaScript, such as input validation, form field restrictions, or CAPTCHA. Geb operates at the browser level and can directly interact with the DOM, effectively ignoring client-side JavaScript restrictions. This allows attackers to submit malicious data or perform actions that would be blocked by client-side checks.

**Impact:** Data integrity issues, injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection if backend is vulnerable), circumvention of business logic, unauthorized access, security control failure.

**Geb Component Affected:** Geb Scripts (browser interaction capabilities), WebDriver (browser control)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never rely solely on client-side security controls.
*   Implement robust server-side validation and security measures.
*   Treat all input from Geb scripts as potentially malicious.

## Threat: [Abuse of Application Functionality through Automation](./threats/abuse_of_application_functionality_through_automation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage Geb's automation capabilities to abuse application functionality at scale. This includes automated scraping, brute-force attacks (login, password reset), spamming, or other malicious activities that are amplified by automation. Geb scripts can perform actions repeatedly and rapidly, making abuse more efficient.

**Impact:** Data scraping, unauthorized access, account compromise, spam, service disruption, reputational damage, financial loss.

**Geb Component Affected:** Geb Scripts (automation capabilities), WebDriver (browser control)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting and throttling for application actions.
*   Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Implement bot detection and prevention measures.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Geb Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_geb_library.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities directly within the Geb library code. If Geb has a vulnerability (e.g., in its parsing, browser interaction handling, or internal logic), attackers could craft malicious inputs or scripts to trigger these vulnerabilities and potentially gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, privilege escalation, complete system compromise.

**Geb Component Affected:** Geb Library (core modules, parsing logic, browser interaction handling)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Geb library updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Monitor Geb security advisories and vulnerability databases.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in WebDriver Implementations](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_webdriver_implementations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities in the WebDriver implementations (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) that Geb relies on. WebDriver vulnerabilities could allow attackers to control the browser instance used by Geb, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, sandbox escape, or information disclosure.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, sandbox escape, information disclosure, browser compromise, system compromise.

**Geb Component Affected:** WebDriver Implementations (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep WebDriver implementations updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Monitor WebDriver security advisories and vulnerability databases.

## Threat: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in Geb's dependencies or transitive dependencies (libraries that Geb or its direct dependencies rely on). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited through Geb, even if Geb itself is secure. This requires careful management of the entire dependency chain.

**Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and other security breaches.

**Geb Component Affected:** Geb Dependencies (direct and transitive libraries)

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use dependency management tools to track and manage Geb's dependencies.
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
*   Keep dependencies updated to patched versions.
