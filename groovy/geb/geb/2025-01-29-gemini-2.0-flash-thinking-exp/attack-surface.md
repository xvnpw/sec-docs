# Attack Surface Analysis for geb/geb

## Attack Surface: [Insecure WebDriver Binaries](./attack_surfaces/insecure_webdriver_binaries.md)

*   **Description:** Using compromised, outdated, or unverified WebDriver binaries (like ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) that Geb relies on.
*   **Geb Contribution:** Geb directly utilizes WebDriver binaries to control browsers. Insecure binaries compromise Geb's operation and the system.
*   **Example:** Downloading ChromeDriver from an unofficial source hosting a malware-infected version. Geb using this binary can lead to malware execution on the system running Geb.
*   **Impact:** Malware infection, system compromise, data breach, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Download WebDriver binaries **only** from official and trusted sources (e.g., ChromeDriver from Google Chrome for Developers, GeckoDriver from Mozilla).
        *   Implement checksum verification to ensure binary integrity against official checksums.
        *   Keep WebDriver binaries updated to the latest stable and secure versions.

## Attack Surface: [WebDriver Server Exposure](./attack_surfaces/webdriver_server_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing the WebDriver server (e.g., Selenium Grid hub or standalone server) to unauthorized access due to misconfiguration, when Geb is configured to use remote WebDriver.
*   **Geb Contribution:** Geb's ability to connect to remote WebDriver servers introduces a network service that, if insecure, becomes an attack vector.
*   **Example:** Running a Selenium Grid hub on a public network without authentication. Attackers can access the hub via Geb, control browser sessions, and potentially access internal systems if the hub is within a private network.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized control of browser sessions, potential access to internal applications and data, denial of service against the WebDriver server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Securely configure WebDriver servers with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to WebDriver servers.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for WebDriver server communication.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Code Execution via Geb Scripts](./attack_surfaces/unintended_code_execution_via_geb_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to inject and execute malicious code within Geb scripts, leveraging Groovy's dynamic nature.
*   **Geb Contribution:** Geb scripts are written in Groovy. If Geb scripts are dynamically generated based on untrusted input, code injection is possible.
*   **Example:** A Geb script reads configuration from a user-controlled file. An attacker modifies this file to inject malicious Groovy code into a Geb script, leading to arbitrary code execution when Geb runs the script.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running Geb, system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Avoid dynamic generation of Geb scripts based on untrusted or external input.
        *   If dynamic script generation is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization.
        *   Follow secure coding practices in Groovy within Geb scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Geb Extensions or Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_geb_extensions_or_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities present in Geb extensions or plugins (either custom-built or third-party).
*   **Geb Contribution:** Geb's extensibility through plugins means vulnerabilities in these plugins directly impact Geb's security.
*   **Example:** Using a third-party Geb plugin with a code execution vulnerability. When Geb loads this plugin, the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, security bypass, application manipulation, potential system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit Geb extensions and plugins for security vulnerabilities before use.
        *   Prefer well-established and actively maintained extensions from trusted sources.
        *   Keep Geb extensions and plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable to Geb context)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_to_geb_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities if Geb or its extensions use deserialization of data without proper security measures.
*   **Geb Contribution:** While not core, Geb or extensions *could* use deserialization for configuration or data handling, introducing deserialization risks.
*   **Example:** A Geb extension deserializes data from a configuration file. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object in this file. Geb deserializing it leads to code execution.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, system compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Avoid deserialization of untrusted data if possible.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and libraries.
        *   Implement robust input validation before deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Geb Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_geb_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries and dependencies that Geb relies upon (e.g., Selenium WebDriver, Groovy, etc.).
*   **Geb Contribution:** Geb depends on libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies indirectly become part of Geb's attack surface.
*   **Example:** Geb uses an outdated Selenium WebDriver version with a known vulnerability. Attackers could exploit this via interaction with the WebDriver instance Geb controls.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities, potential code execution, system compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly scan Geb and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.
        *   Keep Geb and its dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies effectively.
