# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Geb project is a library for browser automation, primarily used for web testing and web scraping.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a user-friendly and expressive DSL for browser automation.
  - Offer a robust and reliable abstraction over WebDriver.
  - Enable efficient and maintainable automated tests for web applications.
  - Support rapid development and iteration of automated tests.
  - Facilitate web scraping tasks by simplifying browser interactions.

- Most important business risks:
  - Risk of vulnerabilities in the Geb library itself, potentially leading to security issues in projects that depend on it.
  - Risk of misuse of Geb for malicious automation, such as denial-of-service attacks or unauthorized data scraping.
  - Risk of data breaches if Geb is used to automate interactions with sensitive data without proper security considerations in user applications.
  - Risk of compatibility issues with different WebDriver versions or web browsers, impacting the reliability of automated tests.
  - Risk of performance bottlenecks in automated tests if Geb is not used efficiently, leading to slow feedback loops in development.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Public GitHub repository with issue tracking and pull request review process. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
  - security control: Open-source licensing, allowing community review and contributions. (Implemented: GitHub repository - LICENSE file)

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities may be discovered in the library code due to its complexity and open-source nature.
  - accepted risk: Malicious actors may attempt to contribute malicious code through pull requests.
  - accepted risk: Users may misuse Geb in insecure ways, leading to security vulnerabilities in their own applications.
  - accepted risk: Dependencies of Geb may have vulnerabilities that could indirectly affect Geb users.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in Geb's dependencies.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to detect potential security flaws in the Geb codebase.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external developers.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for Geb users, focusing on secure handling of credentials, input validation, and data sanitization in automated tests and scraping scripts.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Geb, including a security policy and contact information.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to the Geb library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the web applications being tested or automated using Geb, and the user applications that utilize Geb. Geb should provide mechanisms to handle authentication flows in web applications securely (e.g., handling credentials, session management).
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to the Geb library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the web applications being tested or automated using Geb, and the user applications that utilize Geb. Geb should not bypass or undermine the authorization mechanisms of target web applications.
  - Input validation:
    - Geb should encourage and facilitate input validation in user applications that interact with web applications. This includes validating inputs before submitting forms, interacting with web elements, and processing data scraped from web pages. Geb itself should be robust against malformed or unexpected inputs from WebDriver and web browsers.
  - Cryptography:
    - Geb itself may not directly implement cryptographic functions. However, if Geb is used to handle sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) in automated tests or scraping scripts, it is crucial to ensure that user applications utilize secure storage and transmission mechanisms for such data. Geb should not introduce vulnerabilities related to cryptography, such as storing credentials in plaintext or using weak encryption algorithms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
  - For the Geb project itself: Maintaining the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the Geb library code and build process. Ensuring the library is free from vulnerabilities and safe for users to use.
  - For users of Geb: Ensuring the reliability and security of their automated tests and web scraping scripts. Protecting sensitive data handled during automation processes.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Geb library source code: Confidentiality (to prevent unauthorized access and modification), Integrity (to ensure code is not tampered with), Availability (to ensure continuous development and maintenance). Sensitivity: High.
  - Geb build artifacts (JAR): Integrity (to ensure users download untampered and safe library versions), Availability (to ensure users can access and use the library). Sensitivity: Medium.
  - User application code using Geb: Confidentiality (if it contains sensitive business logic or credentials), Integrity (to ensure tests are reliable and not manipulated), Availability (to ensure tests can be executed when needed). Sensitivity: Varies depending on the user application.
  - Sensitive data handled during automation (credentials, PII): Confidentiality (to prevent unauthorized access), Integrity (to ensure data is not modified or corrupted), Availability (to ensure data is accessible when needed for automation). Sensitivity: High to Critical, depending on the data.
