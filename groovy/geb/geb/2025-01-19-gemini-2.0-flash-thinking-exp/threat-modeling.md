# Threat Model Analysis for geb/geb

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Geb Scripts](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_credentials_in_geb_scripts.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Credentials in Geb Scripts
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the repository or environment containing Geb scripts. They then read the scripts to find hardcoded credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) used for interacting with the application under test *via Geb's browser automation capabilities*.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can use the exposed credentials to gain unauthorized access to the application, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption *by mimicking legitimate user actions through Geb or directly using the extracted credentials*.
    *   **Affected Geb Component:** Scripting (Groovy code within Geb scripts)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in Geb scripts.
        *   Utilize secure configuration management or secrets management solutions to store and retrieve credentials *within Geb scripts*.
        *   Implement robust access controls for the repository and environment containing Geb scripts.
        *   Regularly review Geb scripts for accidentally committed secrets.

## Threat: [Accidental Execution of Geb Scripts Against Production](./threats/accidental_execution_of_geb_scripts_against_production.md)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Execution of Geb Scripts Against Production
    *   **Description:** Due to misconfiguration, human error, or a compromised automation pipeline, Geb scripts intended for testing are mistakenly executed against the production environment. These scripts, *designed to interact with the application through Geb's browser automation*, might perform actions that modify or delete live data.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption, data loss, service disruption, and potential financial losses due to incorrect operations on the production system *triggered by Geb's automated actions*.
    *   **Affected Geb Component:** Browser interaction (actions performed by Geb on the application)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly segregate test and production environments.
        *   Implement clear environment indicators and checks within Geb scripts to prevent execution against the wrong environment.
        *   Use environment variables or configuration flags to control the target environment *for Geb script execution*.
        *   Implement safeguards and confirmation steps for destructive actions within Geb scripts, especially when targeting production-like environments.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Geb Scripts](./threats/injection_of_malicious_geb_scripts.md)

*   **Threat:** Injection of Malicious Geb Scripts
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the development or testing environment injects malicious Geb scripts into the test suite. These scripts, *leveraging Geb's browser automation capabilities*, could be designed to exfiltrate data from the application by navigating to specific pages and extracting information, modify application state in unintended ways by submitting forms or clicking buttons, or perform other malicious actions during test execution.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, and potential compromise of the application under test *through actions orchestrated by the malicious Geb scripts*.
    *   **Affected Geb Component:** Scripting (Groovy code within Geb scripts)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and code review processes for Geb scripts.
        *   Use version control for Geb scripts and track changes.
        *   Employ security scanning tools to detect potentially malicious patterns or commands within Geb scripts.
