# Attack Tree Analysis for geb/geb

Objective: To gain unauthorized access to the application's data, functionality, or resources by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses introduced by the Geb library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Compromise Application via Geb Exploitation [CRITICAL]**
*   Inject Malicious Geb Commands [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]
    *   Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Geb Script [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]
*   Exploit Geb's Integration with Selenium WebDriver [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]
    *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Underlying Selenium WebDriver [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]
*   Exploit Geb's Dependency Chain [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]
    *   Leverage Vulnerabilities in Geb's Dependencies [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Geb Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_geb_exploitation__critical_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control over the application due to weaknesses in how Geb is used or its inherent vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Geb Commands [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_geb_commands__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Goal:** Execute arbitrary code or actions within the context of the Geb script execution.
*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Geb Script [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **How:** If the application dynamically constructs Geb scripts based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious Groovy or JavaScript code. For example, if a Geb script uses a variable derived from user input to select an element, an attacker could inject code into that variable to execute arbitrary commands when the script runs.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Geb's Integration with Selenium WebDriver [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_geb's_integration_with_selenium_webdriver__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Goal:** Control the browser or gain access to browser data by exploiting Geb's reliance on Selenium WebDriver.
*   **Attack Vector: Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Underlying Selenium WebDriver [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **How:** Geb relies on Selenium WebDriver. If the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of Selenium, attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in WebDriver to gain control of the browser or the system running the browser.
    *   **Impact:** Browser compromise, information disclosure (e.g., cookies, session tokens), or even remote code execution on the machine running the browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Geb's Dependency Chain [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_geb's_dependency_chain__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that Geb depends on.
*   **Attack Vector: Leverage Vulnerabilities in Geb's Dependencies [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **How:** Geb relies on other libraries like Groovy and potentially specific versions of Selenium. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Various vulnerabilities depending on the exploited dependency, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. For example, a vulnerability in Groovy could allow for arbitrary code execution.
