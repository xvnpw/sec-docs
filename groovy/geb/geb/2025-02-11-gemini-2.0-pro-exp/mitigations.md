## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe JavaScript Execution within Geb](./mitigation_strategies/safe_javascript_execution_within_geb.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Safe JavaScript Execution within Geb**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize Geb's API:** Use Geb's built-in methods for interacting with web elements whenever possible.  These methods (e.g., `$`, `click()`, `value()`, `text()`, `displayed`, `enabled`) are designed to handle common interactions safely and are less prone to injection vulnerabilities than raw JavaScript.
    2.  **Minimize `evaluateJavascript` (`js`):** Avoid using `browser.js` or `evaluateJavascript` unless absolutely necessary.  These methods execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser context and are inherently more risky.
    3.  **Context-Specific Escaping (When `js` is Unavoidable):** If you *must* use `browser.js` or `evaluateJavascript`:
        *   **Understand the Context:** Determine precisely where the dynamic data will be inserted into the JavaScript code (e.g., as a string literal, within an HTML attribute, as part of a function call).
        *   **Use Appropriate Escaping:** Apply the correct escaping function for that specific context.  Groovy's `encodeAsJavaScript()` is a starting point, but it's not always sufficient.  Consider using a dedicated JavaScript escaping library (if available in your Groovy environment) that provides more granular control (e.g., escaping for HTML attributes, CSS, URLs, etc.).
        *   **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Do *not* build JavaScript code by concatenating strings, especially if those strings contain user-provided or externally sourced data.  This is a classic recipe for injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Parameterized Approach (Conceptual):**  Think of dynamic JavaScript generation like building SQL queries.  Strive for a "parameterized" approach where you pass data as separate arguments to JavaScript functions rather than embedding it directly into the code string.  This is often difficult to achieve perfectly with JavaScript, but the principle is important.
        *   **Example (Illustrative - Requires a Suitable Library):**
            ```groovy
            def userInput = "'; alert('XSS'); //"

            // Hypothetical - using a library for robust escaping
            def escapedInput = JavaScriptEscaper.escapeForHtmlAttribute(userInput)
            browser.js."document.getElementById('myInput').setAttribute('value', ?)", escapedInput

            //Another example
            def jsCode = "someFunction(?, ?)"
            browser.js(jsCode, "param1", "param2")
            ```
    4.  **Input Validation (Test Data):** Even if the data originates from a test file or database, validate and sanitize it *before* using it within Geb, especially if it will be part of dynamically generated JavaScript.  This adds a layer of defense even if the data source is considered "trusted."

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **JavaScript Injection within Geb Tests:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript code into the test scripts, which could then be executed in the browser context.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation *Through* Geb:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Reduces the risk of a Geb test inadvertently triggering an XSS vulnerability in the application being tested.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **JavaScript Injection:** Risk reduction: **High** (significantly reduces the attack surface by limiting the ways JavaScript can be injected).
    *   **XSS Exploitation:** Risk reduction: **Medium** (helps prevent accidental triggering of XSS vulnerabilities).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   We generally prefer Geb's API methods.
    *   `evaluateJavascript` is used, but escaping practices are inconsistent and not always context-aware.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent and context-specific escaping is not rigorously applied when `evaluateJavascript` is used.
    *   A dedicated JavaScript escaping library is not utilized.
    *   Input validation for test data, specifically before use in `js`, is not consistently performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Test Code Practices within Geb Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/secure_test_code_practices_within_geb_scripts.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Test Code Practices within Geb Scripts**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never directly embed credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) or other sensitive data within Geb test scripts. This is a critical security risk, especially if the code is stored in a version control system.
    2.  **Use Environment Variables (with Geb):** Access secrets through environment variables. Geb can easily access these:
        ```groovy
        def username = System.getenv("TEST_USERNAME")
        def password = System.getenv("TEST_PASSWORD")
        $("input", name: "username").value(username)
        $("input", name: "password").value(password)
        ```
    3. **Secrets Management Integration (Advanced):** For enhanced security, integrate Geb with a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  The Geb script would retrieve secrets from the secrets manager at runtime. This typically involves using the secrets manager's API (often through a Groovy or Java client library) within the Geb script. The specifics depend on the chosen secrets manager.
    4. **Code Reviews (Geb-Specific Focus):** During code reviews of Geb scripts, specifically look for:
        *   Proper use of Geb's API (avoiding unnecessary `evaluateJavascript`).
        *   Secure handling of any dynamic data used within JavaScript.
        *   Absence of hardcoded secrets.
        *   Correct use of environment variables or secrets management integration.
    5. **Data Minimization:** Design Geb tests to interact with and handle the *minimum* amount of sensitive data necessary to achieve the test objectives. Avoid unnecessary data entry or retrieval.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Test Environment Leading to Application Compromise:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Reduces the risk of attackers obtaining credentials or other sensitive data from compromised test code.
    *   **Data Leakage from Test Runs:** (Severity: **High**) - Minimizes the amount of sensitive data handled by the tests, reducing the potential for exposure.
    *   **JavaScript Injection within Geb Tests:** (Severity: **High**) - Secure coding practices reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited for injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Test Environment:** Risk reduction: **Medium** (makes it harder for attackers to extract sensitive information from test code).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduction: **Medium** (reduces the amount of sensitive data at risk).
    *   **JavaScript Injection:** Risk reduction: **Medium** (reduces the introduction of vulnerabilities).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Environment variables are used for *some* secrets, but not consistently across all tests.
    *   Basic code reviews are performed, but the focus on Geb-specific security aspects is not always strong.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A robust secrets management solution (like HashiCorp Vault) is not integrated with Geb.
    *   Code reviews are not consistently focused on Geb-specific security best practices.
    *   Data minimization principles are not always strictly followed in test design.
