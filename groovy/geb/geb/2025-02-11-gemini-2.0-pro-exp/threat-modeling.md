# Threat Model Analysis for geb/geb

## Threat: [Arbitrary JavaScript Execution via `interact`](./threats/arbitrary_javascript_execution_via__interact_.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary JavaScript Execution via `interact`

    *   **Description:** An attacker (malicious test writer or compromised CI/CD) crafts a Geb test that uses the `interact` block to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser context. This bypasses any client-side XSS protections the application might have. The attacker could steal cookies, redirect the user to a phishing site, deface the page, or exfiltrate sensitive data displayed on the page.  This is a *direct* threat because it leverages a specific Geb feature (`interact`) for malicious purposes.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (sensitive information displayed in the browser).
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Client-side defacement.
        *   Phishing attacks.
        *   Malware distribution (if the injected script downloads and executes malicious code).
    *   **Geb Component Affected:** `interact` block (and any methods that allow raw JavaScript execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Review:** Mandate thorough code reviews for all uses of `interact`, focusing on the purpose and safety of the injected JavaScript.
        *   **Avoid `interact` When Possible:** Prefer Geb's built-in methods and page object model features over direct JavaScript execution.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** If data from external sources (e.g., test data files) is used within the `interact` block, rigorously sanitize and escape it to prevent injection.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the application uses CSP, ensure it's configured to restrict the execution of inline scripts, further mitigating the risk. (This is an application-level mitigation that helps, but doesn't eliminate the risk from a malicious test writer).

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Browser Automation](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_browser_automation.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Browser Automation

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses Geb's browser control capabilities (e.g., `driver.getPageSource()`, taking screenshots, accessing element text) to extract sensitive data *displayed* in the browser, even if the application's backend is secure. This could include data from other open tabs (if the test environment isn't isolated), browser extensions, or the user's clipboard. This is a *direct* threat because it uses Geb's core functionality (browser automation) for malicious data gathering.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (sensitive information displayed in the browser, potentially including data from outside the application under test).
        *   Privacy violation.
    *   **Geb Component Affected:**  All Geb features that interact with the browser's DOM, including:
        *   `driver` object (and its methods like `getPageSource()`, `getCurrentUrl()`).
        *   `Navigator` and `WebElement` objects (for accessing element text and attributes).
        *   Screenshot functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sandboxed Test Environments:** Run Geb tests in isolated environments (Docker containers, VMs) with minimal privileges and network access.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Test Users):** Use test accounts with the absolute minimum permissions required.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Browser Features:** Configure the browser to disable features like clipboard access, extensions, and pop-ups.
        *   **Monitor Test Execution:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual browser behavior.
        *   **Code Review:** Review test code for any interactions that access data outside the intended scope of the test.

## Threat: [Browser Hijacking in Compromised CI/CD](./threats/browser_hijacking_in_compromised_cicd.md)

*   **Threat:** Browser Hijacking in Compromised CI/CD

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the CI/CD pipeline where Geb tests are executed. They modify the tests or the environment to use Geb's browser control to perform malicious actions *outside* the application under test. This could include visiting malicious websites, downloading malware, or interacting with other systems. This is a *direct* threat because the attacker is leveraging Geb's capabilities, albeit through a compromised environment.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Malware infection of the CI/CD server or other connected systems.
        *   Data exfiltration from the CI/CD environment.
        *   Use of the compromised CI/CD server as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Geb Component Affected:** All Geb features that control the browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** Implement strong security controls for the CI/CD pipeline (access control, vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection, regular security audits).
        *   **Sandboxed Test Environments:** (As above) Isolate the test execution environment.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict the network access of the test environment.
        *   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure for the CI/CD pipeline to make it more difficult for attackers to persist changes.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Test Code](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_test_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Test Code

    *   **Description:** Developers inadvertently include hardcoded credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data directly within the Geb test code. This code is then committed to a source code repository (potentially a public one) or otherwise exposed. This is a *direct* threat to the Geb test code itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to the application or other systems.
        *   Data breach.
    *   **Geb Component Affected:**  The entire Geb test codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never Hardcode Secrets:** Use environment variables, configuration files, or secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
        *   **Code Review:** Enforce code reviews to catch accidental inclusion of secrets.
        *   **Secrets Scanning:** Use tools (e.g., git-secrets, truffleHog) to scan the codebase for potential secrets before committing.
        *   **.gitignore:** Ensure sensitive files (e.g., configuration files containing secrets) are included in the `.gitignore` file.

## Threat: [Bypassing Client-Side Validation](./threats/bypassing_client-side_validation.md)

* **Threat**: Bypassing Client-Side Validation
    * **Description**: An attacker uses Geb to manipulate the DOM and bypass client-side validation logic. They can then submit invalid or malicious data to the server. If the server does not perform adequate validation, this can lead to various security issues. This is direct threat, because attacker is using Geb to interact with application.
    * **Impact**: 
        *   Data corruption.
        *   SQL injection (if server-side validation is missing).
        *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) (if server-side validation is missing and data is reflected back).
        *   Other application-specific vulnerabilities.
    * **Geb Component Affected**: All Geb features that allow interaction with and modification of the DOM (e.g., `$` selector, `value()`, `click()`, `interact`).
    * **Risk Severity**: High (if server-side validation is missing)
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        *   **Robust Server-Side Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation on the server-side for *all* user input. Never rely solely on client-side validation.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Encoding**: Sanitize and encode user input appropriately on the server-side to prevent injection attacks.
