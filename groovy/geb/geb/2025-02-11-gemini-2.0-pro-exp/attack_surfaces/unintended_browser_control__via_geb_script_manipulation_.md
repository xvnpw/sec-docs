# Deep Analysis: Unintended Browser Control (via Geb Script Manipulation)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Geb script manipulation, identify specific vulnerabilities within our application's context, and propose concrete, actionable steps to mitigate those risks.  We aim to prevent attackers from leveraging our Geb-based testing infrastructure to compromise our systems or data.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface where *existing* Geb scripts are maliciously modified.  It encompasses:

*   **Geb Script Storage:**  Where are Geb scripts stored (e.g., version control, CI/CD configuration, build artifacts)?
*   **Geb Script Execution:** How and where are Geb scripts executed (e.g., local developer machines, CI/CD servers, dedicated testing environments)?
*   **Access Control:** Who has access to modify Geb scripts at each stage (developers, testers, CI/CD system accounts)?
*   **Change Management:** How are changes to Geb scripts tracked, reviewed, and approved?
*   **Monitoring:**  What mechanisms are in place to detect unauthorized modifications or unexpected behavior during Geb script execution?
*   **Dependencies:** Are there any external dependencies (libraries, modules) used by the Geb scripts that could introduce vulnerabilities?
*   **Browser Context:** What privileges and access does the browser have when running Geb scripts?  Can it access sensitive data or systems?

This analysis *excludes* scenarios where attackers introduce *entirely new* Geb scripts (that's a separate, albeit related, attack surface).  It also excludes vulnerabilities within Geb itself (assuming we're using a reasonably up-to-date and patched version).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach (e.g., STRIDE, PASTA) to systematically identify potential threats related to Geb script manipulation.
2.  **Code Review:**  We will review the Geb scripts themselves, focusing on patterns that might be more susceptible to manipulation or that could lead to unintended consequences if modified.
3.  **Infrastructure Review:** We will examine the CI/CD pipeline, version control system, and testing environments to identify weaknesses in access control, change management, and monitoring.
4.  **Dependency Analysis:** We will analyze the dependencies of our Geb scripts to identify any known vulnerabilities.
5.  **Penetration Testing (Simulated Attacks):**  We will conduct controlled penetration tests to simulate realistic attack scenarios, attempting to modify Geb scripts and observe the consequences.  This is crucial for validating the effectiveness of our mitigations.
6.  **Documentation Review:** We will review existing documentation related to testing procedures, security policies, and incident response plans.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

We'll use the STRIDE model to categorize potential threats:

*   **Spoofing:**  An attacker could impersonate a legitimate user or system to modify Geb scripts.  This is particularly relevant if access controls are weak or if the CI/CD system is compromised.
*   **Tampering:** This is the core of the attack surface â€“ the attacker directly modifies the Geb scripts to alter their behavior.
*   **Repudiation:**  If changes to Geb scripts are not properly logged and audited, it may be difficult to determine who made the malicious modifications.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  A modified Geb script could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the application or the testing environment.  This could include credentials, API keys, or customer data.
*   **Denial of Service:**  A modified script could be used to disrupt testing processes or even cause a denial-of-service condition in the application being tested (though this is less likely than other threats).
*   **Elevation of Privilege:**  If the browser running the Geb scripts has excessive privileges, a modified script could be used to gain access to other systems or data.

### 2.2. Vulnerability Analysis

Here's a breakdown of specific vulnerabilities related to each aspect of the scope:

*   **Geb Script Storage:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Storing Geb scripts in a repository with overly permissive access controls (e.g., everyone has write access).
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of branch protection rules in the version control system, allowing direct commits to main/master branches without review.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Storing Geb scripts as plain text build artifacts without integrity checks.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Storing secrets (passwords, API keys) directly within Geb scripts.

*   **Geb Script Execution:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Executing Geb scripts on developer machines without sandboxing or isolation.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Executing Geb scripts on CI/CD servers with overly permissive network access.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of monitoring for unusual browser behavior during test execution.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Using a shared, high-privileged user account for all Geb test executions.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Running tests against production environments.

*   **Access Control:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Weak or shared passwords for accounts with access to modify Geb scripts.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing the version control system or CI/CD platform.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Insufficient segregation of duties (e.g., developers having the ability to modify both the application code and the Geb tests).

*   **Change Management:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of a formal code review process for Geb scripts.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  No audit trail of changes to Geb scripts.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  No requirement for approvals before deploying changes to Geb scripts.

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Absence of security information and event management (SIEM) or other monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity in the CI/CD pipeline or testing environment.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  No alerts for failed login attempts or unauthorized access to the version control system.
    *   **Vulnerability:** No browser monitoring tools to detect unusual navigation patterns or network requests during Geb test execution.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Using outdated or vulnerable versions of Geb or its dependencies (e.g., Selenium, browser drivers).
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Lack of a process for regularly updating and patching dependencies.

*  **Browser Context:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Running Geb tests with a browser that has access to production databases or other sensitive resources.
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Not clearing browser cookies, cache, and local storage between test runs, potentially leading to cross-contamination or information leakage.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Using browser extensions that could be compromised or introduce vulnerabilities.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed & Actionable)

The original mitigation strategies are a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed and actionable breakdown:

*   **a. Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   **Implement least privilege:**  Use service accounts with the minimum necessary permissions for each stage of the pipeline.  Avoid using root or administrator accounts.
    *   **Enable MFA:**  Require multi-factor authentication for all users and service accounts accessing the CI/CD platform.
    *   **Network segmentation:**  Isolate the CI/CD environment from other networks, limiting inbound and outbound traffic.
    *   **Regular security audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secrets management:**  Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage sensitive information.  *Never* store secrets directly in Geb scripts or CI/CD configuration files.
    *   **Pipeline-as-Code:** Define your CI/CD pipeline as code, allowing for version control, review, and auditing of pipeline changes.

*   **b. Version Control & Approvals:**
    *   **Branch protection rules:**  Enforce branch protection rules in the version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to require pull requests, code reviews, and status checks before merging changes to protected branches (e.g., main, develop).
    *   **Mandatory code reviews:**  Require at least two reviewers for all changes to Geb scripts.
    *   **Automated code analysis:**  Integrate static code analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan Geb scripts for potential vulnerabilities and coding errors.
    *   **Audit logging:**  Ensure that all changes to Geb scripts are logged and auditable, including who made the change, when it was made, and why.

*   **c. Code Signing (Geb Scripts):**
    *   **Choose a signing mechanism:**  While Groovy doesn't have built-in code signing like Java, you can use tools like GPG to sign the script files.  This involves generating a private/public key pair and using the private key to sign the script.
    *   **Verify signatures before execution:**  Implement a script or process that verifies the GPG signature of the Geb script *before* it's executed by the CI/CD system.  This ensures that only scripts signed with the trusted private key are run.
    *   **Key management:**  Securely store and manage the private key used for signing.  Consider using a hardware security module (HSM) for enhanced security.
    *   **Automated signing:** Integrate the signing process into the CI/CD pipeline, so that scripts are automatically signed after they are approved and before they are deployed.

*   **d. Test Execution Monitoring:**
    *   **Browser monitoring tools:**  Use browser monitoring tools (e.g., Selenium Grid's logging, browser developer tools, custom scripts) to capture network traffic, console logs, and other relevant data during test execution.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure alerts for unusual browser behavior, such as navigation to unexpected URLs, excessive network requests, or JavaScript errors.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate test execution logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect potential attacks.
    *   **Visual Regression Testing:** Implement visual regression testing to detect unexpected changes to the UI, which could indicate a compromised script.

*   **e. Least Privilege (Browser User):**
    *   **Dedicated test accounts:**  Create dedicated user accounts with the minimum necessary permissions for running Geb tests.  Avoid using accounts with administrative privileges.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running Geb tests in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container, a virtual machine) to isolate the browser from the host system.
    *   **Browser profiles:**  Use separate browser profiles for different test environments (e.g., development, staging, production) to prevent cross-contamination.

*   **f. Strict No-Production Testing:**
    *   **Policy enforcement:**  Implement a strict policy that prohibits running Geb tests against production environments.  This policy should be clearly communicated to all developers and testers.
    *   **Technical controls:**  Use technical controls (e.g., network restrictions, firewall rules) to prevent Geb tests from accessing production systems.
    *   **Environment variables:** Use environment variables to configure Geb scripts to connect to the correct environment (e.g., development, staging).  This helps prevent accidental connections to production.
    *   **Data masking/anonymization:** If testing requires access to production-like data, use data masking or anonymization techniques to protect sensitive information.

### 2.4. Penetration Testing Scenarios

Here are some specific penetration testing scenarios to validate the mitigations:

1.  **Scenario:** Attempt to modify a Geb script in the version control system without going through the required approval process.  **Expected Result:** The change should be blocked by branch protection rules.
2.  **Scenario:** Attempt to commit a Geb script containing a known malicious URL.  **Expected Result:** The static code analysis tool should flag the URL and prevent the commit.
3.  **Scenario:** Attempt to execute a Geb script that has been tampered with (i.e., its signature is invalid).  **Expected Result:** The signature verification process should fail, and the script should not be executed.
4.  **Scenario:** Modify a Geb script to navigate to a known phishing site.  **Expected Result:** Browser monitoring tools should detect the navigation and trigger an alert.
5.  **Scenario:** Attempt to execute a Geb script using a high-privileged user account.  **Expected Result:** The test should fail or be blocked due to least privilege restrictions.
6.  **Scenario:** Attempt to connect a Geb script to a production database. **Expected Result:** The connection should be blocked by network restrictions or firewall rules.
7. **Scenario:** Attempt to inject malicious javascript into input fields that are handled by Geb. **Expected Result:** Input validation and sanitization should prevent the injection.

### 2.5 Dependency Management

*   **Regular Updates:** Establish a process for regularly updating Geb, Selenium, browser drivers, and any other dependencies to their latest stable versions.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, npm audit) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Dependency Locking:** Use a dependency locking mechanism (e.g., `build.gradle` with specific versions, `Gemfile.lock` for Ruby dependencies) to ensure that the same versions of dependencies are used across all environments.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Unintended Browser Control (via Geb Script Manipulation)" attack surface presents a significant risk.  By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, and by regularly conducting penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, we can significantly reduce this risk.  Continuous monitoring and improvement are crucial.  The security of our Geb-based testing infrastructure is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix.
