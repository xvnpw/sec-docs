## High and Critical Groovy-Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve Apache Groovy:

*   **Threat:** Code Injection via `Eval` or Scripting Engines
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious Groovy code into input fields, configuration files, or other data sources that are subsequently processed by the application using methods like `Eval.me()`, `GroovyShell.evaluate()`, or `GroovyScriptEngine.eval()`. The attacker aims to execute arbitrary commands on the server. For example, they might inject code to read sensitive files, establish a reverse shell, or manipulate data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Groovy Component:**
        *   `groovy-all` module (core Groovy functionality)
        *   `groovy.util.Eval` class
        *   `groovy.lang.GroovyShell` class
        *   `groovy.lang.GroovyScriptEngine` class
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `Eval` or scripting engines to execute untrusted input.
        *   If dynamic code execution is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization.
        *   Use a secure sandboxing environment with restricted permissions for executing dynamic code.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to detect potential code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider alternative approaches that don't involve dynamic code execution.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized Groovy object and provides it as input to the application. When the application deserializes this object (e.g., using `ObjectInputStream`), the malicious object can trigger arbitrary code execution due to the way Groovy handles object construction and method calls during deserialization. The attacker might exploit known vulnerabilities in classes present in the classpath.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, potential for privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Groovy Component:**
        *   `groovy-all` module (core Groovy functionality)
        *   Object serialization/deserialization mechanisms within the JVM, which Groovy utilizes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization is unavoidable, implement robust input validation and integrity checks on the serialized data.
        *   Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
        *   Keep all dependencies, including Groovy and Java libraries, up to date to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Utilize tools like SerialKiller or similar to filter dangerous classes during deserialization.

*   **Threat:** Classpath Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify the Groovy classpath at runtime. This allows them to introduce malicious JAR files containing backdoors, trojans, or exploits that will be loaded and executed by the application. This could happen through vulnerabilities in application configuration, file upload mechanisms, or other means of influencing the runtime environment.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Groovy Component:**
        *   Groovy's classloading mechanism.
        *   Potentially the application's configuration management and deployment processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access to the application's classpath and deployment environment.
        *   Implement integrity checks on JAR files loaded into the classpath.
        *   Run the application with restricted file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   Avoid dynamically adding JAR files to the classpath at runtime if possible.
