# Threat Model Analysis for jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via DSL Scripts](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_dsl_scripts.md)

**Description:** An attacker with permissions to create or modify DSL scripts crafts a script containing malicious Groovy code. When this script is processed by the **Job DSL plugin**, the embedded code is executed on the Jenkins master server with the privileges of the Jenkins user. This could involve executing system commands, accessing sensitive files, or installing malware.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins master server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further attacks on connected systems.

**Affected Component:** DSL Interpreter (the core component of the **Job DSL plugin** responsible for parsing and executing the Groovy-based DSL).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access control for who can create, modify, and execute DSL scripts.
* Enforce mandatory code reviews for all DSL script changes, focusing on identifying potentially malicious code.
* Consider using a "sandbox" environment for testing DSL scripts before deploying them to production.
* Regularly update the **Job DSL plugin** to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Script Injection through User-Provided Parameters](./threats/script_injection_through_user-provided_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits DSL scripts that dynamically generate job configurations using user-provided parameters without proper sanitization. By injecting malicious code snippets into these parameters, the attacker can cause the **Job DSL plugin's** interpreter to execute unintended commands or modify job configurations in harmful ways.

**Impact:** Modification of job configurations leading to malicious build steps, data exfiltration, or denial of service. Potential for arbitrary code execution on build agents if injected into build steps.

**Affected Component:** DSL Interpreter (within the **Job DSL plugin**), Job Configuration Generation logic (within the **Job DSL plugin**).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided parameters used within DSL scripts.
* Use parameterized job templates with caution and ensure parameters are handled securely.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into executable code within DSL scripts.
* Utilize Jenkins' built-in features for securely handling parameters and secrets.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via DSL-Modified Jobs](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_dsl-modified_jobs.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates DSL scripts to modify job configurations in a way that grants them elevated privileges or access to restricted resources. This is done through the **Job DSL plugin's** ability to programmatically define job configurations, including security settings.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, ability to execute commands with elevated privileges, potential for further system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Job Configuration Modification logic (within the **Job DSL plugin**), Security Realm integration (as configured by the **Job DSL plugin**).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce the principle of least privilege when configuring job permissions and access controls within DSL scripts.
* Regularly review job configurations created or modified by DSL scripts for unauthorized changes.
* Implement auditing of changes made to job configurations via the **Job DSL plugin**.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on DSL Scripts](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_dsl_scripts.md)

**Description:** If the source of DSL scripts used by the **Job DSL plugin** (e.g., a Git repository) is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that are then deployed to Jenkins instances via the plugin.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of Jenkins instances using the affected DSL scripts, potentially leading to data breaches and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** DSL Script Loading mechanism (within the **Job DSL plugin**), potentially external repositories accessed by the plugin.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the repositories where DSL scripts are stored with strong authentication and access controls.
* Implement code signing or other mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of DSL scripts.
* Regularly scan repositories for vulnerabilities and malicious code.
* Follow secure software development lifecycle practices for managing DSL scripts.
