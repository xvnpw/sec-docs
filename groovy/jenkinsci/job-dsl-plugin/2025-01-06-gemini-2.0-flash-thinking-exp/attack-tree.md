## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Execute Arbitrary Code on Jenkins Master](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__execute_arbitrary_code_on_jenkins_master.md)

This is the most critical objective for an attacker. Successful execution of arbitrary code grants complete control over the Jenkins master, allowing for further compromise of connected systems and the application being built.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Inject Malicious Groovy Code in DSL Script ***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_groovy_code_in_dsl_script.md)

Attackers aim to insert malicious Groovy code directly into the DSL scripts that are processed by the Job DSL plugin. This code will then be executed by the Jenkins master.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Via User Input in Seed Job Configuration ***](./attack_tree_paths/via_user_input_in_seed_job_configuration.md)

If the configuration of a seed job allows for user-controlled input to be directly incorporated into the DSL script without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious Groovy code through this input. For example, using a job parameter directly within a `node` block or a shell command.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Via Compromised Source Control Repository ***](./attack_tree_paths/via_compromised_source_control_repository.md)

If the DSL scripts are stored in a version control system, compromising the repository allows attackers to directly modify the scripts and introduce malicious code. This requires gaining unauthorized access to the repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Leverage DSL Features for Code Execution ***](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_dsl_features_for_code_execution.md)

Instead of directly injecting malicious code, attackers can misuse legitimate features of the Job DSL to achieve code execution or other malicious goals.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Use `System.setProperty` to Modify System Settings ***](./attack_tree_paths/use__system_setproperty__to_modify_system_settings.md)

The DSL allows using `System.setProperty` to modify JVM system properties. Attackers can leverage this to alter the behavior of Jenkins or other plugins, potentially leading to vulnerabilities or enabling further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Execute External Commands via `sh`, `bat`, or `powershell` steps ***](./attack_tree_paths/execute_external_commands_via__sh____bat___or__powershell__steps.md)

The DSL provides steps to execute shell commands. If the input to these commands is not carefully sanitized, attackers can inject malicious commands that will be executed on the Jenkins master's operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Access and Manipulate Filesystem on Jenkins Master ***](./attack_tree_paths/access_and_manipulate_filesystem_on_jenkins_master.md)

The DSL can interact with the filesystem on the Jenkins master. Attackers can use this to read sensitive files, modify configurations, or drop malicious payloads onto the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Interact with Jenkins API with Elevated Privileges ***](./attack_tree_paths/interact_with_jenkins_api_with_elevated_privileges.md)

The DSL can interact with the Jenkins API. If a user with limited permissions can trigger the execution of a DSL script that operates with higher privileges, attackers can leverage this to perform actions they are normally not authorized to do.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit Vulnerabilities within the Job DSL Plugin Itself ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_job_dsl_plugin_itself.md)

Like any software, the Job DSL plugin may contain security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Leverage Known Security Vulnerabilities (CVEs) ***](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_security_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (identified by CVEs) in the Job DSL plugin if the plugin is not kept up-to-date. Exploit code for these vulnerabilities may be readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Modify or Delete Existing Jenkins Jobs](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__modify_or_delete_existing_jenkins_jobs.md)

Attackers may aim to disrupt the CI/CD process by altering the configuration of existing jobs or deleting critical jobs and pipelines.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Inject Malicious DSL to Alter Job Configuration ***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_dsl_to_alter_job_configuration.md)

By modifying DSL scripts, attackers can change the configuration of existing jobs. This could involve adding malicious build steps, altering notification settings, or changing deployment processes to compromise the application or infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Delete Critical Jobs or Pipelines ***](./attack_tree_paths/delete_critical_jobs_or_pipelines.md)

Attackers can modify DSL scripts to include commands that delete critical Jenkins jobs or entire pipelines, causing significant disruption to the development and deployment workflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exfiltrate Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exfiltrate_sensitive_information.md)

Attackers may target sensitive information stored within the Jenkins instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Access and Exfiltrate Jenkins Credentials ***](./attack_tree_paths/access_and_exfiltrate_jenkins_credentials.md)

Jenkins stores credentials for accessing various systems. If attackers can execute code on the master or manipulate job configurations, they can potentially access and exfiltrate these stored credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exfiltrate Build Artifacts or Logs ***](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_build_artifacts_or_logs.md)

Build artifacts and logs generated by Jenkins jobs may contain sensitive information about the application, infrastructure, or even secrets. Attackers can modify DSL scripts to access and exfiltrate these files.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exfiltrate Configuration Data ***](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_configuration_data.md)

Jenkins configuration files contain information about the Jenkins setup and connected systems. Attackers can leverage DSL capabilities to access and exfiltrate these files, potentially gaining insights into the infrastructure and identifying further attack vectors.
