# Attack Surface Analysis for jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted DSL Script Execution](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_dsl_script_execution.md)

**Description:**  The Job DSL plugin processes and executes Groovy-based scripts to generate Jenkins jobs. If these scripts originate from untrusted sources, they can contain malicious code.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin's core functionality is to interpret and execute these scripts, directly enabling this attack vector.

**Example:** A developer with malicious intent commits a DSL script to the shared repository that, when processed, creates a job that executes `rm -rf /` on build agents.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Jenkins master and potentially connected build agents, data loss, and disruption of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict access to modify DSL scripts: Implement strict access controls on the source of DSL scripts (e.g., SCM repositories, direct input forms).
*   Code review of DSL scripts: Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to DSL scripts before they are processed.
*   Principle of least privilege for seed jobs: Ensure the seed jobs that process DSL scripts run with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   Static analysis of DSL scripts: Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities or malicious patterns in DSL scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Job Generation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_job_generation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft DSL scripts that generate Jenkins jobs with malicious configurations or build steps.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin provides the mechanism to programmatically define and create jobs, allowing for the automated creation of malicious ones.

**Example:** A compromised account with permission to create/modify DSL scripts injects code to create a job that, when triggered, exfiltrates secrets from the Jenkins master to an external server.

**Impact:** Data breaches, credential compromise, unauthorized access to systems and resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly audit generated job configurations: Implement processes to review the configurations of jobs generated by the DSL plugin for suspicious activities.
*   Restrict permissions for DSL processing: Limit which users or systems can trigger the processing of DSL scripts.
*   Implement security scanning on generated jobs: Integrate security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to analyze newly generated jobs for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in DSL Scripts](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_dsl_scripts.md)

**Description:** Developers might inadvertently hardcode sensitive information (credentials, API keys) directly within DSL scripts.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin processes these scripts as plain text, making any embedded secrets readily accessible if the script source is compromised.

**Example:** A DSL script for creating deployment jobs includes the deployment server password directly in the script. This password is then visible to anyone with access to the script.

**Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to external systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Never hardcode secrets in DSL scripts: Utilize Jenkins' credential management system or other secure secret storage mechanisms.
*   Implement secret scanning on DSL scripts: Use tools to automatically scan DSL scripts for potential secrets before they are processed.
*   Secure storage and access control for DSL scripts: Protect the storage location of DSL scripts and restrict access to authorized personnel.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Job DSL Plugin Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_job_dsl_plugin_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software, the Job DSL plugin itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, cross-site scripting).

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin's code base is the source of these potential vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A discovered vulnerability in the plugin's DSL parsing logic allows an attacker to craft a specific DSL script that executes arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Jenkins master, potential for privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the Job DSL plugin up-to-date: Regularly update the plugin to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories: Stay informed about security vulnerabilities reported for the Job DSL plugin.
*   Consider using alternative job configuration methods if security concerns are high:** If the risks associated with the Job DSL plugin are deemed too high for a particular environment, explore alternative methods for managing Jenkins job configurations.
