## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Via User Input in Seed Job Configuration

This analysis delves into the specific attack path identified: "**Via User Input in Seed Job Configuration**" within the context of an application utilizing the Jenkins Job DSL Plugin. We will dissect the mechanics of this attack, its potential impact, mitigation strategies, and detection methods.

**Understanding the Context:**

The Jenkins Job DSL plugin allows users to programmatically generate Jenkins jobs using a Groovy-based Domain Specific Language (DSL). Seed jobs are special Jenkins jobs that execute these DSL scripts to create and manage other Jenkins jobs. This automation is powerful but introduces security considerations, especially when user-controlled input is involved.

**Attack Path Breakdown:**

The core vulnerability lies in the **lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input** that is directly incorporated into the DSL script executed by a seed job. This allows an attacker to inject malicious Groovy code, which will then be executed with the privileges of the Jenkins master process.

**Detailed Steps of the Attack:**

1. **Attacker Identifies a Target Seed Job:** The attacker needs to find a seed job whose configuration allows for user-provided input to be used within the DSL script. This input could come from:
    * **Job Parameters:** String parameters, choice parameters, etc., defined for the seed job.
    * **Environment Variables:** While less direct, if the seed job uses environment variables that are influenced by user input, this could also be a vector.
    * **Potentially other configuration fields:**  Depending on the seed job's logic, other configurable fields might be directly used in the DSL.

2. **Attacker Crafts Malicious Input:**  Knowing how the user input is incorporated into the DSL, the attacker crafts malicious Groovy code. The goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the Jenkins master. Common techniques include:
    * **System Command Execution:** Using Groovy's `execute()` method or the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method.
    * **File System Manipulation:** Reading, writing, or deleting files on the Jenkins master.
    * **Credential Harvesting:** Accessing Jenkins credentials stored on the master.
    * **Installing Malicious Plugins:**  Adding new plugins to further compromise the system.
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Establishing a reverse shell or connecting to a command and control server.

3. **Attacker Triggers the Seed Job with Malicious Input:** The attacker triggers the seed job, providing the crafted malicious input through the identified configuration mechanism (e.g., setting a job parameter).

4. **Malicious DSL is Executed:** When the seed job runs, the DSL script containing the injected malicious code is executed by the Job DSL plugin. Since the DSL is Groovy, the injected code will be interpreted and executed with the permissions of the Jenkins master process.

5. **Compromise of the Jenkins Master:** The malicious code executes, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Jenkins master. This allows the attacker to:
    * **Control all Jenkins jobs and configurations.**
    * **Access sensitive data and credentials.**
    * **Potentially pivot to other systems accessible from the Jenkins master.**
    * **Disrupt CI/CD pipelines.**

**Example Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1: Job Parameter in `node` block:**

   ```groovy
   job {
       name 'dynamic-node'
       parameters {
           stringParam('nodeLabel', '', 'Label for the node to run on')
       }
       steps {
           // Vulnerable code: Directly using the parameter in the node block
           node("${nodeLabel}") {
               shell('whoami')
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   **Attack:** An attacker could set the `nodeLabel` parameter to: `'; Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned");'`

   **Result:** When the seed job runs, the DSL becomes:

   ```groovy
   node('; Runtime.getRuntime().exec("touch /tmp/pwned");') {
       shell('whoami')
   }
   ```

   This would execute the `touch /tmp/pwned` command on the Jenkins master.

* **Scenario 2: Job Parameter in a `shell` command:**

   ```groovy
   job {
       name 'parameterized-shell'
       parameters {
           stringParam('command', '', 'Command to execute')
       }
       steps {
           shell("${command}")
       }
   }
   ```

   **Attack:** An attacker could set the `command` parameter to: `rm -rf /`

   **Result:** When the seed job runs, the DSL becomes:

   ```groovy
   shell("rm -rf /")
   ```

   This would attempt to delete all files on the Jenkins master.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker gains full control over the Jenkins master, the central hub of the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data, credentials, and build artifacts stored on the Jenkins master.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Injecting malicious code into build processes, potentially affecting downstream systems and users.
* **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the CI/CD pipeline, preventing builds and deployments.
* **Reputation Damage:**  Compromise of the build system can severely damage trust in the organization's software.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  This is the **most critical** mitigation. Never directly incorporate user-provided input into DSL scripts without proper validation and sanitization.
    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed values or patterns for user input.
    * **Escaping Special Characters:** Escape characters that have special meaning in Groovy or shell commands.
    * **Using Parameterized Builds Securely:**  When using parameters, ensure they are treated as data and not directly as code.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run Jenkins and seed jobs with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running the Jenkins master process as root.
* **Secure DSL Practices:**
    * **Avoid using user input directly in code execution blocks (`node`, `shell`, `steps`).**
    * **If user input is necessary, process it through safe functions or libraries.**
    * **Consider using pre-defined DSL methods that abstract away direct command execution.**
* **Code Reviews:**  Implement thorough code reviews for all seed job configurations and DSL scripts to identify potential injection vulnerabilities.
* **Security Audits:** Regularly audit Jenkins configurations and plugins for security weaknesses.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Restrict access to seed job configuration and execution to authorized personnel only.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing this attack, CSP can help mitigate the impact of some types of injected code by restricting the resources the browser can load.
* **Regularly Update Jenkins and Plugins:** Keep Jenkins and all installed plugins, including the Job DSL plugin, up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.

**Detection Methods:**

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor Jenkins logs for suspicious activity related to seed job execution, such as:
    * Unexpected commands being executed.
    * Errors during DSL script execution.
    * Changes to system files or configurations.
    * Unusual network connections originating from the Jenkins master.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage on the Jenkins master for anomalies that might indicate malicious activity (e.g., high CPU or memory usage).
* **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly compare current Jenkins configurations with known good configurations to detect unauthorized changes.
* **Security Scanners:** Utilize security scanning tools that can analyze Jenkins configurations and plugins for known vulnerabilities.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Implement FIM to detect unauthorized changes to critical files on the Jenkins master.
* **Behavioral Analysis:**  Establish a baseline of normal Jenkins behavior and alert on deviations that might indicate an attack.

**Severity and Likelihood:**

* **Severity:** **High**. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins master and potentially the entire CI/CD pipeline.
* **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**, depending on the security awareness and practices of the development team. If developers are not aware of the risks of injecting user input into DSL scripts, the likelihood is higher.

**Affected Components:**

* **Jenkins Job DSL Plugin:** The plugin itself is the mechanism through which the vulnerability is exploited.
* **Jenkins Master:** The target of the attack, where the malicious code is executed.
* **Seed Job Configuration:** The specific configuration of the seed job that allows for user input to be used in the DSL.

**Attacker Profile:**

* **Internal Threat:**  A malicious insider with access to Jenkins configuration.
* **External Threat:** An attacker who has gained unauthorized access to Jenkins through other vulnerabilities or compromised credentials.

**Conclusion:**

The "Via User Input in Seed Job Configuration" attack path highlights a critical security risk associated with the powerful automation capabilities of the Jenkins Job DSL plugin. Failing to properly sanitize user input when constructing DSL scripts can have severe consequences. Development teams must prioritize secure coding practices, implement robust input validation, and adopt a defense-in-depth approach to mitigate this significant threat. Regular security audits and proactive monitoring are crucial for detecting and responding to potential attacks.
