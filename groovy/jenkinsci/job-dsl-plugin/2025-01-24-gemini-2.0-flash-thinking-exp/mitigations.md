# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Access Control for DSL Script Creation and Modification](./mitigation_strategies/strict_access_control_for_dsl_script_creation_and_modification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Security Realm:** Ensure Jenkins is using a security realm (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, Jenkins internal database) to manage user authentication.
    2.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Utilize Jenkins' authorization matrix or a plugin like Role-Based Authorization Strategy. Define roles with specific permissions.
    3.  **Restrict DSL Script Permissions:**  Create dedicated roles (e.g., "DSL Admin," "DSL Developer") and grant them granular permissions related to Job DSL functionality. Limit who can create, modify, or execute DSL scripts.  Specifically control permissions like "Job - Create," "Job - Configure," "Job - Delete" for DSL-generated jobs and access to the script console if used for DSL development.
    4.  **Limit "Administer" Permission:**  Restrict the powerful "Administer" permission to only a minimal set of highly trusted administrators.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Permissions:** Periodically review user and role assignments related to Job DSL to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege and are still appropriate.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized DSL Script Modification/Creation (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized users from creating or altering Job DSL scripts, which could lead to malicious job configurations or Jenkins compromise.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration via DSL (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of unintentional errors in DSL scripts by limiting modification access to trained personnel.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via DSL (Severity: High):**  Prevents users from leveraging DSL script modification to escalate their privileges within Jenkins or connected systems.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized DSL Script Modification/Creation: High Reduction
    *   Accidental Misconfiguration via DSL: Medium Reduction
    *   Privilege Escalation via DSL: High Reduction

    *   **Lack of Traceability and Rollback for DSL Changes (Severity: Medium):** Version control provides a history of DSL script changes, enabling traceability and the ability to rollback to previous versions if needed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Introduction of Vulnerabilities in DSL Scripts: High Reduction

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege within DSL Scripts](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_within_dsl_scripts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Permissions in DSL:** When writing DSL scripts, only request the minimum necessary Jenkins permissions required for the script's intended functionality.
    2.  **Avoid Wildcard Permissions:**  Avoid using broad wildcard permissions (e.g., `Job.*`, `Item.*`) in DSL scripts. Grant specific permissions for the exact actions needed (e.g., `Job.CREATE`, `Item.CONFIGURE`).
    3.  **Scope Permissions (If Possible):** If feasible, scope permissions within DSL scripts to specific folders or job types rather than granting global permissions.
    4.  **Review Script Permissions During Code Review:**  Explicitly verify during code review that DSL scripts only request necessary permissions and adhere to the principle of least privilege.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Job DSL Plugin Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Ensures that known security vulnerabilities within the Job DSL Plugin are patched promptly, reducing the risk of exploitation.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Job DSL Plugin (Severity: Medium):** While updates primarily address known vulnerabilities, staying up-to-date reduces the overall attack surface of the Job DSL Plugin and may indirectly mitigate some zero-day risks.

    6.  **Regular Review of DSL Script Approvals:** Periodically review the list of approved DSL scripts and methods to ensure they remain necessary and do not introduce new security risks.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via DSL (Severity: High):** Significantly reduces the risk of RCE vulnerabilities through DSL scripts by sandboxing their execution and requiring approval for potentially unsafe operations.
    *   **Information Disclosure via DSL (Severity: Medium):** Limits the ability of DSL scripts to access and disclose sensitive information within Jenkins or connected systems by restricting their capabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unsafe DSL Script Execution: High Reduction
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) via DSL: High Reduction

    3.  **Implement DSL Input Validation:** Implement input validation logic within DSL scripts to check if input data conforms to the defined rules *before* using it to generate job configurations.
    4.  **Sanitize DSL Input:** Sanitize input data within DSL scripts to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or code *before* using it in job configurations, especially if the input is used in job names, descriptions, or script commands.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities in DSL-Generated Jobs (Severity: High):** Prevents injection attacks (e.g., command injection, script injection) in jobs generated by DSL scripts that process unsanitized external input.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in DSL-Generated Jobs (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in Jenkins UI elements of jobs generated by DSL scripts if user-controlled input is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious DSL Input (Severity: Medium):** Prevents malicious input from causing DSL scripts to generate resource-intensive or crashing job configurations, leading to DoS.
