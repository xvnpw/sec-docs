# Attack Surface Analysis for jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution via DSL Script](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_via_dsl_script.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject or modify DSL scripts to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The core functionality of the plugin is to interpret and execute Groovy code defined in DSL scripts. This provides a direct pathway for code execution if the source of the DSL is compromised or if input validation is lacking.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the Git repository where DSL scripts are stored and modifies a script to execute a reverse shell command on the Jenkins master.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins master, including access to secrets, build artifacts, and the ability to control connected agents.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to DSL script sources.
* Code review for DSL scripts.
* Principle of least privilege.
* Secure SCM practices.
* Consider a dedicated, restricted environment for DSL execution testing.

## Attack Surface: [Sandbox Escape](./attack_surfaces/sandbox_escape.md)

**Description:** Attackers can find vulnerabilities in the Groovy sandbox implementation used by the Job DSL plugin to bypass restrictions and execute arbitrary code.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin relies on a sandbox to limit the capabilities of the executed Groovy code. If this sandbox is flawed, attackers can escape it.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a DSL script that exploits a known sandbox escape vulnerability in the Groovy version used by the plugin to execute system commands.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins master, similar to arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the Job DSL plugin updated.
* Monitor for known sandbox escape vulnerabilities.
* Consider alternative approaches if sandbox security is a major concern.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious DSL](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_dsl.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft DSL scripts that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space) on the Jenkins master, leading to denial of service.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin executes the provided DSL, and poorly written or malicious scripts can create infinite loops, allocate excessive memory, or perform other resource-intensive operations.

**Example:** An attacker submits a DSL script that creates a very large number of jobs or performs an infinite loop, causing the Jenkins master to become unresponsive.

**Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the ability to run builds and manage the Jenkins instance.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement resource limits for Jenkins processes.
* Monitor Jenkins master resource usage.
* Implement timeouts for DSL script execution.
* Code review for performance implications.

## Attack Surface: [Access to Sensitive Jenkins APIs](./attack_surfaces/access_to_sensitive_jenkins_apis.md)

**Description:** Attackers can leverage the DSL's access to Jenkins internal APIs to perform unauthorized actions.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** The DSL provides access to Jenkins APIs, allowing programmatic interaction with various Jenkins functionalities. If a malicious actor can control the DSL, they can abuse these APIs.

**Example:** An attacker injects DSL code that uses the Jenkins API to modify user permissions, create administrative accounts, or access sensitive configuration data.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data breaches, unauthorized modification of Jenkins configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to DSL modification.
* Principle of least privilege for DSL execution.
* Regularly audit API usage within DSL scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Seed Job Compromise](./attack_surfaces/seed_job_compromise.md)

**Description:** Attackers can compromise seed jobs to generate or modify other jobs with malicious configurations.

**How Job-DSL-Plugin Contributes:** Seed jobs are a specific feature of the plugin that allows generating other jobs programmatically. Compromising a seed job has a cascading effect.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a seed job to create new jobs that execute malicious code on build agents or exfiltrate data.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of jobs and potentially connected systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure seed job definitions.
* Monitor changes to seed jobs.
* Review the permissions of seed jobs.
