## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Job DSL Plugin [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_job_dsl_plugin__critical_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved unauthorized control over the Jenkins instance or the systems it manages through exploiting the Job DSL plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Arbitrary Code Execution [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_arbitrary_code_execution__critical___high-risk_path_.md)

This is a critical node because it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Jenkins master or agents, granting them significant control. It's a high-risk path because it's a direct and impactful way to compromise the application, and there are multiple likely ways to achieve it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Groovy Code in DSL Script [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_groovy_code_in_dsl_script__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector involves inserting malicious Groovy code into the DSL scripts that are processed by the Job DSL plugin. This code, when executed, can perform various malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly in Seed Job Definition [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/directly_in_seed_job_definition__high-risk_path_.md)

An attacker with sufficient permissions to create or modify seed jobs can directly embed malicious Groovy code within the definition of these jobs. When the seed job runs, this malicious code will be executed, potentially creating or modifying other jobs in a harmful way.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via External DSL Script Source [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/via_external_dsl_script_source__high-risk_path_.md)

If the Job DSL plugin is configured to fetch DSL scripts from an external source (like a Git repository), an attacker can compromise this source to inject malicious code into the scripts. When Jenkins fetches and processes these compromised scripts, the malicious code will be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Source Repository (e.g., Git) [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_source_repository__e_g___git___critical___high-risk_path_.md)

This is a critical node because compromising the source repository can have widespread impact, potentially affecting multiple Jenkins instances that rely on those scripts. It's a high-risk path because it's a common target for attackers and can lead to the injection of malicious code into multiple systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Unsafe DSL Methods or Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_unsafe_dsl_methods_or_features__high-risk_path_.md)

The Groovy environment provides access to powerful methods. If the Job DSL plugin does not properly restrict access to potentially dangerous methods, attackers can directly use these methods within their DSL scripts to perform malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Methods Allowing System Calls (e.g., `execute()`) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_methods_allowing_system_calls__e_g____execute______high-risk_path_.md)

Methods like `execute()` allow the execution of arbitrary system commands on the Jenkins server. If an attacker can use these methods within a DSL script, they can directly control the underlying operating system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Jenkins Configuration and Resources [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_jenkins_configuration_and_resources__critical_.md)

This is a critical node because even without achieving direct code execution, an attacker can leverage the Job DSL plugin to manipulate Jenkins' configuration and resources for malicious purposes, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or compromise of downstream systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing Job Configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_job_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers with permissions to modify existing job configurations can inject malicious elements into these configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Build Steps [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_build_steps__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can add malicious build steps to existing jobs. These build steps can execute arbitrary commands, download malware, exfiltrate data, or perform other harmful actions when the job is executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create New Malicious Jobs [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/create_new_malicious_jobs__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers with permissions to create new jobs can define jobs specifically designed for malicious purposes. These jobs could contain backdoors, data exfiltration mechanisms, or be used to launch further attacks.
