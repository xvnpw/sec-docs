# Threat Model Analysis for jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious DSL Script](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_malicious_dsl_script.md)

**Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious DSL Script

*   **Description:** An attacker with permission to create or modify Job DSL scripts injects malicious Groovy code within the script. When the DSL script is processed by the **Job DSL plugin's execution engine**, this code is executed within the Jenkins master process. The attacker might use this to execute system commands, access files, or manipulate Jenkins internals.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins master, allowing the attacker to steal credentials, modify configurations, install backdoors, or pivot to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** DSL execution engine (specifically the Groovy interpreter used by the **Job DSL plugin**).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access control for who can create and modify Job DSL scripts.
    *   Enforce code reviews for all changes to DSL scripts.
    *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization for DSL script execution (though this can be complex with Groovy).
    *   Regularly audit DSL scripts for suspicious code patterns.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Job Creation/Modification](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_job_creationmodification.md)

**Threat:** Privilege Escalation through Job Creation/Modification

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages the **Job DSL plugin** to create or modify Jenkins jobs with elevated privileges or permissions that they would not normally possess. This could involve assigning powerful roles to newly created jobs or modifying the security settings of existing jobs through the **plugin's job creation and update logic**.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains access to sensitive resources or functionalities within Jenkins, potentially allowing them to view restricted information, trigger unauthorized builds, or further compromise the system.
*   **Affected Component:** Job creation and update logic within the **Job DSL plugin**, interaction with Jenkins security realm *through the plugin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when defining jobs via DSL.
    *   Implement checks and validations within DSL scripts to prevent the assignment of overly permissive roles.
    *   Regularly review the permissions of jobs created or modified by DSL scripts.
    *   Consider using a "seed job" approach where a tightly controlled job generates other jobs, limiting the scope of direct DSL script manipulation.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in DSL Scripts](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_dsl_scripts.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in DSL Scripts

*   **Description:** Developers inadvertently or intentionally embed sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, or internal URLs, directly within the Job DSL scripts. An attacker with access to these scripts (managed and processed by the **Job DSL plugin**) can then extract this information.
*   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive credentials or information, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external systems or services, or further compromise of the Jenkins environment.
*   **Affected Component:** DSL script storage and retrieval mechanisms *as handled by the plugin*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandate the use of Jenkins credential management features instead of hardcoding secrets in DSL scripts.
    *   Implement static analysis tools to scan DSL scripts for potential secrets.
    *   Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks of embedding secrets.
    *   Control access to the Jenkins master file system where DSL scripts might be stored.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Job DSL Plugin Itself](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_the_job_dsl_plugin_itself.md)

**Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Job DSL Plugin Itself

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities may exist within the **Job DSL plugin's** code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control over Jenkins.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the **Job DSL plugin codebase**.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the **Job DSL plugin** updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories related to Jenkins and its plugins.
    *   Follow best practices for plugin management and security.
