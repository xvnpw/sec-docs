# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Jenkins Job DSL Plugin addresses the business need for efficient and consistent management of Jenkins jobs. Instead of manually creating and configuring jobs through the Jenkins UI, which is time-consuming and error-prone, the plugin allows users to define jobs as code using a Groovy-based DSL (Domain Specific Language). This approach enables automation, version control, and repeatability in job configuration, aligning with DevOps best practices and infrastructure-as-code principles.

Business priorities and goals:
- Automate Jenkins job creation and management to reduce manual effort.
- Ensure consistency and standardization across Jenkins job configurations.
- Improve efficiency and speed of setting up and modifying CI/CD pipelines.
- Enable version control of Jenkins job configurations for auditability and rollback capabilities.
- Promote infrastructure-as-code practices within the organization's CI/CD environment.

Most important business risks:
- Risk of misconfiguration: Incorrectly written DSL scripts can lead to misconfigured Jenkins jobs, potentially causing build failures, deployment issues, or security vulnerabilities in the deployed applications.
- Risk of unauthorized access and modification: If not properly secured, the Job DSL plugin could be used by unauthorized users to create or modify Jenkins jobs, potentially disrupting CI/CD pipelines or gaining unauthorized access to systems.
- Risk of supply chain vulnerabilities: Dependencies of the Job DSL plugin or vulnerabilities within the plugin itself could introduce security risks into the Jenkins environment and the CI/CD pipeline.
- Risk of operational disruption: Issues with the Job DSL plugin, such as bugs or performance problems, could disrupt the automated job creation and management process, impacting the overall CI/CD pipeline availability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Jenkins security model: Jenkins provides a comprehensive security model for authentication, authorization, and access control. This is documented within Jenkins official documentation.
- security control: Plugin security reviews: Jenkins plugins undergo community reviews, and some may have undergone more formal security audits, although the extent and depth of these reviews can vary. Information about plugin security is generally available on the Jenkins plugin website and community forums.
- security control: Jenkins Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Jenkins allows administrators to define roles and permissions, controlling user access to jobs, nodes, and other Jenkins resources. This is configured within Jenkins security settings.
- accepted risk: Plugin vulnerabilities: As with any software, Jenkins plugins, including the Job DSL plugin, may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Mitigation relies on timely updates and security patching.
- accepted risk: Misconfiguration by users: Users with sufficient permissions might misconfigure jobs or DSL scripts, leading to security weaknesses or operational issues. User training and best practices are essential mitigations.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Input validation for DSL scripts: Implement robust input validation within the Job DSL plugin to prevent injection attacks and ensure that DSL scripts adhere to expected formats and constraints.
- recommended security control: Secure defaults for job configurations: Encourage or enforce secure default settings for jobs created via DSL, such as enabling security plugins, configuring proper authentication and authorization, and limiting access to sensitive resources.
- recommended security control: Least privilege principle for DSL script execution: Ensure that DSL scripts execute with the minimum necessary privileges to perform their intended tasks, reducing the potential impact of compromised scripts.
- recommended security control: Static analysis of DSL scripts: Integrate static analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan DSL scripts for potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations before they are applied to Jenkins.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The Job DSL plugin should leverage Jenkins' existing authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated users can create, modify, or execute DSL scripts.
    - Requirement: Access to DSL script management and execution should be controlled based on user roles and permissions defined within Jenkins.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: The Job DSL plugin must enforce Jenkins' authorization model to control who can create, update, delete, or view DSL scripts and the jobs they generate.
    - Requirement: Granular permissions should be available to control access to specific DSL script functionalities and resources.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The Job DSL plugin must validate all inputs from DSL scripts to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, script injection).
    - Requirement: Validation should include checks for data type, format, and allowed values to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If DSL scripts handle sensitive data (e.g., credentials, API keys), the Job DSL plugin should provide mechanisms for securely storing and managing this data, potentially using Jenkins' credential management system or encryption features.
    - Requirement: When transmitting sensitive data within DSL scripts or during job execution, encryption should be used to protect confidentiality and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Automation of Jenkins job configuration and management, which is a key part of the CI/CD pipeline. Disruption or compromise of this process can lead to delays in software delivery, inconsistencies in deployments, and potential security vulnerabilities in deployed applications due to misconfigurations.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Job DSL scripts: These scripts contain the configuration of Jenkins jobs, including build steps, deployment procedures, and potentially sensitive information like credentials or API keys. Sensitivity: Confidentiality and Integrity. Unauthorized access could reveal sensitive information or allow malicious modification of job configurations.
- Jenkins job configurations (generated from DSL scripts): These configurations, stored within Jenkins, also contain sensitive information and define the behavior of CI/CD pipelines. Sensitivity: Confidentiality and Integrity.
- Credentials and secrets managed within Jenkins and potentially used in DSL scripts: These are highly sensitive and critical for accessing external systems and deploying applications. Sensitivity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Compromise of these credentials can lead to unauthorized access to critical systems.
- Build artifacts and logs generated by Jenkins jobs defined by DSL scripts: These may contain sensitive information depending on the nature of the jobs and the applications being built. Sensitivity: Confidentiality and Integrity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the target environment for Jenkins and the Job DSL Plugin? (e.g., cloud, on-premises, hybrid). This will influence deployment and infrastructure security considerations.
- What is the organization's overall security posture and risk appetite? (e.g., startup vs. Fortune 500). This will help prioritize security controls and recommendations.
- Are there specific compliance requirements that need to be considered (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)? This might introduce additional security requirements.
- What is the expected user base and their roles and responsibilities regarding Jenkins and Job DSL? This will help define appropriate access control and authorization policies.
- Are there existing security tools and processes in place within the organization's CI/CD pipeline? This will help integrate recommended security controls with existing infrastructure.

Assumptions:
- The Job DSL Plugin is intended to be used in a typical Jenkins environment for automating CI/CD pipelines.
- Security is a relevant concern for the users of the Job DSL Plugin, and they are looking to improve the security posture of their Jenkins setup.
- The organization using the plugin has a basic understanding of Jenkins security concepts and best practices.
- DSL scripts are stored in version control systems and are subject to code review processes.
- Jenkins is configured with authentication and authorization enabled.
