## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize DSL Scripts and Validate Inputs in Job DSL](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_dsl_scripts_and_validate_inputs_in_job_dsl.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Inputs in DSL:** Analyze your Job DSL scripts to pinpoint where dynamic inputs are used (e.g., job names, repository URLs, branch names, parameters passed to jobs).
    2.  **Parameterize using Job DSL Features:**  Utilize Job DSL's built-in parameterization capabilities. Instead of hardcoding values, use variables or parameters within your DSL scripts.
    3.  **Implement Input Validation within DSL Script (Groovy):**  Within the Groovy code of your DSL script, add validation logic for each parameter *before* using it to define jobs or configurations.
        *   **Type Checking (Groovy):** Use Groovy's type checking to ensure parameters are of the expected type (e.g., `parameter instanceof String`).
        *   **Format Validation (Groovy/Regex):** Employ Groovy and regular expressions to validate string formats (e.g., URL format, valid branch name patterns).
        *   **Range Validation (Groovy):** For numerical parameters, use Groovy to check if they fall within acceptable ranges.
        *   **Sanitization (Groovy):** Sanitize inputs using Groovy methods to prevent injection attacks (e.g., escaping special characters if constructing shell commands within DSL).
    4.  **Handle Validation Errors in DSL:**  Use Groovy's error handling mechanisms (e.g., `try-catch` blocks, conditional statements) within your DSL script to manage validation failures gracefully. Prevent job creation or DSL script execution if validation fails and log informative error messages.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Command Injection, Script Injection) via DSL Parameters (High Severity):**  If DSL scripts directly use unsanitized parameters in commands or scripts they generate, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities when processing user-provided or external data.
    *   **Unexpected Job Configuration due to Invalid DSL Input (Medium Severity):** Invalid input to DSL scripts can result in jobs being configured incorrectly or failing to be created as intended.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via DSL Parameters:** Risk reduced significantly. Input validation within DSL scripts directly addresses the threat of injection vulnerabilities arising from dynamic parameters used by the plugin.
    *   **Unexpected Job Configuration due to Invalid DSL Input:** Risk reduced. Validation improves the reliability and predictability of job creation and configuration through Job DSL by ensuring data integrity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some DSL scripts use parameters, but robust input validation *within the DSL script itself* using Groovy is not consistently applied.
    *   *Location:* Within individual Job DSL scripts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Systematically review all Job DSL scripts and implement comprehensive input validation directly within the Groovy code of the scripts for all dynamic parameters. Create reusable Groovy validation functions for common input patterns to promote consistency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Jenkins Credentials Plugin with Job DSL](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_jenkins_credentials_plugin_with_job_dsl.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets in DSL Scripts:** Review your Job DSL scripts to find any instances where secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens, etc.) might be hardcoded or directly embedded as strings.
    2.  **Migrate Secrets to Jenkins Credentials:** Remove any hardcoded secrets from your Job DSL scripts.
    3.  **Create Jenkins Credentials:** Use the Jenkins Credentials Plugin (within Jenkins UI) to create appropriate credential types (e.g., "Secret text," "Username with password") for each secret required by your jobs defined in DSL. Assign unique and descriptive IDs to these credentials.
    4.  **Reference Credentials in DSL using `credentials()`:** In your Job DSL scripts, replace the hardcoded secrets with calls to the `credentials()` method provided by the Job DSL plugin. Reference the credentials by their IDs that you defined in Jenkins.  For example: `steps { shell("echo ${credentials('my-api-key')}") }`
    5.  **Avoid Direct Secret Manipulation in DSL:**  Ensure your DSL scripts only *reference* credentials via the `credentials()` method and do not attempt to directly manipulate or store secret values within the DSL code itself.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Job DSL Scripts (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets directly in Job DSL scripts makes them vulnerable to exposure through version control, Jenkins configuration exports, or if DSL scripts are inadvertently shared or accessed without proper authorization.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Infrastructure-as-Code (High Severity):**  Storing credentials directly in code violates security best practices for infrastructure-as-code and significantly increases the risk of credential compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Job DSL Scripts:** Risk reduced significantly. Using Jenkins Credentials Plugin with Job DSL eliminates the practice of hardcoding secrets in scripts, centralizing secret management and reducing exposure.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Infrastructure-as-Code:** Risk reduced significantly. Adheres to security best practices for managing secrets in infrastructure-as-code, improving overall security posture.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Jenkins Credentials Plugin is used for some secrets, but there might be inconsistencies in its application across all Job DSL scripts. Older scripts might still have hardcoded secrets or less secure secret handling methods.
    *   *Location:* Job DSL scripts, Jenkins Credentials Management.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of all Job DSL scripts to identify and eliminate any remaining hardcoded secrets. Enforce the consistent use of Jenkins Credentials Plugin and the `credentials()` method in all DSL scripts for managing secrets. Establish guidelines and code review practices to prevent future hardcoding of secrets in DSL.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Jenkins Script Security Settings for Job DSL](./mitigation_strategies/configure_jenkins_script_security_settings_for_job_dsl.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Install Script Security Plugin (if not already installed):** Ensure the Jenkins Script Security Plugin is installed and enabled in your Jenkins instance. This plugin provides fine-grained control over script execution permissions.
    2.  **Review Script Security Settings:** Access Jenkins' "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure Global Security" -> "Script Security" section (or similar, depending on Jenkins version and plugins).
    3.  **Configure Script Approval for DSL Scripts:**  The Script Security Plugin often requires script approvals for Groovy scripts.  When using Job DSL, ensure that the "Groovy Script" and potentially "Method Calls" and "Field Access" script approval mechanisms are configured appropriately.
        *   **Initial Script Approvals:** When you first run seed jobs with new or modified DSL scripts, you might encounter "Pending script approvals."  Review these pending approvals carefully.
        *   **Approve Safe Scripts:** Approve only those scripts and method calls that are necessary and safe for your Job DSL scripts to function. Be cautious about approving overly permissive scripts.
        *   **Minimize Script Permissions:** Strive to write Job DSL scripts that require minimal permissions. Avoid using powerful or potentially dangerous Groovy methods or APIs unless absolutely necessary.
    4.  **Consider Using a Sandbox (if applicable and needed):**  The Script Security Plugin might offer sandboxing options. Explore if sandboxing can further restrict the capabilities of Job DSL scripts, limiting their access to Jenkins APIs and system resources. However, sandboxing might impact the functionality of some DSL features, so test thoroughly.
    5.  **Regularly Review Script Approvals:** Periodically review the list of approved scripts and method signatures in Jenkins Script Security settings. Remove any approvals that are no longer needed or represent unnecessary permissions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Script Execution Vulnerabilities in DSL Scripts (High Severity):**  If Job DSL scripts are allowed to execute arbitrary or unrestricted Groovy code, it can create opportunities for script execution vulnerabilities, potentially leading to remote code execution or unauthorized access to Jenkins resources.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via DSL Scripts (High Severity):**  Unrestricted script execution in DSL scripts could be exploited to escalate privileges within Jenkins or the underlying system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Script Execution Vulnerabilities in DSL Scripts:** Risk reduced significantly. Script Security Plugin and script approvals act as a critical control to prevent malicious or vulnerable Groovy code from being executed by Job DSL.
    *   **Privilege Escalation via DSL Scripts:** Risk reduced significantly. Limiting script capabilities through security settings and approvals helps prevent privilege escalation attacks originating from DSL scripts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Script Security Plugin is installed, but the script approval process for Job DSL scripts might not be rigorously enforced or reviewed.  Script permissions might be overly permissive.
    *   *Location:* Jenkins Global Security Configuration, Script Security Plugin settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a strict script approval workflow for all Job DSL script changes.  Regularly review and refine script approvals to minimize permissions granted to DSL scripts.  Explore sandboxing options if appropriate for your environment and DSL usage patterns.  Educate developers on writing secure and least-privileged Job DSL scripts.
