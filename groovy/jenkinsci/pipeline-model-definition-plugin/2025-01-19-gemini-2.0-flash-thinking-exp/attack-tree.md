## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Pipeline Model Definition Plugin (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_pipeline_model_definition_plugin__critical_node_.md)

**Compromise Application via Pipeline Model Definition Plugin:**
* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or access to the application or its underlying infrastructure through vulnerabilities in the plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Jenkins Controller/Agent (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_jenkins_controlleragent__high-risk_path_.md)

**Execute Arbitrary Code on Jenkins Controller/Agent:**
* This path represents the most severe threat. Successful execution allows the attacker to run any code on the Jenkins master or agent, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or further attacks on connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Pipeline Definition Parsing/Interpretation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_pipeline_definition_parsinginterpretation__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit Vulnerability in Pipeline Definition Parsing/Interpretation:**
* Attackers aim to find flaws in how the plugin parses and interprets the declarative pipeline syntax. Successfully exploiting these vulnerabilities can allow them to inject malicious code that gets executed by Jenkins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Scripting (e.g., Groovy) via Declarative Syntax (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_scripting__e_g___groovy__via_declarative_syntax__high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious Scripting (e.g., Groovy) via Declarative Syntax:**
* Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the plugin's parsing logic to inject malicious Groovy code within the seemingly declarative syntax. This injected code is then executed by Jenkins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Plugin Functionality for Malicious Purposes (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_plugin_functionality_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse `script` Step with Insufficient Security Context (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse__script__step_with_insufficient_security_context__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

**Abuse `script` Step with Insufficient Security Context:**
* The `script` step allows embedding arbitrary Groovy code. If the Jenkins environment doesn't enforce strict security measures (like sandboxing or restricted permissions), attackers can directly execute malicious code with the privileges of the Jenkins user.

**Abuse `script` Step with Insufficient Security Context:** (Also a Critical Node)
* As described above, this is a direct route to code execution if the `script` step is not properly secured.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Execution of External Commands with Malicious Arguments (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_execution_of_external_commands_with_malicious_arguments__high-risk_path_.md)

**Trigger Execution of External Commands with Malicious Arguments:**
* If the plugin provides functionality to execute external commands, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in how command arguments are constructed (e.g., lack of proper escaping) to inject malicious commands that are then executed by the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_sensitive_information__high-risk_path_.md)

**Gain Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:**
* This path focuses on obtaining confidential data managed by Jenkins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Plugin to Access Jenkins Secrets or Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_plugin_to_access_jenkins_secrets_or_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Credential Masking or Protection Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_credential_masking_or_protection_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

**Bypass Credential Masking or Protection Mechanisms:**
* Jenkins stores credentials securely. Attackers targeting this node aim to find vulnerabilities in the plugin's handling of credentials that would allow them to bypass masking or encryption and retrieve the plaintext credentials.

**Bypass Credential Masking or Protection Mechanisms:** (Also a Critical Node)
* As described above, this leads to direct access to stored credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure through Plugin Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_through_plugin_functionality.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Data in Pipeline Logs or Output (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_data_in_pipeline_logs_or_output__high-risk_path_.md)

**Expose Sensitive Data in Pipeline Logs or Output:**
* Developers might inadvertently log sensitive information (like credentials, API keys, or internal system details) during pipeline execution. Attackers can then access these logs to retrieve the sensitive data.
