# Threat Model Analysis for jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin

## Threat: [Malicious Jenkinsfile Injection](./threats/malicious_jenkinsfile_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the source code repository containing the `Jenkinsfile` modifies it to include malicious code. The **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin** parses this `Jenkinsfile` to define the pipeline structure, and the malicious code will then be executed by the Jenkins agent during pipeline execution orchestrated by the plugin.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins agent, potentially leading to data exfiltration, credential theft, system compromise, or denial of service on the agent. It could also be used to pivot to other systems accessible from the agent.

**Affected Component:** Jenkinsfile parser (part of the **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin**), Pipeline execution engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls on the source code repository.
* Enforce code review processes for all `Jenkinsfile` changes.
* Consider using branch protection rules to prevent direct commits to critical branches.
* Utilize static analysis tools to scan `Jenkinsfile` for potential security issues.
* Implement pipeline approvals for changes to critical pipelines.

## Threat: [Exploiting Unsafe Scripting Practices within Pipelines](./threats/exploiting_unsafe_scripting_practices_within_pipelines.md)

**Description:** Pipeline developers write Groovy scripts within the `script` blocks of the declarative pipeline defined by the **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin**, or use shell steps, that are vulnerable to injection attacks. This could involve processing untrusted input without proper sanitization, leading to command injection or other vulnerabilities during pipeline execution managed by the plugin.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the Jenkins agent, potentially leading to data exfiltration, credential theft, system compromise, or denial of service on the agent.

**Affected Component:** Script execution engine (Groovy) within the **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin**, Shell step execution

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Provide security training to pipeline developers on secure scripting practices.
* Enforce input validation and sanitization for all external inputs used in scripts.
* Utilize parameterized builds with caution and validate parameters.
* Consider using safer alternatives to shell scripting where possible.
* Implement static analysis tools to scan pipeline scripts for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Abuse of Shared Libraries for Malicious Code Injection](./threats/abuse_of_shared_libraries_for_malicious_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to shared libraries, which are integrated into pipelines defined by the **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin**, modifies them to include malicious code. This code will then be executed by any pipeline that utilizes the compromised shared library when the plugin orchestrates its execution.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of pipelines using the affected shared library, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on multiple agents and the Jenkins master.

**Affected Component:** Shared library loading mechanism within Jenkins, integrated with the **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin**

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls for managing shared libraries.
* Enforce code review processes for all changes to shared libraries.
* Consider signing shared libraries to ensure their integrity.
* Regularly audit the content of shared libraries.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Pipeline Steps or Plugins](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_pipeline_steps_or_plugins.md)

**Description:** The declarative pipeline, defined and managed by the **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin**, relies on various steps provided by Jenkins plugins. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these underlying plugins through the pipeline definition, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions during pipeline execution.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the plugin being used, but could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins master or agent.

**Affected Component:** Plugin integration within the **Pipeline Model Definition Plugin**, Specific vulnerable plugin

**Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep all Jenkins plugins up-to-date.
* Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in used plugins.
* Consider using a plugin vulnerability scanner.
* Avoid using plugins with known critical vulnerabilities if alternatives exist.
