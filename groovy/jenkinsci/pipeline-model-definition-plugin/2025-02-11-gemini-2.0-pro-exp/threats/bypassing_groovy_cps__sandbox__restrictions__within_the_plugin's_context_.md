# Deep Analysis: Bypassing Groovy CPS Restrictions in `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify potential vulnerabilities within the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` that could allow an attacker to bypass the Groovy CPS (Continuable-Programmable Scripting) sandbox restrictions and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master or agent.  This analysis focuses on *how the plugin itself interacts with and configures the CPS sandbox*, rather than general Jenkins or Groovy vulnerabilities.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis will focus on the following areas:

*   **Plugin Code Review:**  Examining the source code of the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` (available on GitHub) for potentially unsafe interactions with the `CpsGroovyShell`.  This includes:
    *   How the plugin configures the `CpsGroovyShell`.
    *   How the plugin processes user-provided input (e.g., Declarative Pipeline syntax) before passing it to the Groovy interpreter.
    *   Specific attention to the `Converter` class and related parsing logic.
    *   Any custom classes or methods within the plugin that interact with CPS.
*   **Known Vulnerability Research:**  Investigating publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) and security advisories related to the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` and Groovy CPS bypasses.  This includes searching the Jenkins security advisories, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and security research publications.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Identifying dependencies of the plugin and assessing their security posture, particularly those related to Groovy scripting or CPS.
*   **Interaction with Other Plugins:** Considering how the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` might interact with other commonly used plugins, and whether those interactions could introduce vulnerabilities.  This is a secondary focus, as the primary concern is the plugin's *internal* handling of CPS.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Static Code Analysis (SAST):**  Manual code review, supplemented by automated SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, FindSecBugs, Semgrep) configured to detect Groovy-specific and CPS-related vulnerabilities.  The focus will be on identifying:
    *   Unsafe deserialization.
    *   Reflection usage that could bypass sandbox restrictions.
    *   Improper handling of user input that could lead to code injection.
    *   Use of deprecated or known-vulnerable Groovy features.
    *   Incorrect configuration of the `CpsGroovyShell` (e.g., disabling security features).
    *   Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic (e.g., in the `Converter` class).

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):**  While a full penetration test is outside the scope of this *analysis document*, we will outline potential DAST approaches that could be used to *test* for CPS bypasses. This includes:
    *   Fuzzing the plugin with malformed Declarative Pipeline definitions.
    *   Attempting to inject known Groovy sandbox escape payloads.
    *   Monitoring the Jenkins master and agent for unexpected behavior during testing.

3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Systematic review of vulnerability databases and security advisories, as described in the Scope section.

4.  **Dependency Analysis:** Using tools like `mvn dependency:tree` (if applicable) or manual inspection of the `pom.xml` file to identify dependencies and their versions.  Cross-referencing these dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Potential Vulnerability Areas (Based on Code Review and Common Patterns)

Based on the understanding of Groovy CPS and common vulnerability patterns, the following areas within the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` are of particular concern:

*   **`Converter` Class and Parsing Logic:** The `org.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.modeldefinition.parser.Converter` class is responsible for parsing the Declarative Pipeline syntax.  Any vulnerabilities in this parsing process could be exploited to inject malicious code that bypasses the sandbox.  Specific concerns include:
    *   **Input Validation:**  Insufficient validation of user-provided input (e.g., stage names, script blocks, environment variables) could allow attackers to inject malicious Groovy code.
    *   **Regular Expression Vulnerabilities:**  If regular expressions are used for parsing, they could be vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks, or crafted to bypass intended validation.
    *   **Recursive Parsing:**  Deeply nested or recursive structures in the Declarative Pipeline could potentially lead to stack overflow errors or other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** If the parser deserializes any data from the Pipeline definition, this could be a major vulnerability point.

*   **`CpsGroovyShell` Configuration:**  The way the plugin configures the `CpsGroovyShell` is crucial.  Incorrect configuration could disable security features or introduce vulnerabilities.  Specific concerns include:
    *   **`SecureASTCustomizer`:**  Ensuring that the `SecureASTCustomizer` is properly configured and that no methods are accidentally allowed that should be blocked.
    *   **`ImportCustomizer`:**  Carefully reviewing the allowed imports to prevent access to dangerous classes or methods.
    *   **`CompilationCustomizer`:**  Examining any custom compilation customizations for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Classloader Configuration:**  Ensuring that the classloader is properly restricted and cannot be used to load arbitrary classes.

*   **Custom CPS Integrations:**  Any custom code within the plugin that interacts with CPS APIs (e.g., `CpsScript`, `CpsThread`) needs careful scrutiny.  This includes:
    *   **Direct Manipulation of CPS Objects:**  Avoid directly manipulating internal CPS objects, as this could bypass security checks.
    *   **Use of `@NonCPS`:**  While `@NonCPS` can be necessary for certain operations, it should be used sparingly and with extreme caution, as it bypasses the sandbox.  Any code within a `@NonCPS` method must be thoroughly vetted.
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:**  Carefully handling asynchronous operations and ensuring that they do not introduce race conditions or other vulnerabilities.

*   **Reflection:**  The use of reflection in Groovy can be a powerful tool, but it can also be used to bypass security restrictions.  Any use of reflection within the plugin needs to be carefully examined.

*   **Deserialization:**  Groovy's built-in serialization and deserialization mechanisms can be vulnerable to attack.  If the plugin deserializes any data, this is a high-risk area.

### 2.2. Known Vulnerability Research

A thorough search of vulnerability databases (NVD, Jenkins Security Advisories, etc.) is crucial.  This search should include:

*   **Keywords:**  "pipeline-model-definition-plugin", "Groovy CPS", "sandbox bypass", "Jenkins", "Declarative Pipeline", "CVE".
*   **Specific CVEs:**  Research any CVEs specifically related to the plugin or to Groovy CPS bypasses in general.
*   **Security Advisories:**  Regularly check the Jenkins security advisories for updates.

*Example (Hypothetical):*  Let's say we find a past CVE (e.g., CVE-2020-XXXX) that describes a vulnerability in the `Converter` class where a specially crafted `when` condition could bypass the sandbox.  This would be a *critical* finding and would require immediate patching and further investigation to ensure that similar vulnerabilities do not exist.

### 2.3. Dependency Analysis

The plugin's dependencies need to be analyzed for known vulnerabilities.  Tools like `mvn dependency:tree` (if applicable) can be used to identify dependencies and their versions.  Key dependencies to focus on include:

*   **Groovy:**  The version of Groovy used by the plugin.
*   **Jenkins Core:**  The version of Jenkins core that the plugin depends on.
*   **Other Pipeline-related Plugins:**  Any other plugins that the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` depends on.
*   **Libraries related to parsing or serialization:**  Libraries like Jackson, Gson, or others used for parsing or serialization.

*Example (Hypothetical):*  If the plugin uses an outdated version of a library with a known deserialization vulnerability, this could be exploited to bypass the CPS sandbox, even if the plugin's code itself is secure.

### 2.4. Interaction with Other Plugins (Secondary Focus)

While the primary focus is on the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` itself, it's important to consider how it might interact with other plugins.  For example:

*   **Plugins that provide custom steps or functions:**  If these plugins have vulnerabilities, they could be exploited through the Declarative Pipeline.
*   **Plugins that modify the Groovy environment:**  Plugins that modify the global Groovy environment could potentially weaken the sandbox.

### 2.5. Potential DAST Approaches (for Testing)

While a full penetration test is beyond the scope of this document, here are some DAST approaches that could be used to test for CPS bypasses:

*   **Fuzzing:**  Provide the plugin with a wide range of malformed and unexpected Declarative Pipeline definitions.  This could include:
    *   Invalid syntax.
    *   Extremely long strings.
    *   Deeply nested structures.
    *   Unicode characters.
    *   Special characters.
*   **Known Payloads:**  Attempt to inject known Groovy sandbox escape payloads into the Pipeline definition.  These payloads can be found in security research papers and online resources.
*   **Monitoring:**  Carefully monitor the Jenkins master and agent during testing for:
    *   Unexpected errors or exceptions.
    *   Unusual CPU or memory usage.
    *   Unauthorized access to files or resources.
    *   Network connections to unexpected hosts.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies (Reinforcement and Expansion)

The mitigation strategies listed in the original threat description are a good starting point.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Keep Jenkins and `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` Updated:** This is the *most important* mitigation.  Regularly update to the latest stable versions of both Jenkins and the plugin.  Subscribe to the Jenkins security advisory mailing list.

*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, focusing specifically on the plugin's interaction with CPS.  This should include both SAST and DAST approaches.

*   **Minimal Plugin Installation:**  Only install the plugins that are absolutely necessary.  This reduces the attack surface.

*   **Avoid Unsafe Groovy Constructs:**  Even within the sandbox, avoid using known risky Groovy constructs, such as:
    *   `Eval.me()`
    *   `GroovyShell` (directly)
    *   Excessive use of reflection
    *   Deserialization of untrusted data

*   **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**  Implement robust monitoring and logging in Jenkins.  Watch for:
    *   Unusual errors or exceptions in the Jenkins logs.
    *   Unexpected changes to Jenkins configuration.
    *   Unauthorized access to Jenkins resources.
    *   Suspicious network activity.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run Jenkins with the least privilege necessary.  Do not run Jenkins as the root user.

*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Jenkins master and agents on a separate network segment to limit the impact of a potential compromise.

*   **Code Review:** Implement a mandatory code review process for any changes to the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` code, with a specific focus on security.

* **Input sanitization:** Sanitize all input that comes from pipeline.

## 4. Conclusion
