Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Input Parameter Injection (within Pipeline Context)" attack surface for the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.

## Deep Analysis: Input Parameter Injection in Jenkins Declarative Pipelines

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Input Parameter Injection" vulnerability within the context of Jenkins Declarative Pipelines using the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.  We aim to identify the root causes, potential exploitation scenarios, and effective mitigation strategies, providing actionable guidance for developers to secure their pipelines.  This goes beyond a simple description and delves into the *why* and *how* of the vulnerability.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   Declarative Pipelines defined using the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.
*   Input parameters defined using the `parameters` directive within the pipeline.
*   The *unsafe handling* of these parameters within the pipeline's Groovy code (including `script` blocks) and shell scripts (`sh` steps).
*   The interaction between user-provided input and the execution environment (Jenkins agent).
*   Vulnerabilities arising *directly* from the pipeline's definition, not general Jenkins configuration issues.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the vulnerability and its underlying mechanisms.
2.  **Code Analysis:** Examine how the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` processes and exposes input parameters.  While we don't have direct access to the plugin's source code here, we'll infer its behavior based on documentation and observed functionality.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:** Develop realistic and detailed attack scenarios, demonstrating how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of successful exploitation, considering various levels of severity.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Propose and evaluate multiple mitigation strategies, prioritizing those that are most effective and practical.
6.  **Best Practices:**  Provide concrete recommendations and best practices for developers to prevent this vulnerability.
7.  **Testing Recommendations:** Outline how to test for this vulnerability.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

**2.1 Vulnerability Definition:**

Input Parameter Injection in Declarative Pipelines occurs when user-supplied input, provided through the `parameters` directive, is used without proper sanitization or escaping within the pipeline's execution context. This allows attackers to inject malicious code (Groovy or shell commands) that is then executed by the Jenkins agent.  The core issue is a *lack of separation between data (user input) and code (pipeline logic)*.

**2.2 Code Analysis (Inferred Behavior):**

The `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` likely works as follows:

1.  **Parameter Definition:** The `parameters` directive in the `Jenkinsfile` defines the expected input parameters (name, type, default value, description).
2.  **Parameter Input:** When a pipeline is triggered, Jenkins presents an interface (or uses default values) to collect the parameter values.
3.  **Parameter Storage:** These values are stored, likely as environment variables or accessible through a specific API within the pipeline's Groovy context.
4.  **Parameter Access:**  Within the pipeline, these parameters are accessed directly (e.g., `${userInput}` in a `sh` step or `$userInput` in a Groovy `script` block).
5.  **Unsafe Execution:** If the parameter value is used directly in a shell command or Groovy code without escaping, the injected code is executed.  The Groovy interpreter or the shell interpreter treats the injected content as code, not data.

**2.3 Exploitation Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1: Basic Command Injection (Shell)**

    *   **Pipeline Snippet:**
        ```groovy
        pipeline {
            agent any
            parameters {
                string(name: 'userInput', defaultValue: 'safe', description: 'Enter some text')
            }
            stages {
                stage('Echo') {
                    steps {
                        sh "echo ${params.userInput}"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Attacker Input:** `"; rm -rf /tmp/*; echo "`
    *   **Result:** The `sh` step executes: `echo ""; rm -rf /tmp/*; echo ""`.  This deletes files in the `/tmp` directory on the agent.

*   **Scenario 2: Command Injection with Conditional Logic (Shell)**

    *   **Pipeline Snippet:**
        ```groovy
        pipeline {
            agent any
            parameters {
                string(name: 'filename', defaultValue: 'report.txt', description: 'Enter filename')
            }
            stages {
                stage('Process') {
                    steps {
                        sh '''
                            if [ -f "${params.filename}" ]; then
                                echo "File exists"
                            else
                                echo "File does not exist"
                            fi
                        '''
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Attacker Input:** `report.txt"; echo "Vulnerable!"; echo "`
    *   **Result:** The shell script becomes:
        ```bash
        if [ -f "report.txt"; echo "Vulnerable!"; echo "" ]; then
            echo "File exists"
        else
            echo "File does not exist"
        fi
        ```
        The attacker's command `echo "Vulnerable!"` is executed regardless of whether the file exists.

*   **Scenario 3: Groovy Code Injection (Script Block)**

    *   **Pipeline Snippet:**
        ```groovy
        pipeline {
            agent any
            parameters {
                string(name: 'groovyCode', defaultValue: 'println "Hello"', description: 'Enter Groovy code')
            }
            stages {
                stage('Execute') {
                    steps {
                        script {
                            evaluate(params.groovyCode)
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Attacker Input:** `org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.ProcessGroovyMethods.execute("rm -rf /tmp/*")`
    *   **Result:** The `evaluate()` function executes the attacker's Groovy code, which in turn executes the shell command `rm -rf /tmp/*` on the agent.  This demonstrates how Groovy's dynamic nature can be abused.

*   **Scenario 4:  Bypassing Weak Validation (Shell)**
    *   **Pipeline Snippet:**
        ```groovy
        pipeline {
            agent any
            parameters {
                string(name: 'userInput', defaultValue: 'safe', description: 'Enter some text')
            }
            stages {
                stage('Echo') {
                    steps {
                        script{
                            if (params.userInput.matches("[a-zA-Z]+")) {
                                sh "echo ${params.userInput}"
                            } else {
                                echo "Invalid input"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Attacker Input:** `aaa$(echo evil > /tmp/evil.txt)`
    *   **Result:** The regex only checks for letters, but the shell expansion still happens.

**2.4 Impact Assessment:**

The impact of successful input parameter injection is **High** to **Critical**, depending on the context and the attacker's actions:

*   **Code Execution:** Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins agent is the primary consequence.
*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can read sensitive files, environment variables, and potentially access connected systems.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:**  Attackers can modify or delete files on the agent, including build artifacts, source code, and configuration files.
*   **System Compromise:**  Attackers could potentially gain full control of the agent machine, using it as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers could disrupt builds, delete critical files, or consume system resources, causing a denial of service.
*   **Credential Theft:**  If the agent has access to credentials (e.g., SSH keys, API tokens), attackers could steal these credentials.

**2.5 Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **1. Strict Input Validation (Whitelist):**
    *   **Description:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters or patterns for each input parameter.  Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.  This is the *most effective* mitigation.
    *   **Example (Regex):**  If a parameter should only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, use a regex like `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`.
    *   **Example (Choice Parameter):** If a parameter should only have a limited set of values, use a `choice` parameter instead of a `string` parameter.
    *   **Implementation:** Use Groovy's `matches()` method or other validation libraries within a `script` block *before* using the parameter in any potentially dangerous context.

*   **2. Triple Single Quotes for Shell Scripts (`sh`):**
    *   **Description:**  Use triple single quotes (`'''`) around the entire shell script within the `sh` step.  This prevents variable expansion and command substitution, treating the entire block as a literal string.
    *   **Example:**
        ```groovy
        sh '''
            echo "${params.userInput}"  # This is SAFE because of the triple quotes
        '''
        ```
    *   **Limitation:** This prevents *all* variable expansion, so you cannot use *any* Jenkins variables or parameters within the shell script.  This is often too restrictive.

*   **3. Parameterized String (GString) with Escaping (Groovy):**
    *   **Description:**  Use Groovy's built-in escaping mechanisms when constructing strings that will be used in shell commands.  Specifically, use `StringEscapeUtils.escapeShell()` from the Apache Commons Lang library (which is available in Jenkins).
    *   **Example:**
        ```groovy
        script {
            def escapedInput = org.apache.commons.lang.StringEscapeUtils.escapeShell(params.userInput)
            sh "echo ${escapedInput}"
        }
        ```
    *   **Benefit:** Allows variable substitution while still preventing command injection.

*   **4. Avoid `sh` and `evaluate()` When Possible:**
    *   **Description:**  Prefer built-in Jenkins pipeline steps and functions that handle input safely.  For example, use `writeFile` to write to a file instead of constructing a shell command with `sh`.  Avoid using `evaluate()` to execute dynamically generated Groovy code.
    *   **Example:** Instead of `sh "cp ${params.source} ${params.destination}"`, use built-in file operations if available.

*   **5. Least Privilege Principle:**
    *   **Description:**  Ensure that the Jenkins agent runs with the *minimum necessary privileges*.  Do not run the agent as root or with unnecessary permissions.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.

*   **6.  Agent Isolation:**
    *   **Description:** Use separate, dedicated agents for different projects or pipelines.  This prevents cross-contamination if one agent is compromised.  Consider using containerized agents (Docker) for even greater isolation.

*   **7.  Regular Security Audits:**
    *   **Description:** Conduct regular security audits of Jenkins pipelines, focusing on input parameter handling.  Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.

**2.6 Best Practices:**

*   **Treat all user input as untrusted.** This is a fundamental security principle.
*   **Prioritize whitelisting over blacklisting.**  It's much easier to define what's allowed than to try to anticipate every possible malicious input.
*   **Use the most restrictive parameter type possible.**  If a parameter should only be a boolean, use a `booleanParam`.  If it should be a choice from a list, use a `choiceParam`.
*   **Document all input parameters clearly.**  Include information about the expected format and any validation rules.
*   **Educate developers about secure coding practices.**  Provide training on input validation, escaping, and the risks of command injection.
*   **Keep Jenkins and all plugins up-to-date.**  Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer versions.

**2.7 Testing Recommendations:**

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube with security plugins, FindBugs/SpotBugs) to scan the `Jenkinsfile` for potential vulnerabilities.  These tools can often detect unsafe use of parameters.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Perform penetration testing, specifically targeting the input parameters of the pipeline.  Try injecting various malicious payloads (shell commands, Groovy code) to see if they are executed.
*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzz testing techniques to generate a large number of random or semi-random inputs and observe the pipeline's behavior.  This can help uncover unexpected vulnerabilities.
*   **Unit/Integration Tests:**  Write unit or integration tests that specifically test the input validation logic of the pipeline.  These tests should include both valid and invalid inputs.  For example:
    ```groovy
    // Example (Conceptual - Requires a testing framework)
    @Test
    void testInputValidation() {
        def pipeline = loadPipeline('Jenkinsfile') // Load the pipeline definition
        def result = pipeline.run(userInput: 'validInput')
        assert result.success

        result = pipeline.run(userInput: '"; rm -rf /; echo "')
        assert result.failure // Or check for a specific error message
    }
    ```

### 3. Conclusion

Input Parameter Injection within Jenkins Declarative Pipelines is a serious vulnerability that can lead to significant security breaches. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and following best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  A combination of strict input validation (whitelisting), proper escaping, and avoiding direct parameter use in shell commands is crucial for securing pipelines.  Regular security audits and testing are essential to ensure that these defenses remain effective. The most important takeaway is to *never trust user input* and to always validate and escape it appropriately before using it in any potentially dangerous context.
