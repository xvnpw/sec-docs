Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the Jenkins Pipeline Model Definition Plugin, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Compromise Shared Library Source in Jenkins Pipeline

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the attack vector "Compromise Shared Library Source" within the context of a Jenkins environment utilizing the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.  We will explore the technical details of how this attack could be executed, the potential consequences, and effective mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of applications using this plugin.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target:**  Jenkins instances using the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` (and by extension, the Declarative Pipeline syntax).  We assume the attacker has *some* level of access, whether it's compromised developer credentials, access to a connected SCM system, or a vulnerability in a related system.  We are *not* focusing on initial access vectors (e.g., phishing, brute-forcing Jenkins credentials).
*   **Attack Vector:**  The manipulation of shared library loading mechanisms within the Declarative Pipeline to execute malicious code.
*   **Plugin:**  `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` and its interaction with shared libraries.
*   **Exclusions:**  Attacks targeting the Jenkins master itself (e.g., exploiting core Jenkins vulnerabilities) are out of scope, *unless* they are directly related to the shared library compromise.  Attacks on the build agents are also out of scope, except as a consequence of the shared library compromise.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Technical Review:**  Examine the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` documentation, source code (where relevant and accessible), and community resources to understand how shared libraries are loaded and managed.
2.  **Attack Scenario Construction:**  Develop concrete, step-by-step scenarios illustrating how an attacker could exploit this vector.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering different levels of access and privileges gained by the attacker.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable recommendations to prevent, detect, and respond to this type of attack.
5.  **Vulnerability Research (Limited):** Briefly check for known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to shared library handling in the plugin.  This is *not* a full penetration test.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1.2 Compromise Shared Library Source

### 4.1. Technical Background: Shared Libraries in Jenkins Declarative Pipeline

The `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` allows developers to define Jenkins pipelines using a structured, declarative syntax.  Shared Libraries are a powerful feature that enables code reuse across multiple pipelines.  They are essentially Groovy scripts stored in a separate source code repository (e.g., Git).  A `Jenkinsfile` can load a shared library using the `@Library` annotation:

```groovy
@Library('my-shared-library@master') _
// OR
@Library('my-shared-library@v1.0') _
// OR, for an untrusted library (requires explicit approval)
@Library('my-shared-library@attacker-controlled-branch') _

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Call a function from the shared library
                mySharedLibraryFunction()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `@Library` annotation specifies:

*   **Library Name:**  A symbolic name configured in Jenkins global settings.  This name maps to a specific SCM repository and retrieval method.
*   **Version/Branch:**  The specific version or branch of the library to load.  This can be a tag, branch name, or commit hash.  The `_` is important; it's a Groovy idiom that imports all classes and methods from the library into the pipeline's namespace.

### 4.2. Attack Scenarios

Here are several scenarios illustrating how an attacker could compromise the shared library source:

**Scenario 1: Compromised SCM Credentials (Most Likely)**

1.  **Attacker Gains Access:** The attacker obtains valid credentials for the SCM repository hosting the shared library (e.g., through phishing, credential stuffing, or exploiting a vulnerability in the SCM system itself).
2.  **Malicious Modification:** The attacker directly modifies the shared library code in the repository, adding malicious code.  This could be a subtle change to an existing function or the introduction of a new, seemingly innocuous function that contains the malicious payload.
3.  **Pipeline Execution:**  The next time a Jenkins pipeline using this shared library runs, it automatically loads the compromised version from the SCM.  The malicious code executes within the context of the Jenkins build agent, potentially with elevated privileges.

**Scenario 2:  Manipulating the `Jenkinsfile` (Requires `Jenkinsfile` Access)**

1.  **Attacker Gains Access:** The attacker gains the ability to modify the `Jenkinsfile` of a project.  This could be through compromised developer credentials, a vulnerability in the application's source code management integration, or direct access to the Jenkins server.
2.  **Changing the Library Source:** The attacker modifies the `@Library` annotation in the `Jenkinsfile` to point to a different repository or branch under their control.  For example:
    *   Original: `@Library('my-shared-library@master') _`
    *   Modified: `@Library('my-shared-library@attacker-controlled-branch') _`
    *   Or, if the attacker controls a different repository entirely:  They could change the global configuration in Jenkins to point the `my-shared-library` name to their malicious repository.
3.  **Pipeline Execution:** The next pipeline run loads the malicious library from the attacker-controlled location, executing the attacker's code.

**Scenario 3:  Exploiting Implicit Trust (Less Likely, but High Impact)**

1.  **Attacker Gains Access:** The attacker gains access to *any* SCM repository that is trusted by the Jenkins instance (even if it's not the *intended* shared library repository).
2.  **Creating a "Fake" Library:** The attacker creates a new repository (or modifies an existing one) with the *same name* as the legitimate shared library.  They populate it with malicious code.
3.  **Jenkinsfile Modification (or Global Config):** The attacker modifies *either* the `Jenkinsfile` to use a version/branch that doesn't exist in the legitimate repository (forcing Jenkins to search other configured SCM sources) *or* modifies the global Jenkins configuration to prioritize their malicious repository.
4.  **Pipeline Execution:** Jenkins, due to its search order for shared libraries, might load the malicious library instead of the legitimate one.

**Scenario 4:  Dependency Confusion (Similar to NPM attacks)**

1.  **Attacker Discovers Naming:** The attacker identifies the naming convention used for internal shared libraries.
2.  **Public Repository Creation:** The attacker creates a public repository (e.g., on GitHub) with the *same name* as a private, internal shared library.
3.  **Misconfiguration:** If the Jenkins instance is misconfigured to search public repositories *before* private ones for shared libraries, it might inadvertently load the attacker's malicious library. This is less likely with the `@Library` annotation, which usually relies on pre-configured, named library sources, but could be relevant if custom library loading mechanisms are used.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful shared library compromise is **Very High** because:

*   **Code Execution:** The attacker gains arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins build agent.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Build agents often have elevated privileges to access source code, build tools, deployment credentials, and other sensitive resources.  The attacker could leverage these privileges to:
    *   Steal source code.
    *   Modify build artifacts.
    *   Deploy malicious code to production environments.
    *   Access and exfiltrate sensitive data (API keys, database credentials, etc.).
    *   Pivot to other systems within the network.
    *   Disrupt or sabotage the build and deployment process.
*   **Persistence:**  The attacker could modify the shared library to maintain persistence, ensuring their code continues to execute even after the initial compromise is detected.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The compromised build agent could be used as a launching point for attacks against other systems in the network.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

Here are specific recommendations to mitigate the risk of shared library compromise:

**4.4.1.  Preventative Measures:**

*   **Strong SCM Security:**
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for *all* users with access to the SCM repository hosting the shared library. This is the single most important control.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to the SCM repository.  Avoid granting write access to the `master` or main branch to all developers.
    *   **Branch Protection Rules:**  Implement branch protection rules (e.g., in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to require code reviews and approvals before merging changes to critical branches (e.g., `master`, release branches).
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically review user access and permissions to the SCM repository.
    *   **IP Whitelisting (if feasible):** Restrict access to the SCM repository to known, trusted IP addresses.

*   **Secure `Jenkinsfile` Management:**
    *   **Treat `Jenkinsfile` as Code:**  Apply the same security practices to the `Jenkinsfile` as you would to any other critical code.  This includes code reviews, version control, and access control.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:**  Never store credentials directly in the `Jenkinsfile`.  Use Jenkins' built-in credential management features.
    *   **Limit `Jenkinsfile` Modification:**  Restrict who can modify the `Jenkinsfile`.  Consider using a separate repository for `Jenkinsfiles` with stricter access controls.

*   **Shared Library Configuration:**
    *   **Explicit Versioning:**  Always specify a specific version (tag or commit hash) for shared libraries in the `@Library` annotation.  Avoid using `@Library('my-shared-library') _` (which defaults to the latest version) or `@Library('my-shared-library@master') _`.  Use a specific tag like `@Library('my-shared-library@v1.2.3') _`. This prevents automatic loading of potentially compromised code from the `master` branch.
    *   **Review Global Library Configuration:**  Carefully review the global Jenkins configuration for shared libraries.  Ensure that the SCM repositories and retrieval methods are correctly configured and that the order of precedence is appropriate.
    *   **Use Trusted Repositories Only:**  Only load shared libraries from trusted, internal repositories.  Avoid using public repositories for shared libraries unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

*   **Code Review and Static Analysis:**
    *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require thorough code reviews for *all* changes to shared libraries.  Focus on security-sensitive areas, such as input validation, external command execution, and credential handling.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, FindBugs, Checkmarx) to scan shared library code for potential vulnerabilities.

**4.4.2.  Detective Measures:**

*   **SCM Auditing:**  Enable audit logging in the SCM system to track all changes to the shared library repository.  Monitor these logs for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized commits or modifications to critical files.
*   **Jenkins Build Monitoring:**  Monitor Jenkins build logs for unusual activity, such as unexpected errors, changes in build times, or the execution of unfamiliar commands.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use FIM tools to monitor the integrity of the shared library files on the Jenkins master and build agents.  Alert on any unauthorized modifications.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity related to the Jenkins server and build agents.

**4.4.3.  Responsive Measures:**

*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that specifically addresses shared library compromises.  This plan should include steps for:
    *   Identifying and isolating compromised systems.
    *   Revoking compromised credentials.
    *   Restoring shared libraries from known-good backups.
    *   Notifying affected users and stakeholders.
    *   Conducting a post-incident analysis to identify root causes and improve security measures.
*   **Rollback Capability:**  Ensure that you have a mechanism to quickly roll back to a previous, known-good version of the shared library in case of a compromise.
*   **Regular Backups:**  Regularly back up the Jenkins configuration, shared library repositories, and build artifacts.

**4.4.4 Specific to `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`:**

* **Regular Updates:** Keep the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` and all related plugins up to date.  Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer versions.
* **Review Plugin Permissions:** Understand the permissions required by the plugin and ensure they are not overly permissive.

## 5. Vulnerability Research (Limited)

A quick search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to shared library handling in the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` did not reveal any *currently unpatched* critical vulnerabilities *specific to the shared library loading mechanism itself*. However, it's crucial to remember:

*   **Absence of Evidence is Not Evidence of Absence:**  The lack of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities does not mean that none exist.
*   **Related Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in *other* Jenkins plugins or in the core Jenkins platform could potentially be leveraged to compromise shared libraries.
*   **Ongoing Threat:**  The threat landscape is constantly evolving, and new vulnerabilities are discovered regularly.

Therefore, continuous monitoring and proactive security measures are essential.

## 6. Conclusion

Compromising the shared library source is a high-impact attack vector against Jenkins pipelines using the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.  By implementing the preventative, detective, and responsive measures outlined in this analysis, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack and protect their build and deployment pipelines.  The most critical mitigations are strong SCM security (especially MFA), explicit shared library versioning, and rigorous code review processes. Continuous vigilance and a proactive security posture are paramount.
