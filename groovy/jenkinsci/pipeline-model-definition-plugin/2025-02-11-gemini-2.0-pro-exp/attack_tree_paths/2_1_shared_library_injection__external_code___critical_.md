Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Shared Library Injection (External Code)" attack tree path, focusing on the Jenkins Pipeline Model Definition Plugin, presented in Markdown format:

# Deep Analysis: Shared Library Injection in Jenkins Pipelines

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the "Shared Library Injection (External Code)" attack vector within Jenkins pipelines that utilize the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.  We will identify specific vulnerabilities, potential attack scenarios, mitigation strategies, and detection methods related to this critical threat.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of applications using this plugin.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Jenkins Pipelines:**  We are concerned with pipelines defined using the Declarative Pipeline syntax, as supported by the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.
*   **Shared Libraries:**  The analysis centers on the security implications of using shared libraries loaded from external sources (e.g., Git repositories).  We will *not* cover vulnerabilities within the core Jenkins engine itself, except where they directly interact with shared library functionality.
*   **`pipeline-model-definition-plugin`:**  We assume this plugin is installed and used as the primary mechanism for defining pipelines.
*   **External Code Injection:** The primary threat is the ability for an attacker to inject malicious code into a shared library, which is then executed within the context of a Jenkins pipeline.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling:**  We will systematically identify potential threats and attack scenarios related to shared library injection.
*   **Code Review (Conceptual):**  While we don't have direct access to the plugin's source code for this exercise, we will conceptually analyze the likely mechanisms involved in loading and executing shared libraries, based on the plugin's documentation and known Jenkins behaviors.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to Jenkins shared libraries and Groovy scripting.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:**  We will compare the observed attack vectors against established security best practices for Jenkins and software development in general.
*   **Attack Tree Path Decomposition:** We will break down the attack tree path into smaller, more manageable sub-goals and attack steps.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.1 Shared Library Injection (External Code)

### 4.1. Attack Sub-Goals and Steps

The primary attack goal is to execute arbitrary code within the context of a Jenkins pipeline.  This can be broken down into the following sub-goals and steps:

1.  **Gain Control of a Shared Library Source:**  The attacker must gain the ability to modify the code within a shared library that is used by the target Jenkins pipeline.  This can be achieved through several means:
    *   **Compromise Source Control Repository:**  Directly compromise the Git (or other SCM) repository hosting the shared library. This could involve:
        *   **Stolen Credentials:**  Obtaining valid credentials for a user with write access to the repository.
        *   **Exploiting SCM Vulnerabilities:**  Leveraging vulnerabilities in the SCM server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking a legitimate developer into committing malicious code or merging a malicious pull request.
        *   **Insider Threat:**  A malicious or compromised developer with legitimate access intentionally introduces malicious code.
    *   **DNS Hijacking/Spoofing:**  If the shared library is loaded from a URL, the attacker could manipulate DNS resolution to point the Jenkins server to a malicious repository.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**  Intercept and modify the network traffic between the Jenkins server and the shared library repository, injecting malicious code during the download process.  This is less likely with HTTPS, but still possible with compromised certificates or weak TLS configurations.
    *  **Dependency Confusion/Substitution:** If the shared library uses dependencies, the attacker might be able to publish a malicious package with the same name to a public repository, tricking the build process into using the malicious version.

2.  **Inject Malicious Code:** Once the attacker controls the shared library source, they can inject malicious Groovy code.  This code could:
    *   **Steal Credentials:**  Access and exfiltrate Jenkins credentials, API tokens, or other sensitive information stored within the Jenkins environment.
    *   **Modify Build Artifacts:**  Tamper with the output of the build process, injecting malicious code into software releases.
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Commands:**  Run arbitrary shell commands on the Jenkins master or agent nodes, potentially gaining full control of the server.
    *   **Launch Further Attacks:**  Use the compromised Jenkins server as a launching point for attacks against other systems within the network.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Steal source code, configuration files, or other sensitive data accessible to the Jenkins pipeline.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Disrupt Jenkins operations by consuming resources, deleting files, or shutting down services.

3.  **Trigger Pipeline Execution:** The attacker needs to trigger the execution of a pipeline that uses the compromised shared library. This could happen:
    *   **Scheduled Builds:**  The pipeline might be configured to run on a schedule.
    *   **SCM Triggers:**  A commit to a specific branch in the application's source code repository could trigger the pipeline.
    *   **Manual Trigger:**  An unsuspecting user might manually trigger the pipeline.
    *   **API Trigger:** The pipeline could be triggered via the Jenkins API.

### 4.2. Vulnerabilities and Exploits

Several vulnerabilities and exploit techniques are relevant to this attack path:

*   **Groovy Sandbox Bypass:**  Jenkins attempts to execute Groovy code within a sandbox to limit its capabilities.  However, numerous sandbox bypass techniques have been discovered over time.  Attackers may try to exploit these bypasses to gain unrestricted access to the system.
*   **Unvalidated Input in Shared Libraries:**  If the shared library code accepts input from the pipeline (e.g., parameters), and this input is not properly validated, it could be used to inject malicious code or manipulate the library's behavior (similar to command injection or SQL injection).
*   **Weak Access Controls:**  Insufficient access controls on the shared library repository or the Jenkins server itself can make it easier for attackers to gain initial access.
*   **Outdated Jenkins or Plugin Versions:**  Known vulnerabilities in older versions of Jenkins or the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` could be exploited.
*   **Lack of Code Signing/Verification:** Without code signing or integrity checks, Jenkins cannot verify that the shared library code has not been tampered with.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

Multiple layers of defense are necessary to mitigate the risk of shared library injection:

*   **Strict Access Control:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and service accounts accessing the shared library repository and the Jenkins server.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Require MFA for all users with write access to the shared library repository.
    *   **Repository Protection Rules:**  Utilize branch protection rules (e.g., in GitHub or GitLab) to require code reviews and prevent direct pushes to critical branches.
    *   **Jenkins Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Use Jenkins' RBAC features to restrict which users can configure pipelines and load shared libraries.

*   **Secure Shared Library Development:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory, thorough code reviews for all changes to shared libraries.
    *   **Static Code Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the Groovy code.
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Carefully vet and manage all dependencies used by the shared library. Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate all input received by the shared library from the pipeline.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines for Groovy and Jenkins development.

*   **Jenkins Configuration Hardening:**
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable any Jenkins features that are not strictly required, reducing the attack surface.
    *   **Keep Jenkins and Plugins Updated:**  Regularly update Jenkins and all plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use a Secure Groovy Sandbox:**  Configure the Groovy sandbox with the most restrictive settings possible.  Consider using a custom sandbox implementation if necessary.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Jenkins server from other critical systems to limit the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Monitor Jenkins Logs:**  Regularly monitor Jenkins logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, unexpected pipeline executions, or errors related to shared library loading.

*   **Code Signing and Verification (Crucial):**
    *   **Implement Code Signing:**  Digitally sign shared library code to ensure its integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Verify Signatures:**  Configure Jenkins to verify the digital signatures of shared libraries before loading them. This is the *most effective* defense against unauthorized code modification.  This might involve custom scripting or the use of specialized plugins.

*   **Dependency Management and Supply Chain Security:**
    *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain a detailed SBOM for all shared libraries and their dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Trusted Repositories:** Use private, trusted repositories for shared libraries and their dependencies whenever possible.

### 4.4. Detection Methods

Detecting a shared library injection attack can be challenging, but several methods can be employed:

*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Network-based and host-based intrusion detection systems can be configured to detect suspicious network traffic or system activity associated with an attack.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  A SIEM system can collect and analyze logs from Jenkins, the SCM server, and other relevant systems to identify potential security incidents.
*   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**  RASP tools can monitor the execution of Groovy code within Jenkins and detect malicious behavior in real-time.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  FIM tools can detect changes to critical files, including shared library code.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Monitor pipeline execution patterns and identify deviations from normal behavior, which could indicate a compromised shared library.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Jenkins environment, including code reviews of shared libraries and penetration testing.

## 5. Recommendations

Based on this analysis, the following recommendations are made to the development team:

1.  **Prioritize Code Signing and Verification:**  Implement a robust mechanism for code signing and verifying shared libraries. This is the single most important mitigation.
2.  **Enforce Strict Access Control:**  Implement and enforce strict access control policies for both the shared library repository and the Jenkins server.
3.  **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Require thorough code reviews for all changes to shared libraries, with a focus on security.
4.  **Regular Security Training:**  Provide regular security training to all developers involved in creating and maintaining Jenkins pipelines and shared libraries.
5.  **Automated Security Scanning:**  Integrate automated security scanning tools (static analysis, dependency scanning) into the development pipeline.
6.  **Continuous Monitoring:**  Implement continuous monitoring of the Jenkins environment, including logs, network traffic, and system activity.
7.  **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan to handle potential shared library injection attacks.
8. **Document Security Best Practices:** Create and maintain clear documentation outlining security best practices for using shared libraries within the organization. This documentation should be readily available to all developers.
9. **Consider a Dedicated Shared Library Team:** For larger organizations, consider having a dedicated team responsible for the security and maintenance of shared libraries.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of shared library injection attacks and improve the overall security of applications using the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.
