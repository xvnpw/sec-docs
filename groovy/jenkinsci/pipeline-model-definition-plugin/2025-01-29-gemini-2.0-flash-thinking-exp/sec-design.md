    - Requirement: No new authentication mechanisms should be introduced by the plugin itself.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: The plugin should respect Jenkins' existing authorization model for pipeline access and execution.
    - Requirement: Pipeline definitions should not bypass Jenkins' authorization controls.
    - Requirement: Access to pipeline definition and execution should be role-based and configurable within Jenkins.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The plugin must validate pipeline definitions to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities arising from malformed input.
    - Requirement: Validation should cover syntax, semantics, and resource usage within pipeline definitions.
    - Requirement: Error handling for invalid pipeline definitions should be robust and secure, avoiding information leakage.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: The plugin should support secure handling of secrets within pipeline definitions, leveraging Jenkins' secrets management features.
    - Requirement: If the plugin handles any sensitive data internally, it should be encrypted at rest and in transit as appropriate.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software Development and Delivery: The plugin is crucial for defining and executing CI/CD pipelines, which are essential for automating software development, testing, and deployment processes. Disruption or compromise of the plugin can directly impact the speed and reliability of software releases.
  - Security Patching and Updates: Pipelines are often used to automate the deployment of security patches and updates. A compromised pipeline or plugin could hinder or sabotage these critical security operations.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Pipeline Definitions: Pipeline definitions themselves can contain sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, and configuration details. Exposure of these definitions could lead to unauthorized access and system compromise.
  - Source Code: Pipelines often interact with source code repositories. While the plugin itself doesn't directly store source code, vulnerabilities could be exploited to gain access to or modify source code through pipeline execution.
  - Build Artifacts: Pipelines produce build artifacts, which may contain sensitive data or vulnerabilities if the build process is compromised.
  - Credentials and Secrets: Pipelines frequently manage and use credentials and secrets for accessing various systems and services. Secure handling of these secrets within pipeline definitions and execution is paramount.
