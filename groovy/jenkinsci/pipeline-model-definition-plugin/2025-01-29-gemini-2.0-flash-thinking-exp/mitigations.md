# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pipeline Definition Security (Declarative Pipelines)](./mitigation_strategies/pipeline_definition_security__declarative_pipelines_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Version Control:** Store all Jenkinsfile definitions, which define declarative pipelines using the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`, in a version control system like Git.
2.  **Code Review Process:** Implement a mandatory code review process specifically for Jenkinsfile defining declarative pipelines. This includes reviewing the declarative structure, steps used, and any embedded `script` blocks.
3.  **Branching Strategy:** Adopt a branching strategy to manage different versions of declarative pipelines (development, staging, production) defined by Jenkinsfile.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Unauthorized Pipeline Modification (High Severity):** Malicious actors could modify declarative pipeline definitions to inject malicious steps or alter the intended workflow.
*   **Accidental Pipeline Breakage (Medium Severity):** Errors in declarative pipeline syntax or step configuration can lead to broken builds.
*   **Lack of Auditability (Medium Severity):** Without version control for Jenkinsfile, tracking changes to declarative pipelines becomes difficult.
### Impact:
*   **Unauthorized Pipeline Modification (High Impact):** Significantly reduces risk by controlling changes to declarative pipeline definitions.
*   **Accidental Pipeline Breakage (Medium Impact):** Reduces risk by introducing review and versioning for declarative pipelines.
*   **Lack of Auditability (Medium Impact):** Provides audit trail for declarative pipeline changes.
### Currently Implemented:
Version control (Git) for Jenkinsfile. Code review partially implemented. Branching strategy in place.
### Missing Implementation:
Formalized code review for Jenkinsfile defining declarative pipelines. Consistent enforcement of code review for all declarative pipeline changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Scripted Pipeline Blocks within Declarative Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/scripted_pipeline_blocks_within_declarative_pipelines.md)

### Description:
1.  **Favor Declarative Syntax:**  Prioritize using the declarative syntax and built-in steps provided by the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` and other Jenkins plugins.
2.  **Avoid `script` Blocks:**  Actively avoid using `script` blocks within declarative pipelines unless absolutely necessary and no declarative alternative exists.
3.  **Educate Developers:** Train developers on the security implications of `script` blocks in declarative pipelines and promote declarative best practices.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** `script` blocks introduce Groovy scripting into declarative pipelines, increasing the risk of injection attacks.
*   **Unintended Code Execution (Medium Severity):**  Uncontrolled Groovy code in `script` blocks can lead to unexpected behavior and security issues within declarative pipelines.
*   **Complexity and Maintainability (Medium Severity):** Excessive use of `script` blocks makes declarative pipelines harder to understand and maintain.
### Impact:
*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces risk by limiting the use of `script` blocks in declarative pipelines.
*   **Unintended Code Execution (Medium Impact):** Reduces risk by promoting structured declarative pipeline definitions.
*   **Complexity and Maintainability (Medium Impact):** Improves maintainability of declarative pipelines.
### Currently Implemented:
Developers generally encouraged to use declarative syntax. No formal policies in place.
### Missing Implementation:
Formal training on declarative pipeline best practices and `script` block security. Clear guidelines on `script` block usage in declarative pipelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Review and Sanitize `script` Blocks (within Declarative Pipelines)](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_review_and_sanitize__script__blocks__within_declarative_pipelines_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Mandatory Code Review for `script`:**  Require rigorous code review specifically for any `script` blocks used within declarative pipelines.
2.  **Security Checklist for `script`:** Develop a checklist for reviewers focusing on security aspects of `script` blocks in declarative pipelines, including input validation, command injection prevention, and least privilege.
3.  **Sanitization Functions for `script`:** Provide developers with reusable functions for sanitizing inputs within `script` blocks in declarative pipelines.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Addresses injection risks within `script` blocks in declarative pipelines through review and sanitization.
*   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Specifically mitigates command injection risks within shell commands executed from `script` blocks in declarative pipelines.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Helps prevent information leaks from `script` blocks in declarative pipelines.
### Impact:
*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces risk through security-focused review of `script` blocks in declarative pipelines.
*   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Directly mitigates command injection in `script` blocks within declarative pipelines.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** Reduces risk of leaks from `script` blocks in declarative pipelines.
### Currently Implemented:
Code reviews are performed, but security-specific review for `script` blocks in declarative pipelines is not formalized.
### Missing Implementation:
Security-focused review checklist for `script` blocks in declarative pipelines. Reusable sanitization functions for `script` blocks. Formal training for reviewers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameter Validation and Sanitization (Declarative Pipelines)](./mitigation_strategies/parameter_validation_and_sanitization__declarative_pipelines_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Declarative Parameter Types:** Utilize specific parameter types offered by the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` in declarative pipelines (e.g., `string`, `choice`, `boolean`).
2.  **Validation Rules for Declarative Parameters:**  Use validation rules (e.g., regular expressions for `string` parameters) within declarative pipeline parameter definitions to restrict input.
3.  **Sanitization in Declarative Pipelines:** Implement or use sanitization functions within declarative pipeline scripts (especially in `script` blocks if used) to sanitize parameter values before use.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents command injection via parameters used in declarative pipelines.
*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces script injection risks from parameters in declarative pipelines.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** Sanitization can help prevent XSS if declarative pipeline output with parameters is displayed in web context.
### Impact:
*   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces risk of parameter-based command injection in declarative pipelines.
*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Reduces risk of script injection via parameters in declarative pipelines.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Impact):** Provides defense against XSS in specific declarative pipeline contexts.
### Currently Implemented:
Parameter types are used. Basic validation might be implicit. No dedicated sanitization for declarative pipeline parameters.
### Missing Implementation:
Systematic parameter validation rules in declarative pipelines. Sanitization functions for declarative pipeline parameters. Developer training on secure parameter handling in declarative pipelines.
