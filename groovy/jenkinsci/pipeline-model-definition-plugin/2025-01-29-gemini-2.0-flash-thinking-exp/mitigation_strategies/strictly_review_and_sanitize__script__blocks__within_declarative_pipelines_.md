    *   Provide training on how to use the sanitization functions correctly and when they are appropriate.
    *   Regularly review and update the library to address new threats and improve existing functions.

#### 4.2. Effectiveness Against Threats:

*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** This strategy directly and effectively mitigates script injection vulnerabilities. Mandatory code review and the security checklist specifically focus on identifying and preventing injection points within `script` blocks. Sanitization functions provide tools to neutralize potentially malicious inputs before they can be interpreted as code.
*   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  This strategy is highly effective against command injection. The security checklist should explicitly include checks for command injection risks, and sanitization functions can provide mechanisms to escape or sanitize inputs used in shell commands. Code review ensures that developers are aware of and avoid insecure command execution patterns.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** This strategy contributes to mitigating information disclosure. Code reviews can identify instances where `script` blocks might unintentionally expose sensitive information through logging, error messages, or external communication. The security checklist can include checks for preventing information leaks. Sanitization functions can help prevent sensitive data from being inadvertently included in outputs or logs.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment:

*   **Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):**  The strategy has a high impact on reducing the risk of script injection. By implementing all three components, the likelihood of introducing and exploiting script injection vulnerabilities is significantly reduced.
*   **Command Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Similarly, the strategy has a high impact on mitigating command injection risks. The combination of code review, checklist, and sanitization functions provides a strong defense against this type of vulnerability.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Impact):** The strategy has a medium impact on reducing information disclosure risks. While it helps identify and prevent some common information leaks, other information disclosure vulnerabilities might exist outside of `script` blocks or require different mitigation techniques.

#### 4.4. Current Implementation and Missing Components:

*   **Currently Implemented:** Code reviews are performed, which is a positive starting point. However, the lack of formalization and security focus for `script` blocks limits their effectiveness in mitigating the identified threats.

    *   **Security-focused review checklist for `script` blocks:** This is a crucial missing component that needs to be developed and implemented to guide reviewers and ensure consistent security checks.
    *   **Reusable sanitization functions for `script` blocks:** Providing these functions will significantly simplify secure coding for developers and improve overall security.
    *   **Formal training for reviewers:** Training is essential to ensure reviewers are equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively identify security vulnerabilities in `script` blocks.

#### 4.5. Challenges and Limitations:

*   **Developer Buy-in:**  Successfully implementing this strategy requires buy-in from the development team. Developers need to understand the importance of security and be willing to participate in code reviews and utilize sanitization functions.
*   **Maintaining Momentum:**  Sustaining the effectiveness of this strategy requires ongoing effort. Checklists and sanitization functions need to be regularly updated, and reviewers need to be continuously trained.
*   **False Positives/Negatives in Reviews:** Code reviews and checklists are not foolproof and can produce false positives (flagging benign code) or false negatives (missing actual vulnerabilities).
*   **Balancing Security and Productivity:**  Implementing rigorous security measures can sometimes impact developer productivity. Finding the right balance is crucial to ensure both security and efficiency.
*   **Complexity of `script` Blocks:**  `script` blocks can be complex and involve various scripting languages and external interactions. Thoroughly reviewing and sanitizing complex `script` blocks can be challenging.

#### 4.6. Recommendations for Improvement:
