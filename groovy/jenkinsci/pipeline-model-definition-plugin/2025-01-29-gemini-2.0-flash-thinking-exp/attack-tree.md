## Attack Tree Path: [1. Groovy Script Injection (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/1__groovy_script_injection__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker gains the ability to modify pipeline definitions. This can be achieved by:
        *   **Compromising a Jenkins User Account:** Using techniques like password attacks, phishing, or social engineering to gain access to an account with pipeline edit permissions.
        *   **Exploiting Jenkins Authentication/Authorization Bypass (Less Likely):**  Finding and exploiting a vulnerability in Jenkins itself that allows bypassing authentication or authorization checks.
    *   Once access is gained, the attacker injects malicious Groovy code within declarative pipeline stages, such as `script` blocks or within steps that allow script execution.
    *   When the pipeline executes, the injected Groovy code runs on the Jenkins Master or Agent with the privileges of the Jenkins process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Arbitrary code execution on Jenkins infrastructure.
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to application secrets, source code, build artifacts stored within Jenkins or accessible from the Jenkins environment.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:** Injecting malware or backdoors into the application build process, potentially affecting a wide range of users.
    *   **Service Disruption:** Malicious builds, resource exhaustion, or intentional disruption of Jenkins services.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strong Access Control:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for Jenkins. Use strong passwords, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Regularly review and audit user permissions.
    *   **Minimize Script Usage:**  Limit the use of `script` blocks in declarative pipelines. If scripting is necessary, carefully review and sanitize any inputs used in scripts.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs used in pipeline definitions, especially if they come from external sources or user input.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers in Jenkins to mitigate certain types of script injection attacks (though might be less directly applicable to pipeline execution context).
    *   **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor Jenkins Master and Agent processes for unusual activity or code execution patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Insecure Pipeline Configuration (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__insecure_pipeline_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Developers or administrators misconfigure pipeline settings within the declarative syntax. Common misconfigurations include:
        *   **Exposing Sensitive Information in Logs or Artifacts:** Accidentally or intentionally printing environment variables, secrets, credentials, or configuration files to pipeline logs or build artifacts.
        *   **Weakening Security Checks (Less Likely in Declarative):**  While less common in declarative pipelines, there might be misconfiguration options that inadvertently weaken security measures.
    *   Attackers gain access to pipeline output (logs, artifacts) through Jenkins UI, API, or compromised accounts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive secrets, credentials, API keys, and configuration details. This can lead to further compromise of applications and systems.
    *   **Weakened Security Posture:** Misconfigurations can create vulnerabilities that are easier to exploit by other attack vectors.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Secure Secrets Management:** Utilize Jenkins' built-in credential management system or external secret stores to securely manage sensitive information. Avoid hardcoding secrets in pipeline definitions.
    *   **Regular Configuration Reviews:** Conduct regular reviews of pipeline configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or security weaknesses.
    *   **Secret Scanning Tools:** Implement automated secret scanning tools to detect accidental exposure of secrets in pipeline definitions, logs, and artifacts.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to pipelines and users. Avoid overly permissive configurations.
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:**  Avoid logging sensitive information. Sanitize logs to remove any accidental exposure of secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Resource Exhaustion via Pipeline Definition (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__resource_exhaustion_via_pipeline_definition__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attackers craft a malicious pipeline definition that is designed to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on the Jenkins Master or Agent.
    *   Examples include:
        *   **Infinite Loops or Deeply Nested Loops:**  Creating pipeline stages with looping constructs that run indefinitely or for an extremely long time.
        *   **Large Data Processing:**  Including steps that process very large datasets or perform computationally intensive operations without proper resource management.
    *   When the pipeline is executed, it overwhelms the Jenkins infrastructure, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Jenkins instance becomes unresponsive or crashes, disrupting build and deployment processes.
    *   **Performance Degradation:**  Jenkins performance significantly degrades, impacting all users and pipelines.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Resource Limits and Quotas:** Implement resource limits and quotas for pipeline executions. Jenkins provides mechanisms to control resource consumption by builds and agents.
    *   **Pipeline Code Review:** Review pipeline definitions for resource-intensive operations or potential infinite loops before deployment.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Jenkins Master and Agent resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Set up alerts for unusual resource consumption patterns.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms for pipeline executions if necessary to prevent abuse.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (for pipeline parameters):** If pipeline parameters can influence resource consumption, validate and sanitize them to prevent malicious input that could trigger resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Information Leakage via Pipeline Output (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/4__information_leakage_via_pipeline_output__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attackers intentionally design a pipeline to expose sensitive information in build logs or artifacts.
    *   Examples include:
        *   **Printing Environment Variables:**  Explicitly printing environment variables to logs, which might contain secrets or credentials.
        *   **Logging Configuration Files:**  Logging the contents of configuration files that contain sensitive information.
        *   **Including Secrets in Artifacts:**  Accidentally or intentionally including secrets or credentials in build artifacts that are stored and accessible through Jenkins.
    *   Attackers gain access to pipeline output (logs, artifacts) through Jenkins UI, API, or compromised accounts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive secrets, credentials, API keys, and configuration details.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Secure Logging Practices:**  Strictly avoid logging sensitive information in pipelines. Sanitize logs to remove any accidental exposure.
    *   **Artifact Security:**  Ensure that build artifacts are stored securely and access is controlled. Avoid including secrets or credentials in artifacts.
    *   **Output Sanitization:**  Implement mechanisms to sanitize pipeline output before it is displayed or stored, removing any sensitive information.
    *   **Access Control for Logs and Artifacts:**  Implement access control policies to restrict who can view pipeline logs and download artifacts.
    *   **Regular Audits of Pipeline Output:** Periodically audit pipeline logs and artifacts to identify and address any unintentional information leakage.
