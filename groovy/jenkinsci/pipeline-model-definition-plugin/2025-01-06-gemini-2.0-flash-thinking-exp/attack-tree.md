## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script in 'script' block](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_in_'script'_block.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker modifies the `Jenkinsfile`, specifically within a `script` block, to include malicious code. This code is then executed by the Jenkins master or agent during pipeline execution.

**Implications:** This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Jenkins infrastructure, potentially gaining full control of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Code Injection through Malformed Jenkinsfile](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_code_injection_through_malformed_jenkinsfile.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malformed `Jenkinsfile` that exploits vulnerabilities in the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin's parsing or processing logic. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Implications:** Similar to injecting malicious scripts, this can grant the attacker code execution capabilities on the Jenkins master.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Credentials Management in Pipelines](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_credentials_management_in_pipelines.md)

**Attack Vector:** Pipelines are often configured to access sensitive credentials for deployment or other tasks. If these credentials are not managed securely, an attacker can manipulate the pipeline to retrieve and exfiltrate them.

**Implications:** Stolen credentials can be used to access other systems and resources, leading to a broader compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Stolen Credentials to Access Other Systems](./attack_tree_paths/use_stolen_credentials_to_access_other_systems.md)

**Attack Vector:** Following the successful retrieval of credentials from the Jenkins environment, the attacker uses these credentials to gain unauthorized access to other connected systems and applications.

**Implications:** This allows for lateral movement within the network, potentially compromising sensitive data or critical infrastructure beyond Jenkins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Vulnerabilities in SCM Integration](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerabilities_in_scm_integration.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Exploiting weaknesses in how Jenkins integrates with Source Code Management (SCM) systems (like Git). This could involve compromising the SCM itself or manipulating the integration to inject malicious code.

**Implications:** This allows attackers to introduce malicious `Jenkinsfile` content directly into the source code repository, affecting all subsequent builds.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Jenkinsfile into Repository](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_jenkinsfile_into_repository.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker, having exploited SCM integration vulnerabilities or through social engineering, successfully commits a modified `Jenkinsfile` containing malicious instructions to the source code repository.

**Implications:** This ensures that the malicious code will be executed the next time the pipeline is triggered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Automatic Builds with Malicious Code](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_automatic_builds_with_malicious_code.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once a malicious `Jenkinsfile` is in the repository, the automated build process of Jenkins will inevitably trigger its execution.

**Implications:** This leads to the execution of the attacker's malicious code on the Jenkins infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary System Commands on Jenkins Master/Agent](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_system_commands_on_jenkins_masteragent.md)

**Significance:** This represents a complete compromise of the Jenkins master or a build agent. The attacker gains the ability to execute any command on the system, allowing for data theft, system disruption, or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization__if_applicable_.md)

**Significance:** Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious serialized objects that, when processed by the application, can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a severe vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on Jenkins Master](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_jenkins_master.md)

**Significance:** Compromising the Jenkins master is a critical breach. The master controls all aspects of the Jenkins environment, including build configurations, credentials, and agent management. This level of access grants the attacker significant control over the entire CI/CD pipeline and potentially connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Actions with Elevated Privileges](./attack_tree_paths/execute_actions_with_elevated_privileges.md)

**Significance:** Successfully bypassing security sandboxes or restrictions allows an attacker to perform actions with elevated privileges. This can lead to system configuration changes, access to sensitive resources, or the execution of privileged commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Retrieve Stored Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/retrieve_stored_credentials.md)

**Significance:** Accessing stored credentials within Jenkins provides the attacker with sensitive information that can be used to compromise other systems and accounts. This is a key step in lateral movement and data breaches.
