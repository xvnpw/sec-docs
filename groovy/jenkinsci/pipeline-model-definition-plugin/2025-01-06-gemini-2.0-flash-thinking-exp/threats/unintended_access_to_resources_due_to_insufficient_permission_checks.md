        print("An attacker could craft a malicious pipeline definition to exploit this vulnerability in several ways:")
        print("""
* **Exploiting Existing Declarative Steps:**
    * **File System Access:** Using steps like `sh` or `script` to execute commands that read sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, credentials files) or write to restricted locations on the Jenkins agent or master. The plugin might not adequately sandbox or restrict the scope of these commands based on the pipeline's intended permissions.
    * **Network Access:** Employing steps that make network requests (e.g., accessing internal APIs, databases) without proper authorization checks. This could involve using tools like `curl` or custom scripts within the pipeline.
    * **Credential Access:**  Tricking the plugin into revealing or using credentials in unintended ways, potentially by manipulating step parameters or exploiting vulnerabilities in how credentials are accessed and used within the declarative context.
* **Abusing Plugin-Specific Features:**
    * **Parameter Manipulation:** If the plugin allows passing parameters that influence resource access, an attacker might craft malicious parameter values to bypass intended restrictions. For example, specifying a path outside the allowed workspace.
    * **Step Chaining:** Combining different declarative steps in a way that circumvents permission checks. For instance, one step might retrieve information that another step uses to access a restricted resource, without the plugin verifying the combined effect.
    * **Exploiting Implicit Permissions:** Relying on implicit permissions granted to the Jenkins user or agent running the pipeline, which might be broader than intended for the specific pipeline's purpose. The plugin should enforce its own permission boundaries.
* **Leveraging Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries:** If the plugin relies on external libraries for resource access, vulnerabilities in those libraries could be exploited through the plugin's declarative steps if input is not properly sanitized or validated.

        print("\n### Detailed Impact Scenarios:\n")
        print("Successful exploitation of this threat can lead to various damaging outcomes:")
        print("""
* **Exposure of Sensitive Data:**
    * **Credentials Leakage:** Accessing and exfiltrating stored credentials for databases, cloud services, or other systems.
    * **Configuration Data Exposure:** Reading sensitive configuration files containing API keys, internal network details, etc.
    * **Source Code Theft:** Accessing and copying source code repositories if the pipeline has access.
* **Unauthorized Modification of System Resources:**
    * **Data Tampering:** Modifying data in databases or other storage systems.
    * **System Configuration Changes:** Altering system configurations on the Jenkins agent or master, potentially leading to instability or further security breaches.
    * **Deployment of Malicious Code:** Injecting malicious code into deployment packages or environments.
* **Escalation of Privileges within the Jenkins Environment:**
    * **Job Manipulation:** Creating, modifying, or deleting other Jenkins jobs.
    * **User Management:** Potentially gaining the ability to create or elevate user privileges within Jenkins.
    * **Plugin Management:**  In extreme cases, potentially installing or modifying other Jenkins plugins.
* **Lateral Movement within the Network:** If the Jenkins environment has network access to other systems, a compromised pipeline could be used as a launching point for attacks against those systems.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If pipelines are used to build and deploy software, a compromised pipeline could inject malicious code into the software supply chain, affecting downstream users.

        print("""
* **Declarative Step Implementations:** The code responsible for executing each declarative step (e.g., `sh`, `script`, custom steps) needs to include robust permission checks before accessing any resource.
* **Parameter Handling and Validation:** The mechanism for processing and validating parameters passed to declarative steps is crucial. Insufficient validation can allow attackers to inject malicious values that bypass security checks.
* **Resource Access Abstraction Layer (if any):** If the plugin has an internal layer for handling resource access, vulnerabilities in this layer could affect all steps that use it.
* **Integration with Jenkins Security Subsystem:** The plugin's interaction with Jenkins' existing security mechanisms (e.g., user permissions, credentials management) needs to be secure and correctly implemented. The plugin should not assume the pipeline execution context inherits excessive permissions.
* **Handling of Credentials within Declarative Syntax:** The way the plugin allows pipelines to access and use Jenkins credentials needs to be carefully designed to prevent unintended disclosure or misuse.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Insufficient or insecure error handling and logging can make it harder to detect and respond to malicious activity. Error messages should not reveal sensitive information.

    def _detailed_mitigation_recommendations(self):
        print("\n### Detailed Mitigation Recommendations:\n")
        print("To effectively mitigate this threat, the development team should focus on the following:")
        print("""
* **Implement Granular Permission Checks within Declarative Steps:**
    * **Resource Type Based Access Control:**  For each declarative step that accesses resources, implement checks based on the type of resource being accessed (e.g., file, network, credential).
    * **Action-Based Access Control:**  Verify the specific action being performed on the resource (e.g., read, write, execute).
    * **Contextual Permission Checks:** Consider the context of the pipeline execution, such as the user who triggered the pipeline, the branch being built, and the intended purpose of the step.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege by Default:** Design steps so that they have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended function.
* **Strengthen Parameter Handling and Validation:**
    * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input parameters to declarative steps to prevent injection attacks (e.g., path traversal, command injection).
    * **Schema Validation:** Define and enforce schemas for step parameters to ensure they conform to expected types and formats.
    * **Avoid Dynamic Interpretation of Unvalidated Input:** Be cautious about dynamically interpreting parameters that could lead to arbitrary resource access.
* **Develop a Secure Resource Access Abstraction Layer:**
    * **Centralized Permission Enforcement:** If the plugin uses an abstraction layer for resource access, implement permission checks within this layer to ensure consistent enforcement across all steps.
    * **Secure API Design:** Design the API for resource access to be secure by default, with clear and well-defined authorization requirements.
* **Enhance Integration with Jenkins Security Subsystem:**
    * **Leverage Jenkins Permissions:**  Integrate with Jenkins' existing permission system (e.g., item permissions, agent permissions) to enforce access controls.
    * **Secure Credential Management:**  Utilize Jenkins' credential management features securely and avoid storing or exposing credentials directly within pipeline definitions.
    * **Consider Security Realms and Authorization Strategies:** Ensure compatibility and proper integration with different Jenkins security realms and authorization strategies.
* **Secure Handling of Credentials in Declarative Syntax:**
    * **Use `credentials()` Step Securely:**  Ensure the `credentials()` step and any related mechanisms for accessing credentials are implemented securely, preventing unintended disclosure or misuse.
    * **Limit Credential Scope:** Encourage the use of scoped credentials that are restricted to specific projects or pipelines.
* **Improve Error Handling and Logging:**
    * **Secure Error Messages:** Avoid including sensitive information in error messages.
    * **Comprehensive Logging:** Log all resource access attempts, including successful and failed attempts, along with relevant context (user, pipeline, step).
    * **Auditing Capabilities:** Provide mechanisms for administrators to audit resource access activity within pipelines.
* **Implement Security Best Practices in Development:**
    * **Secure Coding Guidelines:** Adhere to secure coding practices throughout the plugin's development.
    * **Regular Security Reviews:** Conduct regular security reviews of the plugin's code, focusing on resource access control logic.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to detect security flaws.
