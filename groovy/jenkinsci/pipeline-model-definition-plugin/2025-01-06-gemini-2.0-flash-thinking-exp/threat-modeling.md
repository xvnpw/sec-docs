# Threat Model Analysis for jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Crafted Pipeline Definitions](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_crafted_pipeline_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with permission to create or modify Jenkins pipelines could craft a malicious Declarative Pipeline definition that exploits vulnerabilities in the plugin's parsing or interpretation logic. This could involve injecting Groovy code or other scripting languages that Jenkins executes, potentially through loopholes in how the plugin handles specific syntax or constructs.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Jenkins controller, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data (including credentials), modify configurations, install malicious plugins, or launch further attacks on connected systems.
*   **Affected Component:** Pipeline Definition Parser, Interpreter Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all parts of the pipeline definition processed by the plugin.
    *   Enforce strict syntax checking and validation to prevent the execution of unintended code.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to pipeline creation and modification permissions.
    *   Regularly update the plugin to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization for pipeline execution to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    *   Employ static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in pipeline definitions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion during Pipeline Parsing](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion_during_pipeline_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could create a pipeline definition with excessively complex or deeply nested structures, or containing extremely long strings, that overwhelms the plugin's parser during the interpretation phase. This could lead to high CPU or memory consumption on the Jenkins controller, making it unresponsive or crashing the service.
*   **Impact:**  Disruption of Jenkins services, preventing users from running builds, accessing the UI, or managing the system. This can lead to significant delays in software delivery and operational disruptions.
*   **Affected Component:** Pipeline Definition Parser, Interpreter Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the complexity and size of pipeline definitions that the plugin can process.
    *   Implement timeouts and resource limits for the parsing and interpretation processes.
    *   Employ efficient parsing algorithms and data structures to minimize resource consumption.
    *   Monitor Jenkins controller resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Command Injection through Pipeline Steps Leveraging User-Controlled Input](./threats/command_injection_through_pipeline_steps_leveraging_user-controlled_input.md)

*   **Description:** If pipeline steps within the Declarative Pipeline allow the execution of external commands based on user-provided input (e.g., parameters), and the plugin doesn't properly sanitize or validate this input, an attacker could inject malicious commands that will be executed on the Jenkins agent or controller.
*   **Impact:**  Ability to execute arbitrary commands on the Jenkins agent or controller, depending on the execution context of the vulnerable step. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Pipeline Step Execution Module, potentially specific custom steps or integrations *provided or facilitated by the plugin's declarative syntax*
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in commands executed by pipeline steps.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-provided data used in command execution *within the declarative pipeline context*.
    *   Use parameterized commands or secure APIs instead of directly constructing shell commands.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the execution context of pipeline steps.

## Threat: [Unintended Access to Resources due to Insufficient Permission Checks](./threats/unintended_access_to_resources_due_to_insufficient_permission_checks.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious pipeline definition might be crafted to access resources (files, network locations, credentials) that the pipeline execution context should not have access to. This could occur if the plugin doesn't enforce proper permission checks before allowing access to these resources *within its declarative constructs*.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, unauthorized modification of system resources, or escalation of privileges within the Jenkins environment.
*   **Affected Component:** Resource Access Control Module *within the plugin's scope*, Pipeline Step Execution Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust permission checks for all resource access operations *handled by the plugin*.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to pipeline execution contexts *defined declaratively*.
    *   Clearly define and enforce the boundaries of what resources a pipeline should be able to access *through the plugin's features*.

## Threat: [Credential Leakage through Insecure Handling of Credentials in Pipeline Definitions](./threats/credential_leakage_through_insecure_handling_of_credentials_in_pipeline_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** If the plugin handles or logs credential information used within pipeline definitions insecurely (e.g., storing them in plain text, including them in error messages or debug logs), attackers might be able to extract these credentials.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of stored credentials, allowing attackers to access external systems or services that these credentials provide access to.
*   **Affected Component:** Credential Management Integration *within the plugin's handling of declarative syntax*, Logging Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Leverage Jenkins' built-in credential management system securely *and ensure the plugin properly utilizes it*.
    *   Avoid storing credentials directly in pipeline definitions *and ensure the plugin discourages this practice*.
    *   Ensure that credential information is not included in error messages or debug logs *generated by the plugin*.
    *   Implement secure logging practices and restrict access to log files.

## Threat: [Agent Compromise through Maliciously Crafted Pipeline Steps](./threats/agent_compromise_through_maliciously_crafted_pipeline_steps.md)

*   **Description:** A pipeline definition could be designed to execute malicious code on a Jenkins agent, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in how the plugin interacts with agents or how agents execute steps *initiated through the declarative pipeline*. This could involve leveraging specific agent capabilities or vulnerabilities in the agent's operating system or installed software.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of Jenkins agents, allowing attackers to access resources on the agent machines, pivot to other systems on the network, or use them as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Agent Communication Module *as it relates to declarative pipeline execution*, Pipeline Step Execution Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden Jenkins agents by applying security best practices and keeping software up to date.
    *   Restrict the capabilities of Jenkins agents using appropriate security configurations.
    *   Monitor agent activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   Use secure communication protocols between the controller and agents.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies Leading to Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies_leading_to_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** The `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` might rely on third-party libraries or components that contain known security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited through crafted pipeline definitions or by directly targeting the plugin's functionality that utilizes the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure to vulnerabilities within the dependencies, potentially leading to various attack vectors such as remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** Dependency Management, potentially various modules utilizing the vulnerable dependency
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability - including here as some dependency vulnerabilities can be critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly scan the plugin's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency checking tools.
    *   Keep dependencies up to date with the latest secure versions.
    *   Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to manage and monitor dependencies.
