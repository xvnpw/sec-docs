## Deep Analysis: Use Stolen Credentials to Access Other Systems

This analysis focuses on the attack tree path: **"Use Stolen Credentials to Access Other Systems"** following a successful credential theft from a Jenkins environment utilizing the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`.

**Context:**  The attacker has already successfully compromised the Jenkins environment and extracted valid credentials. This could have been achieved through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in Jenkins itself, the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`, or through social engineering targeting users with access.

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

This attack vector hinges on the principle of **credential reuse**. Attackers understand that users and systems often employ the same or similar credentials across multiple platforms for convenience. Jenkins, being a central automation hub, often holds credentials with broad access to various connected systems.

**Key Stages:**

1. **Credential Exploitation:** The attacker leverages the stolen credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys, SSH keys, OAuth tokens, etc.) obtained from Jenkins.

2. **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies potential target systems and applications that Jenkins interacts with. This involves reconnaissance within the Jenkins configuration, pipeline scripts, and potentially network traffic analysis if they have gained sufficient access.

3. **Access Attempt:** The attacker attempts to authenticate to the identified target systems using the stolen credentials. This could involve:
    * **Direct Login:**  Attempting to log into web interfaces, SSH servers, or other services using the stolen username and password.
    * **API Interaction:** Using stolen API keys or tokens to make authorized API calls to cloud providers, artifact repositories, or other services.
    * **SSH Key Usage:** Utilizing stolen SSH private keys to gain access to remote servers.
    * **Configuration Injection:**  Injecting stolen credentials into configuration files or environment variables of other applications.
    * **Exploiting Trust Relationships:** Leveraging existing trust relationships established by Jenkins (e.g., using Jenkins' service account credentials on other systems).

**Potential Target Systems and Applications:**

Given the context of Jenkins and the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`, the potential targets are numerous and varied. Here are some common examples:

* **Source Code Management (SCM) Systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket):** Jenkins often needs credentials to access and manage repositories. Stolen credentials could allow attackers to:
    * **Modify code:** Inject malicious code into the codebase.
    * **Exfiltrate sensitive data:** Access private repositories and intellectual property.
    * **Compromise build processes:** Manipulate the build pipeline to introduce backdoors.
* **Artifact Repositories (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory):** Jenkins uses these to store and retrieve build artifacts. Stolen credentials could allow attackers to:
    * **Inject malicious artifacts:** Replace legitimate artifacts with compromised versions.
    * **Exfiltrate sensitive artifacts:** Access proprietary software or data.
* **Cloud Providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP):** Jenkins frequently manages deployments and infrastructure in the cloud. Stolen credentials could grant access to:
    * **Provision and de-provision resources:** Disrupt services or incur significant costs.
    * **Access sensitive data stored in cloud services (S3 buckets, databases, etc.).**
    * **Compromise cloud infrastructure:** Gain control over virtual machines and other resources.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible):** Jenkins might use credentials to interact with IaC tools for infrastructure management. Stolen credentials could allow attackers to:
    * **Modify infrastructure configurations:** Introduce backdoors or weaken security.
    * **Provision malicious infrastructure:** Deploy compromised resources within the environment.
* **Databases:** Jenkins pipelines might interact with databases for testing or deployment. Stolen credentials could grant access to:
    * **Exfiltrate sensitive data:** Access customer information, financial records, etc.
    * **Modify or delete data:** Disrupt operations or cause data loss.
* **Other Applications and Services:** Any system that Jenkins integrates with, such as:
    * **Issue trackers (e.g., Jira):**  Potentially manipulate issue tracking data.
    * **Monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana):**  Disable alerts or gain insights into system performance.
    * **Communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):**  Potentially send malicious messages or gain access to sensitive conversations.
* **Internal Network Resources:** Depending on the network configuration and the privileges of the stolen credentials, attackers might be able to access other internal systems and resources.

**Implications:**

The successful execution of this attack path has severe implications:

* **Lateral Movement:** This is the primary goal of this attack vector. It allows attackers to move beyond the initial Jenkins compromise and gain access to other critical systems within the network.
* **Data Breach:** Accessing other systems significantly increases the potential for data breaches, allowing attackers to steal sensitive information.
* **System Compromise:** Gaining control over other systems can lead to further exploitation, including installing malware, establishing persistence, and launching further attacks.
* **Disruption of Services:** Attackers could disrupt critical business processes by manipulating or taking down connected systems.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack impacting multiple systems can severely damage an organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  The consequences of data breaches, service disruptions, and recovery efforts can result in significant financial losses.
* **Compliance Violations:** Accessing and potentially exfiltrating data from various systems can lead to violations of regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

**Specific Considerations for `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`:**

The `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` introduces specific considerations for this attack path:

* **Credentials Stored in Pipeline Definitions:**  While discouraged, developers might inadvertently store credentials directly within pipeline definitions. If these definitions are accessible after the initial Jenkins compromise, the attacker has a direct source of credentials.
* **Shared Libraries and Global Variables:** Credentials might be stored in shared libraries or global variables used by pipelines. Compromise of these resources exposes those credentials.
* **Plugin-Specific Credentials:** The plugin itself might interact with other systems using its own set of credentials. If these are compromised, they can be used for lateral movement.
* **Dynamic Credential Provisioning:** Pipelines might dynamically retrieve credentials from external secrets management systems. Understanding how these systems are accessed and authenticated is crucial for identifying potential targets.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent or mitigate this attack path, the following strategies are crucial:

* **Robust Credential Management:**
    * **Utilize Jenkins Credentials Provider:** Store credentials securely within Jenkins' built-in credential management system, avoiding direct embedding in pipeline code.
    * **Implement Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to Jenkins credentials for accessing other systems.
    * **Regularly Rotate Credentials:** Change credentials on a scheduled basis to limit the window of opportunity for attackers.
    * **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Mandate complex and unique passwords for all accounts.
    * **Utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all user accounts accessing Jenkins and critical connected systems.
* **Secure Pipeline Development Practices:**
    * **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never embed credentials directly in pipeline definitions or scripts.
    * **Utilize Secrets Management Solutions:** Integrate with dedicated secrets management tools like HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk, or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve credentials.
    * **Secure Shared Libraries and Global Variables:** Implement strict access controls and review processes for shared libraries and global variables to prevent unauthorized modification or access to credentials.
    * **Regularly Review Pipeline Definitions:** Audit pipeline definitions for potential security vulnerabilities, including inadvertently stored credentials.
* **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromise. Restrict network access from the Jenkins server to only the necessary systems.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity, such as unusual login attempts or API calls from Jenkins or other systems.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the Jenkins environment and connected systems.
* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches and minimize damage.
* **Keep Jenkins and Plugins Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Jenkins and all installed plugins, including the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin`, to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Jenkins Instance:** Limit the privileges of the Jenkins service account itself to only what is absolutely necessary.
* **Secure Communication Channels:** Ensure secure communication (HTTPS) is enforced for all interactions between Jenkins and other systems.

**Conclusion:**

The "Use Stolen Credentials to Access Other Systems" attack path represents a significant risk following a successful Jenkins compromise. By leveraging stolen credentials, attackers can achieve lateral movement, potentially compromising sensitive data and critical infrastructure. A layered security approach, focusing on robust credential management, secure development practices, network segmentation, and continuous monitoring, is essential to mitigate this threat and protect the organization from significant damage. Understanding the specific nuances introduced by the `pipeline-model-definition-plugin` is crucial for implementing targeted security measures.
