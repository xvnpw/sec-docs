## High-Risk Attack Sub-Tree: Compromising Application via Pipeline Model Definition Plugin

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized control over the application or its environment by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Jenkins Pipeline Model Definition Plugin.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

    * Exploit Malicious `Jenkinsfile` Execution [CRITICAL]
        * Inject Malicious Code into `Jenkinsfile` [CRITICAL]
            * Compromise Source Code Repository [CRITICAL]
        * Introduce Malicious Shared Libraries/Scripts [CRITICAL]
            * Compromise Shared Library Repository [CRITICAL]
            * Introduce Malicious Steps in Shared Pipeline [CRITICAL]
        * Leverage Unsanitized Input in `Jenkinsfile` [CRITICAL]
            * Inject Malicious Commands via Parameters [CRITICAL]
    * Privilege Escalation via Plugin Features [CRITICAL]
        * Leverage Privileged Steps or Agents [CRITICAL]

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application via Pipeline Model Definition Plugin [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** This is the overarching goal. Attackers aim to exploit weaknesses in the plugin to gain control over the application or its environment.
* **Why Critical:** Successful compromise at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective, potentially leading to complete system takeover, data breaches, or service disruption.

**2. Exploit Malicious `Jenkinsfile` Execution [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging the plugin's core functionality of executing user-defined `Jenkinsfile` to introduce malicious actions.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:** This path is highly likely because it directly targets the plugin's primary function. The impact is critical as it allows for arbitrary code execution within the Jenkins environment.

**3. Inject Malicious Code into `Jenkinsfile` [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:**  Directly inserting malicious code into the `Jenkinsfile` that will be executed by the Jenkins agent.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:** This is a direct and effective way to gain control. The impact is critical as it allows for arbitrary code execution.

**4. Compromise Source Code Repository [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to the repository where the `Jenkinsfile` is stored and modifying it.
* **Why Critical:** While the likelihood is medium, the impact is critical. Compromising the repository allows for persistent and widespread injection of malicious code, affecting all pipelines using that `Jenkinsfile`.

**5. Introduce Malicious Shared Libraries/Scripts [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code into shared libraries or scripts that are used by the `Jenkinsfile`.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:** This allows for indirect injection of malicious code, potentially affecting multiple pipelines and making it harder to trace. The impact is critical due to the potential for widespread compromise.

**6. Compromise Shared Library Repository [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to the repository containing shared pipeline libraries and modifying them.
* **Why Critical:** Similar to compromising the main repository, this allows for the injection of malicious code that can be reused across multiple pipelines, leading to a critical impact.

**7. Introduce Malicious Steps in Shared Pipeline [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Modifying a shared pipeline definition to include malicious steps that will be executed by the target application's pipeline.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:** This is a direct way to inject malicious code that will be executed. The likelihood is medium, and the impact is critical.

**8. Leverage Unsanitized Input in `Jenkinsfile` [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting insufficient sanitization of pipeline parameters or environment variables used in shell commands or scripts within the `Jenkinsfile`.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:** This is a common vulnerability with a medium to high likelihood. The impact can range from significant to critical, potentially leading to command injection and system compromise.

**9. Inject Malicious Commands via Parameters [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious commands through pipeline parameters that are not properly sanitized before being used in shell commands or scripts.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:** This is a highly likely attack vector due to the commonality of command injection vulnerabilities. The impact can be significant to critical, allowing for arbitrary command execution.

**10. Privilege Escalation via Plugin Features [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Utilizing legitimate plugin features in unintended ways to gain higher privileges than initially authorized.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:** If pipelines are configured with elevated privileges, this becomes a high-risk path for attackers to abuse those privileges. The impact is critical as it allows for actions that would otherwise be restricted.

**11. Leverage Privileged Steps or Agents [CRITICAL]:**

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting pipelines or agents that are running with elevated privileges to execute malicious commands or access sensitive resources.
* **Why High-Risk and Critical:**  The likelihood is medium if such configurations exist, and the impact is critical as it allows for actions with elevated permissions, potentially leading to system compromise.
