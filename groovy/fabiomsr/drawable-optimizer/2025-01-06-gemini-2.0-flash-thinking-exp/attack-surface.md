# Attack Surface Analysis for fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Input Image Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input_image_files.md)

*   **Description:** Providing specially crafted image files (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying image processing logic *within* `drawable-optimizer` or its immediate processing pipeline (excluding vulnerabilities solely within external dependencies).
    *   **How drawable-optimizer contributes:** The core function of `drawable-optimizer` is to process these input files. If its own code or the way it orchestrates the processing of these files has flaws, it can be directly exploited by malicious input.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted PNG file exploits a buffer overflow in `drawable-optimizer`'s internal image handling routine (not solely within a dependency like `libpng`), leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service (crashing the optimization process or the build system), information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within `drawable-optimizer` itself to check for malformed file structures or unexpected data.
        *   Employ secure coding practices within `drawable-optimizer` to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or integer overflows during image processing.
        *   Run `drawable-optimizer` in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Attack Surface: [Zip Slip Vulnerability (if processing zipped drawables)](./attack_surfaces/zip_slip_vulnerability__if_processing_zipped_drawables_.md)

*   **Description:** If `drawable-optimizer` processes zipped archives of drawable files, a malicious zip archive could contain entries with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../evil.sh`). When extracted by `drawable-optimizer`, this could overwrite critical files or place malicious files in unexpected locations.
    *   **How drawable-optimizer contributes:** The library's own zip extraction logic is the direct cause of this vulnerability. If it doesn't properly sanitize file paths during extraction, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A developer provides a zip file containing an image file named `../../../../home/user/.bashrc`. If `drawable-optimizer`'s extraction code doesn't prevent path traversal, it could overwrite the user's bash configuration file.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to code execution, configuration changes, or data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the zip extraction logic within `drawable-optimizer` properly validates and sanitizes file paths before extraction, preventing path traversal. Use secure extraction libraries and configurations.
        *   Avoid processing zipped archives from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [SVG Specific Vulnerabilities (if processing SVG files)](./attack_surfaces/svg_specific_vulnerabilities__if_processing_svg_files_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious SVG files can contain embedded scripts that could be executed if `drawable-optimizer` doesn't properly sanitize or neutralize them before or after optimization.
    *   **How drawable-optimizer contributes:** If `drawable-optimizer`'s SVG processing doesn't strip or escape potentially malicious scripts, it directly contributes to this attack surface. This is distinct from vulnerabilities within the *underlying* SVG parsing library.
    *   **Example:** A malicious SVG file contains embedded JavaScript. `drawable-optimizer` optimizes the file but doesn't remove the script. If this optimized SVG is later used in a web context, the script could execute.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (if the output is used in web contexts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if the output context allows script execution).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement SVG sanitization within `drawable-optimizer` to remove or neutralize potentially malicious scripts and other active content.
        *   Configure the underlying SVG optimization tools used by `drawable-optimizer` to remove scripting elements.
