# Threat Model Analysis for fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer

## Threat: [Malicious Input Files](./threats/malicious_input_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted image files as input to the `drawable-optimizer`. This could be done by uploading malicious images through application forms or by manipulating data sent to the optimization process. The attacker aims to exploit vulnerabilities in the library's image parsing or processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The optimizer consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) trying to process the malicious file, making the application unresponsive.
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):**  Vulnerabilities in the parsing logic could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the optimizer.
        *   **File System Access:**  If the library has path traversal vulnerabilities, a malicious input file could be crafted to read or write files outside the intended directories.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Image Decoding/Parsing Module
        *   Optimization Engine
        *   File I/O operations within the library
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict validation of image file types, sizes, and potentially internal structure before passing them to the optimizer.
        *   Run the `drawable-optimizer` in a sandboxed environment with limited access to system resources and the file system.
        *   Implement timeouts and resource limits (CPU, memory) for the optimization process to prevent DoS.
        *   Keep the `drawable-optimizer` library and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid or malicious input and prevent crashes that could reveal information.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Optimization Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_optimization_logic.md)

*   **Description:** The `drawable-optimizer`'s internal algorithms for image optimization might contain bugs or flaws. An attacker might trigger these flaws by providing specific types of images or by manipulating optimization parameters (if exposed).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unexpected Output:** The optimized images might be corrupted, malformed, or contain unintended artifacts, leading to application errors or visual glitches.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** In rare cases, vulnerabilities could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the server's memory during the optimization process.
        *   **Buffer Overflows/Integer Overflows:**  Flaws in handling image dimensions or data sizes could cause buffer or integer overflows, potentially leading to crashes or code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Specific optimization algorithms (e.g., compression, format conversion)
        *   Memory management within the optimization process
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `drawable-optimizer` library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   If feasible, conduct code reviews of the `drawable-optimizer` library (or its usage within your application) to identify potential logic flaws.
        *   Perform thorough testing with a wide range of image types and sizes to identify unexpected behavior or errors.
        *   If optimization parameters are exposed to users, sanitize and validate them to prevent the triggering of specific vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Output Manipulation Leading to Malicious Content](./threats/output_manipulation_leading_to_malicious_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might find a way to influence the output of the `drawable-optimizer` so that the optimized images contain malicious content. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities to inject scripts or other harmful data into the image metadata or pixel data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the optimized images are served directly to web browsers and contain malicious scripts, it could lead to XSS attacks on users viewing those images.
        *   **Client-Side Exploits:**  Malicious content within the image could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in image rendering libraries or applications on the client-side.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Image Encoding/Writing Module
        *   Metadata handling within the library
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS if optimized images are served to web browsers.
        *   While challenging for binary data, consider if any metadata or textual parts of the output can be sanitized.
        *   Educate users and developers about the potential risks of rendering images from untrusted sources.
        *   Keep the `drawable-optimizer` updated to address any vulnerabilities that could allow output manipulation.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The `drawable-optimizer` library relies on other third-party libraries. These dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies could have similar impacts as exploiting vulnerabilities in `drawable-optimizer` itself, including DoS, ACE, and information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Third-party libraries used by `drawable-optimizer`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan the project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
        *   Keep the `drawable-optimizer` and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions that include security patches.
        *   Implement a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) process to manage and monitor the security of third-party components.
