## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code on Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_execute_arbitrary_code_on_server__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining the ability to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Drawable Optimizer Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_drawable_optimizer_library__critical_node_.md)

This represents the primary avenue for achieving the attacker's goal, focusing on weaknesses within the `drawable-optimizer` library itself. Exploiting vulnerabilities here bypasses application-level defenses and directly leverages the library's functionality against the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__critical_node___high-risk_path.md)

*   **Input Manipulation ──── Supply Malicious Filename/Path:**
        *   An attacker attempts to inject malicious commands by crafting filenames or paths that are processed by the `drawable-optimizer`. If the application doesn't sanitize these inputs properly before passing them to the optimizer, the attacker can embed shell commands within the filename or path.
    *   **Vulnerable Command Construction ──── Optimizer Constructs Shell Command Insecurely:**
        *   The `drawable-optimizer` likely uses external tools like `optipng` or `jpegoptim`. If the library constructs the commands to execute these tools by directly concatenating user-supplied input (like filenames) without proper escaping or parameterization, it becomes vulnerable to command injection. The attacker's malicious filename or path is then interpreted as a command by the shell.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerable Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerable_dependencies__critical_node___high-risk_path.md)

*   **Identify Vulnerable Underlying Tools ──── Determine Versions of optipng, jpegoptim, etc.:**
        *   Attackers will attempt to identify the specific versions of the underlying image optimization tools used by the `drawable-optimizer`. They can then search for known vulnerabilities associated with those versions in public databases.
    *   **Trigger Vulnerability via Optimizer ──── Pass Input That Exploits the Underlying Tool:**
        *   Once a vulnerability in an underlying tool is identified, the attacker crafts specific image inputs or parameters that, when processed by the `drawable-optimizer` and passed to the vulnerable tool, trigger the vulnerability. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the underlying tool, which can then compromise the server.
