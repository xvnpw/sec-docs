# Threat Model Analysis for fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer

## Threat: [Malicious Drawable Processing - Code Execution](./threats/malicious_drawable_processing_-_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious drawable file (e.g., SVG, PNG, XML) specifically designed to exploit a vulnerability within `drawable-optimizer`'s parsing or optimization modules. When `drawable-optimizer` processes this malicious file during the build process, it triggers the vulnerability (such as a buffer overflow or format string bug). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the build machine, potentially gaining full control over the build environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the build machine.
    *   Complete compromise of the build environment, including access to source code, build secrets, and signing keys.
    *   Injection of malware or backdoors into the Android application being built.
    *   Data exfiltration from the build environment.
*   **Affected Component:** Drawable Parsing and Optimization Modules (SVG parser, PNG optimizer, XML drawable processor).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `drawable-optimizer` updated:** Regularly update to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in the library and its dependencies.
    *   **Run in Sandboxed Environment:** Execute `drawable-optimizer` within a sandboxed or containerized build environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization of all drawable files *before* they are processed by `drawable-optimizer`. This might include file type checks, size limits, and potentially more advanced static analysis of drawable content.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Limits:** Monitor resource consumption (CPU, memory) during the build process when `drawable-optimizer` is running. Set resource limits to prevent excessive consumption that could indicate a DoS or exploit attempt.
    *   **Code Audits and Security Reviews:** If feasible, conduct code audits or security reviews of `drawable-optimizer`'s source code to identify potential vulnerabilities proactively.

## Threat: [Malicious Drawable Processing - Denial of Service](./threats/malicious_drawable_processing_-_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted drawable file as input to `drawable-optimizer`. This file is designed to exploit inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in the library's processing logic, causing it to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) during optimization. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, making the build process extremely slow, unresponsive, or causing it to crash entirely. The attacker aims to disrupt the development workflow and prevent successful application builds.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the build process, significantly delaying development timelines.
    *   Increased build times, potentially making development cycles impractical.
    *   Build failures and inability to release application updates.
    *   Wasted development resources due to build process disruptions.
*   **Affected Component:** Drawable Parsing and Optimization Modules (SVG parser, PNG optimizer, XML drawable processor).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement input validation to reject excessively large or complex drawable files before processing.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU time) for the `drawable-optimizer` process to prevent runaway resource consumption.
    *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for `drawable-optimizer` operations. If optimization takes longer than expected, terminate the process to prevent indefinite hangs.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor build process performance and resource usage. Set up alerts for unusual spikes in resource consumption during drawable optimization.
    *   **Regular Performance Testing:** Conduct performance testing with a variety of drawable files, including potentially complex ones, to identify and address performance bottlenecks in `drawable-optimizer`'s processing.
