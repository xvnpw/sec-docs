# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Reduce the size of Android application packages (APKs).
  - Improve application performance by reducing resource loading times.
  - Decrease bandwidth consumption for application distribution.
  - Enhance user experience by providing faster application downloads and installations.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of introducing defects into drawable resources during optimization, potentially leading to visual artifacts or application crashes.
  - Risk of increasing build times if the optimization process is not efficient.
  - Risk of incompatibility with certain drawable formats or Android versions if the optimization is not thoroughly tested.
  - Supply chain risk associated with using external libraries for optimization, which could introduce vulnerabilities if compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Gradle plugin distribution through a package repository (e.g., Maven Central), which typically includes checksum verification. (Implemented: Package Repository - assumed)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on external libraries for image optimization, which may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Potential for denial-of-service if the plugin is used to process extremely large or malformed drawable files.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in used libraries.
  - security control: Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) into the build process to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities in the plugin itself.
  - security control: Consider code signing the plugin to ensure integrity and authenticity of the distributed artifact.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable as this is a build-time tool and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable as this is a build-time tool and does not manage access control.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement robust input validation for all drawable files processed by the plugin to prevent processing of malicious or malformed files that could lead to unexpected behavior or denial of service.
    - Requirement: Validate configuration parameters provided to the plugin to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable as drawable optimization typically does not involve cryptographic operations. However, if future features involve secure handling of drawables (e.g., encrypted drawables), cryptographic requirements would need to be considered.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Android application development and build process.
  - Distribution of Android applications to end-users.
- Data to Protect:
  - Drawable resources: Sensitivity is generally low to medium, depending on the content of the images. Potential confidentiality concerns if drawables contain sensitive information (e.g., branding assets, logos). Integrity is important to ensure correct application functionality and visual appearance.
  - Plugin integrity: High sensitivity. Compromise of the plugin could lead to widespread impact on applications using it. Integrity and availability are critical.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

  - Is there a code signing process in place for the distributed plugin artifact?
  - What type of static analysis security testing (SAST) is performed, if any?
  - How are configuration parameters validated to prevent potential misconfiguration vulnerabilities?
- Assumptions:
  - The plugin is intended for use by Android developers to optimize drawable resources in their applications.
  - The plugin is distributed through a public Gradle plugin repository like Maven Central.
  - The build process for the plugin is automated using a CI/CD system, likely GitHub Actions.
  - Security checks, such as dependency scanning and potentially SAST, are or will be integrated into the build process.
  - Developers using the plugin are responsible for ensuring the security of their own development environments and applications.
