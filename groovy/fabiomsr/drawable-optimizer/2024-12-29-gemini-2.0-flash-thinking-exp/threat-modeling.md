Here is the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving the `drawable-optimizer` library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Drawable Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious drawable file (e.g., a PNG with an embedded exploit) and provides it as input to the `drawable-optimizer`. The optimizer, upon processing this file, triggers a vulnerability (like a buffer overflow) in its underlying image processing libraries *used by the optimizer*, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server or application, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying image processing libraries used by `drawable-optimizer` (e.g., libraries for PNG, JPG, SVG decoding).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `drawable-optimizer` and its dependencies (especially image processing libraries) updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Implement strict input validation to check file types and potentially scan files for known malicious patterns before passing them to the optimizer.
        *   Run the `drawable-optimizer` in a sandboxed environment or with restricted privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Drawable Causing Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted drawable file that, when processed by the `drawable-optimizer`, causes *the optimizer itself* to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) or crash due to a bug in the optimizer or its dependencies. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or unavailable.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, impacting users and potentially leading to financial losses or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `drawable-optimizer`'s core optimization logic or underlying image processing libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, processing time limits) for the `drawable-optimizer` process.
        *   Implement input validation to reject excessively large or complex drawable files.
        *   Monitor the resource usage of the `drawable-optimizer` and implement alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Consider using a separate process or container for the optimizer to isolate potential crashes.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The `drawable-optimizer` relies on other libraries for image processing and other functionalities. These dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if not properly managed and updated, directly impacting the security of the `drawable-optimizer`'s operations.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to RCE, DoS, or information disclosure *through the optimizer*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Third-party dependencies of `drawable-optimizer`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit the dependencies of `drawable-optimizer` for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency checkers or vulnerability scanners.
        *   Keep all dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and update recommendations.
