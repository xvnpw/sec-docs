**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Exploit Input Manipulation (Critical Node):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code through manipulated input, specifically SVG files.
    *   **Supply Malicious SVG:** An attacker provides a specially crafted SVG file to the application's workflow. This could happen through:
        *   Compromising a developer's machine and injecting the SVG into the project's assets.
        *   Tricking a developer into uploading a malicious SVG from an untrusted source.
    *   **Optimizer Processes Malicious SVG (Critical Node):** The `drawable-optimizer` processes the malicious SVG without proper sanitization. This means:
        *   The optimizer's code does not remove or neutralize embedded scripts or potentially harmful elements within the SVG.
        *   The optimized output still contains the malicious code.
    *   **Application renders the malicious SVG (Critical Node):** The application integrates the optimized SVG and renders it in a way that allows the malicious code to execute. This can occur:
        *   When the SVG is displayed directly in a web browser or a web view component.
        *   When the SVG is downloaded and opened by a user's application that can execute embedded scripts.
    *   **Execute Malicious Code in User Context (Critical Node):** The embedded malicious code (typically JavaScript in SVG) executes within the user's browser or application context, allowing the attacker to:
        *   Steal sensitive information like cookies, session tokens, or other data stored in the browser.
        *   Redirect the user to a malicious website, potentially for phishing or further exploitation.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user on the compromised application, leveraging their authenticated session.

**2. Exploit Processing Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the `drawable-optimizer` processes image files, specifically through command injection.
    *   **Command Injection (Critical Node):** The `drawable-optimizer` uses external tools (like `optipng`, `jpegtran`) by executing shell commands.
    *   **Optimizer uses external tools unsafely (Critical Node):** The optimizer constructs shell commands by directly concatenating user-controlled input (like filenames or metadata) without proper sanitization or escaping.
    *   **Supply Input with Malicious Command:** An attacker provides input (filename or metadata) containing shell metacharacters or commands. Examples include:
        *   A filename like `; rm -rf /` which, if not properly handled, could lead to the deletion of critical files.
        *   Image metadata fields crafted to inject commands.
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Commands on Server (Critical Node):** The vulnerable command construction allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, with the privileges of the user running the optimizer process. This can lead to:
        *   Reading sensitive files from the server's file system.
        *   Modifying application files, potentially injecting backdoors or malicious code.
        *   Establishing persistent access to the server for future attacks.

**3. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries used by the `drawable-optimizer`.
    *   **Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies (Critical Node):** The `drawable-optimizer` relies on external libraries for image processing. These libraries might have publicly known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Drawable Optimizer uses vulnerable libraries (Critical Node):** The application uses a version of `drawable-optimizer` that depends on vulnerable versions of these image processing libraries.
    *   **Trigger Vulnerability through Input:** An attacker provides a specific type of image file or manipulates image data in a way that triggers the vulnerable code path within the dependency. This often involves:
        *   Supplying an image in a format known to be vulnerable in the specific library version.
        *   Crafting image data that exploits a parsing or processing flaw in the library.
    *   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (Critical Node):** By triggering the vulnerability in the dependency, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. This means:
        *   The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the user running the application.
        *   This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the server, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
