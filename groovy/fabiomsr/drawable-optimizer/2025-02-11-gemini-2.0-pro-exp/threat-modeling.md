# Threat Model Analysis for fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer

## Threat: [Malicious Executable Replacement](./threats/malicious_executable_replacement.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Executable Replacement

    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate `drawable-optimizer` executable with a malicious version. The attacker might achieve this through compromised update mechanisms, supply chain attacks, or by gaining write access to the installation directory where `drawable-optimizer` resides. The malicious executable could then perform any action the attacker desires, such as stealing data, installing malware, or disrupting the system. This directly impacts `drawable-optimizer` because the attack vector is the replacement of the tool itself.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `drawable-optimizer` executable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify executable checksum (SHA-256) before execution.  The application must securely store and compare this checksum.
        *   Use a secure package manager with signed packages and pinned versions (e.g., `pip` with requirements.txt and verification).
        *   Run `drawable-optimizer` in a sandboxed environment (container, restricted user account) to limit the impact of a compromised executable.
        *   Regularly audit the installation directory of `drawable-optimizer` for unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Command-Line Argument Injection](./threats/command-line_argument_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Command-Line Argument Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the command-line arguments passed to `drawable-optimizer`. If the application dynamically constructs these arguments based on user input without *extremely* careful sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious options.  This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as writing files to arbitrary locations, deleting files, or potentially even executing arbitrary commands *if* `drawable-optimizer` itself has exploitable vulnerabilities related to how it parses and handles arguments. This is a direct threat because it targets the way the application interacts with the `drawable-optimizer` CLI.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, file system manipulation, potential code execution (contingent on vulnerabilities within `drawable-optimizer`'s argument handling).
    *   **Affected Component:** The command-line argument parsing logic within `drawable-optimizer`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Hardcode command-line arguments whenever possible. Avoid dynamic construction from user input.
        *   If dynamic arguments are *absolutely* necessary, use a strict whitelist of allowed values and characters.  Do *not* simply escape special characters; whitelisting is crucial.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided input that *must* be used in arguments, even after whitelisting. This is a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Code Execution (within `drawable-optimizer`)](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_code_execution__within__drawable-optimizer__.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Code Execution (within `drawable-optimizer`)

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability *within* `drawable-optimizer` itself or one of its direct dependencies (e.g., a buffer overflow in an image parsing library that `drawable-optimizer` uses *internally*) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  If `drawable-optimizer` is running with elevated privileges (which it should *not* be), the attacker could gain those privileges. This is distinct from the "Input Image Tampering" threat because this focuses on vulnerabilities *within* the optimizer or its direct, internal dependencies, not just the general image processing libraries.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any vulnerable code within `drawable-optimizer` or its *direct, internal* dependencies that allows for arbitrary code execution. This is harder to pinpoint without specific vulnerability analysis of the codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run `drawable-optimizer` with the *absolute least* privileges necessary.  Never run it as root or with administrative privileges.
        *   Use a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container with a non-root user, a restricted user account) to isolate `drawable-optimizer` from the rest of the system.
        *   Keep `drawable-optimizer` and its *direct* dependencies (check its `setup.py` or equivalent) up-to-date to patch any known security vulnerabilities.  This is crucial.
        *   Regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting `drawable-optimizer` and its interaction with the application, are highly recommended.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion *caused by drawable-optimizer*)](./threats/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_caused_by_drawable-optimizer_.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion *caused by drawable-optimizer*)

    * **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted input image designed to cause *`drawable-optimizer` itself* (or its internal image processing logic) to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk space). This exploits potential inefficiencies or vulnerabilities *within the optimizer's code* related to how it handles specific image types, sizes, or complexities. This is different from a general DoS on the web application; it's specifically targeting the optimizer's processing.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, application unavailability due to the optimizer consuming all available resources.
    * **Affected Component:** The image processing and optimization algorithms *within* `drawable-optimizer` and its *direct* dependencies. This includes how it handles image loading, resizing, format conversions, and optimization passes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Set resource limits (CPU time, memory usage) on the `drawable-optimizer` *process* itself using operating system mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux, resource limits in container orchestration systems). This is the most direct mitigation.
        *   Implement timeouts for the `drawable-optimizer` *process* to prevent it from running indefinitely on a malicious input.
        *   Monitor the resource usage of the `drawable-optimizer` *process* and automatically terminate processes that exceed predefined thresholds.
