# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Pre-Optimization)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__pre-optimization_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **File Extension Whitelisting:** *Before* passing a file to `drawable-optimizer`, extract the file extension. Convert it to lowercase. Compare it against a hardcoded list of allowed extensions (e.g., `[".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".webp", ".gif"]`). If the extension is *not* in the list, reject the file. Do *not* call `drawable-optimizer`.
2.  **File Header Validation (Magic Bytes):** *Before* passing a file to `drawable-optimizer`, read the first few bytes of the file. Use a library (e.g., `python-magic`) to determine the file type based on these "magic bytes." Compare the detected MIME type against allowed MIME types (e.g., `["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/webp", "image/gif"]`). If it doesn't match, reject the file. Do *not* call `drawable-optimizer`.
3.  **File Size Limitation:** *Before* passing a file to `drawable-optimizer`, get the file size. Compare it against a predefined maximum file size. If it exceeds the limit, reject the file. Do *not* call `drawable-optimizer`.
4.  **Filename Sanitization:** *Before* passing a filename to `drawable-optimizer`, sanitize it. Remove or replace characters that could be used for path traversal (e.g., "..", "/", "\"). Use a whitelist approach (alphanumeric, underscores, hyphens, periods).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload (Critical):** Prevents `drawable-optimizer` from processing non-image files, which could contain exploits.
    *   **Path Traversal (High):** Prevents `drawable-optimizer` from being used to access or write files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** Limits the impact of large files on `drawable-optimizer`'s processing time.
    *   **Code Injection (Critical):** Reduces the chance of exploiting vulnerabilities *within* `drawable-optimizer` itself by ensuring it only processes valid image data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Risk reduced to near zero.
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   File Extension Whitelisting: Implemented in `image_processor.py`, function `validate_image()`.
    *   File Header Validation: Implemented in `image_processor.py`, function `validate_image()`.
    *   File Size Limitation: Implemented in `image_processor.py`, function `validate_image()`.
    *   Filename Sanitization: Implemented in `utils.py`, function `sanitize_filename()`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Output Validation (Post-Optimization)](./mitigation_strategies/output_validation__post-optimization_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Re-validate Optimized Images:** *Immediately after* `drawable-optimizer` completes, apply the *same* input validation checks (file extension, file header, file size) to the *output* file. This is critical because a vulnerability *within* `drawable-optimizer` could result in malicious output, even with valid input.
2.  **Integrity Checks (Optional):** If you have a known-good hash of the *expected* output, generate a hash of the optimized image and compare. This is more for detecting corruption than malicious modification.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (Critical):** Detects if `drawable-optimizer` itself is compromised and producing malicious output.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium):** Detects if the optimization process has corrupted the image.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced (primarily accidental corruption).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Re-validate Optimized Images: Not implemented.
    *   Integrity Checks: Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Re-validate Optimized Images: Implement the input validation checks on the output file *after* `drawable-optimizer` runs. Add this to `image_processor.py`.
    *   Integrity Checks: Implement if known-good hashes are available (lower priority).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Unnecessary Optimization](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_unnecessary_optimization.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Conditional Optimization:** *Before* calling `drawable-optimizer`, check if optimization is truly necessary.
    *   Check if the image is already optimized (e.g., by comparing size to a previous version).
    *   Check if the image is below a size threshold where optimization provides minimal benefit.
    * If optimization is not needed skip calling `drawable-optimizer`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All threats related to `drawable-optimizer` (Variable Severity):** Reduces the frequency of using `drawable-optimizer`, thus reducing exposure to any of its potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All threats:** Risk reduced proportionally to the reduction in `drawable-optimizer` calls.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Conditional Optimization: Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conditional Optimization: Implement logic to determine if optimization is needed *before* calling `drawable-optimizer`. Add this to `image_processor.py`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `drawable-optimizer` Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__drawable-optimizer__updated.md)

**Description:**
* Regularly check for updates to the `drawable-optimizer` library itself. Apply security updates and bug fixes promptly. This is distinct from general dependency management; it focuses specifically on the library in question.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High):** Addresses vulnerabilities that are publicly disclosed and patched in newer versions of `drawable-optimizer`.

* **Impact:**
    * **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by staying up-to-date.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Not consistently implemented. Updates are not checked regularly.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Establish a process for regularly checking for and applying updates to `drawable-optimizer`. This could involve manual checks or automated tooling.
