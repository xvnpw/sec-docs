## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code on Server](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_execute_arbitrary_code_on_server.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain the ability to run arbitrary code on the server hosting the application that uses `drawable-optimizer`. This is the most severe outcome, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Impact:** High - Complete system compromise, data breaches, data loss, potential for lateral movement within the network.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the entire attack tree and represents the worst-case scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in `drawable-optimizer` Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in__drawable-optimizer__dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the attacker's strategy of targeting vulnerabilities within the libraries that `drawable-optimizer` relies on (svgo, oxipng, pngquant). This is a common and often successful attack vector because applications frequently fail to keep dependencies updated.
*   **Impact:** High - Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities often leads directly to code execution.
*   **Why Critical & High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Dependencies are a frequent source of vulnerabilities.
    *   **High Impact:** Vulnerabilities often lead to code execution.
    *   **Relatively Low Effort (for the attacker):** Exploiting known CVEs is often straightforward.
* **Attack Vector Details:**
    * The attacker identifies that the application uses `drawable-optimizer`.
    * The attacker researches known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in `svgo`, `oxipng`, and `pngquant`.
    * The attacker determines if the application is using a vulnerable version of any of these dependencies. This might be done through:
        *   Examining publicly available information (e.g., source code repositories, build files).
        *   Fingerprinting the application's behavior.
        *   Trying known exploit payloads.
    * If a vulnerable version is found, the attacker proceeds to exploit the specific CVE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable `svgo` Version, Vulnerable `oxipng` Version, Vulnerable `pngquant` Version](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable__svgo__version__vulnerable__oxipng__version__vulnerable__pngquant__version.md)

*   **Description:** These nodes represent the specific state where the application is using a version of `svgo`, `oxipng`, or `pngquant` that contains a known, exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** High - The impact depends on the specific CVE, but many vulnerabilities in these image processing libraries can lead to code execution.
*   **Why Critical & High-Risk:** These are direct entry points for exploitation. If any of these are true, the attacker has a clear path to compromise the system.
* **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   The attacker focuses on a specific dependency (e.g., `svgo`).
    *   The attacker identifies a known CVE in `svgo` (e.g., CVE-2023-XXXXX).
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious SVG file specifically designed to trigger the vulnerability in that CVE.
    *   The attacker delivers the malicious SVG file to the application (e.g., through an image upload feature).
    *   The application, using the vulnerable `svgo` version via `drawable-optimizer`, processes the malicious SVG file.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known CVE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_cve.md)

*   **Description:** This represents the actual act of exploiting the identified vulnerability in the dependency. This often involves crafting a specific input (e.g., a malicious image file) that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation typically grants the attacker code execution capabilities.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the final step in the attack chain, leading directly to the attacker's goal.
* **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   The attacker researches the details of the specific CVE.
    *   The attacker may use publicly available exploit code or develop their own exploit based on the CVE details.
    *   The attacker crafts the necessary input (e.g., a specially crafted SVG, PNG, or JPEG file) to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker delivers this input to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious SVG/PNG/JPEG](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_svgpngjpeg.md)

*    **Description:** This represents the creation of a specially crafted image file designed to exploit a vulnerability in one of the image processing libraries or in the way `drawable-optimizer` handles these files.
*    **Impact:** High (indirectly, as it enables other attacks). The impact depends on *which* vulnerability the crafted image exploits.
*    **Why Critical:** This is a crucial enabling step for many of the attacks. The malicious image is the *weapon* used to trigger the vulnerability.
* **Attack Vector Details:**
        * The attacker understands the specifics of the target vulnerability (either in a dependency or in `drawable-optimizer` itself).
        * The attacker uses image editing tools or specialized scripts to create an image file that, when processed, will trigger the vulnerability. This might involve:
            *   Exploiting buffer overflows.
            *   Creating overly complex structures (for DoS).
            *   Injecting malicious code (if the vulnerability allows it).
            *   Using specific image features or metadata known to cause issues.
        * The attacker tests the crafted image (ideally in a sandboxed environment) to ensure it triggers the intended vulnerability.
