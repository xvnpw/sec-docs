# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Reduce the size of Android application packages (APKs) by optimizing drawable resources.
*   Improve application performance by reducing memory usage associated with drawables.
*   Automate the optimization process to integrate seamlessly into the development workflow.
*   Provide a customizable tool that allows developers to configure optimization settings.
*   Support various image formats commonly used in Android development.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Incompatibility: Optimized drawables may not render correctly on all Android versions or devices, leading to visual glitches or application crashes.
*   Performance Degradation: Aggressive optimization settings might degrade image quality or introduce unexpected performance issues.
*   Integration Issues: The tool may not integrate smoothly with all build systems or development environments, causing disruptions in the workflow.
*   Security Vulnerabilities: If not properly secured, the tool itself or its dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities into the application build process.
*   Maintenance Overhead: The tool requires ongoing maintenance and updates to support new Android versions, image formats, and optimization techniques.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and contributions to identify and address potential security issues. (Described in the GitHub repository)
*   security control: The project uses Gradle as a build system, which offers some built-in security features like dependency verification. (Described in build.gradle files)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The tool relies on external libraries (e.g., `com.android.tools.build:gradle`, `org.ow2.asm:asm`). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could impact the security of the tool.
*   accepted risk: The tool modifies the application's resources, which could potentially introduce subtle bugs or vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement dependency scanning to automatically identify and report known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   security control: Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs, PMD, or Android Lint) to detect potential security issues in the codebase.
*   security control: Conduct regular security reviews of the code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Sign the released artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as the tool is a command-line utility that doesn't require user authentication.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as the tool operates on local files and doesn't interact with external services that require authorization.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The tool should validate user-provided input, such as file paths and configuration options, to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
    *   The tool should handle invalid or corrupted image files gracefully, without crashing or exposing sensitive information.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If the tool interacts with remote resources (e.g., to download updates or report usage statistics), it should use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) and validate certificates.
    *   If the tool stores sensitive data (which it shouldn't), it should use appropriate encryption mechanisms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   **Application Build Process:** Ensuring the integrity and security of the build process is crucial to prevent malicious code from being injected into the application.
*   **Application Performance:** Maintaining or improving application performance is essential for a positive user experience.
*   **Application Stability:** Preventing crashes or visual glitches caused by the optimization process is critical.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   **Source Code:** The source code of the Drawable Optimizer and the Android application itself is sensitive and should be protected from unauthorized access. (Sensitivity: Medium)
*   **Drawable Resources:** The drawable resources are part of the application's intellectual property and should be protected. (Sensitivity: Low to Medium, depending on the originality of the resources)
*   **Configuration Files:** Configuration files may contain sensitive information, such as API keys or optimization settings. (Sensitivity: Low to High, depending on the content)
*   **Build Artifacts (APK):** The APK file is the final product and should be protected from tampering. (Sensitivity: Medium)
*   **User Data:** The Drawable Optimizer itself does not handle user data. However, the Android application it optimizes might. (Sensitivity: Varies greatly depending on the application)
