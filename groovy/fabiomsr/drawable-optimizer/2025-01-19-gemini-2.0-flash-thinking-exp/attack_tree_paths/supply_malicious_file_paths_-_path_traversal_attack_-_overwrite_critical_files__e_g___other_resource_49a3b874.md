## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Supply Malicious File Paths -> Path Traversal Attack -> Overwrite Critical Files

This document provides a deep analysis of a specific attack path identified within the context of the `drawable-optimizer` library (https://github.com/fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer). This analysis aims to understand the feasibility, potential impact, and mitigation strategies for this particular attack vector.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the attack path: "Supply Malicious File Paths -> Path Traversal Attack -> Overwrite Critical Files" within the `drawable-optimizer` library. This involves:

* **Understanding the mechanics:**  How could an attacker supply malicious file paths? How could these paths lead to a path traversal vulnerability?
* **Assessing the impact:** What are the potential consequences of successfully overwriting critical files?
* **Identifying potential vulnerabilities:** Where in the `drawable-optimizer` code might this vulnerability exist?
* **Developing mitigation strategies:** What steps can be taken to prevent this attack?

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack path described above. The scope includes:

* **Input mechanisms:**  How the `drawable-optimizer` receives file paths (e.g., command-line arguments, configuration files).
* **File path processing:**  How the library handles and manipulates the provided file paths.
* **File writing operations:**  Where and how the optimized files are written to the file system.
* **Potential targets:**  Identifying critical files within a typical application development environment that could be targeted.

This analysis does **not** cover other potential vulnerabilities within the `drawable-optimizer` or the broader application it's used in.

### 3. Methodology

The methodology for this deep analysis involves:

* **Understanding the `drawable-optimizer`:** Reviewing the library's documentation and source code (if necessary) to understand how it handles file paths and performs file operations.
* **Threat Modeling:**  Analyzing the attack path from an attacker's perspective, considering the steps they would take to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Hypothesizing potential locations within the code where path traversal vulnerabilities could exist.
* **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluating the potential damage caused by a successful attack.
* **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Identifying and recommending security best practices to prevent the attack.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1 Attack Stage 1: Supply Malicious File Paths

**Description:** The initial stage of the attack involves an attacker providing crafted file paths as input to the `drawable-optimizer`. These paths are designed to manipulate the library's file system operations.

**Mechanisms:**

* **Command-line arguments:** If the `drawable-optimizer` accepts input file paths as command-line arguments, an attacker could directly provide malicious paths. For example:
    ```bash
    drawable-optimizer --input ../../../../../important.config input.png output.png
    ```
* **Configuration files:** If the library reads input file paths from a configuration file, an attacker who can modify this file (e.g., through another vulnerability or compromised credentials) could inject malicious paths.
* **Indirect input:** In some scenarios, the `drawable-optimizer` might receive file paths indirectly through other parts of the application or build process. If these upstream components are vulnerable to injection, malicious paths could be introduced.

**Attacker Perspective:** The attacker aims to inject paths containing sequences like `..`, absolute paths, or symbolic links that, when processed by the `drawable-optimizer`, will lead to file operations outside the intended output directory.

#### 4.2 Attack Stage 2: Path Traversal Attack

**Description:** This stage occurs if the `drawable-optimizer` fails to properly sanitize or validate the provided file paths. The library interprets the malicious path in a way that allows access to directories outside the intended scope.

**Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of file paths. Specifically, the library might:

* **Not remove or neutralize ".." sequences:** The `..` sequence is a common way to navigate up the directory structure. If not handled correctly, multiple `..` sequences can lead to traversing to arbitrary locations.
* **Not prevent absolute paths:** If the library accepts absolute paths and uses them directly in file operations, an attacker can specify any location on the file system.
* **Not resolve symbolic links securely:** If the library follows symbolic links without proper checks, an attacker could create a symbolic link pointing to a critical file.

**Code Example (Illustrative - May not be actual `drawable-optimizer` code):**

```python
# Potentially vulnerable code snippet
import os

def optimize_drawable(input_path, output_dir):
    output_filename = os.path.basename(input_path)
    output_file_path = os.path.join(output_dir, output_filename)
    # ... optimization logic ...
    with open(output_file_path, 'wb') as f:
        # Write optimized data
        pass
```

In the above example, if `input_path` is something like `../../../important.config`, `os.path.basename` would return `important.config`, and `os.path.join` would construct a path like `target_output_dir/../../../important.config`, potentially leading to writing outside the intended `output_dir`.

#### 4.3 Attack Stage 3: Overwrite Critical Files (e.g., other resources, build scripts)

**Description:** If the path traversal attack is successful, the `drawable-optimizer` will write the optimized output to a location specified by the attacker's malicious path. This can lead to overwriting critical files.

**Potential Targets and Impact:**

* **Build scripts (e.g., `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, `Makefile`):** Overwriting build scripts can disrupt the build process, potentially injecting malicious code into the build pipeline, or preventing the application from being built correctly.
* **Configuration files (e.g., `application.properties`, `web.xml`):** Modifying configuration files can alter the application's behavior, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, or denial of service.
* **Other resources:** Overwriting other important resources like localization files, data files, or even other drawable resources could lead to application malfunction or unexpected behavior.
* **Executable files (in extreme cases):** While less likely in the context of drawable optimization, if the attacker can traverse to executable directories, they could potentially overwrite executables, leading to complete system compromise.

**Impact Severity:** The severity of this attack can range from disrupting the development process to causing significant security breaches and application failures. Overwriting build scripts is particularly dangerous as it can lead to supply chain attacks.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To prevent this attack path, the following mitigation strategies should be implemented:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Canonicalization:** Convert file paths to their canonical form (e.g., by resolving symbolic links and removing redundant separators and `.` and `..` components) before processing.
    * **Path Whitelisting:** If possible, define a set of allowed input and output directories and ensure all paths stay within these boundaries.
    * **Blacklisting Dangerous Characters:**  Remove or escape characters like `..`, absolute path prefixes (`/` on Linux/macOS, `C:\` on Windows), and potentially other special characters.
* **Secure File Handling Practices:**
    * **Avoid direct concatenation of user-supplied paths:** Use secure path manipulation functions provided by the operating system or programming language libraries (e.g., `os.path.join` in Python) carefully.
    * **Restrict file system access:** Run the `drawable-optimizer` process with the least privileges necessary. Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit its access to the file system.
    * **Output directory control:**  Explicitly define and control the output directory. Ensure that the library cannot write outside this designated location.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the code for potential path traversal vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses.
* **Dependency Updates:** Keep the `drawable-optimizer` library and its dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the user or process running the `drawable-optimizer` has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended tasks.

### 6. Conclusion

The attack path "Supply Malicious File Paths -> Path Traversal Attack -> Overwrite Critical Files" represents a significant security risk for applications using the `drawable-optimizer` if proper input validation and secure file handling practices are not implemented. A successful attack can lead to severe consequences, including build failures, application malfunction, and potential security breaches.

By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack and ensure the integrity and security of their applications. A thorough understanding of how the `drawable-optimizer` handles file paths and a proactive approach to security are crucial in preventing such vulnerabilities.
