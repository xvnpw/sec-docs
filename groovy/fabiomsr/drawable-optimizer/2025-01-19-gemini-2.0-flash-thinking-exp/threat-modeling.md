# Threat Model Analysis for fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer

## Threat: [Malicious Drawable Input Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_drawable_input_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious drawable file (either XML or an image) and provides it as input to the `drawable-optimizer`. This file exploits a vulnerability in the library's parsing or processing logic. The attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary code on the server or within the application's processing environment by leveraging this vulnerability. This could involve overflowing buffers, exploiting logic errors in XML parsing, or triggering vulnerabilities in underlying image processing libraries *within the drawable-optimizer*.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server or application environment, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** XML parsing module, image processing functions *within drawable-optimizer*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation *before* processing with `drawable-optimizer` to check file types, sizes, and content against expected formats.
*   Sanitize input drawable files *before* processing with `drawable-optimizer` to remove potentially malicious code or structures.
*   Keep the `drawable-optimizer` library updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities *within the library itself*.
*   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate the `drawable-optimizer` process.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious XML drawable file containing external entity declarations. When the `drawable-optimizer` parses this file, it attempts to resolve these external entities. The attacker can leverage this to access local files on the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), internal network resources, or cause a denial of service by forcing the server to process large amounts of data from external sources *through the vulnerable XML parsing of drawable-optimizer*.

**Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive server files, server-side request forgery (SSRF) allowing access to internal resources, denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** XML parsing module *within drawable-optimizer*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable external entity resolution in the XML parser configuration *used by drawable-optimizer*.
*   Sanitize XML input *before* processing with `drawable-optimizer` to remove or escape potentially malicious entity declarations.
*   Use a secure XML parser *within drawable-optimizer* that is not vulnerable to XXE attacks (if configurable).

## Threat: [Image Processing Vulnerabilities Exploitation](./threats/image_processing_vulnerabilities_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) as input to the `drawable-optimizer`. This image exploits vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows or integer overflows) in the underlying image processing libraries *used by drawable-optimizer*. The attacker aims to cause a crash, denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential for remote code execution depending on the vulnerability *within drawable-optimizer's dependencies*.

**Affected Component:** Image processing functions *within drawable-optimizer*, potentially external image processing libraries *used by drawable-optimizer*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `drawable-optimizer` library and its image processing dependencies updated to the latest versions.
*   Consider using image processing libraries *within drawable-optimizer* known for their security and robustness (if configurable).
*   Implement checks on image file headers and metadata *before* processing with `drawable-optimizer` to detect potentially malicious files.
*   Run the image processing *performed by drawable-optimizer* in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [Command Injection via External Tools](./threats/command_injection_via_external_tools.md)

**Description:** The `drawable-optimizer` might use external command-line tools for certain optimization tasks. If the input to these tools is constructed by concatenating data processed by `drawable-optimizer` without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. For example, if the filename is taken directly from the drawable and used in a command, an attacker could provide a filename like `; rm -rf /`.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data breaches or system disruption.

**Affected Component:** Functions *within drawable-optimizer* responsible for executing external commands.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using external command-line tools *within drawable-optimizer* if possible.
*   If external tools are necessary, never construct commands by directly concatenating data processed by `drawable-optimizer`.
*   Use parameterized commands or secure command execution libraries that prevent injection *within drawable-optimizer*.
*   Enforce strict input validation on any data *within drawable-optimizer* used in command construction.
