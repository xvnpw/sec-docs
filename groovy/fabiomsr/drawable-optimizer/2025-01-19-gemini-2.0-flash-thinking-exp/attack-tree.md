## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Drawable Optimizer](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_drawable_optimizer.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and signifies a successful breach of the application's security through the vulnerabilities in the drawable optimizer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Input to Optimizer](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_input_to_optimizer.md)

This node represents a critical control point where the attacker attempts to influence the optimizer's behavior by providing malicious or crafted input. Successful manipulation here can lead to various high-risk outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Parsing Vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, arbitrary code execution in underlying image library)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_parsing_vulnerability__e_g___buffer_overflow__arbitrary_code_execution_in_underlying_i_d29573c4.md)

This node highlights the risk of vulnerabilities within the image processing libraries used by the optimizer. Attackers can craft malicious image files that trigger these vulnerabilities, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the build server or developer machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Critical Files (e.g., other resources, build scripts)](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_critical_files__e_g___other_resources__build_scripts_.md)

This node represents the severe impact of successful path traversal attacks. By manipulating file paths, attackers can overwrite critical application resources or build scripts, leading to application malfunction, introduction of backdoors, or disruption of the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Characters in Filename (e.g., command injection if filename is used in shell commands)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_characters_in_filename__e_g___command_injection_if_filename_is_used_in_shell_comman_461ef4e6.md)

This node highlights the risk of command injection vulnerabilities. If the optimizer uses filenames in shell commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious characters that are interpreted as commands, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Optimizer's Processing Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_optimizer's_processing_logic.md)

This node represents a broader category of vulnerabilities that can exist within the optimizer's code itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to unexpected behavior, including code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

This node emphasizes the risk associated with using external libraries. If the optimizer relies on vulnerable image processing libraries, attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Image Processing Libraries (e.g., libpng, jpeg-turbo)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_image_processing_libraries__e_g___libpng__jpeg-turbo_.md)

This node specifically points to the risk of using vulnerable versions of common image processing libraries. These libraries are often targeted by attackers due to their widespread use.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Optimizer's Output Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_optimizer's_output_handling.md)

This node represents vulnerabilities in how the optimizer handles the output of optimized files. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the output process for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Write Optimized Files to Malicious Locations](./attack_tree_paths/write_optimized_files_to_malicious_locations.md)

This node highlights the risk of attackers manipulating the output path to write optimized files to unintended locations. This can lead to overwriting critical application files or introducing malicious files into sensitive areas.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite Critical Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_critical_application_files.md)

This node represents the direct impact of successfully manipulating the output path. Overwriting critical application files can lead to application failure, security breaches, or the introduction of malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Backdoors or Data Exfiltration Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_backdoors_or_data_exfiltration_mechanisms.md)

This node represents the potential for long-term compromise. By injecting malicious code into the optimized drawables, attackers can introduce backdoors for persistent access or mechanisms to exfiltrate sensitive data when the application uses these resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Drawable Content -> Exploit Image Parsing Vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, arbitrary code execution in underlying image library)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_drawable_content_-_exploit_image_parsing_vulnerability__e_g___buffer_overflow__arbi_9045003f.md)

An attacker crafts a malicious image file designed to exploit a vulnerability in the image parsing library used by the optimizer. When the optimizer processes this file, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the build server or developer machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Drawable Content -> Embed Malicious Data within Image Metadata (e.g., SVG script injection, malicious EXIF data)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_drawable_content_-_embed_malicious_data_within_image_metadata__e_g___svg_script_inj_8a274286.md)

An attacker embeds malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript in SVG files) or other harmful data within the metadata of image files. When the application processes or renders these optimized drawables, the malicious content is executed, potentially leading to code execution within the application's context or data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious File Paths -> Path Traversal Attack -> Overwrite Critical Files (e.g., other resources, build scripts)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_file_paths_-_path_traversal_attack_-_overwrite_critical_files__e_g___other_resource_49a3b874.md)

An attacker provides file paths containing ".." sequences or other path traversal characters as input to the optimizer. If the optimizer doesn't properly sanitize these paths, it can be tricked into writing the optimized files to arbitrary locations outside the intended output directory, potentially overwriting critical application files or build scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious File Paths -> Filename Injection -> Inject Malicious Characters in Filename (e.g., command injection if filename is used in shell commands)](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_file_paths_-_filename_injection_-_inject_malicious_characters_in_filename__e_g___co_f46dd525.md)

An attacker provides filenames containing malicious characters. If the optimizer uses these filenames in shell commands without proper sanitization, the malicious characters can be interpreted as commands, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the build server or developer machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerable Image Processing Libraries (e.g., libpng, jpeg-turbo)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerable_image_processing_libraries__e_g___libpng__jpeg-turbo_6fd0ec12.md)

The `drawable-optimizer` relies on external image processing libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, an attacker can provide specific input that triggers these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Optimizer's Output Handling -> Manipulate Output Path -> Write Optimized Files to Malicious Locations -> Overwrite Critical Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_optimizer's_output_handling_-_manipulate_output_path_-_write_optimized_file_8e8bd737.md)

An attacker exploits a vulnerability in how the optimizer handles output paths. This allows them to manipulate the destination where the optimized files are written, potentially overwriting critical application files and causing significant damage or introducing malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Optimizer's Output Handling -> Inject Malicious Content During Output -> Modify Optimized Drawables with Malicious Code/Data -> Introduce Backdoors or Data Exfiltration Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_optimizer's_output_handling_-_inject_malicious_content_during_output_-_modi_0092dd70.md)

An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the output handling process to inject malicious code or data directly into the optimized drawable files. This can introduce backdoors into the application or create mechanisms for exfiltrating sensitive data when the application uses these compromised resources.
