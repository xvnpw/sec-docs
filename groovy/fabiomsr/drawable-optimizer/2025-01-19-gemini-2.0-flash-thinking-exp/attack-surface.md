# Attack Surface Analysis for fabiomsr/drawable-optimizer

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious SVG Files](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_svg_files.md)

**Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into an SVG file. When this optimized SVG is later displayed in a web browser without proper sanitization, the script executes in the user's browser.

**How Drawable-Optimizer Contributes:** Drawable-optimizer processes SVG files but doesn't inherently sanitize them against XSS. If the application doesn't perform output encoding or sanitization after optimization, the malicious script remains.

**Example:** An attacker uploads an SVG file containing `<svg><script>alert("XSS");</script></svg>`. Drawable-optimizer optimizes it, and the application serves this optimized file directly. When a user views this SVG, the `alert("XSS");` script executes.

**Impact:**  Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Output Encoding/Sanitization:**  Always sanitize or encode SVG content before displaying it in a web browser. Use context-aware encoding appropriate for HTML.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed.
*   **Consider SVG Sanitization Libraries:**  Explore using dedicated SVG sanitization libraries in addition to `drawable-optimizer`.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via Malicious SVG Files](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_via_malicious_svg_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts an SVG file that includes external entity declarations, potentially allowing them to read local files or interact with internal systems if the underlying XML parser is vulnerable.

**How Drawable-Optimizer Contributes:** If the SVG parsing library used by `drawable-optimizer` (or its dependencies like `svgo`) is not configured to disable external entity resolution, it can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker uploads an SVG containing `<!DOCTYPE doc [<!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]> <svg>&x;</svg>`. If the parser is vulnerable, it will attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive server-side files, potential for remote code execution (in some scenarios), internal port scanning.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable External Entity Resolution:** Ensure that the XML parsing libraries used by `drawable-optimizer` and its dependencies are configured to disable external entity resolution by default.
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `drawable-optimizer` and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Unsanitized Input Filenames](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_unsanitized_input_filenames.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify input file paths and this input is directly passed to `drawable-optimizer` without validation, an attacker could potentially access files outside the intended directory.

**How Drawable-Optimizer Contributes:** Drawable-optimizer accepts file paths as input. If the application doesn't sanitize these paths, the library will attempt to process files at the specified location.

**Example:** An attacker provides an input path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to the application, which then passes it to `drawable-optimizer`. The library might attempt to process this file if not properly restricted.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential for data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths. Use allowlists for permitted directories and perform path canonicalization.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the user or process running `drawable-optimizer` has only the necessary permissions to access the intended input files.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Unsanitized Output Filenames](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_unsanitized_output_filenames.md)

**Description:** Similar to input, if the application allows users to specify output file paths without validation, an attacker could potentially write optimized files to arbitrary locations on the server.

**How Drawable-Optimizer Contributes:** Drawable-optimizer allows specifying the output path for optimized files. Without proper sanitization, this can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker provides an output path like `/var/www/html/malicious.svg` to the application. Drawable-optimizer might write the optimized file to this location, potentially overwriting existing files or placing malicious content in the webroot.

**Impact:**  Overwriting critical files, introduction of malicious content into the web application, potential for remote code execution if executable files are overwritten.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Output Path Restrictions:**  Enforce strict rules for output file paths. Use a predefined output directory and generate unique filenames.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Sanitize any user-provided output path components.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Optimization Tools](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_optimization_tools.md)

**Description:** `drawable-optimizer` relies on external tools like `svgo`, `optipng`, and `jpegtran`. Vulnerabilities in these tools can be indirectly exploitable.

**How Drawable-Optimizer Contributes:** By using these tools, `drawable-optimizer` inherits their potential vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability exists in an older version of `optipng`. If the application uses `drawable-optimizer` with this vulnerable version, processing a specially crafted PNG could trigger the overflow.

**Impact:**  Potential for remote code execution, denial-of-service, or other impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `drawable-optimizer` and all its underlying optimization tools updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Archive Extraction Vulnerabilities (Zip Slip)](./attack_surfaces/archive_extraction_vulnerabilities__zip_slip_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `drawable-optimizer` to process archives (e.g., ZIP files containing drawables), vulnerabilities in the archive extraction process could allow writing files to arbitrary locations.

**How Drawable-Optimizer Contributes:** If the application extracts archives before passing individual files to `drawable-optimizer` and doesn't properly sanitize filenames within the archive, a "zip slip" vulnerability can occur.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a ZIP file containing a file named `../../../../tmp/malicious.svg`. If the extraction process doesn't sanitize the filename, the file might be written to `/tmp/malicious.svg`.

**Impact:**  Writing files to arbitrary locations, potentially overwriting critical system files or introducing malicious content.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Archive Extraction:** Use secure archive extraction libraries that prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Filename Sanitization:**  Sanitize filenames extracted from archives before writing them to the filesystem.
