## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise OpenBoxes Application (Critical Node - Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_openboxes_application__critical_node_-_root_goal_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities within the OpenBoxes application itself.
    *   Exploiting misconfigurations or weaknesses in the deployment environment of OpenBoxes.
    *   Successful attacks on any of the sub-nodes listed below will lead to the compromise of the OpenBoxes application.
    *   The ultimate goal is to achieve data breach (exfiltration of sensitive supply chain data) and/or operational disruption (manipulation of supply chain processes).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OpenBoxes Vulnerabilities (Critical Node - High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_openboxes_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This node represents exploiting inherent weaknesses in the OpenBoxes codebase.  Specific attack vectors are detailed in the sub-nodes:
    *   **AuthN/AuthZ Bypass Flaws**
    *   **Input Validation Flaws**
    *   **Code Vulnerabilities**
    *   Exploiting any of these vulnerability types within OpenBoxes can lead to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [AuthN/AuthZ Bypass Flaws (Critical Node - High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/authnauthz_bypass_flaws__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Broken Authentication:**
        *   Exploiting weak password policies enforced by OpenBoxes.
        *   Predictable session IDs allowing session hijacking.
        *   Insecure password reset mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Broken Authorization:**
        *   Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities allowing access to resources by manipulating IDs.
        *   Privilege escalation vulnerabilities enabling low-privileged users to gain administrative access.
        *   Bypassing role-based access control (RBAC) checks to access restricted functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Input Validation Flaws (Critical Node - High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/input_validation_flaws__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
        *   Injecting malicious SQL code through input fields to manipulate database queries.
        *   Extracting sensitive data from the database.
        *   Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
        *   Injecting malicious JavaScript code into web pages.
        *   Stealing user session cookies (session hijacking).
        *   Defacing the web application.
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
        *   Tricking a logged-in user into unknowingly performing actions.
        *   Modifying user data or application settings without user consent.
        *   Initiating unauthorized transactions.
    *   **Command Injection:**
        *   Injecting malicious operating system commands through input fields.
        *   Achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Vulnerabilities (Critical Node - High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/code_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution on the server.
        *   This could stem from insecure deserialization, vulnerable libraries used by OpenBoxes, or other code execution flaws within the application logic.
    *   **Path Traversal:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities to access files and directories outside the intended web root.
        *   Reading sensitive configuration files or application code.
        *   Potentially writing malicious files to the server.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that leak sensitive information.
        *   Revealing configuration details, database credentials, internal system paths, or other sensitive data that can aid further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Outdated Components (Critical Node - High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/outdated_components__critical_node_-_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated OpenBoxes Version:**
        *   Utilizing publicly available exploits for known vulnerabilities present in older versions of OpenBoxes.
        *   Gaining unauthorized access or achieving code execution through these known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Dependencies:**
        *   Targeting outdated libraries and frameworks used by OpenBoxes (e.g., Spring, Hibernate, specific JavaScript libraries).
        *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application.
    *   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Outdated Operating System or Server Software:**
        *   Targeting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or web/application server software if they are outdated and unpatched.
        *   Gaining system-level access through these vulnerabilities.
