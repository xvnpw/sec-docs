Okay, let's create a design document for the OpenBoxes project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

OpenBoxes is an open-source supply chain management system designed primarily for public health facilities in resource-constrained settings. The primary business goals are:

*   Provide a reliable and accurate system for tracking inventory and managing supply chains.
*   Improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery by ensuring the availability of essential medicines and supplies.
*   Reduce waste and loss due to stockouts, expiries, and poor inventory management.
*   Empower healthcare workers with the tools they need to manage their supplies effectively.
*   Be adaptable and configurable to a wide range of contexts and workflows.
*   Foster a community of users and developers to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.

Key business risks that need to be addressed:

*   Data loss or corruption, leading to inaccurate inventory records and potential disruption of healthcare services.
*   Unauthorized access to the system, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing malicious manipulation of inventory.
*   System failure or downtime, preventing healthcare workers from accessing critical information and managing supplies.
  *   Inability to scale to meet the needs of larger facilities or expanding programs.
*   Lack of user adoption due to complexity or poor usability.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, potentially exposing the system to exploits.
*   Insufficient audit trails, making it difficult to track changes and identify the source of errors or discrepancies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls (based on the GitHub repository and common practices):

*   security control: Authentication: User accounts and login functionality are implemented (implied by the presence of user roles and login pages).
*   security control: Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) is mentioned, restricting access to certain features based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Stock Manager). Described in documentation and implemented in code.
*   security control: Input validation: Some level of input validation is likely present to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), although the specifics need to be verified in the codebase.
*   security control: Session management: Sessions are used to maintain user state after login.
*   security control: HTTPS: The application is likely intended to be deployed behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) that handles HTTPS encryption.
*   security control: Database security: Database credentials are (hopefully) stored securely and not hardcoded in the application.
*   security control: Regular backups: It's implied that users should perform regular backups of the database.
*   security control: Dependency management: Dependencies are managed using a package manager (e.g., Gradle), allowing for updates and vulnerability patching.

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: The project relies heavily on community contributions, which may introduce varying levels of code quality and security awareness.
*   accepted risk: The application is designed to be deployed in resource-constrained settings, which may limit the feasibility of implementing some advanced security measures.
*   accepted risk: The documentation may not be fully comprehensive, and some security-relevant configurations may require manual setup.

Recommended security controls (high priority):

*   Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user inputs, including those from file uploads.
*   Enforce strong password policies and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Implement detailed audit logging to track all user actions and system events.
*   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing.
*   Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage.
*   Use a secure coding standard and perform static code analysis (SAST) during development.
*   Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) during testing.
*   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The system MUST require users to authenticate with a unique username and strong password.
    *   The system SHOULD support multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   The system MUST securely store passwords using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   The system MUST implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.

*   Authorization:
    *   The system MUST implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.
    *   The system MUST ensure that users can only access data and perform actions that are authorized for their assigned roles.
    *   The system MUST provide a mechanism for administrators to manage user roles and permissions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   The system MUST validate all user inputs against a strict whitelist of allowed characters and formats.
    *   The system MUST sanitize all user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks.
    *   The system MUST validate file uploads to ensure they are of the expected type and size.

*   Cryptography:
    *   The system MUST use HTTPS for all communication between the client and the server.
    *   The system MUST use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms for storing sensitive data (e.g., AES-256).
    *   The system MUST securely manage cryptographic keys.
    *   The system SHOULD use a secure random number generator for all cryptographic operations.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible deployment solutions:

1.  Manual installation on a Linux server (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
2.  Using Docker and Docker Compose.
3.  Deployment on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) using virtual machines or container services.

Chosen solution (for detailed description): Docker and Docker Compose. This is a popular and convenient option for deploying OpenBoxes.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Deployment Environment
        subgraph Docker Host
            OpenBoxesApp[("openboxes-app\n(Tomcat)")]
            OpenBoxesDB[("openboxes-db\n(MySQL)")]
        end
        Internet[("Internet")]

        Internet -- "HTTPS" --> OpenBoxesApp
        OpenBoxesApp -- "JDBC" --> OpenBoxesDB
    end
```

Element Descriptions:

## BUILD

OpenBoxes uses Gradle as its build tool. The build process typically involves the following steps:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  A build server (or a developer's local machine) checks out the code.
3.  Gradle is used to compile the code, run tests, and create a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.
4.  The WAR file is then deployed to the application server (Tomcat).

Security controls in the build process:

*   security control: Version control (Git): All code changes are tracked in a Git repository, providing an audit trail and allowing for rollbacks.
*   security control: Dependency management (Gradle): Gradle manages project dependencies, allowing for updates and vulnerability patching.
*   security control: Automated build: The build process is automated using Gradle, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Testing: The build process includes running unit tests and integration tests, which can help identify security vulnerabilities.

Recommended additions:

*   Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools into the Gradle build process to automatically scan the code for vulnerabilities.
*   Integrate SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Use a dedicated build server (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to ensure a consistent and secure build environment.
*   Digitally sign the WAR file to ensure its integrity.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[("Developer")]
    GitHub[("GitHub Repository")]
    BuildServer[("Build Server\n(e.g., Jenkins)")]
    ArtifactRepository[("Artifact Repository\n(e.g., Nexus)")]
	Tomcat[("Tomcat Server")]

    Developer -- "Commits code" --> GitHub
    GitHub -- "Triggers build" --> BuildServer
    BuildServer -- "Runs Gradle build,\nSAST, SCA" --> BuildServer
    BuildServer -- "Publishes WAR file" --> ArtifactRepository
	BuildServer -- "Deploy WAR" --> Tomcat
```

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes to protect:

*   Inventory management: Ensuring accurate tracking of stock levels, locations, and movements.
*   Order management: Managing the procurement of new supplies.
*   Shipment management: Tracking incoming and outgoing shipments.
*   Reporting: Generating accurate and timely reports on inventory and supply chain performance.
*   User management: Controlling access to the system and ensuring data integrity.

Data to protect and their sensitivity:

*   Inventory data (stock levels, locations, expiry dates): Sensitive, as it directly impacts healthcare delivery.
*   Product information (names, descriptions, classifications): Moderately sensitive, as it could be used for competitive advantage or to identify supply chain vulnerabilities.
*   Supplier information: Moderately sensitive, as it could be used for competitive advantage.
*   User account information (usernames, roles, permissions): Highly sensitive, as it controls access to the system.
*   Transaction logs: Sensitive, as they provide an audit trail of all system activity.
*   Patient data: If integrated with other systems that handle patient data, this would be highly sensitive and subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA). OpenBoxes itself does *not* directly manage patient data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
