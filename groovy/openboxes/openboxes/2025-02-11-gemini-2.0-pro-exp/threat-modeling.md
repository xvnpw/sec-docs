# Threat Model Analysis for openboxes/openboxes

## Threat: [Unauthorized Inventory Modification via Direct Database Access](./threats/unauthorized_inventory_modification_via_direct_database_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Inventory Modification via Direct Database Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the database server (e.g., through compromised credentials, network intrusion, or misconfigured database permissions) and bypasses OpenBoxes' application logic to directly modify inventory records. They might alter quantities, locations, expiration dates, or even delete records.  This bypasses OpenBoxes' internal controls.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Inaccurate inventory data, leading to stockouts or overstocking of critical supplies.
        *   Potential use of expired or damaged goods, posing risks to patients.
        *   Financial losses due to wasted resources or inability to fulfill orders.
        *   Disruption of supply chain operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or other configured database). *While the database itself isn't OpenBoxes code, the threat arises from bypassing OpenBoxes' intended access controls.*
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Database Hardening:** Implement strict database access controls, ensuring only the OpenBoxes application user has the necessary permissions (and *no* direct user logins).  This is crucial to prevent bypassing OpenBoxes.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the database server on a separate network segment with strict firewall rules.
        *   **Database Auditing:** Enable database-level auditing to track all data modifications, including the source IP address and user (if applicable).
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery plan, with regular integrity checks.
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Deploy intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor network traffic and database activity for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via RBAC Bypass](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_rbac_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via RBAC Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker with a low-privilege OpenBoxes account (e.g., a warehouse worker) exploits a flaw in *OpenBoxes' role-based access control (RBAC) implementation*. This could involve manipulating requests, exploiting a logic error in permission checks, or leveraging a vulnerability in a *custom OpenBoxes extension*. The attacker gains access to functionalities or data restricted to higher-privilege roles (e.g., administrator). This is a direct flaw in OpenBoxes' code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., financial reports, user data).
        *   Ability to perform unauthorized actions (e.g., creating new users, modifying system settings, deleting data).
        *   Potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** OpenBoxes RBAC system (likely within `org.openboxes.security` or related packages, and potentially custom extensions – *this is OpenBoxes code*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of the RBAC implementation, focusing on permission checks and authorization logic. This is directly addressing OpenBoxes code.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing specifically targeting the RBAC system, attempting to escalate privileges from various user roles.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit user roles and permissions to ensure they are appropriate and up-to-date.
        *   **Input Validation:** Ensure all user input related to roles and permissions is properly validated.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Malicious Import](./threats/data_tampering_via_malicious_import.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering via Malicious Import

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious CSV, Excel, or other supported import file containing manipulated data or hidden formulas. When a legitimate user imports this file into OpenBoxes, the attacker's data is injected into the system, bypassing standard validation checks *within OpenBoxes' import logic*. This could involve altering inventory counts, product details, or even injecting malicious code (if OpenBoxes incorrectly handles formulas or scripts within imported files).  The vulnerability lies in how OpenBoxes processes the import.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Corruption of inventory data.
        *   Introduction of false or misleading information.
        *   Potential for code execution (if formulas or scripts are mishandled – a direct OpenBoxes vulnerability).
        *   Disruption of supply chain operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** OpenBoxes data import functionality (likely within modules related to inventory management, product catalogs, or data exchange – *this is OpenBoxes code*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation for all imported data, checking data types, ranges, and formats *within the OpenBoxes import logic*.
        *   **Formula Sanitization:** If OpenBoxes supports formulas in imported files (e.g., Excel), sanitize or disable them to prevent malicious code execution *within OpenBoxes*.
        *   **Restricted Import Permissions:** Limit the ability to import data to trusted users with specific roles.
        *   **File Type Validation:** Enforce strict file type validation, only allowing known and safe file types.
        *   **Content Scanning:** Scan imported files for potentially malicious content (e.g., macros, scripts) before processing *within OpenBoxes*.
