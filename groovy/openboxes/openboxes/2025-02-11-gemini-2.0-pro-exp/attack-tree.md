## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.3 Exploit insufficient server-side validation to create inconsistent inventory state](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_3_exploit_insufficient_server-side_validation_to_create_inconsistent_inventory_state.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious requests with invalid quantity values (e.g., negative numbers, excessively large numbers) and sends them to the server.  If the server-side validation is insufficient, these invalid values can be accepted, leading to inconsistencies in the inventory data.
*   **Example:**  Sending a request to `/stockmovement` with `quantity: -1000` for a product.
*   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict server-side validation of all quantity inputs, ensuring they are positive, within reasonable limits, and consistent with the current inventory state.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2.3 Exploit insufficient authorization checks to create/modify records without proper permissions](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_3_exploit_insufficient_authorization_checks_to_createmodify_records_without_proper_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to create or modify stock movement records (e.g., shipments, receipts) without having the necessary permissions.  If authorization checks are weak or missing, the attacker can successfully manipulate these records.
*   **Example:**  Sending a POST request to `/shipment` to create a fake shipment, even without being a "Shipping Manager."
*   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure that all operations on stock movement records are properly authorized based on the user's role and permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1.3 Exploit insufficient state validation to bypass required steps](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_3_exploit_insufficient_state_validation_to_bypass_required_steps.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to skip required steps in a defined workflow (e.g., approving a shipment without performing a required inspection).  If the application does not properly validate the current state of the workflow, the attacker can bypass these steps.
*   **Example:**  Directly accessing the `/shipment/approve` endpoint without first completing the `/shipment/inspect` step.
*   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict state validation within the workflow engine.  Ensure that each step in the workflow can only be executed if the previous required steps have been completed and validated.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3, 2.2.3, 2.3.3, 2.4.3 Exploit the identified vulnerability (Grails, Groovy, Libraries, Database)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3__2_2_3__2_3_3__2_4_3_exploit_the_identified_vulnerability__grails__groovy__libraries__database_04c2dd3f.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker identifies a known vulnerability (e.g., a CVE) in a specific version of Grails, Groovy, a third-party library, or the database used by OpenBoxes.  They then use a publicly available exploit or craft their own exploit to leverage this vulnerability.  This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, or other severe consequences.
*   **Example:**  Exploiting a known deserialization vulnerability in an outdated version of Apache Commons Collections.
*   **Mitigation:**  Keep all dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Use dependency management tools to identify and track vulnerable components.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.3 Exploit insufficient input sanitization to execute arbitrary SQL commands](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_3_exploit_insufficient_input_sanitization_to_execute_arbitrary_sql_commands.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into user input fields that are used in database queries.  If the application does not properly sanitize this input, the injected code can be executed by the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, or even gain control of the database server.
*   **Example:**  Entering `' OR '1'='1` into a search field that is used directly in a SQL query.
*   **Mitigation:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all database interactions.  Never construct SQL queries by concatenating user input directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.3 Exploit insufficient output encoding to execute arbitrary JavaScript in other users' browsers](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_3_exploit_insufficient_output_encoding_to_execute_arbitrary_javascript_in_other_users'_browsers.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user input fields that are later displayed to other users without proper encoding.  When another user views the compromised page, the injected JavaScript code is executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal their session cookies, redirect them to malicious websites, or deface the page.
*   **Example:**  Entering `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into a comment field.
*   **Mitigation:**  Properly encode all user-supplied data before displaying it in the web page.  Use a context-aware output encoding library.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.3 Attempt to escalate privileges (e.g., access resources intended for other roles)](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_3_attempt_to_escalate_privileges__e_g___access_resources_intended_for_other_roles_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker, who may already have some level of access to the application, attempts to gain access to resources or perform actions that are restricted to users with higher privileges. This could involve manipulating session tokens, guessing user IDs, or exploiting flaws in the authorization logic.
*   **Example:**  Changing a user ID parameter in a URL to access another user's profile data.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure that all sensitive operations are properly authorized based on the user's role and permissions.  Thoroughly test authorization logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.4.3 Exploit insufficient access control checks to retrieve or modify data belonging to other users/entities](./attack_tree_paths/3_4_3_exploit_insufficient_access_control_checks_to_retrieve_or_modify_data_belonging_to_other_users_db66bdae.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker manipulates object identifiers (e.g., IDs, keys) that are exposed in URLs or request parameters to access data that they should not be able to access.  This is often due to a lack of proper access control checks on the server-side.
*   **Example:**  Changing the `productID` parameter in a URL from `productID=123` to `productID=456` to view details of a different product, even if the attacker should not have access to product 456.
*   **Mitigation:**  Implement proper access control checks on the server-side to ensure that users can only access data that they are authorized to view or modify.  Avoid exposing direct object references whenever possible. Use indirect object references or session-based access control.
