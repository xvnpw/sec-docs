# Attack Surface Analysis for openboxes/openboxes

## Attack Surface: [1. Inventory Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__inventory_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized modification of inventory data, including stock levels, product details, and lot numbers, *through OpenBoxes interfaces and logic*.
*   **How OpenBoxes Contributes:**  Inventory management is a *core* function, with OpenBoxes providing all the mechanisms for data entry, modification, and tracking. This is entirely within OpenBoxes' control.
*   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in OpenBoxes' "Receive Stock" functionality (specifically a flaw *within the OpenBoxes code*) to artificially inflate the quantity of a high-value item.
*   **Impact:**  Financial loss, supply chain disruption, inaccurate reporting, potential for dispensing incorrect/expired products.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strict input validation on *all* OpenBoxes inventory-related forms and API endpoints. Use parameterized queries *within OpenBoxes' database interactions*. Implement robust audit logging of all inventory changes *within OpenBoxes*. Enforce strong data type validation *within OpenBoxes*. Implement concurrency controls *within OpenBoxes' transaction handling*.
    *   **User:**  Implement strong access controls *within OpenBoxes*, limiting inventory modification privileges. Regularly reconcile physical inventory with OpenBoxes records. Implement a multi-person approval process *within OpenBoxes* for significant adjustments.

## Attack Surface: [2. Fraudulent Orders and Procurement (within OpenBoxes)](./attack_surfaces/2__fraudulent_orders_and_procurement__within_openboxes_.md)

*   **Description:**  Creation of fake orders, modification of existing orders, or manipulation of supplier data *using OpenBoxes' functionalities*.
*   **How OpenBoxes Contributes:**  OpenBoxes manages the entire procurement process *internally*, from creating purchase orders to receiving goods. The vulnerability lies within OpenBoxes' handling of this process.
*   **Example:**  An attacker creates a purchase order *within OpenBoxes* for a large quantity of goods, directing shipment to an unauthorized address, exploiting a flaw in OpenBoxes' order validation logic.
*   **Impact:**  Financial loss, delivery of goods to unauthorized locations, disruption of supply chain, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Implement strong validation of all order-related data *within OpenBoxes*. Implement workflow controls *within OpenBoxes* to require approvals. Securely store and manage supplier data *within OpenBoxes*. Use parameterized queries *in OpenBoxes' database interactions*.
    *   **User:**  Implement strong access controls *within OpenBoxes*, limiting order creation/modification. Regularly review and audit purchase orders *within OpenBoxes*. Implement a multi-person approval process *within OpenBoxes*.

## Attack Surface: [3. Shipment Diversion and Tracking Tampering (via OpenBoxes)](./attack_surfaces/3__shipment_diversion_and_tracking_tampering__via_openboxes_.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized redirection of shipments or manipulation of shipment tracking information *through OpenBoxes' interfaces*.
*   **How OpenBoxes Contributes:**  OpenBoxes manages shipment creation, tracking, and receiving *internally*. The attack vector is through OpenBoxes' functionality.
*   **Example:**  An attacker modifies the shipping address on a pending shipment *within the OpenBoxes interface*, exploiting a lack of validation in OpenBoxes.
*   **Impact:**  Loss of goods, disruption of supply chain, potential for theft or fraud.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Implement strong validation of shipping addresses and tracking information *within OpenBoxes*. Implement audit logging of all shipment-related changes *within OpenBoxes*. If integrating with external APIs, ensure secure communication and data validation *within OpenBoxes' integration code*.
    *   **User:**  Implement strong access controls *within OpenBoxes*, limiting shipment modification privileges. Regularly monitor shipment tracking information *displayed by OpenBoxes*.

## Attack Surface: [4. Privilege Escalation (within OpenBoxes)](./attack_surfaces/4__privilege_escalation__within_openboxes_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker with limited OpenBoxes user privileges gains unauthorized access to higher-level privileges *within OpenBoxes*.
*   **How OpenBoxes Contributes:**  OpenBoxes' role-based access control system is entirely self-contained.  The vulnerability and its exploitation occur *within OpenBoxes*.
*   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom OpenBoxes API endpoint (part of OpenBoxes' code) to grant themselves administrator privileges *within OpenBoxes*.
*   **Impact:**  Complete OpenBoxes compromise, data breach, ability to perform any action *within OpenBoxes*.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Thoroughly test and audit all OpenBoxes authentication and authorization mechanisms. Follow the principle of least privilege when designing OpenBoxes user roles. Avoid using default credentials *within OpenBoxes*. Regularly review and update OpenBoxes' role-based access control system. Sanitize user input *within OpenBoxes*.
    *   **User:**  Enforce strong password policies *for OpenBoxes users*. Implement multi-factor authentication for all OpenBoxes users, especially administrators. Regularly review OpenBoxes user accounts and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [5. Injection Attacks (SQL, XSS) - Targeting OpenBoxes Code](./attack_surfaces/5__injection_attacks__sql__xss__-_targeting_openboxes_code.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious code into OpenBoxes through user input fields *processed by OpenBoxes*.
*   **How OpenBoxes Contributes:**  OpenBoxes' code handles user input and database interactions. The vulnerability lies in *how OpenBoxes processes this input*.
*   **Example:**  An attacker enters a SQL injection payload into an OpenBoxes search field, allowing them to access or modify data in the database *because OpenBoxes does not properly sanitize the input*. Or, an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into an OpenBoxes comment field, which is then executed by other users (XSS) *because OpenBoxes does not properly encode the output*.
*   **Impact:**  Data breach, data modification, account takeover, website defacement, denial of service â€“ all *within the context of OpenBoxes*.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for *all database interactions within OpenBoxes*. Implement robust input validation and output encoding *within OpenBoxes* to prevent XSS. Use a well-vetted web application framework and follow its security guidelines *for OpenBoxes development*. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) *within OpenBoxes*.
    *   **User:** Educate users about phishing (though this is less directly related to OpenBoxes' internal code).

## Attack Surface: [6. API Security Weaknesses (OpenBoxes API)](./attack_surfaces/6__api_security_weaknesses__openboxes_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the OpenBoxes REST API, allowing unauthorized access or data manipulation *to OpenBoxes data and functionality*.
*   **How OpenBoxes Contributes:** The OpenBoxes REST API *is* OpenBoxes. Weaknesses here directly expose OpenBoxes' core.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers an OpenBoxes API endpoint that lacks proper authentication, allowing them to retrieve sensitive inventory data *from OpenBoxes*.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized modification of OpenBoxes data, denial of service *against OpenBoxes*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for all OpenBoxes API endpoints. Enforce strict input validation and output encoding for all OpenBoxes API requests and responses. Implement rate limiting *within the OpenBoxes API*. Use HTTPS for all OpenBoxes API communication. Regularly audit OpenBoxes API security and conduct penetration testing. Follow OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines *for the OpenBoxes API*.
    * **User:** If using OpenBoxes API keys, store them securely and rotate them regularly. Monitor OpenBoxes API usage for suspicious activity.
