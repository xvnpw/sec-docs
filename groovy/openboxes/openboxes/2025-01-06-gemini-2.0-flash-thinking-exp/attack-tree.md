## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using OpenBoxes (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code-Level Exploitation (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/code-level_exploitation__and___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities directly within the OpenBoxes codebase. Successful attacks in this category often lead to the most severe consequences.

    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Exploit Insecure Deserialization:** Attackers can inject malicious code into serialized data that, when processed by OpenBoxes, executes arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **Exploit Command Injection Vulnerability:** Attackers can manipulate input fields or parameters to inject system commands that are then executed by the OpenBoxes server.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerability in File Upload/Processing:** Attackers can upload malicious files that, when processed by OpenBoxes, lead to code execution on the server.
    *   **SQL Injection (Focus on OpenBoxes-Specific Queries) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Exploit Vulnerability in Custom OpenBoxes Database Queries:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are used to construct database queries within OpenBoxes, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute operating system commands in some database configurations.

*   **Exploit Vulnerability in Custom OpenBoxes Database Queries:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into input fields or parameters that are used to construct database queries within OpenBoxes, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute operating system commands in some database configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Exploitation (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_exploitation__and___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path involves exploiting misconfigurations within the OpenBoxes setup that can provide attackers with unauthorized access.

    *   **Insecure Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Access OpenBoxes with Default Administrator Credentials:** If the default username and password for administrative accounts in OpenBoxes are not changed after installation, attackers can easily gain full control of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Exploitation (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_exploitation__and___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and dependencies used by OpenBoxes.

    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in OpenBoxes Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Leverage Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by OpenBoxes:** Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the libraries that OpenBoxes relies on. This often involves using readily available exploit code to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass (AND) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass__and___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path targets weaknesses in how OpenBoxes verifies user identities and manages permissions.

    *   **Authentication Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Brute-force Attacks on OpenBoxes Login:** Attackers can attempt to guess user credentials by trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords.
        *   **Bypass Authentication via Vulnerable OpenBoxes Logic:** Attackers can exploit flaws in the authentication process itself to gain access without providing valid credentials.

*   This path focuses on actions that compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the data managed by OpenBoxes.

    *   **Data Exfiltration (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Extract Sensitive Data from OpenBoxes Database:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities like SQL injection or other access control flaws to directly access and extract sensitive information stored in the OpenBoxes database.
        *   **Leverage OpenBoxes Export Functionality for Unauthorized Data Extraction:** If the export features of OpenBoxes are not properly secured, attackers can use them to extract large amounts of data without proper authorization.
