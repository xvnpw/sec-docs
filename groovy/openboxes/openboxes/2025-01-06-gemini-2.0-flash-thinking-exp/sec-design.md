### 6. Data Flow

This section details the typical flow of data during a user interaction and highlights key data pathways within the system.

**Scenario: Viewing Inventory Items**

1. **User Action:** A user interacts with the OpenBoxes web interface through their web browser, navigating to the inventory list page.
2. **HTTP Request:** The web browser sends an HTTP GET request to the Tomcat server, specifically targeting the endpoint responsible for retrieving inventory data (e.g., `/inventory`).
3. **Request Handling:** The Tomcat server receives the request and forwards it to the appropriate Spring Controller within the Inventory Module of the OpenBoxes application.
4. **Business Logic Invocation:** The Spring Controller invokes the relevant service layer components within the Inventory Module. This service layer contains the business logic for retrieving inventory data.
5. **Data Access:** The service layer interacts with the PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API), which simplifies database interactions. It constructs and executes a SQL query (e.g., `SELECT * FROM items`) to fetch the required inventory data.
6. **Data Retrieval:** The PostgreSQL database executes the query and returns the requested inventory data to the service layer.
7. **Data Processing:** The service layer processes the retrieved data, potentially performing transformations or filtering as needed.
8. **Response Generation:** The service layer returns the processed inventory data to the Spring Controller. The Controller then prepares an HTTP response, typically in HTML format to render the inventory list in the web browser.
9. **HTTP Response:** The Tomcat server sends the HTTP response containing the HTML back to the user's web browser.
10. **Rendering:** The web browser receives the HTML and renders the inventory list page, displaying the retrieved data to the user.
