# Threat Model Analysis for openboxes/openboxes

## Threat: [Outdated Third-Party Library with Known Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability](./threats/outdated_third-party_library_with_known_remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerable third-party library used by OpenBoxes that has a publicly known remote code execution vulnerability. The attacker crafts a malicious request or manipulates input that triggers this vulnerability within the outdated library, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting OpenBoxes.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, disrupt services, or pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-party Libraries/Dependencies (e.g., a specific version of a logging library, a framework component, etc.)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a robust dependency management process to track and update all third-party libraries used by OpenBoxes.
    *   Utilize automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Establish a regular patching schedule to promptly update vulnerable libraries.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization Vulnerability in a Core OpenBoxes Module](./threats/insecure_deserialization_vulnerability_in_a_core_openboxes_module.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies a module within OpenBoxes that deserializes untrusted data without proper validation. They craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the vulnerable module, executes arbitrary code or triggers other unintended actions.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application server or perform malicious actions within the application's context.
*   **Affected Component:**  A specific OpenBoxes module responsible for handling data serialization/deserialization (e.g., a module handling API requests, data import/export, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
    *   Utilize secure serialization mechanisms that prevent code execution during deserialization.
    *   Regularly audit the OpenBoxes codebase for insecure deserialization patterns.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Flawed Logic in OpenBoxes' Authentication Module](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_flawed_logic_in_openboxes'_authentication_module.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a flaw in the OpenBoxes authentication logic that allows them to bypass the normal login process without providing valid credentials. This could involve manipulating request parameters, exploiting race conditions, or leveraging logical errors in the authentication code.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the OpenBoxes application, allowing the attacker to view, modify, or delete sensitive data, and potentially perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** OpenBoxes Authentication Module (responsible for user login and session management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test the OpenBoxes authentication logic for potential bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the authentication module.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation Vulnerability within OpenBoxes' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./threats/privilege_escalation_vulnerability_within_openboxes'_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with low-level privileges within OpenBoxes discovers a vulnerability in the RBAC implementation that allows them to elevate their privileges to those of a higher-level user (e.g., administrator). This could involve exploiting flaws in permission checks or manipulating user roles.
*   **Impact:** The attacker gains access to functionalities and data that should be restricted to higher-level users, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or system disruptions.
*   **Affected Component:** OpenBoxes Authorization/RBAC Module (responsible for managing user roles and permissions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and implement the RBAC system, ensuring proper segregation of duties and least privilege principles.
    *   Thoroughly test the RBAC implementation for potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.
