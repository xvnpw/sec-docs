## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Data or Functionality via OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_data_or_functionality_via_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overall goal and a critical node as it represents the successful compromise of the application through OpenBoxes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in OpenBoxes Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_openboxes_code__critical_node_.md)

*   This path represents exploiting flaws directly within the OpenBoxes codebase. It's critical because successful exploitation can lead to a wide range of high-impact consequences.
    *   **Identify Vulnerable OpenBoxes Component:** The attacker first needs to identify a specific part of OpenBoxes that contains a vulnerability.
    *   **Exploit Identified Vulnerability:** The attacker then leverages the identified vulnerability to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] SQL Injection in OpenBoxes Queries [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__sql_injection_in_openboxes_queries__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers inject malicious SQL code into OpenBoxes input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized.
    *   This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to:
        *   Data breaches (accessing sensitive information).
        *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
        *   In some cases, even remote code execution on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in OpenBoxes UI](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__cross-site_scripting__xss__in_openboxes_ui.md)

*   Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into OpenBoxes data fields (e.g., item names, descriptions).
    *   When other users view this data, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially allowing attackers to:
        *   Steal session cookies (session hijacking).
        *   Deface the application.
        *   Redirect users to phishing sites.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Deserialization in OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_deserialization_in_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   If OpenBoxes uses serialization to handle data, attackers can provide maliciously crafted serialized objects.
    *   When OpenBoxes deserializes these objects, it can lead to:
        *   Remote code execution on the server.
        *   Other unexpected and potentially harmful behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Remote Code Execution (RCE) in OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__remote_code_execution__rce__in_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in OpenBoxes that allow them to execute arbitrary code directly on the server.
    *   This is a critical vulnerability as it grants the attacker complete control over the server and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass in OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass_in_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers find ways to circumvent OpenBoxes's login mechanisms or access resources they are not authorized to view or modify.
    *   Successful bypass can lead to:
        *   Access to sensitive data.
        *   The ability to perform privileged actions within OpenBoxes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in OpenBoxes Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_openboxes_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

*   OpenBoxes relies on various third-party libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application.
    *   This highlights the importance of keeping dependencies up-to-date.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Data Validation in OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_data_validation_in_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   OpenBoxes fails to properly validate user input, allowing attackers to provide unexpected or malicious data.
    *   This can lead to various vulnerabilities, including:
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
        *   SQL injection (as seen above).
        *   Other unexpected application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data within OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data_within_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   OpenBoxes stores sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) in plaintext or with weak encryption.
    *   If attackers gain access to the database or configuration files, they can easily compromise this information, potentially leading to:
        *   Full compromise of OpenBoxes.
        *   Compromise of integrated systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Integration Weaknesses between Application and OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_integration_weaknesses_between_application_and_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the main application integrates with OpenBoxes.
    *   Weaknesses in the integration can create pathways for attackers to compromise either system.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Shared Database Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__shared_database_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   If the application and OpenBoxes share the same database, vulnerabilities in either system can be exploited to compromise the other.
    *   For example, an SQL injection in the main application could be used to access OpenBoxes data, or vice versa.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure API Communication between Application and OpenBoxes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__insecure_api_communication_between_application_and_openboxes__critical_node_.md)

*   The application and OpenBoxes communicate via an API without proper security measures.
    *   This can allow attackers to:
        *   Intercept and manipulate API requests and responses (if not using HTTPS).
        *   Exploit a lack of authentication or authorization to gain unauthorized access or control.
