        2.  **Establish Update Schedule for OpenBoxes:** Define a regular schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) specifically for checking and updating OpenBoxes dependencies. This should be part of the OpenBoxes project maintenance.
        3.  **Utilize Dependency Management Tools for OpenBoxes:** Use Gradle's dependency management features or integrate tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot directly into the OpenBoxes development workflow to identify outdated dependencies and known vulnerabilities within the OpenBoxes project.
        4.  **Review Vulnerability Reports for OpenBoxes Dependencies:** Analyze reports generated by these tools, prioritizing vulnerabilities with high severity scores and known exploits that affect OpenBoxes dependencies.
        5.  **Update OpenBoxes Dependencies:** Update identified dependencies within the OpenBoxes project to their latest stable versions. For critical security updates, consider backporting patches to stable OpenBoxes releases if necessary.
        6.  **Test OpenBoxes Thoroughly:** After updating dependencies within OpenBoxes, perform comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and system tests) of OpenBoxes to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions introduced by dependency updates.
        7.  **Document OpenBoxes Dependency Updates:**  Maintain a record of dependency updates within the OpenBoxes project documentation, including dates, versions, and reasons for updates.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
