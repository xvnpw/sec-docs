# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `font-mfizz`, provides an iconic font for web developers. The primary business goal is to offer a free, open-source, and high-quality icon set that simplifies the integration of icons into web projects. This aims to enhance user interface design and improve the visual appeal of web applications.

Business priorities include:
- Providing a comprehensive and versatile icon set.
- Ensuring ease of use and integration for developers.
- Maintaining compatibility across different browsers and platforms.
- Fostering community adoption and contribution.
- Ensuring the project remains open-source and freely accessible.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of low adoption if the icon set is not perceived as useful or comprehensive enough.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in the font files or associated CSS, potentially leading to website compromise if used.
- Risk of supply chain attacks if build dependencies are compromised.
- Risk of licensing issues if dependencies or included assets are not properly licensed.
- Risk of project abandonment if not actively maintained, leading to outdated icons or security vulnerabilities remaining unpatched.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open-source project with public code repository on GitHub. This allows for community review and potential identification of vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: MIT License. This ensures clarity on usage rights and reduces legal risks associated with using the font. Implemented: LICENSE file in the repository.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in build tools and dependencies used to create the font.
- accepted risk: Lack of dedicated security team actively monitoring the project for vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning of the codebase and build artifacts for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using GitHub Actions with vulnerability scanning tools).
- recommended security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Regularly update build tools and dependencies to their latest secure versions.
- recommended security control: Consider code signing the font files to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- recommended security control: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) when including the font CSS and font files on web pages to prevent tampering.

Security requirements:

Authentication:
- Not applicable. The font is a publicly available resource and does not require authentication.

Authorization:
- Not applicable. Access to the font is public and does not require authorization.

Input validation:
- security requirement: While the font itself is a static asset, the build process involves processing SVG files. Input validation should be applied to ensure that SVG files are parsed safely and do not introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., XML External Entity attacks). Implemented: within build scripts (needs verification).
- security requirement: Ensure that CSS generated is valid and does not contain any malicious code. Implemented: within build scripts (needs verification).

Cryptography:
- security requirement: Serve font files and CSS over HTTPS to ensure confidentiality and integrity during transmission. Implemented: Web server/CDN configuration where the font is hosted.
- security requirement: Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for CSS and font files to ensure integrity when loaded by web browsers. Implemented: Web page integration.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

What are critical business process we are trying to protect?
- The critical business process is providing a functional, reliable, and secure icon font library to web developers. This includes the build, distribution, and availability of the font.

What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?
- We are trying to protect:
    - Source SVG icon files: Sensitivity is moderate. Loss or unauthorized modification could disrupt the project and potentially introduce malicious icons.
    - Build process and build environment: Sensitivity is high. Compromise could lead to supply chain attacks by injecting malicious code into the font files or CSS.
    - Distribution files (font files and CSS): Sensitivity is moderate. Integrity and availability are important to ensure users are getting the intended and safe font library.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended audience for this font library in terms of security sensitivity? Are they primarily used in public-facing websites or also in more sensitive internal applications?
- Are there any specific security concerns or past incidents related to font files or icon libraries that are relevant to this project?
- What is the current build process and what tools are being used? Is there any existing automation or CI/CD pipeline?
- Are there any existing security scanning or code quality checks in place during the build process?
- What is the planned distribution method for the font library? Will it be hosted on a CDN, npm, or other platforms?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - The primary goal is to provide a free and open-source icon font for general web development use.
    - Community adoption and ease of use are key success metrics.
    - Security is important to maintain trust and prevent misuse, but not the absolute highest priority compared to functionality and usability for a public, open-source project.
- SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Currently, security controls are minimal, typical for many open-source projects focused on functionality first.
    - The project is willing to improve security posture by implementing recommended controls.
    - The target deployment environment will support HTTPS and SRI.
- DESIGN:
    - The build process is currently manual or semi-automated and can be improved with a more robust CI/CD pipeline.
    - Distribution will likely be via CDN or similar public hosting.
    - The project is relatively simple in architecture, focused on generating and distributing static assets (font files and CSS).
