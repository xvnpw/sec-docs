# Threat Model Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Threat: [Threat 1: Font Parsing Vulnerability Exploitation Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/threat_1_font_parsing_vulnerability_exploitation_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Font Parsing Vulnerability Exploitation (Remote Code Execution)
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a highly malicious font file (e.g., `.woff`, `.ttf`) designed to exploit a critical vulnerability in browser font parsing engines. This malicious font file replaces a legitimate `font-mfizz` font file on the server or is injected during delivery. When a user's browser attempts to render a webpage using `font-mfizz`, the browser's font parsing engine processes the malicious font. This triggers a critical vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine. This allows the attacker to gain full control over the user's system, potentially stealing data, installing malware, or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Affected Component:** User's Browser Font Rendering Engine (processing `font-mfizz` font files).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Browsers Updated:**  Users *must* keep their browsers updated to the latest versions. Browser vendors are constantly patching critical font parsing vulnerabilities. This is the most crucial mitigation.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Implement SRI hashes for `font-mfizz` CSS and font files. This ensures that the browser *only* loads files that match the expected hash, preventing attackers from replacing legitimate font files with malicious ones. This is a vital preventative measure.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which fonts can be loaded (`font-src` directive). This limits potential attack vectors by controlling where font files can originate from.
    *   **Use Reputable CDN (If Applicable):** If using a CDN to serve `font-mfizz` assets, choose a well-established and security-conscious provider. While not a primary mitigation against font parsing bugs, it reduces the risk of CDN compromise.
    *   **Regularly Update `font-mfizz`:** While `font-mfizz` itself doesn't patch browser vulnerabilities, staying updated ensures you are using the intended font files and might indirectly benefit from any changes in font file generation or usage in newer versions.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Supply Chain Compromise of font-mfizz Leading to Malicious Code Injection](./threats/threat_2_supply_chain_compromise_of_font-mfizz_leading_to_malicious_code_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Compromise (Malicious Code Injection)
*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `font-mfizz` library at its source (e.g., GitHub repository) or during its distribution (e.g., CDN or package registry). Malicious code is injected directly into the `font-mfizz` library files (CSS, font files, or potentially build scripts if used). When developers include the compromised `font-mfizz` library in their web applications, they unknowingly integrate this malicious code into their applications, which is then served to users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High:** Malware distribution to application users. The injected malicious code can execute in users' browsers, potentially leading to malware installation, drive-by downloads, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **High:** Backdoors in applications. The compromised library could introduce backdoors allowing attackers to further compromise applications or user sessions.
    *   **High:** Data theft. Malicious code could be designed to steal sensitive user data or application data and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers.
*   **Affected Component:** `font-mfizz` library files (CSS, font files) and consequently, any application code that includes and uses the compromised `font-mfizz` library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Verify Source and Integrity:** Download `font-mfizz` *only* from the official and trusted GitHub repository. Verify the integrity of downloaded files using checksums or signatures if provided.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Implement SRI hashes for `font-mfizz` CSS and font files. This is crucial to ensure that the browser verifies the integrity of the files against a known-good hash, detecting any tampering from a compromised source or during transit.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Auditing:** Use dependency scanning tools to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in `font-mfizz` and its dependencies (if any). Regularly audit your dependencies for any signs of compromise or unusual changes.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `font-mfizz` and all other project dependencies updated. While updates are not a direct mitigation against supply chain attacks, staying current can help in quickly identifying and responding to any reported compromises.
    *   **Use Package Managers with Security Features:** Utilize package managers (like npm, yarn, or pip) that offer security features such as vulnerability scanning, dependency locking, and provenance checks.
    *   **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior:** After updating or including `font-mfizz`, carefully monitor your application and user reports for any unexpected or anomalous behavior that could indicate a supply chain compromise.
