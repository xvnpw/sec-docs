## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Font Files [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_font_files__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within font files (TTF, WOFF, SVG) provided by font-mfizz.
*   **Focus:**  This node is critical because it represents the core threat related to font-mfizz itself - the potential for malicious font files to be used to compromise the application.
*   **Key Threat:** Font Parsing Vulnerabilities in Browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Font Parsing Vulnerability in Browser [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/font_parsing_vulnerability_in_browser__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging weaknesses in browser font parsing engines to execute malicious code or cause denial of service when processing crafted font files from font-mfizz.
*   **Focus:** This node is critical as it's the underlying vulnerability that attackers aim to exploit within the "Exploit Malicious Font Files" path.
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack during Download [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_during_download__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting the download of font-mfizz assets (CSS and font files) if the application uses insecure HTTP, and replacing legitimate files with malicious ones.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Yes, due to medium likelihood and critical impact.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if application uses HTTP for assets).
*   **Impact:** Critical (Code execution in browser).
*   **Effort:** Low (Tools readily available for MITM).
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner (Basic network manipulation).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Network monitoring can detect anomalies).
*   **Mitigation Priority:** **High**.  Immediately switch to HTTPS for all asset delivery.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application's Asset Delivery Mechanism [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application's_asset_delivery_mechanism__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the server or CDN where the application hosts font-mfizz assets to replace legitimate font files with malicious versions.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Yes, due to low to medium likelihood and major impact.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on server/CDN security).
*   **Impact:** Major (Compromise of application for all users).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Server/CDN exploitation skills).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Web server/CDN security knowledge).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Security monitoring, integrity checks can detect).
*   **Mitigation Priority:** **High**.  Strengthen server/CDN security, implement integrity checks for assets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting developers through social engineering tactics to introduce malicious font-mfizz components into the application.
*   **Focus:** This node is critical because it highlights the human element as a vulnerability point, even if font-mfizz itself is secure.
*   **Key Threat:** Phishing Attacks Targeting Developers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing Attack Targeting Developers [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_attack_targeting_developers__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Tricking developers into downloading and using a compromised version of font-mfizz through phishing emails or messages impersonating legitimate sources.
*   **High-Risk Path:** Yes, due to medium likelihood and major impact.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Phishing is a common attack vector).
*   **Impact:** Major (Developer machine compromise, code injection).
*   **Effort:** Low (Phishing templates and tools are readily available).
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner (Basic social engineering skills).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (User awareness training, email security can help).
*   **Mitigation Priority:** **High**. Implement developer security awareness training, secure development workflows, and use trusted sources for dependencies.
