# Attack Surface Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Attack Surface: [Font File Parsing Vulnerabilities (High to Critical)](./attack_surfaces/font_file_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_to_critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within browser or operating system font parsing libraries when processing font files provided by `font-mfizz`. A maliciously crafted font file can trigger these vulnerabilities.
*   **Font-mfizz Contribution:** `font-mfizz` provides font files (TTF, WOFF, etc.) that are processed by the user's browser. If these files are maliciously crafted *or* if standard font files trigger existing browser parsing bugs, using `font-mfizz` exposes the application to this risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker replaces a legitimate `font-mfizz` font file on the server with a specially crafted malicious font. When a user's browser loads a page using `font-mfizz`, it downloads and parses this malicious font. This triggers a critical buffer overflow vulnerability in the browser's font rendering engine, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Critical:**  Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to gain complete control over the user's system.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High:** A malformed font file could crash the browser or rendering engine, causing a denial of service for the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for RCE scenarios) to **High** (for DoS scenarios).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Browser and OS Updates:**  Users *must* be strongly encouraged to keep their browsers and operating systems updated. Vendors regularly patch font parsing vulnerabilities, and updates are crucial for protection. Developers should inform users about this necessity.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) - Strict `font-src` Directive:** Implement a strict CSP with a tightly controlled `font-src` directive.  Only allow font loading from trusted, explicitly defined origins (ideally your own domain or a reputable CDN you control).  Avoid `unsafe-inline` or overly permissive `font-src` directives.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) - For CDN Usage:** If `font-mfizz` font files are served from a CDN, *always* use Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags in your HTML. This ensures that the browser verifies the integrity of the downloaded font files against a cryptographic hash, preventing the loading of tampered files from a compromised CDN or during a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
    *   **Regularly Review and Update Font-mfizz (Less Direct but Good Practice):** While less likely to contain vulnerabilities *within* the font files themselves from the `font-mfizz` project, keeping the library updated is a general security best practice. It ensures you are using the intended files and potentially benefits from any community security awareness.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Delivery Leading to Malicious Font Injection (High)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_delivery_leading_to_malicious_font_injection__high_.md)

*   **Description:**  Insecure delivery mechanisms for `font-mfizz` font files (e.g., over unencrypted HTTP) allow attackers to intercept and replace legitimate font files with malicious ones. This then leverages Font File Parsing Vulnerabilities.
*   **Font-mfizz Contribution:**  `font-mfizz` font files need to be delivered to the user's browser. Insecure delivery directly enables the injection of malicious font files in place of the intended `font-mfizz` icons.
*   **Example:** Font files are served over HTTP. An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the network. They intercept the font file download and inject a malicious font file. The user's browser, expecting a legitimate `font-mfizz` font, downloads and processes the attacker's malicious font, potentially triggering a parsing vulnerability and leading to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Critical (via chained Font Parsing Vulnerability):** If the injected malicious font exploits a parsing vulnerability, it can lead to RCE.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High:** An injected malformed font can cause browser crashes and DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to the potential for chaining with parsing vulnerabilities to achieve RCE, and the feasibility of MitM attacks in certain network contexts).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS for All Font Delivery:**  *Mandatory* serving of `font-mfizz` font files over HTTPS is critical. This encrypts the communication channel and prevents Man-in-the-Middle attacks that could be used to inject malicious fonts.  There is *no* acceptable reason to serve font files over unencrypted HTTP in a production environment.
    *   **Secure Server and CDN Infrastructure:**  Harden and regularly audit the security of servers and CDNs hosting `font-mfizz` files. Prevent unauthorized access and ensure file integrity to avoid attackers replacing legitimate files with malicious ones at the source.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (Server-Side):** Implement server-side file integrity monitoring for the `font-mfizz` font files. This can detect unauthorized modifications to the files on the server, alerting administrators to potential compromises.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Server Access):**  Restrict write access to the directories containing `font-mfizz` files on the server to only necessary processes and users. This minimizes the risk of accidental or malicious modification of the font files.
