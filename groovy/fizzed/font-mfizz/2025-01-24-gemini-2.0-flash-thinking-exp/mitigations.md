# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Font Files](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_font_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Font Files
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hashes:** Use a tool to generate SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 hashes for each `font-mfizz` font file (e.g., `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`) and the `font-mfizz.css` file if loaded from a CDN.
    2.  **Integrate Hashes into HTML/CSS:** Add the `integrity` attribute to the `<link>` tag in your HTML for the `font-mfizz.css` file, along with `crossorigin="anonymous"`.
        ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/font-mfizz/font-mfizz.css" integrity="sha384-YOUR_CSS_FILE_HASH_HERE" crossorigin="anonymous">
        ```
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CDN/Hosting Compromise (High Severity):** If the CDN or server hosting `font-mfizz` is compromised, malicious actors could replace legitimate files with modified ones. SRI prevents the browser from using tampered files.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Medium Severity):** During transit, an attacker could intercept and modify the `font-mfizz` files. SRI ensures only files matching the hash are accepted.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **CDN/Hosting Compromise:** High risk reduction. Prevents execution of compromised `font-mfizz` files loaded via `<link>` with SRI.
    *   **MITM Attacks:** High risk reduction. Prevents use of modified `font-mfizz` files during transit for resources loaded via `<link>` with SRI.
*   **Currently Implemented:** SRI is currently implemented for the `font-mfizz.css` file loaded from our primary CDN in the `<head>` of public-facing HTML pages.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   SRI is not currently implemented for fallback CDN URLs (if configured).
    *   Internal admin panels or less critical application sections might be missing SRI for `font-mfizz` resources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Font Sources (`font-src` directive)](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_font_sources___font-src__directive_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Content Security Policy (CSP) for Font Sources (`font-src` directive)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Web Server:** Access your web server's configuration.
    2.  **Set `Content-Security-Policy` Header:** Add or modify the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header.
    3.  **Define `font-src` Directive:** Include `font-src` in the CSP header to specify allowed origins for font resources, including where `font-mfizz` is loaded from.
        *   Example CSP header: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; font-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;`
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** If an attacker injects HTML (XSS), they could try to load malicious `font-mfizz` files from attacker-controlled domains. CSP `font-src` prevents loading fonts from unauthorized origins.
    *   **Malicious Font Injection via HTML Injection (Medium Severity):** Similar to XSS, HTML injection could be used to load malicious `font-mfizz` fonts. CSP `font-src` restricts allowed font sources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Attacks:** Medium to High risk reduction. Reduces the impact of XSS related to loading malicious `font-mfizz` fonts.
    *   **Malicious Font Injection:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents loading `font-mfizz` fonts from unexpected sources due to HTML injection.
*   **Currently Implemented:** A basic CSP header is implemented on our main web server, including `font-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com` where `font-mfizz` is loaded from.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `font-src` directive could be more restrictive by explicitly listing only the specific CDN domain used for `font-mfizz`.
    *   CSP is not consistently applied across all subdomains or internal applications using `font-mfizz`.
    *   CSP reporting is not fully configured to monitor for violations related to `font-mfizz` font loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update font-mfizz Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_font-mfizz_library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular `font-mfizz` Library Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check the `font-mfizz` GitHub repository for new releases, security announcements, and bug fixes.
    2.  **Review Changelogs/Release Notes:** Review changelogs to understand changes, especially security fixes in `font-mfizz` updates.
    3.  **Test Updates:** Test `font-mfizz` updates in development/staging environments before production.
    4.  **Deploy to Production:** Deploy updated `font-mfizz` library to production after testing.
    5.  **Repeat Regularly:** Establish a schedule for checking and applying updates to `font-mfizz`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `font-mfizz` or Dependencies (Medium Severity):** Older versions of `font-mfizz` might have known security issues. Updates patch these vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in `font-mfizz` or Dependencies:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the likelihood of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the `font-mfizz` library.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We have a semi-annual review process for updating front-end libraries, including `font-mfizz`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The update process for `font-mfizz` is not automated or continuous.
    *   We lack automated dependency scanning tools to proactively identify outdated `font-mfizz` versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Host font-mfizz Resources Locally (Self-Hosting)](./mitigation_strategies/host_font-mfizz_resources_locally__self-hosting_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Self-Hosting `font-mfizz` Resources
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Download `font-mfizz` Files:** Download `font-mfizz` CSS and font files.
    2.  **Include in Project:** Add these files to your project's static assets directory.
    3.  **Update Paths:** Modify HTML and CSS to reference locally hosted `font-mfizz` files instead of CDN URLs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CDN/Third-Party Compromise (Medium Severity):** Reduces dependency on external CDNs for `font-mfizz`. If their infrastructure is compromised, your application is less directly affected regarding `font-mfizz`.
    *   **CDN Availability Issues (Low Severity - Security related to availability):** Self-hosting removes dependency on external CDN availability for `font-mfizz`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **CDN/Third-Party Compromise:** Medium risk reduction. Shifts security control of `font-mfizz` resources to your infrastructure.
    *   **CDN Availability Issues:** Low risk reduction (primarily availability benefit). Improves resilience against CDN outages for `font-mfizz`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We are currently using a CDN for `font-mfizz` CSS and font files for public-facing website sections.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Self-hosting is not implemented for `font-mfizz` in any part of the project.
    *   We could consider self-hosting `font-mfizz` for internal applications where CDN benefits are less critical.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Usage of External Resources (font-mfizz Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_usage_of_external_resources__font-mfizz_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Usage of External `font-mfizz` Resources
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit Icon Usage:** Review your application and identify all places where `font-mfizz` icons are used.
    2.  **Evaluate Necessity:** For each `font-mfizz` icon usage, evaluate if it's truly necessary and if alternatives are possible.
    3.  **Implement Alternatives:** Replace `font-mfizz` icons with alternatives (SVG, CSS icons, Unicode) where feasible.
    4.  **Subset Font (If Applicable):** If `font-mfizz` is necessary but only a few icons are used, explore font subsetting to create a smaller, custom `font-mfizz` file with only used icons.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Overall Attack Surface Reduction (Low Severity):** Reducing dependency on `font-mfizz` reduces the attack surface related to this specific library.
    *   **Performance Improvement (Low Severity - Indirect Security Benefit):** Reducing the size of downloaded `font-mfizz` resources improves page load times.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Overall Attack Surface Reduction:** Low risk reduction. Marginal reduction in risk specifically related to `font-mfizz`.
    *   **Performance Improvement:** Low risk reduction (indirect). Primarily a performance benefit related to `font-mfizz` resources.
*   **Currently Implemented:** We have started using SVG icons for new features, reducing reliance on `font-mfizz` in some areas.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive audit of all `font-mfizz` icon usage across the application is needed.
    *   Font subsetting for `font-mfizz` has not been explored.
    *   Formal guidelines to prioritize alternatives over `font-mfizz` for new icons are missing.
