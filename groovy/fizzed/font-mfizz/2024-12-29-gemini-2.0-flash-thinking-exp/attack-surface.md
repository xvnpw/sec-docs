### Key Attack Surface List: font-mfizz (High & Critical, Direct Involvement)

Here's a filtered list of key attack surfaces that directly involve `font-mfizz` and are classified as High or Critical severity.

* **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Compromise - Compromised GitHub Repository
    * **Description:** The official `font-mfizz` GitHub repository is compromised, leading to the injection of malicious code into the font files or CSS.
    * **How font-mfizz Contributes:** Applications directly download or reference the library from this repository or its releases. If compromised, the delivered `font-mfizz` files are malicious.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the `font-mfizz` repository and modifies the `font-mfizz.css` file to include JavaScript that exfiltrates user cookies.
    * **Impact:** Client-side code execution, data exfiltration, redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use package managers with integrity checks (e.g., npm/yarn with lock files and integrity hashes).
        * Verify the source and maintainer reputation of the library.
        * Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CSS files served from CDNs.

* **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Compromise - Compromised Release Artifacts
    * **Description:** The release artifacts of `font-mfizz` (font files, CSS) are compromised during the build or distribution process.
    * **How font-mfizz Contributes:** Applications rely on the integrity of the released `font-mfizz` files. If these are tampered with, the application integrates malicious components from `font-mfizz`.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor compromises the build server used to create `font-mfizz` releases and injects a keylogger into the `font-mfizz.woff2` file.
    * **Impact:** Client-side code execution, data exfiltration, potential for persistent compromise if the malicious font is widely distributed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify checksums or signatures of downloaded release artifacts if provided by the maintainers.
        * Monitor for unexpected changes in library versions or file hashes.
        * Implement a secure build and release pipeline for your own application.

* **Attack Surface:** Client-Side Vulnerabilities - Font Parsing Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Bugs in browser font rendering engines are triggered by specially crafted font files within `font-mfizz`.
    * **How font-mfizz Contributes:** The library provides font files that are processed by the user's browser. Maliciously crafted fonts within the `font-mfizz` library can exploit these vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** A specially crafted glyph in one of the `font-mfizz` font files triggers a buffer overflow in the browser's font rendering engine, leading to a browser crash or potentially remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (browser crash), potential for memory corruption and remote code execution (though less likely with modern browsers).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep user browsers updated to the latest versions, as browser vendors regularly patch font rendering vulnerabilities.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which fonts can be loaded, limiting the impact if a malicious `font-mfizz` font is somehow introduced.
