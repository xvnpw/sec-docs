**High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Font Mfizz**

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Dependency
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers a known vulnerability in a version of `font-mfizz` being used. They might exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific requests or interactions with the application that trigger the flaw in the library's code. This could involve sending malicious data or exploiting a weakness in how the library handles certain inputs or states.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to various outcomes, such as denial of service (crashing the application), information disclosure (leaking sensitive data), or even remote code execution (allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server or client).
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `font-mfizz` library is affected, specifically the vulnerable code within its files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update `font-mfizz` to the latest version. Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities. Implement a process for patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities promptly.
