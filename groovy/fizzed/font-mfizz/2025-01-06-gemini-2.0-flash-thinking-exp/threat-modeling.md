# Threat Model Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Repository](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_compromised_repository.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the `font-mfizz` GitHub repository or its distribution channels. They inject malicious code into the font files (WOFF, TTF) or CSS files. When a user's browser loads these compromised files, the malicious code executes, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or further compromise of the user's system.

**Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of user systems, data breaches, and reputational damage to the application.

**Affected Component:** Font files (WOFF, TTF), CSS files.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Verify the integrity of downloaded `font-mfizz` files using checksums or signatures if provided by the official source.
* Use reputable and trusted CDNs if not self-hosting, and verify their security practices.
* Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for unexpected changes.
* Consider using subresource integrity (SRI) hashes for CSS files. While browser support for SRI on fonts is limited, monitor for advancements in this area.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack Leading to Malicious Font Delivery](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack_leading_to_malicious_font_delivery.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious package with the name `font-mfizz` to a public or private package registry. If the application's build process is misconfigured or prioritizes this malicious registry, it could download and use the attacker's compromised font library instead of the legitimate one. This malicious library could contain backdoors or exploit vulnerabilities in the browser.

**Impact:** High. Potential for remote code execution on user browsers, data theft, and application compromise.

**Affected Component:** Entire `font-mfizz` library as delivered through package managers.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure package managers to prioritize official and trusted repositories.
* Implement namespace management and access controls for private package registries.
* Regularly audit dependencies and their sources.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Font Parsing Vulnerabilities in Browsers](./threats/exploitation_of_font_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_browsers.md)

**Description:**  Although less common, vulnerabilities might exist in the font parsing logic of web browsers. A specially crafted font file within `font-mfizz`, either intentionally malicious or inadvertently containing a bug, could trigger these vulnerabilities. This could lead to browser crashes, denial of service for the user, or potentially even remote code execution in older or unpatched browsers.

**Impact:** Medium to High. Denial of service for users, potential for remote code execution on vulnerable browsers.

**Affected Component:** Font files (WOFF, TTF).

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Encourage users to keep their web browsers up-to-date.
* While direct mitigation on the application side is limited, staying informed about browser security advisories is important.
