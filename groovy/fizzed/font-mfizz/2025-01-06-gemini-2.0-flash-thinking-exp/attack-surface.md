# Attack Surface Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Attack Surface: [Font File Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/font_file_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Web browsers rely on complex font rendering engines to display font files. These engines can have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by maliciously crafted font files.
    *   **How font-mfizz contributes to the attack surface:** `font-mfizz` provides the actual font files (`.ttf`, `.woff`, etc.) that are processed by the browser's font rendering engine. If a malicious actor can replace a legitimate `font-mfizz` file with a crafted one, or if a vulnerability exists within the legitimate files themselves, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted `.ttf` file from `font-mfizz` could trigger a buffer overflow in the browser's font rendering engine when it tries to parse the file, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (browser crash), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep browsers updated to the latest versions to patch known font rendering vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which fonts can be loaded, limiting the possibility of loading malicious fonts from untrusted origins.
        *   Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags on the `<link>` or `@font-face` declarations to ensure the integrity of the font files.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Compromise](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk that the `font-mfizz` library itself could be compromised at its source (e.g., GitHub repository) or during its distribution, leading to the inclusion of malicious code or files.
    *   **How font-mfizz contributes to the attack surface:** By depending on `font-mfizz`, your application inherits the security posture of its development and distribution channels. If the `font-mfizz` repository is compromised, a malicious version could be served to developers.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the `font-mfizz` GitHub repository and replaces the legitimate font files with crafted ones containing exploits. Developers pulling the latest version would unknowingly include these malicious files in their applications.
    *   **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code or exploitable font files in your application, potentially leading to various attacks on your users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor the `font-mfizz` repository for any suspicious activity or changes.
        *   Verify the integrity of the `font-mfizz` library when including it in your project (e.g., by checking checksums if available).
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the `font-mfizz` library.
        *   Consider using a private or internally managed copy of the library if concerns about the public repository are high.
