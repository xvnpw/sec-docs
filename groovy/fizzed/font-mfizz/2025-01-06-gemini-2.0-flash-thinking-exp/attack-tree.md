## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Font File Substitution](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_font_file_substitution.md)

**Exploit Malicious Font File Substitution:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker replaces legitimate `font-mfizz` font files on the server with malicious versions.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to client-side rendering issues, the delivery of misleading or malicious content through manipulated glyphs, and resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Server File System](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_server_file_system.md)

**Gain Access to Server File System:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the server's file system where the `font-mfizz` font files are stored. This could be through exploiting other server vulnerabilities or compromising server credentials.
    *   **Impact:** This access enables the attacker to replace legitimate font files with malicious ones (leading to the "Exploit Malicious Font File Substitution" path) and potentially perform other server-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CSS Injection to Manipulate Icon Display](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_css_injection_to_manipulate_icon_display.md)

**Exploit CSS Injection to Manipulate Icon Display:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker exploits a CSS Injection vulnerability in the application to inject malicious CSS code.
    *   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to alter the appearance and potentially the behavior of `font-mfizz` icons, leading to misleading user interfaces and clickjacking attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify CSS Injection Vulnerability (Common Web App Threat - OMIT)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_css_injection_vulnerability__common_web_app_threat_-_omit_.md)

**Identify CSS Injection Vulnerability (Common Web App Threat - OMIT):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies a weakness in the application's handling of user-controlled input that allows for the injection of arbitrary CSS code.
    *   **Impact:** This is a prerequisite for the "Exploit CSS Injection to Manipulate Icon Display" path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerability in How Font Files are Served (e.g., misconfigured CDN, insecure storage)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerability_in_how_font_files_are_served__e_g___misconfigured_cdn__insecure_storage_.md)

**Identify Vulnerability in How Font Files are Served (e.g., misconfigured CDN, insecure storage):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker identifies a security flaw in the infrastructure used to host and serve the `font-mfizz` font files. This could involve misconfigured CDNs, insecure cloud storage buckets, or other vulnerabilities in the hosting environment.
    *   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to potentially replace the legitimate font files with malicious ones or redirect users to malicious sites when they attempt to load the font files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deliver Misleading or Malicious Content](./attack_tree_paths/deliver_misleading_or_malicious_content.md)

**Exploit Malicious Font File Substitution -> Deliver Misleading or Malicious Content:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** After successfully substituting malicious font files, the attacker leverages the ability to control the appearance of icons. They design glyphs that visually resemble legitimate UI elements but represent different characters or trigger unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:** Users can be tricked into performing actions they did not intend, potentially leading to data compromise, unauthorized transactions, or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misleading User Interface](./attack_tree_paths/misleading_user_interface.md)

**Exploit CSS Injection to Manipulate Icon Display -> Misleading User Interface:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious CSS, the attacker alters the appearance of `font-mfizz` icons to misrepresent the application's state or functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Users may misunderstand the application's current status or the consequences of their actions, leading to errors or security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Clickjacking/UI Redressing](./attack_tree_paths/clickjackingui_redressing.md)

**Exploit CSS Injection to Manipulate Icon Display -> Clickjacking/UI Redressing:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uses injected CSS to overlay malicious, invisible elements on top of or in place of legitimate icons.
    *   **Impact:** Users are tricked into clicking on the attacker's elements while believing they are interacting with legitimate icons, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, credential theft, or malware installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Serve Malicious Font Files (Similar to "Exploit Malicious Font File Substitution")](./attack_tree_paths/serve_malicious_font_files__similar_to_exploit_malicious_font_file_substitution_.md)

**Exploit Font File Hosting Vulnerabilities -> Serve Malicious Font Files (Similar to "Exploit Malicious Font File Substitution"):**
    *   **Attack Vector:** By exploiting vulnerabilities in the font file hosting infrastructure, the attacker can serve malicious font files to users instead of the legitimate ones.
    *   **Impact:** This leads to the same consequences as direct malicious font file substitution, including client-side rendering issues and the delivery of misleading or malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect Users to Malicious Sites](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_users_to_malicious_sites.md)

**Exploit Font File Hosting Vulnerabilities -> Redirect Users to Malicious Sites:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** By exploiting vulnerabilities in the font file hosting infrastructure, the attacker can redirect users to malicious websites when their browser attempts to download the `font-mfizz` font files.
    *   **Impact:** Users can be redirected to phishing sites to steal credentials, or to websites that attempt to install malware on their systems.
