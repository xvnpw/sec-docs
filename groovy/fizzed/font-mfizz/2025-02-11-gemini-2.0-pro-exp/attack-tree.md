## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Exploit SVG Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  This is the primary attack surface.  SVG files are parsed as XML, and vulnerabilities in the XML parsing process can lead to RCE.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable external entity resolution completely.
        *   Use a secure and up-to-date XML parser.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
        *   Limit resource consumption (entity expansion, image size, etc.).
        *   Fuzz test the SVG parsing component.

    *   **1.1.1 XXE (XML External Entity) Injection in SVG [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]**

        *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts an SVG file that includes malicious external XML entities.  If the parser resolves these entities, it can lead to:
            *   **1.1.1.1 Read Arbitrary Files:**  The attacker can read files from the server's file system (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files).
            *   **1.1.1.2 Internal Port Scanning:**  The attacker can probe internal ports on the server or other internal systems.
            *   **1.1.1.3 SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):**  The attacker can make the server send requests to internal or external services, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in those services.
            *   **1.1.1.4 Trigger Out-of-Band Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can exfiltrate data through DNS or HTTP requests.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (if external entities are not disabled)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** *Completely disable external entity resolution in the XML parser.* This is the most crucial mitigation.

*   **1.3 Exploit Configuration File Vulnerabilities**
    *   **1.3.1 Command Injection via Configuration [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** If the application allows the configuration file to specify commands or scripts to be executed (e.g., for post-processing), and this input is not properly sanitized, the attacker can inject malicious commands.
        *   **1.3.1.1:** Inject malicious commands to be executed by the server.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if configuration parsing is done securely)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Direct RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Strictly validate and sanitize all input from the configuration file.
            *   *Do not allow the configuration file to specify arbitrary commands or scripts.*
            *   If post-processing is necessary, use a tightly controlled and sandboxed environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Achieve Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__achieve_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.1 Resource Exhaustion via SVG Parsing [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts SVG files designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space), leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit XML entity expansion depth and count.
        *   Limit SVG image dimensions and file size.
        *   Limit the number of glyphs and fonts that can be generated.

    *   **2.1.1 Billion Laughs Attack (XML Entity Expansion) [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:**  The attacker defines XML entities that recursively expand, leading to exponential growth in memory consumption.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Limit XML entity expansion depth and count.

    *   **2.1.2 Quadratic Blowup Attack (Nested Entities)**
        *   **Description:** Similar to Billion Laughs, but uses a different pattern of nested entities to achieve resource exhaustion.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Limit XML entity expansion depth and count.

    *   **2.1.3 Deeply Nested XML Structures**
        *   **Description:** Even without entity expansion, deeply nested XML structures can consume significant resources during parsing.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Limit the depth of nested XML structures.

    *   **2.1.4 Large Image Dimensions/Filesize [CRITICAL]**

        *   **Description:**  The attacker provides an SVG file with extremely large dimensions or a very large file size, causing the server to consume excessive memory or processing time.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict limits on SVG image dimensions and file size.
