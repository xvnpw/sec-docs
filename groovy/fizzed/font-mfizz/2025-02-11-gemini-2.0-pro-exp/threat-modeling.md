# Threat Model Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Threat: [Malicious SVG Injection (Code Execution)](./threats/malicious_svg_injection__code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SVG file containing embedded scripts or exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the SVG parsing library *used by* `font-mfizz` (e.g., a vulnerability in a library like `resvg` or a similar dependency, *if and how* it's used internally by `font-mfizz`). The attacker uploads this file, aiming for code execution on the server *through the processing done by* `font-mfizz`.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the `font-mfizz` processing. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** SVG parsing module/library *within* `font-mfizz` or its *directly used* dependencies (e.g., a hypothetical `parseSVG()` function or an underlying library like `resvg` *if and only if* `font-mfizz` uses it for parsing). The key here is that the exploit happens *during* `font-mfizz`'s processing of the SVG.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict SVG Sanitization:** Use a dedicated, security-focused SVG sanitizer *before* passing the SVG to `font-mfizz`. This sanitizer should remove all script tags, event handlers, external references, and any potentially dangerous elements or attributes. Whitelist allowed elements and attributes rather than blacklisting. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit `font-mfizz` and all its *direct* dependencies (especially the SVG parsing library it uses) for known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` or similar for your package manager.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run the `font-mfizz` processing in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container, a restricted user account with minimal privileges) to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   **Input Validation (Schema):** Validate the SVG input against a strict XML schema that defines the allowed structure and content. Reject any SVG that doesn't conform to the schema.

## Threat: [Malicious SVG Injection (Denial of Service - Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/malicious_svg_injection__denial_of_service_-_resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a very large or complex SVG file (e.g., with deeply nested elements, excessive numbers of paths, or extremely large dimensions) designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) *during processing by* `font-mfizz`.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.
*   **Affected Component:** SVG parsing and font generation modules *within* `font-mfizz` (e.g., functions responsible for parsing the SVG structure and converting it to font data). The attack directly targets `font-mfizz`'s processing capabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Size Limits:** Enforce strict limits on the maximum file size of uploaded SVGs *before* they are processed by `font-mfizz`.
    *   **Complexity Limits:** Implement limits on the complexity of the SVG *before* passing it to `font-mfizz`, such as the maximum number of elements, attributes, nested levels, and path points.
    *   **Resource Limits (OS Level):** Configure operating system-level resource limits (e.g., using `ulimit` on Linux) for the process running `font-mfizz` to prevent it from consuming excessive memory or CPU time.
    *   **Timeouts:** Set a reasonable timeout for the `font-mfizz` processing. If the process exceeds the timeout, terminate it.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** If users can upload SVGs, implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from flooding the server with requests intended for `font-mfizz`.

## Threat: [Malicious SVG Injection (Denial of Service - Algorithm Complexity)](./threats/malicious_svg_injection__denial_of_service_-_algorithm_complexity_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts an SVG file that, while not necessarily large, exploits algorithmic complexities in the SVG parsing or font generation process *within* `font-mfizz` or its *directly used* dependencies. This could involve specific combinations of SVG features that trigger worst-case performance scenarios in the underlying libraries *as they are used by* `font-mfizz`.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). Similar to resource exhaustion, but achieved through clever exploitation of algorithm weaknesses rather than brute force, directly impacting `font-mfizz`'s processing.
*   **Affected Component:** SVG parsing and font generation algorithms *within* `font-mfizz` and its *directly used* dependencies. This is highly dependent on the specific implementation details of `font-mfizz`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing techniques to identify input that triggers unexpectedly long processing times or high resource consumption *within* `font-mfizz`. This involves providing `font-mfizz` with a wide range of randomly generated or mutated SVG inputs.
    *   **Profiling:** Profile the `font-mfizz` code during processing to identify performance bottlenecks and potential algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities *within its own code and how it uses its dependencies*.
    *   **Input Validation (Specific Features):** If specific SVG features are identified as being particularly vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks *when processed by* `font-mfizz`, consider disallowing or strictly limiting their use *before* the SVG reaches `font-mfizz`.
    *   **Timeouts (again):** Timeouts are crucial for mitigating this type of DoS, specifically within the context of `font-mfizz`'s processing.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly Used)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_used_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in one of the libraries that `font-mfizz` *directly* depends on and *actively uses* (e.g., an XML parsing library, a font manipulation library). This vulnerability could be exploited through a crafted SVG file *that is processed by* `font-mfizz`. The key distinction is that the vulnerability is triggered *during* `font-mfizz`'s operation, not through a separate attack vector.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from DoS to RCE, all stemming from `font-mfizz`'s use of the vulnerable dependency.
*   **Affected Component:** Any of `font-mfizz`'s *direct and actively used* dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical) depending on the specific dependency and vulnerability, but we're filtering for High/Critical here.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing (Continuous):** Continuously monitor *direct* dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated vulnerability scanners. Focus on dependencies that are involved in SVG parsing and font generation.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `font-mfizz` and all its *direct* dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   **Dependency Pinning (with Caution):** Consider pinning *direct* dependency versions to specific, known-good releases, but be aware that this can prevent you from receiving security updates. A better approach is to use a lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency resolution, and regularly update the lockfile.
