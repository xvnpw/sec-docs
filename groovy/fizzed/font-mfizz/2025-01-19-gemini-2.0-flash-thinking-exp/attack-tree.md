## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Font File [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_font_file__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Serve a modified or malicious font file to application users.
- This node is critical because successful exploitation can directly lead to browser compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace Font File on Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/replace_font_file_on_server__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Gain control over the font files served by the application's server.
- This node is critical because it allows the attacker to directly inject malicious font files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Vulnerability (e.g., insecure file upload, path traversal) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_vulnerability__e_g___insecure_file_upload__path_traversal___critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Leverage weaknesses in the server's security to directly overwrite font files.
- Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities like insecure file upload functionalities, path traversal flaws, or misconfigured permissions.
- Impact: Serving malicious font files, potentially leading to browser exploitation (RCE or DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Server Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_server_credentials__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Obtain valid server credentials to manipulate files, including font files.
- Attack Vector: Employ techniques like phishing, brute-force attacks, or exploiting other server-side vulnerabilities to gain access credentials.
- Impact: Serving malicious font files, potential browser exploitation, and broader server access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Font File Content [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_font_file_content__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Exploit vulnerabilities within the browser's font rendering engine by crafting malicious font files.
- This node is critical because it directly targets the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Browser Font Parsing Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_browser_font_parsing_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Trigger vulnerabilities in the browser's font parsing logic.
- Attack Vector: Create specially crafted font files that exploit buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues in the browser's font parser.
- Impact:
    - Crafted Font File for Code Execution: Achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine.
    - Crafted Font File for Denial of Service (DoS): Causing the user's browser to crash or become unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CSS Injection Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_css_injection_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Inject malicious CSS code that interacts with font-mfizz classes to achieve malicious objectives.
- This node is critical because it allows manipulation of the user interface and potential data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious CSS referencing font-mfizz classes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_css_referencing_font-mfizz_classes__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Insert arbitrary CSS into the application's stylesheets that specifically targets font-mfizz elements.
- Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities that allow the injection of arbitrary CSS, such as Stored XSS.
- Impact: Enables various malicious activities by manipulating the appearance and behavior of font-mfizz icons.

## Attack Tree Path: [Override Icon Appearance for Phishing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/override_icon_appearance_for_phishing__critical_node_.md)

- Goal: Redefine the appearance of font-mfizz icons to mimic legitimate UI elements for phishing purposes.
- Attack Vector: Inject CSS that alters the styling of font-mfizz icons to resemble login buttons, confirmation prompts, or other interactive elements.
- Impact: Tricking users into interacting with fake elements, potentially leading to the disclosure of credentials or other sensitive information.
