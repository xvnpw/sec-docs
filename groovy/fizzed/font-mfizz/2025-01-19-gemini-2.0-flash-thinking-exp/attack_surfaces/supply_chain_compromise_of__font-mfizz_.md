### 5. Evaluation of Existing Mitigation Strategies

The initially provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but their effectiveness depends on proper implementation and consistent application:

*   **Verify Source and Hashes:** This is a crucial step. However, users need to be aware of the official sources and have access to reliable hash values. The process for verifying hashes should be clear and easy to follow.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** This helps identify known vulnerabilities in `font-mfizz`'s dependencies (if any). The frequency and accuracy of the scanning are important factors.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Implementing SCA provides ongoing monitoring of dependencies. The effectiveness depends on the quality of the SCA tool and the timeliness of alerts.
*   **Pin Dependencies:** Pinning versions prevents automatic updates that might introduce compromised versions. However, it's crucial to regularly review and update pinned dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

**Gaps in Existing Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Lack of Code Signing:**  If `font-mfizz` is not digitally signed, it's harder for users to verify the integrity and authenticity of the downloaded files.
*   **Limited Transparency in Build Process:**  If the build process is opaque, it's difficult for users to assess the risk of compromise.
*   **No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement:**  Enforcing MFA for developers with write access to the repository significantly reduces the risk of account compromise.
*   **Infrequent Security Audits:** Regular security audits of the codebase and infrastructure can help identify potential vulnerabilities.

### 6. Recommendations
