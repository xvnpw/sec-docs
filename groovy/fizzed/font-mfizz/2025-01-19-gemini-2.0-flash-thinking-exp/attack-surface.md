# Attack Surface Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Font Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_font_files.md)

*   **Description:** The risk of using font files that contain malicious code or are crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in font rendering engines.
    *   **How font-mfizz Contributes:** If the application directly includes or relies on font files provided by `font-mfizz` from potentially untrusted sources or if the distribution channel of `font-mfizz` is compromised, malicious font files could be introduced.
    *   **Example:** A compromised `font-mfizz` release on a CDN could contain a specially crafted `.woff` file that, when rendered by a user's browser, triggers a buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, denial of service in the browser, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploitability and impact of the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify Source Integrity: Ensure `font-mfizz` and its font files are obtained from trusted and verified sources (e.g., official GitHub releases, reputable package managers).
        *   Subresource Integrity (SRI): If loading font files from a CDN, use SRI hashes to ensure the integrity of the downloaded files.
        *   Regular Updates: Keep the `font-mfizz` library up-to-date to benefit from any security fixes related to the included font files.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which font files can be loaded (`font-src` directive).

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Compromise of `font-mfizz`](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_compromise_of__font-mfizz_.md)

*   **Description:** The risk that the `font-mfizz` library itself is compromised at its source or during distribution, leading to the inclusion of malicious code.
    *   **How font-mfizz Contributes:**  If the official repository, package manager listing, or CDN serving `font-mfizz` is compromised, malicious code could be injected into the library, affecting all applications using it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `font-mfizz` GitHub repository and injects malicious JavaScript into the build process, which is then distributed to users.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially Critical, as the malicious code could have broad access and impact on applications using the compromised library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Verify Source and Hashes:  When including `font-mfizz`, verify the source and use checksums or hashes to ensure the integrity of the downloaded files.
        *   Dependency Scanning: Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `font-mfizz` and its dependencies.
        *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Implement SCA practices to monitor the dependencies of the application and receive alerts about potential security risks.
        *   Pin Dependencies:  Pin the specific version of `font-mfizz` used in the application to avoid automatically pulling in compromised versions.
