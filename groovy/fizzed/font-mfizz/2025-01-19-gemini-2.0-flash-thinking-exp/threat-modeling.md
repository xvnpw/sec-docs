# Threat Model Analysis for fizzed/font-mfizz

## Threat: [Malicious Font Files (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/malicious_font_files__supply_chain_attack_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker compromises the `font-mfizz` repository or its distribution channels (e.g., CDN) to inject malicious font files. When a user's browser attempts to render these malicious fonts, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's machine by exploiting vulnerabilities in the browser's font rendering engine.
- **Impact:**  Client-side Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities on the user's computer.
- **Affected Component:** Font files themselves (e.g., `.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`) distributed by `font-mfizz`.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Verify the integrity of downloaded font files using checksums or signatures provided by the `font-mfizz` project (if available).
    - Pin specific, known-good versions of the `font-mfizz` library in your project's dependency management.
    - Monitor the `font-mfizz` project for any security advisories or reports of compromise.
    - Consider using a reputable Content Delivery Network (CDN) with strong security measures for serving font files, and implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for these files.
