# Attack Surface Analysis for stjohnjohnson/smartthings-mqtt-bridge

## Attack Surface: [1. MQTT Connection Interception (TLS/SSL Configuration within the Bridge)](./attack_surfaces/1__mqtt_connection_interception__tlsssl_configuration_within_the_bridge_.md)

*Description:* Attackers intercept the communication between the bridge and the MQTT broker due to misconfiguration *within the bridge itself*.
*   *Contribution:* The bridge is *directly responsible* for establishing a secure (or insecure) connection based on its configuration.
*   *Example:* The `mqtt_port` is set to 1883 (non-TLS) and TLS-related settings (`mqtt_tls_ca_certs`, etc.) are left blank in the bridge's `config.yml`.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Eavesdropping on all SmartThings events and commands.
    *   Ability to inject malicious commands by modifying intercepted traffic.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **(Developer/User):**  *Always* use TLS/SSL.  Configure `mqtt_port` to a TLS-enabled port (e.g., 8883) in the bridge's configuration.
    *   **(Developer/User):**  Properly configure `mqtt_tls_ca_certs`, `mqtt_tls_certfile`, and `mqtt_tls_keyfile` in the bridge's configuration.
    *   **(Developer):**  Make TLS/SSL the *default* configuration and provide clear, prominent instructions.  Issue a warning if the bridge starts up with an insecure configuration.

## Attack Surface: [2. SmartThings API Token Leakage (Bridge Configuration/Storage)](./attack_surfaces/2__smartthings_api_token_leakage__bridge_configurationstorage_.md)

*Description:* The `smartthings_token` used by the bridge is compromised due to insecure handling *by the bridge or its configuration*.
*   *Contribution:* The bridge *stores and uses* this token; its security is the bridge's responsibility.
*   *Example:* The `config.yml` file containing the token has overly permissive file permissions, allowing other users on the system to read it.
*   *Impact:*
    *   An attacker can directly interact with the SmartThings API, bypassing the bridge.
    *   Full control over SmartThings devices.
*   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **(Developer/User):**  Store the `smartthings_token` securely in the configuration file.  Ensure the file has restricted permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 config.yml`).
    *   **(Developer):**  Consider using environment variables instead of a configuration file for the token.
    *   **(Developer):**  Explore more robust secret management solutions for production deployments.

## Attack Surface: [3. MQTT Message Injection (Lack of Validation *within the Bridge*)](./attack_surfaces/3__mqtt_message_injection__lack_of_validation_within_the_bridge_.md)

*Description:* Attackers inject malicious MQTT messages that are not properly validated *by the bridge's code*.
*   *Contribution:* The bridge is *directly responsible* for parsing and validating all incoming MQTT messages before acting on them.
*   *Example:* An attacker sends a crafted MQTT message with a command payload designed to trigger a buffer overflow in the bridge's message handling code.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Potential for remote code execution on the system running the bridge.
    *   Denial-of-service.
    *   Manipulation of SmartThings devices through crafted commands.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **(Developer):**  Implement *strict* input validation for *all* incoming MQTT messages.  Sanitize and validate data before passing it to SmartThings or acting upon it.
    *   **(Developer):**  Define a clear schema for expected MQTT message formats and reject any messages that do not conform.
    *   **(Developer):**  Implement rate limiting on incoming messages to mitigate flooding attacks.

## Attack Surface: [4. Overly Permissive SmartApp Capabilities (Defined by the Bridge's SmartApp)](./attack_surfaces/4__overly_permissive_smartapp_capabilities__defined_by_the_bridge's_smartapp_.md)

*Description:* The SmartApp associated with the bridge requests more permissions than it needs, increasing the impact of a bridge compromise.
*   *Contribution:* The bridge's functionality and potential attack surface are *directly defined* by the capabilities requested by its associated SmartApp.
*   *Example:* The SmartApp requests `capability.switchLevel.*` (control of dimming) when it only needs `capability.switch.*` (on/off control).
*   *Impact:* If the bridge is compromised, the attacker gains access to *all* capabilities granted to the SmartApp, not just those strictly necessary.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High**
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **(Developer):**  Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege.  The SmartApp should *only* request the absolute minimum capabilities required for the bridge to function.
    *   **(Developer):**  Clearly document the required capabilities and *why* they are needed.

## Attack Surface: [5. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly Affecting the Bridge)](./attack_surfaces/5__dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_affecting_the_bridge_.md)

*Description:* The bridge uses external libraries that have known vulnerabilities.
*   *Contribution:* The bridge's code *directly depends* on these libraries; their vulnerabilities become the bridge's vulnerabilities.
*   *Example:* An outdated version of the Paho MQTT client library is used, which has a known remote code execution vulnerability.
*   *Impact:* Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the dependencies to compromise the bridge itself.
*   *Risk Severity:* **High** (severity depends on the specific vulnerability)
*   *Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **(Developer):**  Regularly update *all* dependencies to their latest secure versions.
    *   **(Developer):**  Use a dependency management tool and integrate vulnerability scanning into the development process.
