# Threat Model Analysis for stjohnjohnson/smartthings-mqtt-bridge

## Threat: [Unauthorized MQTT Broker Access (via Bridge Credentials)](./threats/unauthorized_mqtt_broker_access__via_bridge_credentials_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the MQTT broker by exploiting weak, default, or compromised credentials *used by the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` itself*. The attacker could then send forged commands or eavesdrop on legitimate traffic *through the bridge*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over MQTT communication *relayed by the bridge*; ability to control SmartThings devices, steal data, and disrupt service.
    *   **Affected Component:** MQTT connection module (likely within the main bridge application file where MQTT client initialization occurs and credentials are used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce strong password requirements in documentation and example configurations.  Encourage (or even require) the use of TLS client certificates for authentication to the MQTT broker. Avoid hardcoding credentials; use environment variables.
        *   **Users:** Use a strong, unique password for the MQTT broker user account *specifically used by the bridge*. Configure the MQTT broker to require TLS client certificate authentication, and provide the bridge with the necessary certificate and key.

## Threat: [SmartThings Account Takeover (via Token Leak from Bridge)](./threats/smartthings_account_takeover__via_token_leak_from_bridge_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the SmartThings access token *stored or used by the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge`*, either through a compromised server where the bridge is running, exposed configuration files, or insecure logging *by the bridge*.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the user's SmartThings account and all connected devices.
    *   **Affected Component:** SmartThings API interaction module (where the token is used, stored, and potentially refreshed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure storage for the SmartThings token (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management system *integrated with the bridge*).  *Never* log the token. Implement proper OAuth token refresh mechanisms and handle refresh failures securely.
        *   **Users:** Protect the server running the bridge.  Use strong passwords for the server and any associated accounts. Regularly review SmartThings connected services and revoke access if necessary. Ensure the bridge's configuration files are not publicly accessible.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Bridge-MQTT Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_bridge-mqtt_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication *between the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` and the MQTT broker* because TLS/SSL is not used or is improperly configured *within the bridge's connection settings*. The attacker can eavesdrop on messages and potentially modify them.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of device status and commands *relayed by the bridge*; ability to inject malicious commands *into the bridge's communication*.
    *   **Affected Component:** MQTT connection module (specifically, the TLS/SSL configuration and connection establishment code within the bridge).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Enforce TLS/SSL by default in the bridge configuration. Provide clear instructions for configuring TLS/SSL with trusted certificates, including how to handle certificate verification. Consider making TLS/SSL mandatory.
        *   **Users:** Enable TLS/SSL encryption for the MQTT connection *within the bridge's configuration*. Use a trusted certificate authority for the MQTT broker's certificate. Verify the broker's certificate *as configured in the bridge*.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Dependencies *within the Bridge*](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_dependencies_within_the_bridge.md)

*   **Description:** The `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` itself uses a third-party Node.js package with a known security vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability *directly against the running bridge process*.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution *on the bridge*; potential for complete system compromise *of the host running the bridge*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` code that relies on the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions. Use tools like `npm audit` or `snyk` to identify and remediate vulnerabilities *in the bridge's dependencies*. Consider using dependency pinning with checksum verification.
        *   **Users:** Keep the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` software and its dependencies up-to-date. Regularly check for updates and security advisories *specifically for the bridge*.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Unsanitized Input *Processed by the Bridge*](./threats/code_injection_via_unsanitized_input_processed_by_the_bridge.md)

*   **Description:** The `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` does not properly sanitize data received from SmartThings or MQTT messages before using it in code execution (e.g., constructing commands or generating responses *within the bridge's logic*).
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution *on the bridge itself*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Input handling and processing logic *within the bridge* (specifically, areas where data from SmartThings or MQTT is used without proper validation and escaping).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* data received from SmartThings and MQTT *within the bridge's code*. Use parameterized queries or escaping functions where appropriate. Follow secure coding practices to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** There is limited mitigation available to users beyond keeping the bridge software updated, as this is primarily a code-level issue.

## Threat: [Unmaintained Project Risks *Affecting the Bridge*](./threats/unmaintained_project_risks_affecting_the_bridge.md)

* **Description:** The `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` project is no longer actively maintained, leading to unpatched vulnerabilities and potential incompatibility with newer versions of SmartThings or MQTT brokers. *This directly impacts the security of the bridge itself*.
    * **Impact:** Increased risk of exploitation due to unpatched vulnerabilities *in the bridge code*; potential for system instability or failure *of the bridge*.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (if unmaintained)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** (If maintaining a fork) Commit to regular security updates and maintenance of the forked project.
        * **Users:** Regularly check for updates and security advisories *for the bridge*. Consider forking the project and maintaining it internally if the original project becomes abandoned. Evaluate alternative, actively maintained solutions if the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` project is no longer viable.
