# Threat Model Analysis for stjohnjohnson/smartthings-mqtt-bridge

## Threat: [MQTT Client Spoofing](./threats/mqtt_client_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could send MQTT messages to the broker pretending to be a legitimate client that the bridge is configured to listen to. This could involve using the same topic and message format expected by the bridge.
*   **Impact:** The bridge might relay these forged commands to the SmartThings Hub, leading to unauthorized control of SmartThings devices. An attacker could turn devices on/off, change settings, or trigger other actions.
*   **Affected Component:** `mqtt_client` module, specifically the functions handling incoming MQTT messages and relaying them to the SmartThings API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize authentication mechanisms provided by the MQTT broker (username/password, TLS client certificates).
    *   Implement topic-based access control on the MQTT broker to restrict which clients can publish to specific topics.
    *   Consider adding a layer of validation within the bridge to verify the source or content of MQTT messages before relaying them.

## Threat: [SmartThings API Communication Tampering](./threats/smartthings_api_communication_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between the bridge and the SmartThings API (if not using HTTPS) and modify the data being exchanged. This could involve altering device states being reported or changing commands being sent to the hub.
*   **Impact:**  Incorrect device states could be reflected in the MQTT broker, leading to confusion or incorrect automation logic. Tampered commands could cause unintended actions on SmartThings devices.
*   **Affected Component:** `smartthings_api` module, specifically the functions responsible for sending and receiving data to/from the SmartThings API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory use of HTTPS for all communication with the SmartThings API.** This provides encryption and integrity checks.
    *   Implement checks to detect unexpected changes in the structure or content of API responses.

    *   Consider using secure logging mechanisms that encrypt log data.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through MQTT Broker](./threats/information_disclosure_through_mqtt_broker.md)

*   **Description:** The bridge might publish sensitive SmartThings device data to MQTT topics without proper access controls or encryption. Anyone with access to the MQTT broker could subscribe to these topics and view this data.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of device status, sensor readings, or other sensitive information could compromise user privacy and security.
*   **Affected Component:** `mqtt_client` module, specifically the functions responsible for publishing MQTT messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Publish data to MQTT topics that require authentication and authorization to subscribe.
    *   Avoid publishing highly sensitive information directly.
    *   Consider encrypting sensitive data before publishing it to MQTT.

## Threat: [MQTT Injection Leading to Privilege Escalation](./threats/mqtt_injection_leading_to_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** If the bridge doesn't properly sanitize or validate MQTT messages received, an attacker could craft malicious MQTT messages that, when relayed to the SmartThings API, cause unintended actions or expose vulnerabilities in the SmartThings ecosystem.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could gain unauthorized control over SmartThings devices or potentially even the SmartThings hub itself, depending on the nature of the vulnerability and the attacker's payload.
*   **Affected Component:** `mqtt_client` module, specifically the functions responsible for processing MQTT messages and constructing SmartThings API requests.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all input received from MQTT before relaying it to the SmartThings API.**
    *   Implement a whitelist approach for allowed MQTT commands and data formats.
    *   Avoid directly passing MQTT message content to SmartThings API calls without careful processing.

## Threat: [Exposure of SmartThings API Keys in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_smartthings_api_keys_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The SmartThings API keys required for the bridge to function might be stored insecurely in configuration files (e.g., plain text). An attacker gaining access to the system running the bridge could easily retrieve these keys.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the associated SmartThings account, allowing the attacker to control all connected devices and access personal information.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and storage mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Store SmartThings API keys securely using encryption or a dedicated secrets management solution.**
    *   Avoid storing keys directly in configuration files.
    *   Consider using environment variables or a more secure configuration mechanism.
