# Threat Model Analysis for stjohnjohnson/smartthings-mqtt-bridge

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of SmartThings API Key](./threats/insecure_storage_of_smartthings_api_key.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the system hosting the bridge and retrieves the SmartThings Personal Access Token (PAT) stored in a plain text configuration file or environment variable. They then use this key to directly interact with the SmartThings API *through the compromised bridge's credentials*.

**Impact:** The attacker can control all devices connected to the SmartThings account associated with the stolen API key (e.g., turn on/off lights, unlock doors, arm/disarm security systems), access sensor data, and potentially disrupt the entire SmartThings ecosystem.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading module, potentially environment variable handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt the SmartThings API key at rest.
*   Utilize secure credential management systems provided by the operating system or a dedicated secrets manager.
*   Restrict file system permissions on configuration files to only the necessary user.
*   Avoid storing the API key directly in environment variables if possible, or ensure proper access controls are in place.

## Threat: [Exposure of MQTT Broker Credentials](./threats/exposure_of_mqtt_broker_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the system hosting the bridge and retrieves the MQTT broker's username and password stored in a plain text configuration file or environment variable. They then use these credentials to connect to the MQTT broker *potentially impersonating the bridge*.

**Impact:** The attacker can publish malicious messages to any topic on the MQTT broker, subscribe to sensitive topics, and potentially disrupt other applications relying on the broker. They could also impersonate the bridge or other devices.

**Affected Component:** Configuration loading module, potentially environment variable handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt the MQTT broker credentials at rest.
*   Utilize secure credential management systems.
*   Restrict file system permissions on configuration files.
*   Enforce strong authentication and authorization on the MQTT broker itself.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on SmartThings API Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_smartthings_api_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the bridge and the SmartThings API. If the communication *from the bridge* is not properly secured with TLS/SSL and certificate validation, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication or even modify requests and responses.

**Impact:** The attacker could potentially steal the SmartThings API key during initial setup, manipulate device states, or inject malicious commands into the SmartThings ecosystem *by intercepting and altering the bridge's communication*.

**Affected Component:** SmartThings API communication module (using HTTP/HTTPS).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the bridge always uses HTTPS for communication with the SmartThings API.
*   Verify the SmartThings API server certificate to prevent MITM attacks.
*   The bridge code should enforce TLS and proper certificate validation.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on MQTT Broker Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_mqtt_broker_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the bridge and the MQTT broker. If the communication *from the bridge* is not secured with TLS/SSL, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication or modify messages being sent and received.

**Impact:** The attacker could intercept sensitive device data being published to the MQTT broker *by the bridge*, manipulate device states by sending forged MQTT messages *that the bridge might process*, or disrupt communication between the bridge and the broker.

**Affected Component:** MQTT client module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure the bridge to use TLS/SSL for communication with the MQTT broker.
*   Verify the MQTT broker's certificate if using TLS with certificate pinning.
*   Educate users on the importance of using TLS for their MQTT broker.

## Threat: [MQTT Topic Hijacking/Spoofing by Malicious Publishers](./threats/mqtt_topic_hijackingspoofing_by_malicious_publishers.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the MQTT broker and publishes messages to topics that the bridge subscribes to, mimicking legitimate device updates or commands. The bridge then processes these messages *as if they came from SmartThings*.

**Impact:** The attacker can trigger unintended actions in SmartThings devices controlled by the bridge, based on the forged MQTT messages. This could range from simply turning on lights to more serious actions like unlocking doors.

**Affected Component:** MQTT message processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization on the MQTT broker to restrict who can publish to specific topics.
*   Consider using MQTT features like retained messages with caution.
*   The bridge could implement some level of validation on incoming MQTT messages, although this can be complex.

## Threat: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities](./threats/code_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the bridge's code has vulnerabilities (e.g., improper input sanitization when processing data from SmartThings or MQTT), an attacker could inject malicious code that could be executed on the server hosting the bridge.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server hosting the bridge, potentially leading to the theft of credentials, further attacks on the SmartThings ecosystem or the MQTT broker, or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Various modules depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., data processing, event handling).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received from external sources (SmartThings API, MQTT broker).
*   Follow secure coding practices to prevent common injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
*   Regularly update dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The bridge relies on external libraries and dependencies. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, the bridge itself could be susceptible to exploitation.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from denial of service to remote code execution *affecting the bridge*.

**Affected Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories for the used libraries.
