**1.2.2.1 Credentials stored in plaintext configuration files [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    * Attack Vector: Insecure Storage of Credentials
    * Description: SmartThings API keys, MQTT broker credentials, or other sensitive information are stored in plaintext within configuration files accessible to the system running the bridge.
    * Likelihood: Medium to High
    * Impact: High (Direct access to SmartThings account and/or MQTT broker, leading to device control and data access)
    * Effort: Low (Requires access to the file system where configuration files are stored, which might be achievable through various means depending on deployment)
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low (If attacker gains file system access, hard to detect credential theft itself, but access to the system might be logged)
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Never store credentials in plaintext configuration files.
        * Utilize environment variables for sensitive configuration.
        * Employ secure secret management solutions or encrypted configuration files.
        * Restrict file system access to configuration files.
