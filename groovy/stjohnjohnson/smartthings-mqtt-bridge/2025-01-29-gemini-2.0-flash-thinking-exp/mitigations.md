# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for stjohnjohnson/smartthings-mqtt-bridge

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment Variables for API Key](./mitigation_strategies/environment_variables_for_api_key.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Environment Variables for API Key
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify API Key Configuration:** Locate the configuration file for `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` (typically `config.json`) and find where the SmartThings API key is currently stored.
    2.  **Remove API Key from Configuration File:** Delete the API key value from the configuration file, leaving the configuration key present but empty or with a placeholder.
    3.  **Set Environment Variable:** On the system running `smartthings-mqtt-bridge`, set an environment variable named `SMARTTHINGS_API_KEY` (or a similar descriptive name). The value of this environment variable should be your actual SmartThings API key. The method for setting environment variables depends on your operating system.
    4.  **Modify Application Code (if necessary):**  If `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` doesn't natively support environment variables, you might need to modify the application code to read the API key from environment variables. Check the application's documentation or code for configuration methods.
    5.  **Configure `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` to use Environment Variable:** Update the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` configuration to instruct it to retrieve the API key from the environment variable instead of the configuration file.
    6.  **Verify Functionality:** Restart `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` and ensure it functions correctly, retrieving the API key from the environment variable.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of API Key in Configuration Files (High Severity):** Accidental exposure of the SmartThings API key in plain text within `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` configuration files. This could occur through version control, backups, or unauthorized access to the system.  Compromise of the API key grants full control over your SmartThings devices via the SmartThings API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of API Key in Configuration Files:**  Significantly reduces the risk of API key exposure by removing it from easily accessible configuration files.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. Default configuration often uses configuration files for API key storage.
*   **Missing Implementation:** In the default configuration and potentially in the application's code if environment variable support is not fully implemented or documented. Project documentation should strongly recommend this approach.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict API Key Permissions (SmartThings Developer Workspace)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_api_key_permissions__smartthings_developer_workspace_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict API Key Permissions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access SmartThings Developer Workspace:** Log in to your SmartThings Developer Workspace.
    2.  **Locate API Key:** Navigate to API key management and find the API key used by `smartthings-mqtt-bridge`.
    3.  **Review Current Permissions:** Examine the permissions granted to this API key, noting devices and capabilities authorized.
    4.  **Apply Principle of Least Privilege:** Determine the *minimum* permissions `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` needs to function. This should only include devices and capabilities actually used by the bridge for MQTT integration.
    5.  **Restrict Permissions:** Revoke any unnecessary permissions. Select specific devices and capabilities instead of granting broad "all devices" or "all capabilities" access.
    6.  **Save Changes:** Save the updated API key permissions in the SmartThings Developer Workspace.
    7.  **Test Functionality:** Verify `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` still functions correctly after permission reduction. If broken, incrementally add back permissions until functional, ensuring only minimum necessary permissions are granted.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-Permissive API Key Exploitation (Medium to High Severity):** If the API key used by `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` is compromised, an overly permissive key allows an attacker to control *all* SmartThings devices and capabilities, even those not used by the bridge. This expands the potential impact of a compromised bridge or API key.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-Permissive API Key Exploitation:** Reduces the impact of a compromised API key used by `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` by limiting the scope of control an attacker gains.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. This is a manual configuration step in the SmartThings Developer Workspace, external to the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` project itself, but directly impacting its security.
*   **Missing Implementation:** In default user setup and documentation for `smartthings-mqtt-bridge`. Documentation should strongly advise users to restrict API key permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration File Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_file_permissions.md)

    2.  **Determine User Account:** Identify the user account under which `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` is running.
    3.  **Restrict Read Permissions:** Use operating system commands to restrict read access to the configuration file, ensuring only the user account running `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` can read it.
        *   **Linux/macOS:** Use `chmod 600 config.json`.
        *   **Windows:** Use file properties or `icacls`.
    4.  **Verify Permissions:** Check file permissions to confirm they are correctly set.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` Configuration Data (Medium Severity):** If configuration files are readable by unauthorized users on the system, sensitive settings or information (potentially including MQTT credentials if stored there, though discouraged) related to `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` could be exposed. This could aid in further attacks against the bridge or the smart home system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` Configuration Data:** Reduces the risk of unauthorized users reading sensitive configuration information of the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` application from the system.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No. This is a system-level configuration users must manually implement on the system running `smartthings-mqtt-bridge`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** In default setup and documentation for `smartthings-mqtt-bridge`. Documentation should advise users to set secure file permissions on configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use TLS/SSL Encryption for MQTT Communication (Bridge Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/use_tlsssl_encryption_for_mqtt_communication__bridge_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Use TLS/SSL Encryption for MQTT Communication (Bridge Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure MQTT Broker for TLS:** Ensure your MQTT broker is configured to support and enforce TLS/SSL encryption. This is a prerequisite for configuring the bridge to use TLS.
    2.  **Configure `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` for TLS:** Update the `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` configuration to connect to the MQTT broker using TLS/SSL. This typically involves:
        *   Changing the MQTT protocol in the bridge's configuration from `mqtt://` to `mqtts://`.
        *   Potentially providing paths to CA certificates in the bridge's configuration if the MQTT broker uses self-signed certificates or a private CA.
    3.  **Verify Encrypted Connection:** After configuring both the broker and the bridge, restart `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` and verify that it establishes an encrypted TLS/SSL connection to the MQTT broker. Check bridge and broker logs for confirmation of TLS connection.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping on MQTT Traffic involving `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` (High Severity):** Without encryption, MQTT communication between `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` and the MQTT broker is in plain text. This allows eavesdropping on sensitive smart home data and control commands transmitted by the bridge.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` MQTT Communication (High Severity):** Without encryption and certificate verification, attackers could intercept and manipulate MQTT traffic between `smartthings-mqtt-bridge` and the broker, potentially injecting malicious commands or stealing data related to the bridge's operation.
*   **Impact:**
