* **Attack Surface: Layout Template Injection via Dynamic Resolution**
    * **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the layout template path if it's dynamically determined based on user input or external data without proper sanitization. This allows them to include arbitrary templates.
    * **How Thymeleaf-Layout-Dialect Contributes:** The `th:layout` attribute allows specifying the layout template. If the value of this attribute is derived from unsanitized input, the dialect directly facilitates the inclusion of attacker-controlled templates.
    * **Example:**
        ```html
        <div th:fragment="content" th:layout="@{${userProvidedLayout}}">
            <!-- Content -->
        </div>
        ```
        If `userProvidedLayout` is `../../../../evil`, it could include a malicious template.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the injected template contains malicious code, information disclosure by including templates with sensitive data, or defacement.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Dynamic Layout Resolution:** If possible, use a fixed set of predefined layout names.
        * **Strict Input Validation:** If dynamic resolution is necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize any input used to determine the layout path. Use allow-lists of permitted layout names.
        * **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize the input to remove path traversal characters (e.g., `..`, `/`).

* **Attack Surface: Fragment Injection via Dynamic Fragment Selectors**
    * **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the fragment selector used within `layout:fragment`, `layout:replace`, or `layout:insert` if it's dynamically determined based on unsanitized input. This allows them to include unintended fragments.
    * **How Thymeleaf-Layout-Dialect Contributes:** The `layout:fragment`, `layout:replace`, and `layout:insert` attributes allow specifying the fragment to be included. If the selector is based on unsanitized input, the dialect enables the inclusion of arbitrary fragments.
    * **Example:**
        ```html
        <div layout:replace="~{layout :: ${userProvidedFragment}}">
            <!-- Content -->
        </div>
        ```
        If `userProvidedFragment` is `admin/sensitiveData`, it could expose sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure by including fragments containing sensitive data, potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the included fragment contains unsanitized user input, or unexpected application behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Dynamic Fragment Selectors:** If possible, use a fixed set of predefined fragment selectors.
        * **Strict Input Validation:** If dynamic selection is necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize any input used to determine the fragment selector. Use allow-lists of permitted fragment names.
        * **Namespace Control:** Ensure proper namespacing and access control for fragments to limit the impact of unintended inclusion.
