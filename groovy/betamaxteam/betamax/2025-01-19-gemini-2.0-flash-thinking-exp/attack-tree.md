## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Manipulate Betamax Recordings [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__manipulate_betamax_recordings__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to alter the recorded interactions used by the application. This allows them to inject malicious content or modify existing interactions to their advantage.
* **Significance:** Successful manipulation of recordings can lead to a wide range of compromises, from client-side attacks (like XSS) to server-side vulnerabilities exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] Directly Modify Recording Files [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node__directly_modify_recording_files__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain direct access to the files where Betamax stores its recordings (typically YAML files) and modify their content.
* **Significance:** This provides a direct way to inject malicious responses or alter request data, bypassing the intended behavior of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] Gain Unauthorized Access to Recording Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node__gain_unauthorized_access_to_recording_storage__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to the file system or cloud storage where Betamax recordings are stored.
* **Significance:** This is a foundational step for many high-risk attacks. Once access is gained, attackers can modify, delete, or steal recordings.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Inject Malicious Content into Recordings [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__inject_malicious_content_into_recordings__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** After gaining access to recording files, attackers modify the content to include malicious payloads within HTTP responses.
* **Significance:** This allows attackers to inject scripts for XSS, redirect users to malicious sites, or craft responses that exploit application logic flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Inject Malicious HTTP Responses [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__inject_malicious_http_responses__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers specifically target the HTTP response sections within the recording files to inject malicious content.
* **Significance:** This is a direct way to influence the application's behavior when it replays these responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Inject Scripts (e.g., JavaScript) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__inject_scripts__e_g___javascript___high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the response bodies of recorded interactions.
* **Significance:** This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser, steal cookies, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Inject Data Exploiting Application Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__inject_data_exploiting_application_logic__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific response data that, when processed by the application, triggers vulnerabilities or unintended behavior in the application's logic.
* **Significance:** This can lead to various server-side vulnerabilities like command injection, data manipulation, or privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Compromise Recording Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/8__compromise_recording_storage__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers successfully breach the security of the storage mechanism used for Betamax recordings.
* **Significance:** This provides a central point of compromise, allowing for manipulation, deletion, or theft of sensitive information contained within the recordings.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Gain Unauthorized Access to Recording Files [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/9__gain_unauthorized_access_to_recording_files__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Similar to the earlier "Gain Unauthorized Access to Recording Storage," this emphasizes the direct access to the recording files as a critical step.
* **Significance:** This access is a prerequisite for many other high-risk attacks involving modification or theft of recordings.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Information Disclosure via Recording Files [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/10__information_disclosure_via_recording_files__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to the recording files and extract sensitive information contained within the recorded requests and responses, without necessarily modifying them.
* **Significance:** Even without active manipulation, recordings can contain sensitive data like API keys, credentials, or PII, leading to significant security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Extract Sensitive Data from Recorded Requests/Responses [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/11__extract_sensitive_data_from_recorded_requestsresponses__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers specifically target the request and response data within the recording files to extract sensitive information.
* **Significance:** This highlights the risk of sensitive data being inadvertently stored within Betamax recordings.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. API Keys [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/12__api_keys__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers extract API keys that were recorded during interactions with external services.
* **Significance:** Compromised API keys can allow attackers to access and control external services on behalf of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/13__credentials__high_risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers extract usernames, passwords, or authentication tokens that were recorded during interactions.
* **Significance:** Compromised credentials can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access to the application or other systems.
