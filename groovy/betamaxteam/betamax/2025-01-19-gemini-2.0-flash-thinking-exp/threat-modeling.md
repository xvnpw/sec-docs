# Threat Model Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Threat: [Accidental Recording of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_recording_of_sensitive_data.md)

* **Threat:** Accidental Recording of Sensitive Data
    * **Description:** Betamax's recording mechanism might inadvertently capture sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII) within HTTP requests or responses during test execution. This occurs due to the library's core function of intercepting and storing HTTP interactions.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data leading to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Recording mechanism, specifically the request and response interception and storage functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure Betamax to ignore specific headers, query parameters, and request/response bodies containing sensitive data using `ignore_headers`, `ignore_params`, and custom matchers/filters provided by Betamax.
        * Implement data masking or redaction techniques within the application or leverage Betamax's configuration options before recording.
        * Regularly review recorded cassettes for sensitive information and remove or sanitize them.

## Threat: [Malicious Response Injection via Replay](./threats/malicious_response_injection_via_replay.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Response Injection via Replay
    * **Description:** If a compromised or maliciously crafted Betamax cassette is used during replay, the library will inject the recorded responses into the application's workflow. An attacker could manipulate cassette contents to introduce unexpected or harmful responses.
    * **Impact:** Application behaving unexpectedly, potential for exploitation of vulnerabilities if the application trusts the replayed responses without proper validation, leading to data corruption, unauthorized actions, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Replay mechanism, specifically the functionality that retrieves and provides recorded responses from cassettes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the integrity of cassettes before replay, potentially by implementing checksum verification or digital signatures outside of Betamax.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the application, even when dealing with responses replayed by Betamax.
        * Carefully manage the source and integrity of Betamax cassettes used in testing and development environments.

## Threat: [Tampering with Cassettes](./threats/tampering_with_cassettes.md)

* **Threat:** Tampering with Cassettes
    * **Description:** If an attacker gains access to the storage location of Betamax cassettes, they could directly modify the recorded HTTP interactions within the cassette files. Betamax, by design, reads and replays the content of these files.
    * **Impact:** Introduction of false positives or negatives in tests, masking of real application behavior, or the injection of malicious responses that could be replayed during testing or development, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior or exploitation.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Cassette loading and parsing mechanism within Betamax.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement integrity checks for cassettes (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) to detect tampering before Betamax loads them.
        * Use version control for cassettes to track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
        * Restrict write access to the cassette storage location to authorized personnel or systems.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Large Cassettes](./threats/denial_of_service_through_large_cassettes.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service through Large Cassettes
    * **Description:** An attacker could create or modify cassettes to be excessively large, containing a huge number of interactions or very large response bodies. When Betamax attempts to replay these large cassettes, it could consume excessive resources (memory, disk space, CPU) on the system running the tests or the application under development.
    * **Impact:** Application instability, performance degradation, or complete failure during testing or development due to resource exhaustion caused by Betamax's cassette processing.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Replay mechanism, specifically the loading and processing of cassette data by Betamax.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium (While impactful, the direct involvement of Betamax is in processing, not initiating the attack. However, the impact on systems using Betamax justifies inclusion at this level).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on cassette size or the number of interactions within a cassette, potentially through custom logic or by monitoring cassette sizes.
        * Monitor resource usage during test execution and identify unusually large cassettes.
        * Optimize recording strategies to avoid capturing unnecessary data and large responses.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** Betamax relies on other libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, and Betamax uses the vulnerable parts, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities through Betamax.
    * **Impact:** Potential for various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, which could be triggered through Betamax's functionality.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** The Betamax library itself and its dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Betamax and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
        * Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis tools.
        * Monitor security advisories for Betamax and its dependencies.
