# Attack Surface Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Attack Surface: [Plaintext Storage of Sensitive Data in Cassettes](./attack_surfaces/plaintext_storage_of_sensitive_data_in_cassettes.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, PII) present in recorded HTTP requests or responses is stored in plaintext within cassette files.

**How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax's core function is to record and replay HTTP interactions, including the full request and response bodies and headers, which may contain sensitive data.

**Example:** A cassette records an API call that includes an authorization token in the header. This token is stored verbatim in the cassette file.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to systems or data. Potential violation of data privacy regulations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust data scrubbing techniques using Betamax's built-in features or custom filters to remove sensitive information before recording.
*   Avoid recording interactions that inherently involve sensitive data if possible.
*   Store cassette files in secure locations with restricted access.
*   Consider encrypting cassette files at rest using appropriate encryption algorithms.

## Attack Surface: [World-Readable Cassette Files](./attack_surfaces/world-readable_cassette_files.md)

**Description:** Cassette files are stored with file system permissions that allow unauthorized users or processes to read their contents.

**How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax creates files on the file system. If the default permissions are too permissive or developers don't configure them correctly, this vulnerability arises.

**Example:** Cassette files are stored in a directory with world-readable permissions (`chmod 777`). Any user on the system can access and read the contents.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within the cassettes to unauthorized individuals or processes on the system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure cassette file directories and files have appropriate restrictive permissions (e.g., only readable by the application's user).
*   Implement secure file creation practices within the application when using Betamax.
*   Regularly review file system permissions for cassette storage locations.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Cassette Files Leading to Incorrect Application Behavior](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_cassette_files_leading_to_incorrect_application_behavior.md)

**Description:** Attackers with write access to cassette files can modify the recorded interactions, causing the application to behave unexpectedly or insecurely during replay.

**How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax relies on the integrity of the cassette files for accurate replay. If these files are tampered with, the replay mechanism will use the modified data.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a cassette to change a "success" response to a "failure" response, potentially bypassing security checks in the application logic during testing.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, incorrect application logic execution, potential data corruption or manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict write access to cassette file directories to only authorized users or processes.
*   Implement integrity checks on cassette files before replay (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures), although this is not a built-in Betamax feature and would require custom implementation.
*   Store cassette files in a read-only manner after recording is complete in non-development environments.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Maliciously Crafted Cassette Responses](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_maliciously_crafted_cassette_responses.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious data (e.g., XSS payloads, SQL injection strings) into the response bodies within cassette files. When replayed, the application processes this malicious data, leading to vulnerabilities.

**How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax replays the exact content stored in the cassette files. If these files contain malicious data, Betamax will faithfully reproduce it.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a cassette to include a `<script>` tag in the response body. When the application renders this response during replay, the script executes, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potential for other injection vulnerabilities depending on how the replayed data is used by the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any data retrieved from replayed interactions, treating it as potentially untrusted input.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Restrict write access to cassette files to prevent unauthorized modification.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Use of Betamax in Production Environments](./attack_surfaces/accidental_use_of_betamax_in_production_environments.md)

**Description:** Betamax, intended for testing, is mistakenly used in a production environment, leading to the application relying on potentially outdated or manipulated recorded interactions.

**How Betamax Contributes:** If Betamax is enabled in production, the application will use the replay mechanism instead of making actual network requests.

**Example:** A configuration error or oversight results in Betamax being active in the production environment. The application starts serving responses from cassette files instead of making live API calls.

**Impact:** Serving stale or incorrect data to users, potential for application malfunction, security vulnerabilities if manipulated cassettes are used.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict controls to ensure Betamax is only enabled in development and testing environments.
*   Use environment variables or configuration flags to control Betamax's activation.
*   Thoroughly test deployment processes to prevent accidental inclusion of Betamax in production builds.
