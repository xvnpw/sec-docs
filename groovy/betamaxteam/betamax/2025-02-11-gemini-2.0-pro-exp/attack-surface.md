# Attack Surface Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Attack Surface: [1. Sensitive Data Exposure in Cassettes](./attack_surfaces/1__sensitive_data_exposure_in_cassettes.md)

*   **Description:** Cassettes (recorded HTTP interactions) may contain sensitive information.
    *   **Betamax Contribution:** Betamax's core function is to record *all* HTTP traffic, including sensitive data, unless explicitly configured otherwise.
    *   **Example:** A cassette records a request with an `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header, exposing a valid authentication token.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of user accounts.
        *   Unauthorized access to protected resources.
        *   Data breaches and regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Redaction:** Use Betamax's filtering capabilities (matchers, placeholders, custom filters) to *remove or replace* sensitive data (API keys, tokens, PII, etc.) *before* it's written to the cassette.  Prioritize headers like `Authorization` and `Cookie`, and sensitive data within request/response bodies.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store cassettes in a secure, access-controlled location. *Never* commit them to public repositories. Use environment variables or secure configuration for access control.
        *   **Cassette Encryption:** Encrypt cassettes at rest, especially if complete redaction is impossible.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review cassette contents to ensure no sensitive data is present.
        *   **Short-Lived Cassettes:** Delete cassettes when they are no longer needed.
        *   **Placeholder Usage:** Employ Betamax's placeholder feature to substitute sensitive data with consistent, non-sensitive values.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cassette Tampering and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/2__cassette_tampering_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could modify recorded cassettes to alter application behavior during testing.
    *   **Betamax Contribution:** Betamax replays *exactly* what's in the cassette, making it vulnerable to manipulation if the cassette is not protected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a cassette to inject a successful authentication response, bypassing login checks in tests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   False positives in testing (tests pass when they shouldn't).
        *   Masking of security vulnerabilities.
        *   Potential for introducing vulnerabilities through manipulated responses.
        *   Denial of service by injecting large or malformed responses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restricted Write Access:** Store cassettes in a location with *strictly limited* write access. Use file system permissions, ACLs, or other security mechanisms.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement checksums (e.g., hashing) or digital signatures to verify cassette integrity before use.
        *   **Read-Only Mode:** Configure Betamax to use cassettes in read-only mode whenever possible.
        *   **Limited Scope:** Use separate cassettes for different test scenarios to minimize the impact of a single compromised cassette.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unintended Interactions with Live Services During Recording](./attack_surfaces/3__unintended_interactions_with_live_services_during_recording.md)

*   **Description:** Recording mode interacts with *real* external services, potentially causing unintended side effects.
    *   **Betamax Contribution:** Betamax's recording mode sends requests to the actual configured endpoints.
    *   **Example:** A test run in recording mode against a production payment gateway accidentally processes a real transaction.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Modification of production data.
        *   Triggering of unintended actions (e.g., sending emails, financial transactions).
        *   Consumption of API rate limits.
        *   Data exfiltration to real services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dedicated Test Environments:** *Never* record against production systems. Use isolated testing or staging environments.
        *   **Mocking:** For critical services, use mocking frameworks *alongside* Betamax to prevent any real interaction during recording.
        *   **Careful Test Design:** Avoid tests that perform destructive actions during recording.
        *   **Rate Limit Awareness:** Be mindful of API rate limits and avoid exceeding them.
        *   **`record_mode: :none` Default:** Configure Betamax to default to a non-recording mode, requiring explicit enabling for recording.
