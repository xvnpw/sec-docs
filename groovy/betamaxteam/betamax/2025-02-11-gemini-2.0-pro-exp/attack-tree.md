## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Cassette Storage/Access](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_cassette_storageaccess.md)

*   **1.a. Unauthorized File Access (>> 1.a.2. Code Vulnerability in Application [HIGH]):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's code (e.g., path traversal, arbitrary file read/write) to gain access to the Betamax cassette files.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the application code for any vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized file access.
        *   Implement secure coding practices, including input validation and output encoding.
        *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing.
        *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests.

*   **1.b. Insecure Storage Location:**
    *   **(>> 1.b.1. Lack of Encryption [CRITICAL]):**
        *   **Description:** Cassette files are stored without encryption, making them readable to anyone with access to the storage location.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Encrypt cassette files at rest using filesystem-level encryption (e.g., LUKS, BitLocker) or a Python library like `cryptography`.
            *   Implement a secure key management system to protect the encryption keys.
            *   Regularly rotate encryption keys.

    *   **(>> 1.b.2. Weak File Permissions [CRITICAL]):**
        *   **Description:** Cassette files have overly permissive file permissions, allowing unauthorized users on the system to read or modify them.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Set strict file permissions on the cassette directory and files.  Only the user/process running the tests should have read/write access (e.g., `chmod 600` or `chmod 700`).
            *   Use the principle of least privilege.
            *   Regularly audit file permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Betamax Configuration/Usage Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_betamax_configurationusage_vulnerabilities.md)

*    **2.a Insecure Matchers:**
    *    **(>> 2.a.2 Missing Request Body Matching):**
        *    **Description:** If the request body contains sensitive data and is not included in Betamax matchers, the response might be replayed to requests with different, potentially malicious, bodies.
        *    **Mitigation:**
            *   Always include the `body` matcher in your Betamax configuration when the request body contains sensitive data.
            *   Consider using more granular matchers, such as matching specific fields within the request body.

*   **2.b. Lack of Cassette Sanitization [CRITICAL] (and all sub-nodes):**
    *   **(>> 2.b.1. Record Sensitive Data [CRITICAL]):**
        *   **Description:** Betamax records sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII) without any filtering, storing this data in plain text within the cassette.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Use Betamax's `before_record` and `before_playback` hooks (or the `filter_request` and `filter_response` methods) to register filters.
            *   Create custom filter functions to remove or replace sensitive data before it's written to the cassette.
            *   Use regular expressions to target specific patterns of sensitive data.

    *   **(>> 2.b.2. Missing Header/Body Filter [CRITICAL]):**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive data is present in HTTP headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`) or the response body, and no filters are applied to remove or redact it.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement filters to specifically target and remove sensitive headers.
            *   Create filters to redact or replace sensitive portions of the response body.  Use regular expressions or custom logic to identify and modify the data.

    *   **(>> 2.b.3. Missing Query Param Filter [CRITICAL]):**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive data is present in the URL query parameters, and no filters are applied.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement filters to remove or redact sensitive query parameters.

    *   **(>> 2.b.4. Missing Cookie Filter [CRITICAL]):**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive data is present in cookies, and no filters are applied.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement filters to remove or redact sensitive cookies.
