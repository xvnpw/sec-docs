# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Placeholder Replacement (Before Recording)](./mitigation_strategies/1__placeholder_replacement__before_recording_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:**  List all sensitive data in HTTP interactions (API keys, passwords, tokens, PII, etc.).
2.  **Environment Variables/Secure Config:** Store *actual* values in environment variables or a secure configuration store.
3.  **Code Modification:**  Read sensitive values from environment variables/config store in your code. Use variable *names*, not literal values.
4.  **Betamax Configuration:** Use `define_cassette_placeholder` in your Betamax configuration (e.g., pytest fixture). For *each* sensitive element, define a placeholder (e.g., `<API_KEY>`).  The *value* passed to `define_cassette_placeholder` should be the *environment variable name* (or secure config key), *not* the secret value. Provide a safe default if the variable isn't set.
5.  **Test Execution:** Betamax replaces the environment variable *name* with the placeholder in the cassette during recording. The secret never appears.
6.  **Playback:** Betamax replaces the placeholder with the environment variable's value (or the default) during playback.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control:** (Severity: **Critical**)
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Build Artifacts:** (Severity: **Critical**)
*   **Exposure of Secrets to Unauthorized Personnel:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets:** (Severity: **High**)

**Impact:**
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control:** Risk reduced to **Near Zero**.
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Build Artifacts:** Risk reduced to **Near Zero**.
*   **Exposure of Secrets to Unauthorized Personnel:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**  [e.g., "Implemented in `tests/conftest.py` for API keys and database credentials."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "Not yet implemented for PII in user profile responses. Need placeholders for email/phone."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Cassette Scrubbing (After Recording)](./mitigation_strategies/2__cassette_scrubbing__after_recording_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** (Same as above).
2.  **Implement `before_record` Hook:** Create a function called by Betamax *after* recording, *before* saving the cassette.  It receives the `interaction` and `current_cassette` objects.
3.  **Redaction Logic:**  In the `before_record` hook, implement logic to identify and redact sensitive data:
    *   Check request headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`).
    *   Parse request/response bodies (JSON, XML) and replace sensitive values.
    *   Modify URLs with sensitive parameters.
    *   Replace data with placeholders (e.g., `<REDACTED>`) or generic values.
4.  **Betamax Configuration:** Configure Betamax to use your `before_record` hook.
5.  **Test Execution:** Betamax calls your hook after each interaction, modifying data *in memory* before writing to the cassette.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Build Artifacts:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Exposure of Secrets to Unauthorized Personnel:** (Severity: **Medium**)
*   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets:** (Severity: **Medium**)

**Impact:**
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Version Control:** Risk reduced, but a small vulnerability window exists.
*   **Exposure of Secrets in Build Artifacts:** Risk reduced, but a small vulnerability window exists.
*   **Exposure of Secrets to Unauthorized Personnel:** Risk moderately reduced.
*   **Accidental Disclosure of Secrets:** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Implemented in `tests/utils/betamax_hooks.py` to redact Authorization headers."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "Need scrubbing for request/response bodies to handle sensitive data in JSON."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Strict Request Matching](./mitigation_strategies/3__strict_request_matching.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Betamax Configuration:** In your Betamax configuration, set `default_cassette_options` to include `match_requests_on`.
2.  **Specify Matching Criteria:** Set `match_requests_on` to a list of *all* relevant request attributes for matching:
    *   `'method'` (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
    *   `'uri'` (the full URL)
    *   `'headers'` (request headers)
    *   `'body'` (request body)
3.  **Test Execution:** Betamax uses a recorded interaction only if *all* specified attributes match the current request exactly during playback.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior Due to API Changes:** (Severity: **High**)
*   **Security Vulnerabilities Due to API Changes:** (Severity: **Medium**)
*   **Incorrect Test Results:** (Severity: **Medium**)

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior Due to API Changes:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities Due to API Changes:** Risk moderately reduced.
*   **Incorrect Test Results:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** [e.g., "Implemented globally in `tests/conftest.py` to match on method, URI, and headers."]

**Missing Implementation:** [e.g., "Need to add 'body' to `match_requests_on` for full request matching."]
