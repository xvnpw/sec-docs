Okay, let's dive into designing a comprehensive document for the Betamax project, suitable for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple, user-friendly video/audio recording tool.
*   Offer a cross-platform solution (implied by Electron usage).
*   Enable users to easily capture and potentially share recordings.
*   Minimize external dependencies for ease of deployment and maintenance.
*   Potentially, to serve as a foundation for more advanced features in the future.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data Loss: Accidental deletion or corruption of user recordings.
*   Unauthorized Access: Malicious actors gaining access to user recordings.
*   Reputational Damage: Security vulnerabilities or privacy breaches leading to negative user perception.
*   Usability Issues: Difficulty in using the application, leading to user frustration.
*   Legal and Compliance: Potential issues related to recording consent and data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and contributions (though this is not a guarantee of security). (Described in: Project's GitHub repository)
*   security control: Use of Electron, which inherently includes Chromium's security features (sandboxing, etc., although Electron-specific vulnerabilities are a concern). (Described in: package.json, implicit in Electron usage)
*   security control: Limited external dependencies, reducing the attack surface. (Described in: package.json)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on the underlying operating system's security for file system permissions and access control.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in Electron itself or its dependencies.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in mechanisms for user authentication or authorization (as it appears to be a local application).
*   accepted risk: No explicit encryption of recordings at rest.

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   security control: Implement robust input validation to prevent potential injection attacks or vulnerabilities related to file handling.
*   security control: Consider adding an option for encrypting recordings at rest, especially if users intend to store sensitive information.
*   security control: Regularly update Electron and all dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.  Automate this process.
*   security control: Conduct a thorough security review of the codebase, focusing on Electron-specific security best practices.
*   security control: Provide clear documentation on security considerations for users, including recommendations for secure storage and sharing of recordings.
*   security control: Implement a mechanism for secure software updates to prevent malicious updates from being installed.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Currently, the application appears to be designed for local use without user accounts.  If user accounts or cloud storage are added in the future, strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) will be crucial.
*   Authorization:
    *   Currently, authorization is primarily handled by the operating system's file system permissions. If features like sharing or collaboration are added, a more granular authorization model will be needed.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs, including file paths, recording settings, and any configuration options, must be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.  This is particularly important for Electron applications.
*   Cryptography:
    *   If sensitive data is stored (e.g., user recordings), encryption at rest should be considered.  If data is transmitted (e.g., to a cloud service), encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) is mandatory.  Key management must be carefully considered.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"]
    LocalMachine["Local Machine"]
    GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    BuildArtifacts["Build Artifacts"]

    Developer -- "Writes code" --> LocalMachine
    LocalMachine -- "Pushes code" --> GitHub
    GitHub -- "Triggers build" --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- "Runs build script" --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- "Produces" --> BuildArtifacts
    BuildArtifacts -- "Uploaded to GitHub Releases" --> GitHub

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer writes code on their local machine.
2.  Code is pushed to the GitHub repository.
3.  A GitHub Actions workflow is triggered (on push or pull request).
4.  The workflow runs a build script (likely using `electron-builder`).
5.  The build script:
    *   Installs dependencies (`npm install`).
    *   Runs linters and tests (recommended: ESLint, Prettier, unit tests).
    *   Runs security checks (recommended: static analysis tools, dependency vulnerability scanners).
    *   Builds the application for the target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   Packages the application into installers (e.g., .exe, .dmg, .deb).
6.  The build artifacts (installers) are produced.
7.  The workflow uploads the artifacts to GitHub Releases.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Use of a CI/CD system (GitHub Actions) for automated builds, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Dependency management using `npm` (and potentially tools like `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities).
*   security control: (Recommended) Integration of static analysis tools (SAST) into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: (Recommended) Use of linters (e.g., ESLint) to enforce coding standards and identify potential errors.
*   security control: (Recommended) Code signing of the build artifacts to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
*   security control: (Recommended) Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to track all components and dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   User recording creation and management.
*   Application usability and stability.
*   User data privacy and security.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User Recordings (Audio/Video): High sensitivity. These are the primary data created by the application and may contain personal or confidential information.
*   Application Configuration/Settings: Low sensitivity.  May contain user preferences, but likely no sensitive personal data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any plans for future features, such as cloud storage, sharing, or collaboration? This would significantly impact the security requirements.
*   What is the target user base?  Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA) that need to be considered?
*   What level of security testing has been performed on the application?
*   Is there a process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by users or researchers?
*   What is the expected lifespan of the project, and what is the plan for long-term maintenance and updates?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a simple, functional recording tool.  Profitability is not the primary driver.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project has limited security resources.  The focus is on basic security hygiene and addressing the most obvious vulnerabilities.
*   DESIGN: The application is intended for local use, with no network connectivity or user accounts (in its current state). The user is responsible for the security of their own computer and the recordings they create.
