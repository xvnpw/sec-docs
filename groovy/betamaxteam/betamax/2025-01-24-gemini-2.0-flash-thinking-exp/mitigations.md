# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Mitigation Strategy: [Comprehensive Request Header Scrubbing](./mitigation_strategies/comprehensive_request_header_scrubbing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Comprehensive Request Header Scrubbing
*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all request headers that might contain sensitive information (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`, custom API key headers).
    2.  Configure Betamax's `before_record` hook in your Betamax configuration file (e.g., `betamax_config.py`).
    3.  Within the `before_record` hook, access the request headers using Betamax's API.
    4.  Utilize Betamax's built-in header scrubbing functionality or implement custom logic *within the Betamax hook* to remove or replace sensitive header values with placeholder strings (e.g., `<REDACTED>`).
    5.  Ensure scrubbing rules are applied to all relevant headers, including custom headers used for authentication or authorization, *within the Betamax configuration*.
    6.  Test scrubbing by making requests with sensitive headers and verifying that the recorded cassettes, *generated by Betamax*, do not contain the original sensitive values.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of API Keys in Request Headers (High Severity):  Accidental recording of API keys passed in headers could lead to unauthorized access if cassettes are exposed.
    *   Exposure of Authentication Tokens in Request Headers (High Severity):  Bearer tokens, JWTs, or session IDs in headers could be compromised if recorded and exposed.
    *   Exposure of Session Cookies in Request Headers (Medium Severity): Session cookies could be used for session hijacking if exposed.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk for all listed threats by preventing sensitive information from being recorded in cassettes *through Betamax's scrubbing mechanisms*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, basic header scrubbing is implemented in `betamax_config.py` for common headers like `Authorization` and `Cookie` using Betamax's configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing scrubbing for custom API key headers used by specific microservices *within Betamax configuration*.  No automated testing to verify header scrubbing effectiveness *of Betamax rules*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Response Header Scrubbing](./mitigation_strategies/robust_response_header_scrubbing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Response Header Scrubbing
*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify response headers that might inadvertently leak sensitive information (e.g., server version information, internal path disclosures, potentially sensitive cookies set by the API).
    2.  Configure Betamax's `before_record` hook in your Betamax configuration file.
    3.  Within the `before_record` hook, access the response headers using Betamax's API.
    4.  Utilize Betamax's header scrubbing functionality or implement custom logic *within the Betamax hook* to remove or replace sensitive response header values with placeholders.
    5.  Focus on headers that could reveal internal system details or session information, configuring scrubbing rules *in Betamax*.
    6.  Test scrubbing by examining recorded cassettes *generated by Betamax* to ensure sensitive response headers are scrubbed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure via Response Headers (Medium Severity): Leaking server versions or internal paths could aid attackers in reconnaissance.
    *   Exposure of Session Cookies in Response Headers (Medium Severity):  While less common, sensitive cookies set in responses could be a risk.
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduces risk of information disclosure by removing potentially revealing details from response headers in cassettes *using Betamax's scrubbing features*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, basic response header scrubbing is implemented to remove `Server` header using Betamax's configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Missing scrubbing for custom response headers that might leak internal application details *within Betamax configuration*. No regular review of response headers for potential sensitive information to configure scrubbing for in Betamax.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Deep Request Body Scrubbing](./mitigation_strategies/deep_request_body_scrubbing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Deep Request Body Scrubbing
*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze request body structures (JSON, XML, form data, etc.) for all API interactions that Betamax records.
    2.  Identify specific fields or data points within request bodies that could contain sensitive data (e.g., password fields, API key parameters, PII fields like email or phone numbers).
    3.  Configure Betamax's `before_record` hook in your Betamax configuration file.
    4.  Within the hook, parse the request body based on its content type (e.g., JSON parsing for `application/json`) *using libraries within the Betamax hook*.
    5.  Use path-based or key-based scrubbing *within the Betamax hook logic* to target specific sensitive fields within the parsed body structure.
    6.  Replace sensitive field values with placeholders *within the Betamax hook logic*.
    7.  Handle different body formats (JSON, XML, form data) appropriately *within the Betamax hook logic*.
    8.  Test scrubbing by sending requests with sensitive data in various body fields and verifying cassette content *recorded by Betamax*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of API Keys in Request Bodies (High Severity): API keys embedded in request bodies could be exposed.
    *   Exposure of User Credentials in Request Bodies (High Severity): Usernames and passwords in login requests or API calls could be recorded.
    *   Exposure of PII in Request Bodies (Medium Severity): Personally identifiable information submitted in API requests could be exposed.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk of sensitive data exposure in request bodies by targeting specific fields for scrubbing *using Betamax's hooks and custom logic*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, basic JSON body scrubbing is implemented for a few known API endpoints and fields using custom logic within Betamax's `before_record` hook.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No scrubbing for XML or form data request bodies *within Betamax hooks*.  Scrubbing rules are not comprehensive across all API endpoints and request body structures *in Betamax configuration*. No automated validation of body scrubbing rules *implemented in Betamax hooks*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Targeted Response Body Scrubbing](./mitigation_strategies/targeted_response_body_scrubbing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Targeted Response Body Scrubbing
*   **Description:**
    1.  Analyze response body structures for all API interactions that Betamax records.
    2.  Identify specific fields or data points within response bodies that might contain sensitive data or PII (e.g., user IDs, email addresses, account numbers, secrets returned in responses).
    3.  Configure Betamax's `before_record` hook in your Betamax configuration file.
    4.  Within the hook, parse the response body based on its content type *using libraries within the Betamax hook*.
    5.  Use path-based or key-based scrubbing *within the Betamax hook logic* to target specific sensitive fields within the parsed body structure.
    6.  Replace sensitive field values with placeholders *within the Betamax hook logic*.
    7.  Handle different body formats appropriately *within the Betamax hook logic*.
    8.  Test scrubbing by examining recorded cassettes *generated by Betamax* to ensure sensitive response data is scrubbed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of PII in Response Bodies (Medium Severity):  PII returned in API responses could be exposed in cassettes.
    *   Exposure of Internal IDs or Account Numbers (Medium Severity):  Internal identifiers or account numbers could be misused if exposed.
    *   Accidental Exposure of Secrets in Responses (Low Severity, but possible):  In rare cases, APIs might inadvertently return secrets in responses.
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduces risk of exposing sensitive data in response bodies by scrubbing specific fields *using Betamax's hooks and custom logic*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, basic JSON response body scrubbing is implemented for a few known API endpoints and fields, mainly focusing on removing user IDs, using custom logic within Betamax's `before_record` hook.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No scrubbing for XML or form data response bodies *within Betamax hooks*. Scrubbing rules are not comprehensive across all API endpoints and response body structures *in Betamax configuration*. No regular review of response bodies for potential sensitive information to configure scrubbing for in Betamax.
