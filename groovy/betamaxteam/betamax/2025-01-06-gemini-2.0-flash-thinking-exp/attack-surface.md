# Attack Surface Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_recordings.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Recordings
    *   **Description:** Betamax records raw HTTP interactions, inherently capable of capturing sensitive data like API keys, authentication tokens, PII, and internal credentials within request headers, bodies, or response bodies.
    *   **How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax's core function is to record and replay these interactions. Without explicit filtering, it will faithfully capture sensitive data present in the HTTP traffic.
    *   **Example:** A test scenario interacts with an API requiring an OAuth token in the `Authorization` header. Betamax records this header, storing the token in the cassette file. This cassette file is then stored in the project's repository, potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data can lead to unauthorized access to systems, data breaches, account compromise, and violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Data Filtering:** Utilize Betamax's filtering capabilities to exclude sensitive headers, request parameters, and response body parts from being recorded.
        *   **Secure Cassette Storage:** Store cassette files in secure locations with appropriate access controls. Avoid committing sensitive cassettes to public repositories.
        *   **Encrypt Cassette Files:** Consider encrypting cassette files at rest to protect sensitive data even if the storage location is compromised.
        *   **Regularly Review Cassette Content:** Periodically audit the content of existing cassettes to identify and remove any inadvertently recorded sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks via Recorded Responses](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_via_recorded_responses.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Injection Attacks via Recorded Responses
    *   **Description:** If an attacker can influence or manipulate the HTTP responses that Betamax records, they can inject malicious content into the cassette files. During replay, the application might process this malicious content, leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax faithfully records the responses it receives. If the recording process is not isolated or if the target service is compromised, malicious responses can be recorded and subsequently replayed by Betamax.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a test API endpoint. When Betamax records interactions with this endpoint, the malicious response (e.g., containing a `<script>` tag for XSS) is saved in the cassette. During testing, this malicious response is replayed, potentially executing the script in the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), data manipulation, and other injection-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Isolate Recording Environment:** Ensure the environment where Betamax records interactions is secure and isolated from potentially compromised systems.
        *   **Verify Recorded Responses:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and expected content of recorded responses.
        *   **Treat Replayed Data as Untrusted:** Even when using Betamax, treat the replayed data as potentially untrusted and apply appropriate input validation and sanitization within the application.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Cassette Storage](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_cassette_storage.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Path Traversal in Cassette Storage
    *   **Description:** If the application logic constructing the path for storing cassette files is vulnerable to path traversal, an attacker might be able to write cassettes to arbitrary locations on the file system.
    *   **How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax relies on the application to provide the path where cassettes should be stored. If this path construction is flawed, Betamax will write the file to the specified (potentially malicious) location.
    *   **Example:** The application uses user input to determine part of the cassette file path. An attacker provides input like `"../../sensitive_data/malicious_cassette.yaml"`, causing Betamax to write the cassette outside the intended directory.
    *   **Impact:** Overwriting existing files, creating files in sensitive locations, potentially leading to information disclosure or even code execution if the attacker can overwrite executable files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Path Construction:** Implement robust and secure logic for constructing cassette file paths, avoiding reliance on user input or external data without proper validation.
        *   **Restrict Write Permissions:** Ensure the application process running Betamax has the minimum necessary write permissions to the designated cassette storage directory.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Security Mechanisms (if used improperly)](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_security_mechanisms__if_used_improperly_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Bypass of Security Mechanisms (if used improperly)
    *   **Description:** If Betamax is used in non-testing environments or if recordings are used inappropriately, it can be exploited to bypass security checks.
    *   **How Betamax Contributes:** Betamax's replay functionality allows simulating the outcome of an actual request by using pre-recorded interactions. This can be misused to circumvent authentication or authorization checks if not carefully managed.
    *   **Example:** A developer uses a cassette that contains a successful authentication response to bypass the actual login process during development or even in a staging environment, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, bypassing security controls, potentially leading to significant security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly Use Betamax for Testing:** Confine the use of Betamax to dedicated testing environments and avoid using it in production or staging environments where security controls should be enforced.
        *   **Clear Separation of Test and Production Data:** Ensure that test data and recordings do not contain sensitive production data that could be misused if security mechanisms are bypassed.
        *   **Enforce Security Checks Even During Replay:** Design the application to perform necessary security checks even when interacting with replayed responses, where applicable.
