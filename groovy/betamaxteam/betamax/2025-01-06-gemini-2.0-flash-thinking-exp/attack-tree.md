## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Recording Storage [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_recording_storage__high_risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

* **Gain Access to Recording Storage [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities in the storage system where Betamax recordings are located.
    * Attack Vector: Leverage weak or default credentials for accessing the storage.
    * Attack Vector: Exploit misconfigurations in file system permissions allowing unauthorized access.
    * Attack Vector: Utilize compromised accounts with access to the storage location.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Modify Recording File [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/directly_modify_recording_file__critical_node_.md)

* **Directly Modify Recording File [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: Once access to the recording storage is gained, directly edit the Betamax recording files (e.g., YAML files).
    * Attack Vector: Inject malicious payloads into response bodies.
    * Attack Vector: Alter response status codes to manipulate application logic.
    * Attack Vector: Modify response headers to introduce vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting).

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Checks Based on Replayed Data [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_checks_based_on_replayed_data__high_risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

* **Bypass Security Checks Based on Replayed Data [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: The application relies solely on data retrieved from Betamax recordings for authorization or authentication decisions.
    * Attack Vector: An attacker manipulates recordings (through prior steps) to impersonate legitimate users or bypass access controls.
    * Attack Vector: The application trusts replayed data without performing independent validation or verification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection via Configuration or Recording Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_via_configuration_or_recording_data__critical_node_.md)

* **Code Injection via Configuration or Recording Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities in how Betamax parses or processes its configuration settings.
    * Attack Vector: Inject malicious code within the recording data itself that gets executed by Betamax during the replay process.
    * Attack Vector: Leverage insecure deserialization flaws if Betamax uses deserialization for processing recordings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Insecure Storage for Recordings [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/use_insecure_storage_for_recordings__high_risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

* **Use Insecure Storage for Recordings [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: Store Betamax recording files in publicly accessible locations on the file system or web server.
    * Attack Vector: Use storage solutions with overly permissive access controls.
    * Attack Vector: Fail to implement proper authentication or authorization for accessing the recording storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Handling of Sensitive Data in Recordings [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/improper_handling_of_sensitive_data_in_recordings__high_risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

* **Improper Handling of Sensitive Data in Recordings [HIGH RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * Attack Vector: Betamax recordings inadvertently capture sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or personal data within request or response bodies or headers.
    * Attack Vector: Developers fail to implement mechanisms to redact or filter sensitive data before recording.
    * Attack Vector: Recorded interactions with external services expose authentication tokens or secrets.
