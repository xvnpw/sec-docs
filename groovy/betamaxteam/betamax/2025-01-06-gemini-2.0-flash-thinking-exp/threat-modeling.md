# Threat Model Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Threat: [Accidental Recording of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_recording_of_sensitive_data.md)

* **Threat:** Accidental Recording of Sensitive Data
    * **Description:** Betamax's core functionality of recording HTTP interactions might inadvertently capture sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, personal data) present in request headers, bodies, or URLs if not properly configured to filter them out.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of confidential data, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems, data breaches, or compliance violations.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Recording module, specifically the request/response interception and storage mechanisms.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust filtering using Betamax's configuration options to exclude sensitive headers, parameters, and request/response bodies.
        * Regularly review and update these filters.
        * Avoid including sensitive data in test requests whenever possible.

## Threat: [Lack of Encryption for Sensitive Data within Cassettes](./threats/lack_of_encryption_for_sensitive_data_within_cassettes.md)

* **Threat:** Lack of Encryption for Sensitive Data within Cassettes
    * **Description:** Betamax stores recorded interactions in cassette files. If sensitive data is present in these recordings and Betamax doesn't provide built-in encryption, an attacker gaining access to these files can directly read and extract confidential information.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, even if the storage location has some level of security.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** The cassette serialization and deserialization mechanisms.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Consider encrypting sensitive data within the cassettes before storage. This might involve custom pre-processing or using Betamax's configuration options if available for encryption.
        * Encrypt the entire storage medium where cassettes are stored.

## Threat: [Accidental Inclusion of Secrets in Cassettes](./threats/accidental_inclusion_of_secrets_in_cassettes.md)

* **Threat:** Accidental Inclusion of Secrets in Cassettes
    * **Description:** Despite filtering efforts, flaws in Betamax's filtering mechanisms or edge cases in how it handles certain data could lead to secrets inadvertently being included in cassette files.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of secrets, leading to potential compromise of associated systems or accounts.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Recording module, filtering mechanisms.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rigorous review processes for cassette files, especially before committing them to version control.
        * Utilize automated secret scanning tools or scripts to scan cassettes for potential secrets.
        * Employ techniques like redaction or tokenization for sensitive data before recording.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Betamax's Replay Mechanism](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_betamax's_replay_mechanism.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Betamax's Replay Mechanism
    * **Description:** A security vulnerability within Betamax's replay logic could be exploited by an attacker.
    * **Impact:** Could lead to unexpected application behavior, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution if a severe vulnerability exists in Betamax.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Replay module, core Betamax library code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Betamax updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        * Monitor for reported vulnerabilities in the Betamax library through security advisories and vulnerability databases.

## Threat: [Compromised Betamax Dependency](./threats/compromised_betamax_dependency.md)

* **Threat:** Compromised Betamax Dependency
    * **Description:** The Betamax library itself could be compromised through a supply chain attack, injecting malicious code into the library.
    * **Impact:** A compromised library could introduce malicious code into the application, leading to various security issues, including data theft, unauthorized access, or remote code execution.
    * **Affected Betamax Component:** Entire Betamax library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in Betamax and its dependencies.
        * Employ software composition analysis (SCA) to monitor for potential supply chain risks.
        * Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or signatures.
        * Pin the version of Betamax used in your project to prevent unexpected updates.
        * Regularly review the dependencies of Betamax.
