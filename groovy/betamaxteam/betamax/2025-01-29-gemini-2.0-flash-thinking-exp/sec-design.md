# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Improve software quality by enabling reliable and repeatable testing of HTTP interactions.
  - Reduce the time and effort required for integration testing by providing a tool to record and replay HTTP services.
  - Facilitate development and debugging by allowing developers to work against consistent and predictable HTTP responses.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of exposing sensitive data if HTTP interactions containing credentials, personal information, or confidential data are recorded and stored insecurely.
  - Risk of test environment inconsistencies if recorded interactions are not properly managed or become outdated.
  - Risk of developers misusing the tool, leading to false positives or negatives in tests if recordings are not created and used appropriately.
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities within the Betamax library itself, which could be exploited if integrated into larger systems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository management and access control. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
  - security control: Open-source project, allowing for community review and potential identification of security vulnerabilities. (Implemented: Open-source nature)
  - security control: Standard software development practices are assumed, including version control and issue tracking. (Assumed: Development process)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for insecure usage by developers if they are not fully aware of security best practices when recording and replaying HTTP interactions.
  - accepted risk: Dependencies on third-party libraries may introduce vulnerabilities.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the build pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate Dependency Vulnerability Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Betamax.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security code reviews by security experts to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and guidelines for developers on secure usage of Betamax, especially regarding handling sensitive data in recordings and storage.
  - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to manage open source components and their licenses, ensuring compliance and security.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Betamax as a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using Betamax and the HTTP services being interacted with. Betamax should not interfere with or bypass application authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to Betamax as a library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using Betamax and the HTTP services being interacted with. Betamax should not introduce any authorization bypass vulnerabilities.
  - Input Validation: Betamax should robustly handle various HTTP request and response formats. It should avoid vulnerabilities related to processing untrusted input from HTTP interactions, such as injection attacks if it parses or logs request/response data.
  - Cryptography: If Betamax stores recordings that may contain sensitive data, consider providing options for encrypting these recordings at rest. This could involve using standard encryption libraries to protect recorded data.

```

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer makes code changes and commits them to a Version Control System (e.g., Git/GitHub).
  - A Build System (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by code changes.
  - The Build System performs the following steps:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is performed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
    - Dependency Checkers are run to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    - Unit Tests are executed to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions.
    - If all checks pass, Build Artifacts (e.g., a library package) are created.
    - Build Artifacts are published to a Package Repository (e.g., PyPI for Python libraries).
- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Version Control System (Git): Tracks code changes, enables code review, and provides audit trails. (Implemented: Git/GitHub)
  - security control: Automated Build System (GitHub Actions): Automates the build process, ensuring consistency and repeatability. (Implemented: GitHub Actions or similar)
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Identifies potential code-level vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. (Recommended: Integrate SAST tools)
  - security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning: Checks for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. (Recommended: Integrate dependency scanning tools)
  - security control: Unit Tests: Ensures code quality and reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through code changes. (Implemented: Unit testing framework)
  - security control: Secure Build Environment: Harden the build environment to prevent tampering and ensure the integrity of the build process. (Recommended: Secure configuration of build agents)
  - security control: Code Review: Peer review of code changes before merging to the main branch to identify potential security and functional issues. (Recommended: Code review process)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software Development Lifecycle: Betamax is a tool to improve the efficiency and reliability of software testing, which is a critical part of the software development lifecycle.
  - Quality Assurance: By enabling robust testing of HTTP interactions, Betamax contributes to the overall quality assurance process.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - HTTP Request and Response Data: Betamax records HTTP requests and responses. This data can contain sensitive information depending on the application being tested.
    - Sensitivity Level: Medium to High. If the application handles sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, personal information, API keys), the recordings may contain this sensitive data.
  - Betamax Library Code: The source code of the Betamax library itself.
    - Sensitivity Level: Medium. Compromise of the library code could lead to vulnerabilities in applications using it.
  - Build Artifacts (Library Package): The packaged Betamax library distributed to developers.
    - Sensitivity Level: Medium. Compromised build artifacts could be distributed and used by developers, potentially introducing vulnerabilities.
