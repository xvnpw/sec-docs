# Threat Model Analysis for betamaxteam/betamax

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage in Recording Files](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_in_recording_files.md)

* **Description:** Betamax records HTTP interactions, potentially including sensitive data like API keys, passwords, personal information (PII), and session tokens within request/response headers, URLs, and bodies. If these recording files (cassettes) are not properly secured, an attacker gaining unauthorized access can extract this sensitive information. Access could be gained through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in storage locations, compromising developer machines, or through insider threats.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of sensitive data. This can lead to severe consequences including:
    * **Account Compromise:** Leaked credentials can be used to access user accounts or administrative panels.
    * **System Compromise:** API keys or internal system credentials can allow attackers to access and control backend systems.
    * **Data Theft:** Personal information or proprietary data can be stolen and misused.
    * **Reputational Damage:** Data breaches can severely damage the reputation and trust of the application and organization.
* **Betamax Component Affected:** Recording Storage (File System, potentially custom storage mechanisms used by Betamax)
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement Robust Data Filtering and Scrubbing:** Utilize Betamax's filtering capabilities to aggressively remove sensitive data from requests and responses *before* they are recorded. Focus on headers, URLs, and request/response bodies.
    * **Secure Recording Storage:** Store recording files in highly secure locations with strict access control. Use file system permissions or dedicated secure storage solutions to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
    * **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt recording files at rest to protect data even if storage is compromised.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of Betamax configurations and recording storage to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Data Minimization:**  Minimize the amount of data recorded by Betamax. Only record interactions necessary for testing and avoid recording unnecessary or overly verbose data.
    * **Developer Training:** Train developers on the security risks associated with Betamax and best practices for secure configuration and data handling within recordings.
    * **Automated Security Checks:** Integrate automated security checks into the development pipeline to detect potential sensitive data leaks in recordings before they are committed or deployed.
