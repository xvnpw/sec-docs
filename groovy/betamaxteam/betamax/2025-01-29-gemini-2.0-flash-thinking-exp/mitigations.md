## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Request and Response Filtering (Betamax Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_request_and_response_filtering__betamax_feature_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Request and Response Filtering (Betamax Feature)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Analyze your application's HTTP requests and responses to pinpoint headers, request bodies, and response bodies that might contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, tokens, PII) that Betamax might record.
    2.  **Configure Betamax Filters:**  Utilize Betamax's configuration options to define filters *within Betamax*. This involves:
        *   **Header Filtering:**  Specify header names (e.g., `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-API-Key`) in Betamax's configuration to be filtered. Betamax will automatically replace the values of these headers in recorded tapes with placeholders during the recording process.
        *   **Body Filtering (Request and Response):**  Use regular expressions or custom functions *within Betamax's configuration* to identify patterns within request and response bodies that represent sensitive data. Configure Betamax to replace these matched patterns with placeholders during recording. Target filtering based on JSON field names or XML element names known to contain sensitive data, using Betamax's body filter mechanisms.
        *   **Query Parameter Filtering:** Configure Betamax to filter sensitive data passed in URL query parameters by specifying parameter names or patterns in Betamax's configuration.
    3.  **Test Filters with Betamax:**  Run your tests with Betamax recording enabled and then inspect the *generated Betamax tapes* to verify that the filters configured *in Betamax* are effectively redacting the identified sensitive data as intended by Betamax's filtering mechanisms. Adjust Betamax filter configurations as needed to ensure comprehensive redaction within Betamax's recording process without breaking test functionality.
    4.  **Maintain Betamax Filter Configuration:** Regularly review and update the filter configuration *within Betamax* as your application evolves and new sensitive data elements are introduced or identified that Betamax needs to filter.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Tapes (High Severity):**  Without Betamax filtering, tapes can contain real API keys, passwords, user data, and internal system details *recorded by Betamax*. If tapes are inadvertently exposed, this sensitive data is compromised due to Betamax's recording.
    *   **Data Breach via Tape Leakage (High Severity):**  If tapes *recorded by Betamax* are accessed by unauthorized individuals due to insecure storage or accidental exposure, the sensitive data within (if not filtered by Betamax) can be exploited for malicious purposes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Tapes:** Significantly reduces the risk *specifically by leveraging Betamax's filtering capabilities*. Effective Betamax filtering makes tapes safer to store and share within the development team and reduces the impact of accidental exposure of Betamax tapes.
    *   **Data Breach via Tape Leakage:**  Significantly reduces the risk *due to Betamax's redaction*. Betamax filtered tapes contain placeholder data, making them much less valuable to attackers even if leaked.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Header filtering for `Authorization` and `Cookie` headers is configured in `betamax_config.py` using Betamax's header filtering feature. Basic body filtering using regular expressions for common patterns like "password" is also in place using Betamax's body filtering.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Comprehensive Body Filtering (Betamax):**  Need to expand body filtering *within Betamax configuration* to cover more specific JSON fields and XML elements that might contain sensitive data in API responses, utilizing Betamax's body filtering capabilities more extensively.
    *   **Query Parameter Filtering (Betamax):**  Filtering of sensitive data in URL query parameters *using Betamax's query parameter filtering* is not yet fully implemented.
    *   **Regular Review and Updates of Betamax Filters:**  No automated process for regularly reviewing and updating filter configurations *within Betamax* as the application evolves and requires updated Betamax filtering rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Recording Scope (Betamax Usage Strategy)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_recording_scope__betamax_usage_strategy_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Recording Scope (Betamax Usage Strategy)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Targeted Recordings with Betamax:**  Design tests that use Betamax to record *only* the specific HTTP interactions necessary to verify the functionality being tested. Avoid broad or overly general recordings *when using Betamax*.
    2.  **Route-Specific Recording (If Possible with Betamax):**  Utilize Betamax's configuration options (if available or through custom logic when setting up Betamax) to limit recording *by Betamax* to specific API routes or endpoints that are relevant to the test.
    3.  **Avoid Unnecessary Interactions During Betamax Recording:**  Structure tests to minimize unnecessary HTTP interactions that are not directly related to the test's purpose *when recording with Betamax*. Focus Betamax recordings on essential interactions.
    4.  **Review Test Design for Betamax Usage:** Periodically review test designs that use Betamax to ensure that recordings are as focused and minimal as possible *in their Betamax usage*.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Chance of Accidental Data Capture (Medium Severity):**  Broader recordings *by Betamax* increase the surface area for potentially capturing sensitive data, even with filtering in Betamax. Minimizing Betamax's recording scope reduces this.
    *   **Larger Tape Size and Complexity (Low Severity - Indirect Security Impact):**  Larger tapes *created by Betamax* are harder to manage, review, and potentially increase the risk of overlooking security issues within them. Minimizing Betamax recording scope helps manage tape size.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Chance of Accidental Data Capture:**  Partially mitigates the risk *by controlling Betamax's recording to essential interactions*. Reducing the amount of data recorded by Betamax reduces the potential for capturing sensitive information in Betamax tapes.
    *   **Larger Tape Size and Complexity:**  Reduces tape size and complexity *of Betamax tapes*, making them easier to manage and review.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally encouraged to write focused tests, but there's no formal process or tooling to enforce minimal recording scope *specifically for Betamax usage*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Guidelines for Minimal Betamax Recording:**  Need to establish clear guidelines for developers on minimizing recording scope *when using Betamax* to write tests.
    *   **Tooling or Linters (Optional) for Betamax Usage:**  Explore if tooling or linters can be used to analyze tests and identify opportunities to reduce recording scope *specifically in the context of Betamax usage*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Betamax Updated (Dependency Management)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_betamax_updated__dependency_management_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Betamax Dependency Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Betamax Dependency Updates:**  Include Betamax in your regular dependency update process. Monitor for new releases of Betamax *itself*.
    2.  **Security Monitoring for Betamax:** Subscribe to security advisories or vulnerability databases specifically related to *the Betamax library* and its dependencies.
    3.  **Prompt Betamax Updates:** When new versions of Betamax are released, especially those addressing security vulnerabilities *in Betamax*, update Betamax to the latest stable version promptly.
    4.  **Testing After Betamax Updates:** After updating Betamax, run your test suite to ensure compatibility and that the Betamax update hasn't introduced any regressions in your tests that rely on Betamax.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Betamax Library (Variable Severity):**  Outdated versions of *Betamax itself* might contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if an attacker gains control over the testing environment or tape processing.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Betamax relies on other libraries. Outdated dependencies *of Betamax* can also introduce vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Betamax Library:**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities *within the Betamax library itself*.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities *in Betamax's dependencies*.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a general dependency update process, but Betamax updates might not be prioritized as security-critical *specifically*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Prioritized Betamax Updates:**  Need to prioritize Betamax updates, especially security-related updates, as part of the security maintenance process *for Betamax dependencies*.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning for Betamax:**  Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to specifically detect known vulnerabilities in *Betamax and its dependencies*.
