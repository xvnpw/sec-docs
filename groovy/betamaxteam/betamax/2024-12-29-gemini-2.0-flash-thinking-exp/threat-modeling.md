### High and Critical Betamax Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Cassette Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the cassette storage location and injects a crafted cassette file. This cassette could contain manipulated responses designed to trick the application under test into behaving in a way that benefits the attacker, such as bypassing authentication or authorization checks during testing.
    *   **Impact:**  False positive test results, masking of critical vulnerabilities, potential introduction of flawed logic into the application based on misleading test outcomes.
    *   **Affected Betamax Component:** Cassette loading mechanism (e.g., file system interaction for cassette retrieval).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to the cassette storage directory to only trusted processes and users.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) for cassette files before loading them.
        *   Store cassettes in a secure location with appropriate file system permissions.

*   **Threat:** Cassette Content Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with read/write access to cassette files modifies existing recordings. This could involve altering response bodies to inject malicious scripts, change expected data, or remove security-related headers.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls during testing, introducing vulnerabilities that are not detected by tests, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks if manipulated responses are used in browser-based tests.
    *   **Affected Betamax Component:** Cassette loading and response retrieval mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict write access to the cassette storage directory.
        *   Implement integrity checks for cassette files.
        *   Regularly review cassette content for unexpected modifications.
        *   Use version control for cassette files to track changes and revert to previous versions.

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Cassettes
    *   **Description:** Developers inadvertently record cassettes containing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, personal data, or internal system details within request or response bodies and headers. An attacker gaining access to these cassettes can extract this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access to external services, compromise of user accounts, exposure of internal system architecture.
    *   **Affected Betamax Component:** Recording mechanism (capturing request and response data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict policies against including real credentials or PII in test scenarios.
        *   Utilize Betamax's filtering capabilities to redact sensitive information from requests and responses before recording.
        *   Encrypt cassette files at rest.
        *   Avoid committing cassettes containing sensitive data to public version control repositories.
        *   Regularly audit cassette content for sensitive information.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Betamax
    *   **Description:**  Betamax itself relies on other libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities if they can influence Betamax's execution or access its internal state.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution within the testing environment, access to sensitive data used by Betamax, or manipulation of test outcomes.
    *   **Affected Betamax Component:**  The entire library and its dependencies.
