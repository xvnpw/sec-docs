    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline managed by the tool stack, leading to unauthorized access to other systems, data breaches, and potential financial loss.
    * **Affected Component:** Dockerfiles within the `docker-ci-tool-stack` definition, `docker-compose.yml` file of the tool stack, environment variable configurations defined within the tool stack's components.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid embedding secrets directly in Dockerfiles or the `docker-compose.yml` of the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
        * Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets, Docker Secrets) and integrate them with the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
        * Pass secrets as environment variables at runtime, ensuring they are not baked into the image layers of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` components.
        * Implement proper access controls to the repository containing the `docker-ci-tool-stack` configuration files.
        * Regularly audit the `docker-ci-tool-stack` configuration for accidentally committed secrets.

## Threat: [Insecure Jenkins Configuration within the Tool Stack](./threats/insecure_jenkins_configuration_within_the_tool_stack.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Jenkins Configuration within the Tool Stack
    * **Description:** A poorly configured Jenkins instance *within the `docker-ci-tool-stack` container* can expose vulnerabilities. This includes weak authentication, authorization bypasses, or leaving default credentials in place. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to the Jenkins instance provided by the tool stack.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the CI/CD pipeline managed by the tool stack, ability to modify build jobs defined within the Jenkins instance, inject malicious code into the build process, access sensitive build artifacts and logs managed by the tool stack, and potentially gain control over the Jenkins server within the tool stack.
    * **Affected Component:** Jenkins instance running within the Docker container provided by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strong authentication and authorization mechanisms within the Jenkins instance of the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
        * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the Jenkins instance.
        * Change default administrative credentials for the Jenkins instance.
