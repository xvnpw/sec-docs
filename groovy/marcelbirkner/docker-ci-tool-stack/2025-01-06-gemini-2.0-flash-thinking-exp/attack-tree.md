## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Jenkins [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_jenkins__critical_.md)

**Exploit Default Credentials [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Access Jenkins UI with default admin credentials [CRITICAL]:**  Attackers attempt to log into the Jenkins web interface using well-known default credentials (e.g., admin/admin, user/password). If the default credentials haven't been changed, the attacker gains full administrative control over the Jenkins instance. This allows them to manage jobs, users, plugins, and the Jenkins server itself.

**Exploit Known Jenkins Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability [HIGH RISK]:**
        * **Execute arbitrary commands on Jenkins server [CRITICAL]:** Attackers exploit known security flaws in the Jenkins software that allow them to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server. This can be achieved through various methods depending on the specific vulnerability, such as exploiting serialization flaws, script console vulnerabilities, or plugin vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the Jenkins server, enabling them to install malware, steal data, or further compromise the CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Artifact Repository (Nexus) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_artifact_repository__nexus___critical_.md)

**Exploit Default Credentials [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Access Nexus UI with default admin credentials [CRITICAL]:** Similar to Jenkins, attackers attempt to log into the Nexus repository manager using default credentials. Successful login grants full administrative control over the artifact repository, allowing them to manage repositories, users, permissions, and artifacts.

**Exploit Misconfigured Access Control [HIGH RISK START]:**
    * **Anonymous access enabled to repositories [HIGH RISK]:**
        * **Upload malicious artifacts or replace legitimate ones [CRITICAL]:** If anonymous access is enabled for repositories in Nexus, attackers can upload malicious artifacts disguised as legitimate dependencies or replace existing, trusted artifacts with backdoored versions. This allows them to inject malicious code into the application build process, leading to supply chain attacks.

**Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Artifact Injection [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Upload a seemingly legitimate but backdoored artifact [CRITICAL]:**  Even without anonymous access, if an attacker gains some level of access to Nexus (e.g., through compromised credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities), they can upload malicious artifacts that appear to be legitimate. These backdoored artifacts can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious functionality into the application when it's built using these compromised dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Docker Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH RISK START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_docker_configuration_weaknesses__high_risk_start_.md)

**Access Docker Socket [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Jenkins container has access to the host Docker socket [HIGH RISK]:**
        * **Escalate privileges to the host system [CRITICAL]:** If the Jenkins container is configured to mount the host's Docker socket ( `/var/run/docker.sock` ) without proper restrictions, an attacker who compromises the Jenkins container can use the Docker socket to control the host Docker daemon. This allows them to create new containers with escalated privileges, access host filesystems, and effectively gain root access to the host system.

**Exploit Privileged Containers [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Jenkins or other containers running with excessive privileges:**
        * **Escape container and gain access to the host system [CRITICAL]:** Running containers with the `--privileged` flag or with overly permissive capabilities grants them excessive access to the host system's resources. Attackers who compromise such containers can exploit this privileged access to escape the container environment and gain control over the underlying host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate CI-CD Pipeline Execution [HIGH RISK START]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_ci-cd_pipeline_execution__high_risk_start_.md)

**Modify Jenkins Job Configuration [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Inject malicious build steps [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Execute arbitrary commands during build process [CRITICAL]:** Attackers who gain access to Jenkins can modify the configuration of existing build jobs or create new ones. They can inject malicious build steps that execute arbitrary commands during the build process. This allows them to introduce backdoors, steal secrets, or deploy compromised versions of the application.
    * **Modify deployment scripts:**
        * **Deploy compromised application versions [CRITICAL]:** Attackers can modify the scripts responsible for deploying the application. This allows them to replace the legitimate application with a compromised version, potentially containing backdoors or malicious functionality.

**Trigger Builds with Malicious Code [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Introduce vulnerabilities through code pushed to repositories monitored by Jenkins [CRITICAL]:** Attackers can directly introduce vulnerabilities into the application's codebase by pushing malicious code to the repositories that Jenkins monitors. When Jenkins triggers a build based on this compromised code, the resulting application will contain the introduced vulnerabilities.

**Steal Secrets and Credentials [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Access Jenkins credentials store [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Retrieve API keys, database passwords, etc. [CRITICAL]:** Jenkins often stores sensitive credentials like API keys, database passwords, and other secrets used during the build and deployment process. Attackers who gain access to Jenkins can attempt to access this credentials store and steal these sensitive values, which can then be used to compromise other systems and resources.
