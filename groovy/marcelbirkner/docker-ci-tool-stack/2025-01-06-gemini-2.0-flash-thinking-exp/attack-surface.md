# Attack Surface Analysis for marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Service Ports (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Traefik UI)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_service_ports__jenkins__sonarqube__nexus__traefik_ui_.md)

* **Attack Surface: Exposed Service Ports (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Traefik UI)**
    * **Description:** Services like Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and the Traefik UI expose web interfaces and potentially other network ports. If these are directly accessible without proper authentication or authorization, they become entry points for attackers.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The `docker-compose.yml` file defines port mappings that can expose these services to the host machine or the Docker network. While Traefik is intended to manage external access, misconfigurations or lack of proper authentication on the underlying services *within the Docker containers defined by the stack* can lead to vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** The Jenkins web interface on port 8080, as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`, is directly accessible without authentication due to misconfigured Traefik rules *within the stack's configuration* or missing security configurations within the Jenkins container *provided by the stack*. An attacker could access the Jenkins dashboard and potentially gain control of the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Impact:** Full control over the affected service, potential data breaches, code manipulation, and denial of service. For Jenkins, this could lead to complete compromise of the development and deployment pipeline. For Nexus, it could lead to the injection of malicious artifacts.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement strong authentication and authorization on all exposed services (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus) *within their respective container configurations*.** Do not rely solely on Traefik for security.
        * **Configure Traefik correctly with authentication middleware (e.g., BasicAuth, ForwardAuth) *as part of the stack's deployment and configuration* to protect access to the web UIs.**
        * **Review and restrict port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` to only expose necessary ports.** Use the principle of least privilege *when defining the stack's configuration*.
        * **Utilize Docker network policies to restrict access between containers and to the outside world *as part of the deployment environment for the stack*.**
        * **Regularly update the Docker images *used by the stack* and the services themselves to patch known vulnerabilities.**

## Attack Surface: [Credentials in Configuration Files or Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/credentials_in_configuration_files_or_environment_variables.md)

* **Attack Surface: Credentials in Configuration Files or Environment Variables**
    * **Description:** Storing sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys) directly in `docker-compose.yml` files or as environment variables within the Docker configuration makes them easily accessible if the host or containers are compromised.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The example `docker-compose.yml` *provided by the stack* might include initial setup credentials or environment variables that, if not properly managed *after deploying the stack*, can become long-term security risks.
    * **Example:** The initial administrator password for Jenkins is set as an environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` *of the tool stack*. If this file is accidentally committed to a public repository or if an attacker gains access to the Docker host where the stack is deployed, they can easily retrieve this password.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, data breaches, and the ability to manipulate the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid storing credentials directly in `docker-compose.yml` or environment variables *when deploying or customizing the stack*.**
        * **Utilize Docker Secrets or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely manage and inject credentials *when deploying the stack*.**
        * **Implement proper access controls on the Docker host and container configurations *where the stack is deployed* to prevent unauthorized access.**
        * **Rotate credentials regularly *for the services within the deployed stack*.**

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Jenkins Plugins](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_jenkins_plugins.md)

* **Attack Surface: Unsecured Jenkins Plugins**
    * **Description:** Jenkins' functionality is extended through plugins. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or steal sensitive information.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The stack relies on Jenkins and its plugin ecosystem. The selection of default plugins *included in the Jenkins image used by the stack* directly impacts the initial attack surface.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable version of a popular Jenkins plugin is included in the default Jenkins image used by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Groovy scripts on the Jenkins master, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Jenkins master, access to sensitive data, and manipulation of the CI/CD pipeline.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Carefully review the default plugins included in the Jenkins image *used by the stack*.**
        * **Only install necessary Jenkins plugins from trusted sources *after deploying the stack*.**
        * **Keep all Jenkins plugins up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities *within the deployed Jenkins instance*.**
        * **Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are unused or have known security issues *in the deployed Jenkins instance*.**
        * **Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Jenkins *after deployment* to limit plugin management to authorized users.**

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Docker Socket (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_docker_socket__if_applicable_.md)

* **Attack Surface: Exposed Docker Socket (if applicable)**
    * **Description:** If the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted into a container without proper restrictions, it grants the container root-level access to the Docker daemon, allowing for container escape and host system compromise.
    * **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** While not a default configuration of the base stack, customizations or additions to the `docker-compose.yml` or individual container configurations *after deploying the stack* could introduce this vulnerability.
    * **Example:** A user modifies the `docker-compose.yml` to mount the Docker socket into a Jenkins agent container *deployed as part of the stack*. A vulnerability in the agent software allows an attacker to execute commands that manipulate the Docker daemon, potentially taking over the entire host.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the Docker host system and all running containers.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers *when customizing or extending the stack* unless absolutely necessary.**
        * **If mounting is required, use specialized tools or techniques (e.g., `docker context`, limited API access) to restrict the container's capabilities *when configuring the stack or its extensions*.**
        * **Implement strong container security practices and vulnerability scanning *for all containers in the deployed stack*.**
