## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate CI-CD Pipeline Execution

This analysis focuses on the provided attack tree path within the context of an application utilizing the `docker-ci-tool-stack`. We will break down each stage, analyze the potential attack vectors, impacts, and provide concrete recommendations for mitigation.

**Context:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` provides a pre-configured environment for CI/CD using Docker, Jenkins, and potentially other tools. This analysis assumes a standard setup of this stack.

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

**Manipulate CI-CD Pipeline Execution [HIGH RISK START]**

This is the overarching goal of the attacker. Successfully manipulating the CI/CD pipeline allows them to inject malicious code, compromise deployments, and potentially gain persistent access to the application and its infrastructure. The "HIGH RISK START" designation is accurate, as compromising the pipeline can have cascading and severe consequences.

**1. Modify Jenkins Job Configuration [HIGH RISK]:**

Gaining unauthorized access to Jenkins and modifying job configurations is a critical step for attackers. This highlights the importance of securing the Jenkins instance itself.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromised Jenkins Credentials:** Weak passwords, leaked credentials, or successful phishing attacks targeting Jenkins administrators.
    * **Exploiting Jenkins Vulnerabilities:** Unpatched Jenkins instances may have known security flaws allowing remote code execution or unauthorized access.
    * **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access to Jenkins.
    * **Lack of Proper Access Controls:** Insufficiently granular permissions allowing users to modify jobs they shouldn't.

* **Impact:**
    * Complete control over the build and deployment process.
    * Ability to introduce persistent backdoors into the application.
    * Potential for data breaches by exfiltrating sensitive information during builds.
    * Reputational damage due to deploying compromised software.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Enforce strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Jenkins.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular audits of Jenkins configurations, user permissions, and installed plugins.
    * **Keep Jenkins and Plugins Up-to-Date:** Apply security patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities.
    * **Restrict Access to Jenkins Configuration:** Limit the number of users with permissions to modify job configurations.

    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Jenkins instance within a secure network segment.

    * **Inject malicious build steps [CRITICAL]:**

        This is a direct consequence of gaining access to job configurations. Attackers can insert arbitrary commands that will be executed on the Jenkins agent during the build process.

        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Adding malicious shell scripts:** Injecting commands directly into the "Execute shell" build step.
            * **Modifying existing build steps:** Altering existing scripts to include malicious logic.
            * **Installing and utilizing malicious plugins:** Leveraging vulnerable or intentionally malicious Jenkins plugins.
            * **Manipulating pipeline scripts (e.g., Jenkinsfile):** If using declarative or scripted pipelines, attackers can modify the pipeline definition.

        * **Impact:**
            * **Execute arbitrary commands during build process [CRITICAL]:** This is the immediate consequence. Attackers can:
                * **Steal secrets and credentials:** Access environment variables, configuration files, or other stored secrets.
                * **Download and execute malware:** Introduce backdoors or other malicious software onto the build agents.

            * **Implement Code Signing for Build Artifacts:** Verify the integrity of build outputs.
            * **Utilize Containerized Builds:** Leverage Docker to isolate build processes and limit the impact of malicious commands. The `docker-ci-tool-stack` inherently uses this, but proper container security is crucial.

    * **Modify deployment scripts:**

        Attackers can target the scripts responsible for deploying the built application to production or other environments.

        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Directly editing deployment scripts within Jenkins jobs.**
            * **Modifying deployment scripts stored in version control.**
            * **Compromising the deployment infrastructure itself (e.g., access to deployment servers).**

        * **Impact:**
            * **Deploy compromised application versions [CRITICAL]:** This is the ultimate goal of modifying deployment scripts. Attackers can deploy:
                * **Backdoored applications:** Applications containing persistent access mechanisms.
                * **Applications with malicious functionality:** Software designed to steal data or disrupt operations.
                * **Vulnerable application versions:** Reverting to older, insecure versions of the application.

        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Version Control for Deployment Scripts:** Store deployment scripts in a version control system and enforce code review processes.
            * **Immutable Infrastructure:** Utilize immutable infrastructure principles where deployment environments are replaced rather than modified in place.
            * **Automated Deployment Pipelines:** Implement robust and auditable deployment pipelines with clear approval steps.
            * **Secure Credential Management for Deployments:** Use secure methods for storing and accessing deployment credentials (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
            * **Deployment Environment Security:** Harden the target deployment environments and restrict access.
            * **Rollback Mechanisms:** Have well-defined and tested rollback procedures in case of compromised deployments.

**2. Trigger Builds with Malicious Code [HIGH RISK]:**

This attack path focuses on injecting vulnerabilities directly into the application's codebase, which are then incorporated into the built and deployed application through the normal CI/CD process.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromised Developer Accounts:** Gaining access to developer accounts through phishing, credential stuffing, or malware.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Version Control Systems (e.g., Git):**  While less common, vulnerabilities in Git or related tooling could be exploited.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising dependencies or third-party libraries used by the application.
    * **Insider Threats:** Malicious developers intentionally introducing vulnerabilities.

* **Impact:**
    * **Introduce vulnerabilities through code pushed to repositories monitored by Jenkins [CRITICAL]:**  This leads to the deployment of vulnerable applications, potentially allowing for:
        * **Data breaches:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to access sensitive data.
        * **Account takeover:** Allowing attackers to gain control of user accounts.
        * **Remote code execution:** Enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the application servers.
        * **Denial of Service:** Crashing or disrupting the application.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Development Practices:** Implement secure coding guidelines, regular security training for developers, and static/dynamic code analysis tools.
