# Threat Model Analysis for marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack

## Threat: [Malicious Image Injection](./threats/malicious_image_injection.md)

Description: Attackers replace legitimate Docker images provided or used by the `docker-ci-tool-stack` with malicious ones. This could happen by compromising the source repository, build pipeline, or image registry. These malicious images can contain backdoors or malware that compromises the CI/CD environment upon deployment.
Impact: Full compromise of the CI/CD environment managed by the tool stack, supply chain attacks by injecting malicious code into build artifacts, exfiltration of sensitive data from the CI/CD system.
Affected Component: Docker Images provided by `docker-ci-tool-stack`, Image Pull Process
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Thoroughly vet the source and maintainer of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` and its provided images.
*   Implement image signing and verification mechanisms to ensure image integrity before deployment.
*   Use a private and secure image registry with strict access controls.
*   Regularly audit the image build and deployment pipeline for any signs of compromise.
*   Implement monitoring for unexpected changes in image digests or sources.

## Threat: [Secrets Exposure in Configuration](./threats/secrets_exposure_in_configuration.md)

Description: Developers or users might inadvertently hardcode secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens) within the configuration files (e.g., Docker Compose files, environment variables) used to deploy the `docker-ci-tool-stack`. Attackers who gain access to these configuration files can extract these secrets.
Impact: Unauthorized access to services managed by the tool stack (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus), compromise of external systems that these services interact with, data breaches due to exposed credentials.
Affected Component: Configuration Files (Docker Compose, Environment Variables) used with `docker-ci-tool-stack`
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Never hardcode secrets in configuration files or code.
*   Utilize dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to securely store and manage secrets.
*   Inject secrets into containers at runtime using environment variables or volume mounts from secure secret stores.
*   Implement regular security audits of configuration files to identify and remove any accidentally exposed secrets.
*   Educate developers and users on secure secrets management practices.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Service Instances within Tool Stack](./threats/misconfigured_service_instances_within_tool_stack.md)

Description: The default configurations of services like Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus, as deployed by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`, might contain insecure settings (e.g., default credentials, weak authentication, exposed management interfaces). Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to these services.
Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive CI/CD data, code repositories, build artifacts, and the ability to manipulate CI/CD pipelines managed by the tool stack. Potential for remote code execution if vulnerabilities are present in misconfigured services.
Affected Component: Service Configurations (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus) within `docker-ci-tool-stack`
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Thoroughly review and harden the default configurations of all services deployed by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   Change all default passwords immediately upon deployment and enforce strong password policies.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all services.
*   Disable or restrict access to unnecessary management interfaces or features.
*   Regularly review and update service configurations to align with security best practices.

## Threat: [Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities in Tool Stack Services](./threats/pluginextension_vulnerabilities_in_tool_stack_services.md)

Description: Services like Jenkins and SonarQube within the `docker-ci-tool-stack` rely on plugins or extensions. These plugins can contain vulnerabilities. If the tool stack uses vulnerable or outdated plugins, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the service instances.
Impact: Compromise of Jenkins or SonarQube instances within the tool stack, potential for remote code execution on the CI/CD server, data breaches by accessing sensitive information managed by these services.
Affected Component: Service Plugins/Extensions (Jenkins Plugins, SonarQube Plugins) used in `docker-ci-tool-stack`
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Maintain a detailed inventory of all plugins and extensions used by services within the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   Regularly update all plugins and extensions to the latest secure versions.
*   Implement a plugin vetting process to assess the security of plugins before installation.
*   Utilize automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in installed plugins and extensions.
*   Minimize the number of plugins and extensions installed to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Base Images in Tool Stack Components](./threats/vulnerable_base_images_in_tool_stack_components.md)

Description: The Docker images provided by the `docker-ci-tool-stack` might be built upon vulnerable base images or contain outdated software packages with known vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the containers running the CI/CD components.
Impact: Compromise of CI/CD components (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus) deployed by the tool stack, potential for lateral movement within the CI/CD infrastructure, disruption of CI/CD pipelines due to exploited vulnerabilities.
Affected Component: Docker Images (Base Images) used in `docker-ci-tool-stack`
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Regularly update the base images used to build Docker images for the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   Implement automated vulnerability scanning of the Docker images provided and used by the tool stack during build and runtime.
*   Use minimal and hardened base images whenever possible to reduce the attack surface.
*   Establish a process to monitor for security updates for base images and rebuild images promptly when updates are available.
