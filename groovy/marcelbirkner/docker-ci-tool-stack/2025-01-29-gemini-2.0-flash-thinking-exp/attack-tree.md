## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise CI/CD Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_cicd_pipeline.md)

**1. Critical Node: Compromise CI/CD Pipeline**

*   **Description:** This is the root of the high-risk paths. Compromising the CI/CD pipeline, especially Jenkins, grants attackers significant control over the application deployment process and infrastructure.
*   **Attack Vectors (Leading to this node):**
    *   Exploiting Jenkins Instance
    *   Exploiting Insecure Pipeline Secrets Management

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Jenkins Instance](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_jenkins_instance.md)

**2. Critical Node: Compromise Jenkins Instance**

*   **Description:** Jenkins is the central orchestration tool in the docker-ci-tool-stack. Gaining control over Jenkins allows attackers to manipulate builds, deployments, and potentially access sensitive credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors (Leading to this node):**
    *   Exploiting Unsecured Jenkins Access

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Unsecured Jenkins Access](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_unsecured_jenkins_access.md)

**3. Critical Node: Exploit Unsecured Jenkins Access**

*   **Description:** This is the most direct and easily exploitable vulnerability in a Jenkins instance.  It arises from misconfigurations or negligence in securing Jenkins access.
*   **High-Risk Paths (Under this node):**
    *   **Default Credentials (admin:admin)**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Full Jenkins control)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   **No Authentication Enabled**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High (Full Jenkins control)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   **Publicly Accessible Jenkins UI without Authentication**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High (Full Jenkins control)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Pipeline Secrets Management](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_insecure_pipeline_secrets_management.md)

**4. High-Risk Path: Exploit Insecure Pipeline Secrets Management**

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of secrets within the CI/CD pipeline can directly expose sensitive credentials, leading to broader system compromise.
*   **High-Risk Paths (Under this node):**
    *   **Secrets Stored in Plain Text in Jenkins Configuration**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Exposure of sensitive credentials)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   **Secrets Exposed in Pipeline Logs**
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Exposure of sensitive credentials)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Unsecured Nexus Access](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_unsecured_nexus_access.md)

**5. Critical Node: Exploit Unsecured Nexus Access**

*   **Description:**  Similar to Jenkins and SonarQube, unsecured access to Nexus Repository Manager allows attackers to manipulate artifacts, potentially injecting malicious code into the application build process (supply chain attack).
*   **Attack Vectors (Leading to this node):**
    *   Default Credentials (admin:admin)
        *   Likelihood: Medium
        *   Impact: High (Nexus control, artifact manipulation)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   No Authentication Enabled
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High (Nexus control, artifact manipulation)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
    *   Publicly Accessible Nexus UI without Authentication
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High (Nexus control, artifact manipulation)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Supply Chain Attack via Tool-Stack Images](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_supply_chain_attack_via_tool-stack_images.md)

**6. High-Risk Path: Supply Chain Attack via Tool-Stack Images**

*   **Description:**  Compromising the tool-stack images themselves, either through malicious base images or injected dependencies, can lead to widespread and difficult-to-detect compromises.
*   **High-Risk Paths (Under this node):**
    *   **Use Maliciously Modified Base Images (if not from trusted sources)**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High (Backdoored tool-stack components, full compromise)
        *   Effort: Medium to High
        *   Skill Level: Medium to High
        *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult
    *   **Malicious Libraries injected into Tool-Stack containers during build process (if custom build)**
        *   Likelihood: Low
        *   Impact: High (Backdoored tool-stack components, full compromise)
        *   Effort: Medium to High
        *   Skill Level: Medium to High
        *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult
