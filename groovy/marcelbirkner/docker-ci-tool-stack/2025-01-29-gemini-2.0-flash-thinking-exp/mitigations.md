# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Base Images](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_base_images.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify the base images used in Dockerfiles for Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and any build tools within the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
    2.  Establish a process to monitor for updates to these base images (e.g., using watchtower, or subscribing to security mailing lists for the base image providers).
    3.  When updates are available, especially security updates, update the `FROM` instruction in your Dockerfiles to use the newer image tag.
    4.  Rebuild the Docker images using the updated base images.
    5.  Redeploy the updated images to your CI/CD environment.
    6.  Automate this process using CI/CD pipelines to ensure regular updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerable Base OS Packages - Severity: High
    *   Outdated Libraries in Base Images - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerable Base OS Packages: High reduction in risk. Significantly reduces the attack surface by patching known OS vulnerabilities.
    *   Outdated Libraries in Base Images: Medium reduction in risk. Addresses vulnerabilities in libraries used by applications within the containers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Container Management: High reduction in risk. Prevents unauthorized users from creating, starting, stopping, or deleting containers.
    *   Host System Compromise via Docker Socket: High reduction in risk. Protects the host system from being compromised through the Docker socket.
    *   Privilege Escalation: High reduction in risk. Limits the ability of attackers to escalate privileges by exploiting the Docker socket.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default file system permissions might provide some level of restriction, but more robust access control measures are likely missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementing stricter file system permissions for the Docker socket, avoiding network exposure, and considering socket activation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits for Containers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_for_containers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define resource limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O) in Docker Compose files or container runtime configurations for Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and build tool containers.
    2.  Use Docker resource management features like `cpu_limit`, `mem_limit`, `blkio_weight` to enforce these limits.
    3.  Monitor container resource usage to identify and adjust limits as needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion - Severity: Medium
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: Medium
    *   Noisy Neighbor Effect - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium reduction in risk. Prevents individual containers from consuming excessive resources and impacting other containers or the host system.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium reduction in risk. Mitigates DoS attacks caused by resource-hungry containers.
    *   Noisy Neighbor Effect: Medium reduction in risk. Improves the stability and performance of the CI/CD environment by preventing resource contention between containers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely missing. Resource limits are often not configured by default but are important for resource management and stability.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Defining and enforcing resource limits for all containers in the `docker-ci-tool-stack` using Docker resource management features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Docker Content Trust](./mitigation_strategies/enable_docker_content_trust.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Enable Docker Content Trust in your Docker environment by setting the `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` environment variable.
    2.  Ensure that Docker images are signed by trusted publishers or your organization's signing keys.
    3.  Configure your Docker daemon to verify image signatures before pulling and running containers.
    4.  Manage signing keys securely and restrict access to them.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Image Tampering - Severity: High
    *   Malicious Image Injection - Severity: High
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Images - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Image Tampering: High reduction in risk. Ensures that images pulled are exactly as they were signed and haven't been modified.
    *   Malicious Image Injection: High reduction in risk. Prevents the use of unauthorized or malicious images by verifying signatures.
    *   Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Images: High reduction in risk. Reduces the risk of supply chain attacks by verifying the authenticity and integrity of images.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely missing. Docker Content Trust is an advanced security feature not typically enabled by default.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Enabling Docker Content Trust in the Docker environment, configuring image signing processes, and enforcing signature verification.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for Web Interfaces](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_web_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Enable HTTPS for the web interfaces of Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus.
    2.  Configure each application to enforce HTTPS and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
    3.  Ensure that TLS certificates are properly configured and valid for each application.
    4.  For Jenkins, configure the Jenkins URL to use HTTPS in system settings.
    5.  For SonarQube and Nexus, configure HTTPS settings within their respective administration interfaces.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks - Severity: High
    *   Data Interception - Severity: High
    *   Credential Sniffing - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High reduction in risk. Encrypts communication, making it significantly harder for attackers to intercept and manipulate traffic.
    *   Data Interception: High reduction in risk. Protects sensitive data and credentials from being intercepted in transit to and from web interfaces.
    *   Credential Sniffing: High reduction in risk. Prevents attackers from sniffing user credentials transmitted over the network to web interfaces.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Might be partially implemented. HTTPS might be enabled, but proper enforcement and redirection might be missing for all web interfaces.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Enforcing HTTPS for all web interfaces of Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus, and ensuring proper TLS certificate configuration for each.
