### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Unsecured Nexus Access

**Critical Node: Exploit Unsecured Nexus Access**

**Description:** Unsecured access to Nexus Repository Manager, a critical component in the docker-ci-tool-stack for managing artifacts (like Docker images, libraries, and build outputs), allows attackers to manipulate these artifacts. This manipulation can lead to severe supply chain attacks, where malicious code is injected into the application build process, ultimately compromising the deployed application and potentially downstream systems.

**Attack Vectors Analysis:**

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Default Credentials (admin:admin)

*   **Description:** Nexus, like many applications, is often deployed with default administrative credentials (typically username: `admin`, password: `admin`). If these credentials are not changed during or immediately after installation, they become a readily exploitable vulnerability. Attackers can easily attempt to log in using these well-known defaults.

*   **Attack Process:**
    1.  **Discovery:** An attacker identifies a potential Nexus instance. This could be through various methods such as:
        *   **Shodan/Censys:** Using search engines for internet-connected devices to identify Nexus instances based on exposed ports or banners.
        *   **Network Scanning:** Internal network scanning to discover running Nexus instances.
        *   **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the target organization's infrastructure, potentially revealing the presence of a Nexus server.
    2.  **Access Attempt:** The attacker attempts to access the Nexus login page, typically found at `/nexus/` or `/repository/` on the Nexus server's IP address or hostname.
    3.  **Credential Brute-forcing (Default Credentials):** The attacker attempts to log in using the default username `admin` and password `admin`.
    4.  **Successful Login:** If the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker gains administrative access to the Nexus Repository Manager.

*   **Potential Impact:** Successful exploitation of default credentials grants the attacker full administrative control over the Nexus instance. This has severe consequences:
    *   **Artifact Manipulation:** Attackers can upload, modify, or delete artifacts stored in Nexus. This is the most critical impact, as they can inject malicious code into legitimate artifacts (e.g., replacing a clean library with a backdoored version).
    *   **Supply Chain Compromise:** By injecting malicious artifacts, attackers can compromise the entire application build and deployment pipeline. When the CI/CD system (Jenkins in this case) pulls artifacts from Nexus, it will unknowingly use the compromised versions, leading to the deployment of vulnerable applications.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Indirect):** While Nexus is primarily for artifacts, attackers might be able to access configuration files or logs that could contain sensitive information or provide further insights into the infrastructure.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could delete critical artifacts, disrupting the build and deployment process, leading to downtime and operational disruption.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Lateral Movement):** In some scenarios, compromised Nexus access could be used as a stepping stone to pivot to other systems within the network, depending on network segmentation and access controls.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Credential Change:** The most crucial mitigation is to **change the default `admin` password immediately upon Nexus installation.** Use a strong, unique password that adheres to password complexity requirements.
    *   **Password Policy Enforcement:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all Nexus users, including administrators. This should include password complexity, regular password rotation, and prevention of password reuse.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans to identify and remediate any instances where default credentials might still be in use or where password policies are not being enforced.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid granting administrative privileges unnecessarily. Create dedicated user accounts with specific roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

*   **Detection Methods:**
    *   **Account Login Monitoring:** Monitor Nexus access logs for successful login attempts using the username `admin`. While legitimate admin logins might occur, frequent or unexpected `admin` logins should be investigated.
    *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Nexus logs with a SIEM system to correlate login events and detect suspicious patterns, such as logins from unusual IP addresses or at unusual times.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  While less specific to default credentials, IDS/IPS can detect anomalous login activity or attempts to access administrative interfaces from unauthorized locations.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: No Authentication Enabled

*   **Description:** In a misconfigured Nexus instance, authentication might be completely disabled. This means that anyone who can access the Nexus UI (typically over HTTP/HTTPS) can gain full administrative access without providing any credentials. This is a severe misconfiguration and a critical vulnerability.

*   **Attack Process:**
    1.  **Discovery:** Similar to the default credentials scenario, attackers can discover publicly accessible Nexus instances through scanning or reconnaissance.
    2.  **Access Attempt:** The attacker attempts to access the Nexus UI.
    3.  **Authentication Bypass:** If authentication is disabled, the attacker is directly granted access to the Nexus administrative interface without any login prompt.
    4.  **Administrative Access:** The attacker gains immediate administrative control over Nexus.

*   **Potential Impact:** The potential impact is identical to exploiting default credentials, but often even more severe due to the complete lack of any access control. This includes:
    *   **Artifact Manipulation**
    *   **Supply Chain Compromise**
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Indirect)**
    *   **Denial of Service**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Lateral Movement)**

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** **Ensure that authentication is always enabled for Nexus.** This is a fundamental security requirement.
    *   **Authentication Mechanism Configuration:** Configure a robust authentication mechanism. Options include:
        *   **Local User Management:** Use Nexus's built-in user management with strong password policies.
        *   **LDAP/Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with existing directory services for centralized user management and authentication.
        *   **SAML/OAuth:** Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML or OAuth for enhanced security and user experience.
    *   **Regular Configuration Reviews:** Periodically review Nexus configuration to ensure authentication is properly enabled and configured. Automated configuration checks can be implemented.

*   **Detection Methods:**
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Configuration Checks:** Implement automated scripts or tools to regularly check if authentication is enabled for the Nexus instance.
    *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic to Nexus. If administrative actions are observed without prior authentication attempts in logs, it indicates a lack of authentication.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to specifically check for misconfigurations like disabled authentication.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Publicly Accessible Nexus UI without Authentication

*   **Description:** This attack vector is a specific instance of "No Authentication Enabled" where the Nexus UI is not only lacking authentication but is also directly accessible from the public internet. This significantly increases the risk as it makes the vulnerability easily discoverable and exploitable by a wider range of attackers.

*   **Attack Process:**
    1.  **Public Exposure Discovery:** Attackers use internet-wide scanning tools (like Shodan, Censys, or Masscan) to identify publicly accessible Nexus instances. This is often done by scanning for common Nexus ports (e.g., 8081, 8082) and identifying Nexus banners or login pages.
    2.  **Public Access Verification:** The attacker accesses the Nexus UI through a web browser using the publicly exposed IP address or hostname.
    3.  **Authentication Check:** The attacker observes if an authentication prompt is presented. If the UI is directly accessible without login, it confirms public accessibility without authentication.
    4.  **Administrative Access:** The attacker gains immediate administrative control.

*   **Potential Impact:** The potential impact remains the same as the previous vectors:
    *   **Artifact Manipulation**
    *   **Supply Chain Compromise**
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Indirect)**
    *   **Denial of Service**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Lateral Movement)**

    However, the **likelihood of exploitation is significantly higher** due to public accessibility.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Access Control:** **The primary mitigation is to ensure that the Nexus UI is NOT directly accessible from the public internet.** Implement network-level access controls using firewalls and network segmentation.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewalls to restrict access to the Nexus UI to only authorized networks (e.g., internal CI/CD network, VPN access for administrators).
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Place the Nexus server within a secure, isolated network segment, separate from public-facing networks.
    *   **VPN Access:** If remote access for administrators is required, implement a secure VPN solution. Administrators should connect to the VPN and then access Nexus through the internal network.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Less Preferred):** While not ideal for this scenario, a WAF could be used as a secondary layer of defense if public access is absolutely unavoidable (which is highly discouraged). However, network-level access control is the primary and recommended approach.
    *   **Regular Port Scanning and Vulnerability Assessments:** Conduct regular external port scans and vulnerability assessments to identify any publicly exposed services, including Nexus instances.

*   **Detection Methods:**
    *   **External Vulnerability Scanning:** Use external vulnerability scanners to periodically scan the organization's public IP ranges for exposed Nexus instances.
    *   **Network Monitoring (External):** Monitor network traffic at the perimeter firewall to detect unauthorized access attempts to Nexus from public IP addresses.
    *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Include checks for publicly accessible internal services like Nexus in regular security audits and penetration testing exercises.
