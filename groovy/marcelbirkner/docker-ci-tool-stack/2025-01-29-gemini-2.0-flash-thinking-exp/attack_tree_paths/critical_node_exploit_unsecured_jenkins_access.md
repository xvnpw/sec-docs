### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1 Critical Node: Exploit Unsecured Jenkins Access

**Description:** This critical node represents the exploitation of a Jenkins instance due to inadequate security measures protecting access to its administrative interface.  Unsecured access allows attackers to bypass intended security controls and gain unauthorized control over the Jenkins server and potentially the entire CI/CD pipeline. This is a foundational vulnerability, as Jenkins often holds sensitive credentials, build configurations, and access to deployment environments.

##### 4.1.1 Default Credentials (admin:admin)

###### 4.1.1.1 Description
This sub-path highlights the vulnerability arising from using default credentials, specifically the username `admin` and password `admin`, which are often pre-configured in Jenkins installations.  If these credentials are not changed during initial setup, they become a trivial entry point for attackers.

###### 4.1.1.2 Exploitation Steps
1.  **Discovery:** Identify a Jenkins instance that is publicly accessible or accessible from within a compromised network. This can be done through network scanning, search engines (e.g., Shodan), or by targeting known Jenkins ports (default 8080).
2.  **Login Attempt:** Navigate to the Jenkins login page (typically `/login` or `/`).
3.  **Credential Brute-forcing (or direct login):** Attempt to log in using the default username `admin` and password `admin`.  In many cases, this will be successful if the administrator has not changed the default credentials.
4.  **Access Granted:** Upon successful login, the attacker gains full administrative access to the Jenkins instance.

###### 4.1.1.3 Technical Details
Jenkins, by default, often creates an `admin` user with the password `admin` during initial setup.  This is intended as a temporary measure to allow initial configuration. However, if administrators fail to change these credentials, it becomes a significant security flaw.  The `docker-ci-tool-stack`, while aiming for ease of use, might inadvertently contribute to this if users are not explicitly guided to change default credentials during setup.

###### 4.1.1.4 Impact Breakdown
*   **Full Jenkins Control:**  Administrative access grants complete control over the Jenkins instance.
*   **Code Manipulation:** Attackers can modify build jobs to inject malicious code into software builds, leading to supply chain attacks.
*   **Credential Theft:** Jenkins often stores sensitive credentials for accessing repositories, deployment environments, and other systems. Attackers can steal these credentials.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can access build logs, artifacts, and other sensitive data stored within Jenkins.
*   **Infrastructure Compromise:**  Through Jenkins, attackers can potentially gain access to connected infrastructure, including servers, databases, and cloud environments.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can disrupt CI/CD pipelines, causing delays and impacting software delivery.

###### 4.1.1.5 Mitigation Strategies
*   **Immediately Change Default Credentials:**  The most critical mitigation is to change the default `admin` password immediately upon Jenkins installation. Use a strong, unique password.
*   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Implement password complexity requirements and regular password rotation policies for all Jenkins users.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid granting administrative privileges unnecessarily. Assign users roles with only the permissions they require.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically audit Jenkins user accounts and permissions to ensure they are appropriate and up-to-date.
*   **Configuration Management:**  Use configuration management tools to automate Jenkins setup and ensure consistent security configurations, including password changes.

###### 4.1.1.6 Detection Methods
*   **Login Auditing:** Enable and monitor Jenkins login logs for successful logins using the `admin` username, especially from unusual IP addresses.
*   **Account Monitoring:**  Monitor for any activity performed by the `admin` user after the initial setup phase, as legitimate administrative tasks should ideally be performed by dedicated administrator accounts with strong passwords.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanners that can check for default credentials on Jenkins instances.

##### 4.1.2 No Authentication Enabled

###### 4.1.2.1 Description
This sub-path describes the most severe misconfiguration: disabling authentication entirely on the Jenkins instance.  In this scenario, anyone who can access the Jenkins URL can access the entire Jenkins interface without any login required.

###### 4.1.2.2 Exploitation Steps
1.  **Discovery:** Identify a Jenkins instance that is publicly accessible or accessible from within a compromised network.
2.  **Access Jenkins UI:** Navigate to the Jenkins URL.
3.  **Unrestricted Access:**  The attacker is immediately granted full access to the Jenkins UI without any authentication prompt.

###### 4.1.2.3 Technical Details
Jenkins allows administrators to disable security entirely, typically through the "Enable Security" checkbox in the global security configuration.  Disabling security removes all authentication and authorization checks, making the entire Jenkins instance publicly accessible and controllable. This is an extremely dangerous configuration and should never be used in a production or internet-facing environment.  It's highly unlikely the `docker-ci-tool-stack` would default to this, but misconfiguration is always possible.

###### 4.1.2.4 Impact Breakdown
The impact of no authentication is identical to that of exploiting default credentials, but potentially even more severe due to the complete lack of any security barrier.  An attacker gains immediate and unrestricted administrative control with no effort.

*   **Full Jenkins Control:**  Complete administrative access.
*   **Code Manipulation:**  Injection of malicious code into builds.
*   **Credential Theft:** Access to stored credentials.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Access to build logs and artifacts.
*   **Infrastructure Compromise:** Potential access to connected infrastructure.
*   **Denial of Service:** Disruption of CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Significant damage to the organization's reputation due to a blatant security oversight.

###### 4.1.2.5 Mitigation Strategies
*   **Enable Authentication:**  Ensure that authentication is enabled in Jenkins global security settings.  Choose a robust security realm (e.g., Jenkins' own user database, LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, OAuth 2.0).
*   **Authorization Configuration:**  Configure authorization to control what authenticated users can access and do within Jenkins. Use role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permissions.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  If possible, restrict access to the Jenkins instance to only authorized networks or IP ranges using firewalls or network access control lists (ACLs).  Consider placing Jenkins behind a VPN.
*   **Regular Security Reviews:**  Periodically review Jenkins security configuration to ensure authentication is enabled and properly configured.

###### 4.1.2.6 Detection Methods
*   **External Security Scans:**  Use external security scanners to check if the Jenkins instance is publicly accessible without authentication.
*   **Manual Verification:**  Attempt to access the Jenkins URL from an external network or incognito browser to verify if authentication is required.
*   **Configuration Audits:**  Regularly audit Jenkins global security configuration to confirm that "Enable Security" is checked and a valid security realm is configured.

##### 4.1.3 Publicly Accessible Jenkins UI without Authentication

###### 4.1.3.1 Description
This sub-path is a variation of "No Authentication Enabled," but specifically highlights the scenario where the Jenkins UI is exposed to the public internet without any authentication.  While authentication *might* be enabled internally, if the UI is accessible from the internet without requiring login, it's effectively unsecured from an external attacker's perspective.

###### 4.1.3.2 Exploitation Steps
1.  **Discovery:** Identify a Jenkins instance that is publicly accessible on the internet. This is easily done through search engines like Shodan or Censys by searching for Jenkins default ports (8080, 443 if SSL is misconfigured).
2.  **Access Jenkins UI:** Navigate to the publicly accessible Jenkins URL.
3.  **Unrestricted Access (or bypassed authentication):** If no authentication is enforced for public access, the attacker gains immediate access. Even if authentication is enabled *internally*, if it's not enforced for *public* access, the attacker bypasses security.

###### 4.1.3.3 Technical Details
This vulnerability often arises from misconfigurations in network firewalls, reverse proxies, or load balancers in front of the Jenkins instance.  Even if Jenkins itself is configured with authentication, if the network infrastructure allows direct public access to the Jenkins port without any intermediary authentication layer, the Jenkins security is effectively bypassed from the internet.  The `docker-ci-tool-stack` setup should be carefully reviewed to ensure it doesn't inadvertently expose Jenkins publicly without proper access controls.

###### 4.1.3.4 Impact Breakdown
The impact is similar to "No Authentication Enabled" and "Default Credentials," resulting in full Jenkins control and the associated risks.  The key difference here is the emphasis on *public accessibility* as the root cause.

*   **Full Jenkins Control:**  Complete administrative access from the internet.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Potential for remote code execution on the Jenkins server and connected infrastructure.
*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data to the public internet.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromise of software builds and distribution.
*   **Widespread Impact:**  Public accessibility increases the likelihood of widespread exploitation by automated scanners and malicious actors.

###### 4.1.3.5 Mitigation Strategies
*   **Network Security Hardening:**  Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to the Jenkins instance. Only allow access from trusted networks or IP ranges.
*   **Reverse Proxy with Authentication:**  Place a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of Jenkins and configure it to enforce authentication (e.g., basic authentication, OAuth 2.0) before forwarding requests to Jenkins.
*   **VPN Access:**  Require users to connect to a VPN to access the Jenkins UI, ensuring that only authorized users can reach it.
*   **Regular Port Scanning:**  Periodically scan public IP addresses associated with the organization to identify any unintentionally exposed Jenkins ports.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Jenkins logs with a SIEM system to monitor for suspicious access attempts from public IP addresses.

###### 4.1.3.6 Detection Methods
*   **Public Internet Scanners (Shodan, Censys):**  Use these search engines to identify publicly exposed Jenkins instances associated with the organization's IP ranges.
*   **External Port Scans:**  Conduct external port scans from the internet to verify if Jenkins ports (8080, 443) are open and accessible without authentication.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  Deploy a WAF in front of Jenkins to detect and block unauthorized access attempts from the public internet.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Implement IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity targeting the Jenkins instance.
