## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `sysbox` Runtime](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__sysbox__runtime.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Install `sysbox`:** Follow the official `sysbox` installation instructions (https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox/blob/master/docs/user-guide/install.md) for your specific host operating system. This typically involves installing a package and configuring the Docker daemon to use `sysbox` as a runtime.
2.  **Configure Docker Daemon:** Modify the Docker daemon configuration (usually `/etc/docker/daemon.json`) to include `sysbox` as a runtime.  An example configuration snippet:
    ```json
    {
      "runtimes": {
        "sysbox-runc": {
          "path": "/usr/local/sbin/sysbox-runc"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  **Update CI Configuration:**  In your CI configuration (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` if using Docker Compose, or your CI platform's configuration), specify the `sysbox-runc` runtime for the *containers that need to run Docker inside*. This is the crucial step that directly addresses the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s core functionality. Example (Docker Compose):
    ```yaml
    services:
      my-ci-service:  # This is the service that uses docker-ci-tool-stack
        image: my-ci-image
        runtime: sysbox-runc
        # ... other configurations ...
    ```
4.  **Test:** Thoroughly test your CI pipeline with `sysbox` to ensure compatibility and that all required functionality (specifically, the ability to build and run Docker images within the CI container) works as expected.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Privileged Container Escape (Critical):**  Directly addresses the primary risk of `docker-ci-tool-stack` â€“ the potential for a compromised container to escape and gain root access to the host system via the Docker daemon.  DinD without `sysbox` makes this a very high-risk scenario.
*   **Host Resource Abuse (High):** Reduces the risk of a compromised container directly manipulating host resources due to the enhanced isolation provided by `sysbox`. This is a direct consequence of the privileged access inherent in standard DinD.
*   **Docker Daemon Compromise (Critical):** Eliminates the direct exposure of the host's Docker daemon to the CI containers, preventing attackers from controlling other containers or the host itself. This is the core vulnerability of using `docker-ci-tool-stack` without `sysbox`.

**Impact:**
*   **Privileged Container Escape:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
*   **Host Resource Abuse:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
*   **Docker Daemon Compromise:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.

**Currently Implemented:** [**PLACEHOLDER: Specify where this is implemented.  Examples:**]
*   "Implemented in the `development` branch, `docker-compose.yml` file, for all CI services that use `docker-ci-tool-stack`."
*   "Partially implemented; `sysbox` is installed, but not yet configured in the CI pipeline for the services using `docker-ci-tool-stack`."
*   "Not implemented."

**Missing Implementation:** [**PLACEHOLDER: Specify where this is missing. Examples:**]
*   "Missing implementation in the `production` environment. Needs to be rolled out after testing in `staging`."
*   "Missing configuration in the `Jenkinsfile` for some specific jobs that utilize `docker-ci-tool-stack`."
*   "Fully implemented."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Docker Daemon Access (if DinD is unavoidable)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_docker_daemon_access__if_dind_is_unavoidable_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **TLS Authentication:** Configure the Docker daemon to require TLS authentication.  This involves generating server and client certificates.
2.  **Client Certificates:**  Create client certificates specifically for the CI container that needs to access the Docker daemon.
3.  **Docker Daemon Configuration:** Modify the Docker daemon configuration (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) to enable TLS and specify the paths to the server certificate, key, and CA certificate.
4.  **CI Container Configuration:**  Configure the CI container to use the client certificate and key when connecting to the Docker daemon.  This typically involves setting environment variables like `DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`, `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`.
5.  **Dedicated Docker Daemon (Optional):**  Consider running a separate, isolated Docker daemon specifically for CI, distinct from any production Docker daemons. This further limits the impact of a compromise. This daemon should still use TLS.
6. **Network Isolation:** Ensure this dedicated Docker daemon (or the main daemon if a dedicated one isn't used) is only accessible from the CI network.

**This mitigation is *only* relevant if `sysbox` is *not* used.  If `sysbox` is used, this mitigation is unnecessary and redundant.**

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Docker Daemon Compromise (High):**  Reduces (but does *not* eliminate) the risk of unauthorized access to the Docker daemon.  Without TLS, *any* container with access to the Docker socket could control the host.
*   **Privileged Container Escape (High):** Indirectly reduces the risk by making it harder to compromise the Docker daemon, which is the pathway to container escape in traditional DinD.

**Impact:**
*   **Docker Daemon Compromise:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (still a significant risk).
*   **Privileged Container Escape:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (still a significant risk).

**Currently Implemented:** [**PLACEHOLDER: Specify where this is implemented.**]
*   "Implemented with TLS authentication and a dedicated Docker daemon for CI."
*   "Partially implemented; TLS is enabled, but client certificates are not consistently used."
*   "Not implemented (relying on `sysbox` instead)."

**Missing Implementation:** [**PLACEHOLDER: Specify where this is missing.**]
*   "Missing a dedicated Docker daemon for CI; using the host's main daemon."
*   "Missing consistent use of client certificates across all CI jobs."
*   "Fully implemented." (Or "Not applicable; using `sysbox`.")
