## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Build Server (Directly) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_build_server__directly___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker directly targets the build server, attempting to gain unauthorized access through various means. This is a high-risk path because successful compromise grants complete control over the build process.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Vulnerability in Build Server OS/Software [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_vulnerability_in_build_server_ossoftware__hr_.md)

    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  The likelihood depends on the presence of unpatched, known vulnerabilities (e.g., in the operating system, web server, or other installed software) or the existence of zero-day exploits.  Regular patching reduces this risk, but zero-days are always a possibility.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, modify build scripts, steal secrets, and deploy malicious artifacts.
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High.  Exploiting known vulnerabilities is easier if public exploits are available.  Developing or acquiring a zero-day exploit requires significant effort and expertise.
    *   **Skill Level:** High.  Requires a deep understanding of operating systems, network protocols, and vulnerability exploitation techniques.  May involve reverse engineering and exploit development.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions *might* detect exploit attempts, but sophisticated attackers can use evasion techniques.  Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning are crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing SSH/RDP [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_brute-forcecredential_stuffing_sshrdp__hr_.md)

    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Success depends on the strength of passwords and the presence of account lockout policies.  Weak, reused, or default credentials significantly increase the likelihood.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Successful authentication grants the attacker direct access to the build server with the privileges of the compromised account.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Automated tools for brute-forcing and credential stuffing are readily available.  The effort increases with stronger passwords and rate limiting.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.  Basic scripting skills can be used to automate attacks.  Knowledge of common username/password combinations is helpful.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Failed login attempts are typically logged, and intrusion detection systems can be configured to detect brute-force patterns.  However, slow, distributed attacks can be harder to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Docker Host (Indirectly via Container) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_docker_host__indirectly_via_container___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities within a container to gain access to the underlying host operating system. This is high-risk because it bypasses many of the security controls that might be in place on the host directly.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Mount Sensitive Host Directories into Container [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_mount_sensitive_host_directories_into_container__hr_.md)

    *   **Likelihood:** Medium. This relies on misconfiguration. Developers might inadvertently mount sensitive directories (like `/`, `/etc`, `/var/run/docker.sock`) into containers for convenience, creating a direct path for attackers.
    *   **Impact:** High.  If a container has access to sensitive host directories, an attacker can read or modify system files, potentially gaining root access to the host.  Mounting the Docker socket is particularly dangerous, as it allows the attacker to control the Docker daemon and all containers.
    *   **Effort:** Low.  Once a container with a sensitive mount is compromised, exploiting the mount is trivial.  The attacker simply needs to navigate the file system.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low.  Requires basic understanding of Docker volumes and file permissions.  No advanced exploitation techniques are needed.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Requires careful review of Docker configurations (docker-compose files, Kubernetes manifests, etc.) and monitoring of container file system activity.  Security tools that analyze container configurations can help.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise CI/CD Tool Configuration (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_cicd_tool_configuration__e_g___jenkins__gitlab_ci___hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the CI/CD tool's configuration, allowing them to modify build pipelines, inject malicious code, or steal credentials. This is a critical node because it's the central point of control for the entire CI/CD process.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Weak Credentials/Authentication [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_weak_credentialsauthentication__hr_.md)

    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Many organizations still use weak or default passwords, and users often reuse passwords across multiple services.  Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly increases the risk.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Gaining access to the CI/CD tool allows the attacker to control the entire build and deployment process.
    *   **Effort:** Low.  Password guessing, brute-forcing, and credential stuffing attacks are relatively easy to execute.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low.  Basic hacking tools and techniques are sufficient.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Failed login attempts and unusual login patterns can be detected, but attackers may use stolen credentials that appear legitimate.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Social Engineering/Phishing [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_social_engineeringphishing__hr_.md)

    *   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Humans are often the weakest link in security.  Well-crafted phishing emails or social engineering attacks can trick users into revealing their credentials or installing malware.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Successful phishing can lead to credential theft, allowing the attacker to access the CI/CD tool or other sensitive systems.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Creating convincing phishing emails or social engineering scenarios can be relatively easy.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.  Requires understanding of social engineering techniques and the ability to craft believable messages.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  User awareness training and email security filters can help, but sophisticated phishing attacks can be difficult to detect.  Monitoring for unusual user activity is important.
