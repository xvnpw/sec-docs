Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the context of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` project.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing SSH/RDP

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   **Quantify the risk:**  Move beyond the qualitative "Medium" likelihood and "High" impact to a more concrete understanding of the *actual* risk to *this specific* `docker-ci-tool-stack` deployment.  This involves considering the specific configuration and usage patterns.
*   **Identify specific vulnerabilities:**  Determine which aspects of a typical `docker-ci-tool-stack` setup make it more or less susceptible to this attack.
*   **Propose concrete mitigation strategies:**  Go beyond general recommendations and provide actionable steps tailored to the `docker-ci-tool-stack` environment.
*   **Prioritize remediation efforts:**  Based on the risk assessment, determine the urgency and resources that should be allocated to addressing this threat.
*   **Enhance detection capabilities:** Improve the ability to identify and respond to brute-force/credential stuffing attempts *before* they succeed.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack vector of brute-force and credential stuffing attacks targeting SSH and RDP services *within the context of a `docker-ci-tool-stack` deployment*.  This includes:

*   **Target Hosts:**  The primary target is the host machine running the Docker daemon and the CI/CD pipeline components.  This could be a developer's workstation, a dedicated build server, or a cloud-based virtual machine.  We also consider any containers *within* the stack that might expose SSH/RDP (though this is less common and generally discouraged).
*   **Attack Surface:**  We are concerned with externally exposed SSH/RDP ports.  This includes any port forwarding configured on the host or through network devices (routers, firewalls).  We also consider misconfigured Docker networking that might unintentionally expose these services.
*   **`docker-ci-tool-stack` Specifics:**  We will analyze how the default configurations, recommended practices, and common usage patterns of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` influence the vulnerability to this attack.  This includes examining the provided Dockerfiles, scripts, and documentation.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD tools themselves, social engineering).  It also does not cover attacks targeting other services running on the host *unless* those services are directly related to the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Refine the threat model specifically for `docker-ci-tool-stack`.  This involves:
    *   **Identifying Assets:**  Determine the valuable assets at risk (e.g., source code, build artifacts, deployment credentials, access to other systems).
    *   **Identifying Threat Actors:**  Consider the likely attackers (e.g., opportunistic attackers, competitors, malicious insiders).
    *   **Refining Attack Scenarios:**  Develop specific scenarios for how brute-force/credential stuffing could be used against the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.

2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine the `docker-ci-tool-stack` for weaknesses that could be exploited:
    *   **Default Configurations:**  Analyze the default SSH/RDP configurations in common base images used by the stack (e.g., are default accounts disabled, are strong password policies enforced?).
    *   **Common Misconfigurations:**  Identify common mistakes users might make that increase vulnerability (e.g., exposing SSH/RDP to the public internet without proper firewall rules, using weak or default passwords).
    *   **Docker Networking:**  Analyze how Docker networking is typically configured in the `docker-ci-tool-stack` and identify potential misconfigurations that could expose SSH/RDP.
    *   **Lack of Rate Limiting/Account Lockout:**  Determine if the default configurations include mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks (e.g., `fail2ban`, account lockout policies).

3.  **Risk Assessment:**  Combine the threat modeling and vulnerability analysis to quantify the risk:
    *   **Likelihood Estimation:**  Based on the identified vulnerabilities and threat actor capabilities, estimate the *actual* likelihood of a successful attack.  This will consider factors like the exposure of SSH/RDP, the strength of passwords, and the presence of mitigation measures.
    *   **Impact Assessment:**  Refine the impact assessment based on the specific assets at risk and the potential consequences of a successful attack (e.g., data breaches, system compromise, disruption of CI/CD pipeline).
    *   **Risk Matrix:**  Use a risk matrix to combine likelihood and impact into an overall risk rating (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical).

4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies:
    *   **Technical Controls:**  Recommend specific technical configurations and tools to reduce vulnerability (e.g., SSH key authentication, `fail2ban`, firewall rules, VPNs).
    *   **Procedural Controls:**  Recommend best practices for managing user accounts and passwords (e.g., strong password policies, regular password changes, multi-factor authentication).
    *   **Monitoring and Detection:**  Recommend specific logging and monitoring configurations to detect and respond to brute-force attempts (e.g., monitoring failed login attempts, using intrusion detection systems).

5.  **Prioritization:**  Prioritize the mitigation recommendations based on their effectiveness, cost, and ease of implementation.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

Now, let's dive into the specific analysis of the attack path:

**4.1 Threat Modeling (Refined for `docker-ci-tool-stack`)**

*   **Assets:**
    *   Source code repositories (potentially containing sensitive information or intellectual property).
    *   Build artifacts (binaries, libraries, etc.).
    *   Deployment credentials (access keys for cloud providers, SSH keys for deployment servers).
    *   Access to other systems (if the compromised host is used as a jump box or has access to other network resources).
    *   The integrity of the CI/CD pipeline itself (an attacker could inject malicious code into the build process).
    *   Docker images and containers.

*   **Threat Actors:**
    *   **Opportunistic attackers:**  Scanning the internet for exposed SSH/RDP ports and attempting to brute-force them with common credentials.
    *   **Targeted attackers:**  Specifically targeting the organization or individual using the `docker-ci-tool-stack`, possibly with knowledge of their infrastructure.
    *   **Malicious insiders:**  Developers or other personnel with legitimate access to the system who might abuse their privileges or attempt to escalate them.  (Less likely for *this specific* attack path, but still a consideration).

*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Scenario 1: Opportunistic Attack:** An attacker scans the internet for exposed SSH port 22 and finds the `docker-ci-tool-stack` host.  They use a tool like `hydra` to attempt to brute-force the SSH login using a list of common usernames and passwords.
    *   **Scenario 2: Targeted Attack:** An attacker researches the organization and identifies the IP address of their build server.  They obtain a list of employee usernames (e.g., from LinkedIn) and attempt to brute-force their SSH accounts using common password patterns or leaked credentials.
    *   **Scenario 3: Credential Stuffing:** An attacker obtains a database of leaked usernames and passwords from a previous data breach.  They use a tool to automatically try these credentials against the SSH/RDP service on the `docker-ci-tool-stack` host.

**4.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Specific to `docker-ci-tool-stack`)**

*   **Default Configurations:**
    *   The `docker-ci-tool-stack` itself doesn't *mandate* exposing SSH/RDP.  However, it's common for developers to enable SSH for remote access to the host machine.
    *   The base images used in the `docker-ci-tool-stack` (e.g., Alpine Linux, Ubuntu) typically have reasonable default SSH configurations (e.g., disabling root login, requiring strong passwords).  However, these configurations can be overridden by the user.
    *   RDP is less common in a Linux-based CI/CD environment, but it's possible that a user might enable it for remote desktop access.

*   **Common Misconfigurations:**
    *   **Exposing SSH/RDP to the Public Internet:**  The most significant vulnerability is exposing SSH/RDP directly to the public internet without proper firewall rules or a VPN.  This makes the host a prime target for automated brute-force attacks.
    *   **Using Weak or Default Passwords:**  Using weak, easily guessable passwords, or failing to change default passwords on the host or within containers, significantly increases the risk.
    *   **Disabling or Misconfiguring `fail2ban` (or similar):**  `fail2ban` is a common tool for preventing brute-force attacks by blocking IP addresses after multiple failed login attempts.  If it's not installed, disabled, or misconfigured, the host is much more vulnerable.
    *   **Not using SSH Key Authentication:**  Relying solely on password authentication for SSH is less secure than using SSH key pairs.
    *   **Running SSH/RDP on Non-Standard Ports (without other protections):**  While changing the default port can provide some *obscurity*, it's not a strong security measure on its own.  Attackers can easily scan for open ports.

*   **Docker Networking:**
    *   **Default Bridge Network:**  If containers are running on the default Docker bridge network and the host's SSH/RDP port is exposed, the containers are also indirectly exposed.
    *   **Host Networking:**  Using `--net=host` for containers directly exposes the host's network interfaces, including SSH/RDP, to the container.  This is generally discouraged for security reasons.
    *   **Misconfigured Port Mappings:**  Incorrectly configured port mappings (e.g., `docker run -p 22:22 ...`) can unintentionally expose SSH/RDP to the outside world.

*  **Lack of Rate Limiting/Account Lockout:**
    * Default OS may not have this configured.
    * Containers may not have this configured.

**4.3 Risk Assessment**

*   **Likelihood Estimation:**
    *   If SSH/RDP is exposed to the public internet *and* weak passwords are used *and* `fail2ban` is not configured, the likelihood of a successful attack is **High** to **Critical**.
    *   If SSH/RDP is exposed, but strong passwords are used and `fail2ban` is properly configured, the likelihood is **Medium**.
    *   If SSH/RDP is *not* exposed to the public internet (e.g., only accessible via a VPN or internal network), the likelihood is **Low**.
    *   If SSH key authentication is used *instead of* password authentication, the likelihood is significantly reduced to **Low**, even if the port is exposed.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   The impact of a successful attack is consistently **High** to **Critical** due to the potential for:
        *   Compromise of source code and build artifacts.
        *   Injection of malicious code into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Access to sensitive deployment credentials.
        *   Lateral movement to other systems.
        *   Data breaches and reputational damage.

*   **Risk Matrix:**

    | Likelihood \ Impact | High      | Critical  |
    |----------------------|-----------|-----------|
    | Low                  | Medium    | High      |
    | Medium               | High      | Critical  |
    | High                 | Critical  | Critical  |
    | Critical             | Critical  | Critical  |

    Based on this matrix, most scenarios fall into the **High** or **Critical** risk categories.

**4.4 Mitigation Recommendations**

*   **Technical Controls:**
    1.  **Disable Password Authentication for SSH:**  *Mandatory*.  Configure SSH to only allow key-based authentication.  This eliminates the possibility of brute-force password attacks.  Generate strong SSH key pairs (e.g., using `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`) and securely manage the private keys.
    2.  **Use a VPN or SSH Tunneling:**  *Highly Recommended*.  Do *not* expose SSH/RDP directly to the public internet.  Instead, require users to connect via a VPN or use SSH tunneling to access the host.
    3.  **Implement `fail2ban` (or similar):**  *Highly Recommended*.  Install and configure `fail2ban` to automatically block IP addresses after a specified number of failed login attempts.  Ensure the `fail2ban` configuration is appropriate for the expected traffic patterns.  Consider using a more advanced intrusion prevention system (IPS) if resources allow.
    4.  **Firewall Rules:**  *Mandatory*.  Implement strict firewall rules (e.g., using `ufw` or `iptables`) to only allow SSH/RDP traffic from trusted IP addresses or networks.  If a VPN is used, the firewall should only allow SSH/RDP connections from the VPN's IP address range.
    5.  **Docker Network Security:**
        *   Avoid using `--net=host`.
        *   Use custom Docker networks to isolate containers from each other and from the host.
        *   Carefully review and minimize port mappings (`-p`).  Only expose the necessary ports.
        *   Consider using a Docker network firewall (e.g., `weaveworks/net-plugin`) for more granular control over container network traffic.
    6.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** *Highly Recommended*. Implement MFA for SSH access, even with key-based authentication. This adds an extra layer of security. Tools like Google Authenticator or Duo Security can be integrated with SSH.
    7. **Regular security audits of the host and containers:** Use vulnerability scanners.

*   **Procedural Controls:**
    1.  **Strong Password Policy:**  *Mandatory*.  Enforce a strong password policy for all user accounts on the host and within containers (if password authentication is unavoidable for some reason).  This policy should require long, complex passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    2.  **Regular Password Changes:**  *Recommended*.  Require users to change their passwords periodically (e.g., every 90 days).
    3.  **User Account Management:**
        *   Disable default accounts (e.g., `root`).
        *   Create separate user accounts with limited privileges for each user.
        *   Regularly review and remove unused user accounts.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege: grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
    4.  **Security Awareness Training:**  *Recommended*.  Educate developers and other personnel about the risks of brute-force/credential stuffing attacks and the importance of following security best practices.

*   **Monitoring and Detection:**
    1.  **Log Monitoring:**  *Mandatory*.  Configure SSH/RDP to log all login attempts (successful and failed).  Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity.  Consider using a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to aggregate and analyze logs from multiple sources.
    2.  **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  *Recommended*.  Implement an IDS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) to detect and alert on brute-force attack patterns.  Configure the IDS to monitor SSH/RDP traffic and trigger alerts based on predefined rules.
    3.  **Automated Alerting:**  *Highly Recommended*.  Configure automated alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.
    4.  **Regular Security Audits:** *Recommended*. Conduct regular security audits of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` environment to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**4.5 Prioritization**

The following prioritization is based on a combination of effectiveness, cost, and ease of implementation:

1.  **Immediate (Critical):**
    *   Disable password authentication for SSH and use key-based authentication.
    *   Implement strict firewall rules.
    *   Enforce a strong password policy.
    *   Implement `fail2ban` (or similar).
    *   Configure log monitoring and automated alerting.

2.  **High Priority:**
    *   Implement a VPN or SSH tunneling.
    *   Implement MFA for SSH access.
    *   Implement an IDS.
    *   Review and secure Docker network configurations.

3.  **Medium Priority:**
    *   Regular password changes.
    *   Security awareness training.
    *   Regular security audits.

### 5. Conclusion

Brute-force and credential stuffing attacks against SSH/RDP represent a significant threat to the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.  However, by implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the risk can be significantly reduced.  The most critical steps are to disable password authentication for SSH, use a VPN or SSH tunneling, implement strict firewall rules, and use `fail2ban`.  Regular monitoring and security audits are also essential for maintaining a secure environment.  By prioritizing these actions, the development team can protect their CI/CD pipeline and valuable assets from this common attack vector.
