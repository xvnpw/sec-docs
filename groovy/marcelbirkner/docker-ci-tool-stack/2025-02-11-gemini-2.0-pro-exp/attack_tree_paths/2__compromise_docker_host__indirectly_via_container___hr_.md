# Deep Analysis: Compromise Docker Host (Indirectly via Container)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, analyze, and propose mitigations for vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to escape a Docker container running within the `docker-ci-tool-stack` environment and gain unauthorized access to the underlying host operating system.  This analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to enhance the security posture of the system.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack vector described as "Compromise Docker Host (Indirectly via Container)".  The scope includes:

*   **Containers within `docker-ci-tool-stack`:**  We will examine the Dockerfiles, configurations, and runtime environments of the containers defined in the `docker-ci-tool-stack` project.  This includes, but is not limited to, containers for Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and any other tools included in the stack.
*   **Container Escape Vulnerabilities:** We will focus on known and potential vulnerabilities that could lead to container escape, including kernel exploits, misconfigurations, and shared resource vulnerabilities.
*   **Host System Interaction:** We will consider how the containers interact with the host system, including shared volumes, network configurations, and any other points of contact.
*   **Exclusion:** This analysis *does not* cover direct attacks on the host operating system (e.g., SSH brute-forcing).  It is solely focused on attacks originating *from within* a compromised container.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Static Analysis of Dockerfiles and Configuration:** We will review the Dockerfiles and related configuration files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`) for potential security weaknesses. This includes identifying:
    *   Use of outdated or vulnerable base images.
    *   Unnecessary privileges granted to containers (e.g., running as root).
    *   Exposed sensitive information (e.g., hardcoded credentials).
    *   Misconfigured network settings.
    *   Improperly configured shared volumes.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) related to:
    *   Docker Engine itself.
    *   The specific base images used in the `docker-ci-tool-stack` containers.
    *   The applications running within the containers (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, etc.).
*   **Best Practices Review:** We will compare the `docker-ci-tool-stack` configuration against established Docker security best practices, such as those provided by Docker, OWASP, and NIST.
*   **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attack scenarios and how an attacker might exploit identified vulnerabilities to achieve container escape.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Potential):**  If feasible and resources permit, we may perform limited dynamic analysis, such as running vulnerability scanners within the containers or attempting controlled container escape exploits in a sandboxed environment.  This is *not* a full penetration test, but a targeted examination of specific concerns.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: "Compromise Docker Host (Indirectly via Container)"

This section details the specific analysis of the attack vector.  We'll break it down into potential sub-vectors and provide analysis and mitigation strategies for each.

### 4.1. Sub-Vectors (Expanding on the original attack tree)

We can expand the "Sub-Vectors" section of the original attack tree into more specific and actionable categories:

*   **4.1.1. Kernel Exploits:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the host's kernel.
*   **4.1.2. Docker Engine Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Docker daemon itself.
*   **4.1.3. Misconfigured Container Capabilities:**  Exploiting excessive or improperly configured Linux capabilities.
*   **4.1.4. Shared Resource Abuse (Volumes/Networks):**  Exploiting misconfigured shared volumes or network configurations.
*   **4.1.5. Application-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the applications running inside the containers (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability in Jenkins) to gain further access.
*   **4.1.6. Insecure Docker Build Practices:** Exploiting vulnerabilities introduced during the image build process.

### 4.2. Analysis and Mitigation for Each Sub-Vector

Let's analyze each sub-vector in detail:

**4.1.1. Kernel Exploits**

*   **Analysis:**  Containers share the host's kernel.  A vulnerability in the kernel (e.g., a privilege escalation vulnerability) can be exploited from within a container to gain root access on the host.  This is a high-impact, high-risk scenario.  Examples include "Dirty COW" (CVE-2016-5195) and other similar vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep the Host Kernel Updated:**  This is the most crucial mitigation.  Regularly apply security patches to the host operating system's kernel.  Automate this process whenever possible.
    *   **Use a Minimal Host OS:**  Reduce the attack surface by using a minimal, container-optimized host OS (e.g., Container Linux, RancherOS, or a minimal installation of a distribution like Ubuntu Server).  Fewer installed packages mean fewer potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Seccomp Profiles:**  Use seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) to restrict the system calls that a container can make.  Docker has a default seccomp profile that blocks many dangerous system calls.  Consider creating custom, more restrictive profiles tailored to each container in the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
    *   **AppArmor/SELinux:**  Employ mandatory access control (MAC) systems like AppArmor (Ubuntu/Debian) or SELinux (Red Hat/CentOS) to further restrict container capabilities and access to host resources.
    *   **User Namespaces:**  Enable user namespaces.  This maps the root user inside the container to a non-root user on the host, significantly mitigating the impact of a container escape.  This is a very strong defense.

**4.1.2. Docker Engine Vulnerabilities**

*   **Analysis:**  Vulnerabilities in the Docker daemon itself (dockerd) can allow an attacker to escape the container.  These are less frequent than kernel exploits but can be equally dangerous.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep Docker Engine Updated:**  Regularly update the Docker Engine to the latest stable version.  Subscribe to Docker security advisories.
    *   **Run Docker Daemon as Non-Root (Rootless Mode):**  If possible, run the Docker daemon in rootless mode. This significantly reduces the impact of any vulnerabilities in the daemon itself.
    *   **Audit Docker Daemon Configuration:**  Review the Docker daemon configuration (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) for any insecure settings.
    *   **Limit Docker API Access:**  Restrict access to the Docker API.  If remote access is required, use TLS with strong authentication.

**4.1.3. Misconfigured Container Capabilities**

*   **Analysis:**  Linux capabilities provide fine-grained control over privileges.  By default, Docker drops many capabilities, but if a container is granted excessive capabilities (e.g., `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`), it can be easier to escape.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant containers *only* the capabilities they absolutely need.  Avoid using `--privileged`.  Explicitly drop unnecessary capabilities using `--cap-drop`.
    *   **Review Dockerfiles:**  Carefully examine the Dockerfiles in `docker-ci-tool-stack` to ensure that no unnecessary capabilities are being granted.
    *   **Use `docker inspect`:**  Use `docker inspect <container_id>` to check the capabilities granted to a running container.

**4.1.4. Shared Resource Abuse (Volumes/Networks)**

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Volumes:**  Mounting the host's root filesystem (`/`) or sensitive directories (e.g., `/etc`, `/var/run/docker.sock`) into a container is extremely dangerous.  An attacker could modify host files or gain control of the Docker daemon.
    *   **Networks:**  Using the host network mode (`--network host`) gives the container full access to the host's network interfaces, bypassing network isolation.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid Mounting Sensitive Host Directories:**  Never mount the host's root filesystem or other critical directories into containers.  Use specific, limited volume mounts only for necessary data sharing.
    *   **Use Read-Only Mounts:**  When possible, mount volumes as read-only (`:ro`) to prevent the container from modifying host files.
    *   **Use Docker Networks:**  Use Docker's built-in networking features (bridge networks, overlay networks) to isolate containers from each other and from the host network.  Avoid using `--network host`.
    *   **Network Policies:**  Implement network policies to control communication between containers and between containers and the outside world.

**4.1.5. Application-Specific Vulnerabilities**

*   **Analysis:**  A vulnerability in an application running inside the container (e.g., Jenkins, SonarQube) could be exploited to gain shell access within the container.  This could then be used as a stepping stone to attempt a container escape.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep Applications Updated:**  Regularly update the applications running within the containers (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, etc.) to the latest versions.
    *   **Use Minimal Base Images:**  Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine Linux) to reduce the attack surface.  Fewer installed packages mean fewer potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use container vulnerability scanners (e.g., Clair, Trivy, Anchore) to identify known vulnerabilities in the container images.  Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Secure Application Configuration:**  Follow security best practices for configuring the applications running within the containers.  For example, disable unnecessary Jenkins plugins, use strong passwords, and restrict user permissions.

**4.1.6. Insecure Docker Build Practices**

* **Analysis:** Vulnerabilities can be introduced during the image build process. For example, including secrets in the Dockerfile, using outdated base images, or not verifying the integrity of downloaded packages.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Use Multi-Stage Builds:** Use multi-stage builds to reduce the size of the final image and avoid including build tools and dependencies in the production image.
    * **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:** Never hardcode secrets (passwords, API keys) in the Dockerfile. Use environment variables, Docker secrets, or a secrets management solution.
    * **Verify Image Integrity:** Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of downloaded base images and packages.
    * **Scan Images After Build:** Scan the built images for vulnerabilities before deploying them.

### 4.3 Specific Recommendations for `docker-ci-tool-stack`

Based on the above analysis, here are some specific recommendations for the `docker-ci-tool-stack` project:

1.  **Review and Update Base Images:**  Examine the Dockerfiles for all containers and ensure they are using the latest, patched versions of their base images.  Consider switching to minimal base images (e.g., Alpine) where possible.
2.  **Audit Capabilities:**  Review the capabilities granted to each container.  Remove any unnecessary capabilities.  Explicitly drop capabilities using `--cap-drop`.
3.  **Secure Volume Mounts:**  Carefully review all volume mounts.  Ensure that no sensitive host directories are being mounted.  Use read-only mounts where appropriate.
4.  **Implement Network Isolation:**  Use Docker networks to isolate the containers from each other and from the host network.  Avoid using `--network host`.
5.  **Enable User Namespaces:**  Enable user namespaces to map the container's root user to a non-root user on the host.
6.  **Integrate Vulnerability Scanning:**  Integrate a container vulnerability scanner (e.g., Trivy, Clair) into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan images for known vulnerabilities.
7.  **Implement Seccomp and AppArmor/SELinux:**  Implement seccomp profiles and AppArmor/SELinux policies to further restrict container capabilities.
8.  **Regularly Update Host and Docker:**  Establish a process for regularly updating the host operating system's kernel and the Docker Engine.
9. **Secrets Management:** Implement secure way to manage secrets. Do not store them in Dockerfiles.

## 5. Conclusion

Compromising a Docker host indirectly via a container is a serious threat. By addressing the sub-vectors outlined above and implementing the recommended mitigations, the `docker-ci-tool-stack` project can significantly improve its security posture and reduce the risk of container escape.  Regular security audits, vulnerability scanning, and adherence to Docker security best practices are essential for maintaining a secure environment. This is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and improvement are crucial.
