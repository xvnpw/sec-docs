Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `docker-ci-tool-stack` context.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 2.3 Mount Sensitive Host Directories into Container

### 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the risks associated with mounting sensitive host directories into containers, specifically within the context of the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   Identify specific scenarios where this vulnerability might be exploited in a CI/CD pipeline using this tool stack.
*   Propose concrete mitigation strategies and detection methods to reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack vector.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers and security engineers.
*   Determine the overall risk rating, considering likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   The `docker-ci-tool-stack` (https://github.com/marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack) and its intended use in CI/CD pipelines.
*   Docker containers and their interaction with the host operating system.
*   The specific attack vector of mounting sensitive host directories (e.g., `/`, `/etc`, `/var/run/docker.sock`, and potentially others relevant to CI/CD like SSH keys or cloud credentials).
*   Exploitation scenarios relevant to a CI/CD environment (e.g., compromising build processes, stealing secrets, deploying malicious artifacts).
*   Mitigation and detection strategies applicable to Docker and CI/CD pipelines.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities within the applications running *inside* the containers, unless they directly relate to the exploitation of the mounted host directories.
*   Network-level attacks, unless they are a prerequisite for compromising a container that then exploits the mounted directory.
*   Attacks that do not involve Docker containers.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific threats related to mounting sensitive host directories in the `docker-ci-tool-stack` context.  This includes considering the attacker's goals (e.g., steal secrets, disrupt builds, deploy malicious code).
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine how the `docker-ci-tool-stack` might be configured (intentionally or unintentionally) to create this vulnerability.  This includes reviewing common Docker Compose configurations and build scripts.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario Development:**  Create realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to achieve their goals.
4.  **Mitigation and Detection Analysis:**  Identify and evaluate specific mitigation and detection techniques to prevent or detect this attack.
5.  **Risk Assessment:**  Combine the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty to determine an overall risk rating.
6.  **Recommendations:** Provide clear, actionable recommendations for developers and security engineers.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1 Threat Modeling

In the context of `docker-ci-tool-stack`, an attacker mounting sensitive host directories aims to:

*   **Steal CI/CD Secrets:** Access environment variables, API keys, SSH keys, or cloud credentials stored on the host and used by the CI/CD pipeline.  This allows the attacker to impersonate the CI/CD system, access source code repositories, cloud infrastructure, or other sensitive resources.
*   **Compromise Build Processes:** Modify build scripts or dependencies on the host to inject malicious code into the build artifacts.  This could lead to the deployment of backdoored applications or infrastructure.
*   **Gain Host Root Access:** Escalate privileges from the container to the host, gaining full control over the CI/CD server.  This is particularly dangerous if the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted.
*   **Disrupt CI/CD Operations:** Delete or modify critical files on the host, causing build failures, deployment errors, or service outages.
*   **Pivot to Other Systems:** Use the compromised CI/CD server as a launching point for attacks against other systems on the network.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

The `docker-ci-tool-stack` itself doesn't inherently introduce this vulnerability.  The vulnerability arises from *how* it's used and configured.  Here are common misconfigurations:

*   **Inadvertent Mounts in `docker-compose.yml`:**  Developers might mount the entire root directory (`/`) or other sensitive directories (like `/etc` or `/home`) for debugging or convenience, without realizing the security implications.  Example:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      my-service:
        image: my-image
        volumes:
          - /:/host  # EXTREMELY DANGEROUS - Mounts the entire host filesystem
    ```

*   **Mounting the Docker Socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`):** This is a classic and extremely dangerous misconfiguration.  It allows the container to control the Docker daemon on the host, effectively granting root access.  Example:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      my-service:
        image: my-image
        volumes:
          - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  # HIGHLY DANGEROUS
    ```

*   **Mounting Directories Containing Secrets:**  Developers might mount directories containing SSH keys (`~/.ssh`), cloud credentials (`~/.aws/credentials`), or other sensitive files.  Example:

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      my-service:
        image: my-image
        volumes:
          - ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh  # DANGEROUS - Exposes SSH keys
    ```
* **Lack of Least Privilege:** Running containers as the `root` user inside the container, combined with a host mount, exacerbates the risk. Even if a less sensitive directory is mounted, the `root` user inside the container has broad permissions.

#### 4.3 Exploitation Scenario Development

**Scenario 1: Stealing AWS Credentials**

1.  **Compromise:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application running within a container in the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.  This could be a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in a testing tool or a dependency.
2.  **Discovery:** The attacker discovers that the `~/.aws/credentials` directory from the host is mounted into the container.
3.  **Exfiltration:** The attacker reads the AWS credentials from the mounted directory and uses them to access the organization's AWS resources.
4.  **Impact:** The attacker can steal data, deploy malicious infrastructure, or disrupt services in the AWS environment.

**Scenario 2: Docker Socket Escape**

1.  **Compromise:**  An attacker gains access to a container through a vulnerability in a service running within it.
2.  **Discovery:** The attacker finds that `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted into the container.
3.  **Escape:** The attacker uses the Docker socket to create a new container with privileged access to the host, effectively gaining root access to the host machine.  They can do this by running a command like:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm -v /:/host chroot /host bash
    ```
    This command mounts the host's root filesystem into a new container and then uses `chroot` to change the root directory to the mounted host filesystem, giving the attacker a shell with full access to the host.
4.  **Impact:** The attacker has complete control over the CI/CD server and can potentially compromise the entire CI/CD pipeline and any connected systems.

**Scenario 3: Modifying Build Scripts**

1.  **Compromise:** An attacker gains access to a container.
2.  **Discovery:** The attacker finds that the directory containing the CI/CD build scripts (e.g., `/home/user/project/scripts`) is mounted into the container.
3.  **Modification:** The attacker modifies a build script to include malicious code, such as a backdoor or a command to exfiltrate data.
4.  **Impact:** The next time the CI/CD pipeline runs, the malicious code will be executed, potentially compromising the build artifacts or other systems.

#### 4.4 Mitigation and Detection Analysis

**Mitigation:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Avoid Mounting Sensitive Directories:**  The most effective mitigation is to *never* mount sensitive host directories into containers unless absolutely necessary.  Rethink the workflow to avoid this.
    *   **Use Read-Only Mounts:** If a directory *must* be mounted, use read-only mounts (`:ro`) whenever possible.  This prevents the container from modifying the host files.  Example:

        ```yaml
        volumes:
          - /path/on/host:/path/in/container:ro
        ```

    *   **Run Containers as Non-Root Users:**  Use the `USER` directive in the Dockerfile or the `user` option in Docker Compose to run the container as a non-root user.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they exploit a vulnerability within the container.  Example (Dockerfile):

        ```dockerfile
        FROM ubuntu:latest
        RUN useradd -m myuser
        USER myuser
        ```

    *   **Use Docker Secrets or Environment Variables:**  Instead of mounting directories containing secrets, use Docker secrets or environment variables to pass sensitive information to the container.  Docker secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit.

*   **Secure Configuration Management:**
    *   **Review Docker Compose Files:**  Carefully review all `docker-compose.yml` files and other Docker configuration files for any unnecessary or dangerous volume mounts.
    *   **Automated Configuration Scanning:**  Use tools like `docker scan`, `trivy`, `clair`, or commercial container security platforms to automatically scan Docker images and configurations for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, including insecure volume mounts.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Reviews:** If using IaC tools like Terraform or Kubernetes, incorporate security checks into the IaC pipeline to detect insecure configurations before they are deployed.

*   **Avoid Mounting the Docker Socket:**  This should almost *never* be done.  If container orchestration is needed from within a container, explore alternatives like:
    *   **Docker-in-Docker (dind):**  This runs a separate Docker daemon inside the container, isolating it from the host's Docker daemon.  However, dind also has security considerations and should be used with caution.
    *   **Sysbox:** A more secure alternative to dind that provides stronger isolation.
    *   **Remote Docker API Access (with TLS):**  Configure the Docker daemon to listen on a TCP port and use TLS encryption to secure the connection.  This is less secure than not exposing the Docker daemon at all, but it's better than mounting the socket directly.

**Detection:**

*   **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly audit Docker configurations (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`, Kubernetes manifests) for insecure volume mounts.
*   **Runtime Monitoring:**
    *   **Container File System Activity Monitoring:** Use tools like `falco`, `sysdig`, or commercial container security platforms to monitor container file system activity for suspicious access to sensitive files or directories.  Create rules to alert on access to known sensitive paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/var/run/docker.sock`, `~/.ssh`).
    *   **Process Monitoring:** Monitor processes running inside containers for unusual behavior, such as attempts to access the Docker socket or execute commands related to container escape.
    *   **Audit Logs:** Enable and monitor Docker daemon audit logs to track container creation, execution, and volume mounts.

*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to detect malicious activity related to container compromise and exploitation.

#### 4.5 Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** Medium (as stated in the original attack tree).  The likelihood is medium because it relies on misconfiguration, which is common but not guaranteed.
*   **Impact:** High (as stated in the original attack tree).  The impact is high because it can lead to complete host compromise, secret theft, and disruption of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Effort:** Low (as stated in the original attack tree).  Exploiting the mount is trivial once the container is compromised.
*   **Skill Level:** Low (as stated in the original attack tree).  Requires basic understanding of Docker and file systems.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (as stated in the original attack tree).  Requires proactive configuration review and monitoring.

**Overall Risk Rating: High**

Due to the high impact and low effort/skill level required for exploitation, this vulnerability poses a high risk, even with a medium likelihood and detection difficulty.

#### 4.6 Recommendations

1.  **Developer Training:** Educate developers on the risks of mounting sensitive host directories and best practices for secure Docker configuration.  Include hands-on exercises and examples of insecure configurations.
2.  **Automated Security Scanning:** Integrate container security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect insecure volume mounts and other vulnerabilities.
3.  **Configuration Review Process:** Implement a code review process that includes a security review of all Docker Compose files and other Docker configuration files.
4.  **Least Privilege Enforcement:** Enforce the principle of least privilege by running containers as non-root users and using read-only mounts whenever possible.
5.  **Runtime Monitoring:** Deploy runtime monitoring tools to detect suspicious container activity, including access to sensitive files and directories.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the CI/CD infrastructure, including Docker configurations and container images.
7.  **Avoid Docker Socket Mounts:**  Strongly discourage the practice of mounting the Docker socket into containers.  Explore alternative solutions for container orchestration.
8.  **Use Secrets Management:** Utilize Docker secrets or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to securely manage sensitive information.
9.  **Document Secure Configuration Standards:** Create and maintain clear documentation on secure Docker configuration standards for the organization.
10. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop an incident response plan that includes procedures for handling container compromises and potential host exploitation.

By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of this attack vector and improve the overall security of their CI/CD pipelines using the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
