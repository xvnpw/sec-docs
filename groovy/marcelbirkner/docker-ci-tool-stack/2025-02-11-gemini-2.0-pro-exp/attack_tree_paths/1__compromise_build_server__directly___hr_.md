Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on the "Compromise Build Server (Directly)" node, tailored for an application using the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.  I'll follow the structure you requested: Objective, Scope, Methodology, and then the detailed analysis.

## Deep Analysis: Compromise Build Server (Directly)

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and propose mitigations for the vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to directly compromise the build server used by an application leveraging the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.  We aim to understand the specific attack vectors, their likelihood, potential impact, and practical countermeasures.  The ultimate goal is to harden the build server against direct compromise, thereby protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the software build process and the resulting artifacts.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the direct compromise of the build server itself.  It does *not* cover indirect attacks (e.g., compromising a developer workstation and then pivoting to the build server), supply chain attacks on dependencies, or attacks targeting the application after deployment.  The scope includes:

*   **Operating System Vulnerabilities:**  Exploits targeting the underlying OS of the build server (e.g., unpatched vulnerabilities, misconfigurations).
*   **Network-Based Attacks:**  Attacks originating from the network, such as brute-force SSH attempts, exploitation of exposed services, or network-based vulnerability scans.
*   **Service-Specific Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities within the services running on the build server, particularly those related to the `docker-ci-tool-stack` (e.g., Docker daemon, Jenkins, other CI/CD tools).
*   **Physical Access (if applicable):**  If the build server is physically accessible, we'll consider the risks associated with unauthorized physical access.  This is less likely in cloud environments but crucial for on-premise setups.
*   **Credential Management:** Weak or exposed credentials for accessing the build server (SSH keys, passwords, API tokens).
* **Docker-ci-tool-stack specific configuration:** Misconfiguration of the stack.

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following methodologies:

*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Using automated tools (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, Trivy, Clair) to identify known vulnerabilities in the operating system, installed software, and Docker images used by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   **Configuration Review:**  Manually reviewing the configuration files of the build server's operating system, Docker, Jenkins (or other CI/CD tools), and any other relevant services.  This includes checking for secure settings, least privilege principles, and adherence to best practices.
*   **Penetration Testing (Simulated):**  We will *conceptually* simulate penetration testing techniques to identify potential attack paths.  This will not involve actual exploitation but will consider how an attacker might leverage identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Applying threat modeling principles to identify potential threats and attack vectors specific to the `docker-ci-tool-stack` and the build server's environment.
*   **Best Practice Review:**  Comparing the current setup against industry best practices for securing build servers and CI/CD pipelines.  This includes referencing guidelines from OWASP, NIST, and Docker security documentation.
* **Docker-ci-tool-stack documentation review:** Review documentation of the stack and search for known vulnerabilities and best practices.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Build Server (Directly)

This section breaks down the "Compromise Build Server (Directly)" node into specific attack vectors and analyzes each one.

**4.1. Operating System Vulnerabilities**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a known, unpatched vulnerability in the build server's operating system (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability in a system service).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  The likelihood depends on the patching frequency and the OS used.  Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are actively scanned for and exploited.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation could grant the attacker full control over the build server.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Regular Patching:** Implement a robust patch management process to ensure the OS is updated promptly with security patches.  Automate patching where possible.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the OS for known vulnerabilities using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
    *   **System Hardening:**  Disable unnecessary services, configure a firewall, and implement other OS hardening measures (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor).
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run services with the least necessary privileges.  Avoid running everything as root.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block exploit attempts.

**4.2. Network-Based Attacks**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Brute-Force SSH:**  An attacker attempts to guess SSH credentials through repeated login attempts.
    *   **Exploitation of Exposed Services:**  The attacker targets vulnerabilities in exposed services (e.g., an outdated web server, an improperly configured database).
    *   **Network Scanning/Reconnaissance:**  The attacker uses network scanning tools to identify open ports and services, looking for potential entry points.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Brute-force attacks are common.  The likelihood of other network attacks depends on the exposed services and their configurations.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation could grant the attacker access to the build server, potentially with elevated privileges.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Strong Passwords/SSH Keys:**  Enforce strong, unique passwords and prefer SSH key-based authentication over password authentication.  Regularly rotate keys.
    *   **Firewall:**  Implement a strict firewall to allow only necessary inbound traffic to the build server.  Block all unnecessary ports.
    *   **Fail2Ban (or similar):**  Use tools like Fail2Ban to automatically block IP addresses that exhibit suspicious behavior (e.g., repeated failed login attempts).
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the build server on a separate network segment to limit the impact of a compromise.
    *   **VPN/Bastion Host:**  Require access to the build server through a VPN or a secure bastion host.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the network configuration.

**4.3. Service-Specific Vulnerabilities (Docker-ci-tool-stack)**

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Docker Daemon Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Docker daemon itself (e.g., privilege escalation, container escape).
    *   **Jenkins (or other CI/CD tool) Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Jenkins or other CI/CD tools, such as unauthenticated access, remote code execution, or cross-site scripting (XSS).
    *   **Misconfigured Docker Images:**  Using Docker images with known vulnerabilities or insecure configurations.
    *   **Exposed Docker API:** Unintentional or malicious exposure of the Docker API without proper authentication.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  The likelihood depends on the versions of the tools used and their configurations.  Regular updates are crucial.
*   **Impact:** High.  Compromising the CI/CD tool or the Docker daemon could grant the attacker control over the build process and the ability to inject malicious code.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep Docker, Jenkins, and all other components of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Secure Docker Configuration:**
        *   Use Docker Content Trust to verify the integrity of Docker images.
        *   Run Docker containers with the least necessary privileges (e.g., non-root user).
        *   Limit container capabilities.
        *   Use a secure registry for Docker images.
        *   Do not expose the Docker daemon socket unnecessarily. If needed, use TLS authentication.
    *   **Secure Jenkins Configuration:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization.
        *   Use strong passwords and regularly rotate them.
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
        *   Disable unnecessary plugins.
        *   Regularly review and update Jenkins plugins.
        *   Configure Jenkins to use HTTPS.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning of Docker Images:**  Use tools like Trivy, Clair, or Anchore Engine to scan Docker images for known vulnerabilities before using them in the build process.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the CI/CD tool and Docker containers have only the minimum necessary permissions.

**4.4. Physical Access (if applicable)**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains physical access to the build server and compromises it through direct manipulation (e.g., booting from a USB drive, accessing the console).
*   **Likelihood:** Low (for cloud environments), Medium to High (for on-premise servers).
*   **Impact:** High.  Physical access often grants complete control over the server.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Physical Security Controls:**  Restrict physical access to the server room or data center.  Use locks, surveillance cameras, and access control systems.
    *   **BIOS/UEFI Password:**  Set a strong BIOS/UEFI password to prevent unauthorized booting.
    *   **Disable USB Boot:**  Disable booting from USB devices in the BIOS/UEFI settings.
    *   **Full Disk Encryption:**  Encrypt the server's hard drive to protect data at rest.

**4.5. Credential Management**

*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker obtains valid credentials for the build server through various means (e.g., phishing, social engineering, credential stuffing, finding exposed credentials in code repositories).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High.  Credential theft is a common attack vector.
*   **Impact:** High.  Valid credentials grant the attacker direct access to the build server.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   **Strong, Unique Passwords:**  Enforce strong, unique passwords for all accounts on the build server.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for all access to the build server, especially for SSH and CI/CD tool logins.
    *   **SSH Key Management:**  Use SSH keys instead of passwords where possible.  Regularly rotate keys and store them securely.
    *   **Secrets Management:**  Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage sensitive credentials.  Do *not* hardcode credentials in code or configuration files.
    *   **Credential Rotation:**  Regularly rotate all credentials, including passwords, API keys, and SSH keys.
    * **Least Privilege Access:** Grant users and services only the minimum necessary permissions.

**4.6 Docker-ci-tool-stack specific configuration**
* **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguration in `docker-ci-tool-stack` setup, like exposing sensitive ports, using default credentials, or not enabling security features.
* **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on the administrator's expertise and adherence to best practices.
* **Impact:** High. Could lead to unauthorized access, code execution, or data breaches.
* **Mitigations:**
    * **Review Official Documentation:** Thoroughly review the official documentation for `docker-ci-tool-stack` and follow all security recommendations.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure the stack with the least privilege necessary for each component.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any features or services within the stack that are not required.
    * **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the configuration of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` for security misconfigurations.
    * **Use Configuration Management Tools:** Use tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet to automate the configuration and ensure consistency and security.
    * **Network Isolation:** Isolate the `docker-ci-tool-stack` components on a separate network segment.
    * **Monitor Logs:** Monitor the logs of all components for suspicious activity.
