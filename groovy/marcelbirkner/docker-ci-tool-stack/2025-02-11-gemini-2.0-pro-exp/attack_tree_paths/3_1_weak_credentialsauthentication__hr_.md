Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on the `docker-ci-tool-stack` and tailored for a development team audience.

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.1 Weak Credentials/Authentication

### 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the specific vulnerabilities related to weak credentials and authentication within the context of the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   Identify the potential attack vectors attackers might exploit due to these weaknesses.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies that the development team can implement to significantly reduce the risk.
*   Assess the residual risk after implementing the mitigations.
*   Provide guidance on monitoring and detection to identify potential credential-based attacks.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the "Weak Credentials/Authentication" attack path (3.1) within the broader attack tree.  It considers the following components of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` that are relevant to authentication and credential management:

*   **Jenkins:**  The core CI/CD server.  This includes Jenkins' built-in user management, any configured authentication plugins (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, GitHub OAuth), and API token usage.
*   **Nexus Repository Manager:**  Used for storing build artifacts.  This includes Nexus' user management, any external authentication integrations, and API key/token usage.
*   **SonarQube:**  Used for code quality analysis.  This includes SonarQube's user management, external authentication integrations, and API token usage.
*   **Docker Registry (if used within the stack):**  If a private Docker registry is part of the CI/CD pipeline, its authentication mechanisms are in scope.  This includes username/password authentication and token-based authentication.
*   **Any other tools within the stack that require authentication:** This includes any additional tools added to the stack that have their own authentication mechanisms.
* **SSH access to the host machine:** Access to the underlying server hosting the Docker containers.

The analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities unrelated to credentials, such as software vulnerabilities within the tools themselves (e.g., a Jenkins plugin vulnerability that allows privilege escalation *after* successful authentication).  It also excludes attacks that bypass authentication entirely (e.g., exploiting a zero-day vulnerability that allows unauthenticated code execution).

### 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific threat actors and their motivations for targeting the CI/CD pipeline.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine each component within the scope for specific weaknesses related to credential management and authentication.
3.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Describe the precise steps an attacker might take to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable countermeasures to address each vulnerability and attack vector.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the remaining risk after implementing the mitigations.
6.  **Detection and Monitoring Recommendations:**  Suggest methods for detecting and monitoring for potential credential-based attacks.

### 4. Deep Analysis

#### 4.1 Threat Modeling

Relevant threat actors include:

*   **Disgruntled Employees/Contractors:**  May have legitimate access but misuse it or attempt to escalate privileges.  Motivation: Revenge, financial gain, sabotage.
*   **External Attackers (Opportunistic):**  Scan for exposed services and weak credentials.  Motivation:  Financial gain (e.g., deploying cryptominers), data theft, using the infrastructure for other attacks.
*   **External Attackers (Targeted):**  Specifically target the organization or its software supply chain.  Motivation:  Espionage, sabotage, intellectual property theft, inserting malicious code into the software supply chain.
*   **Competitors:**  May attempt to gain access to steal intellectual property or disrupt operations. Motivation: Competitive advantage.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

Here's a breakdown of vulnerabilities for each component:

*   **Jenkins:**
    *   **Default/Weak Passwords:**  The `admin` account might have a default or easily guessable password.  Users might choose weak passwords.
    *   **Lack of Password Complexity Enforcement:**  Jenkins might not enforce strong password policies (length, character requirements, etc.).
    *   **Lack of Account Lockout:**  Repeated failed login attempts might not trigger account lockout, allowing brute-force attacks.
    *   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:**  Credentials (e.g., for accessing other services) might be stored in plain text within Jenkins job configurations or global settings.
    *   **Overly Permissive API Tokens:**  API tokens might be granted excessive permissions, allowing an attacker with a compromised token to perform actions beyond what's necessary.
    *   **Weak or No MFA:**  Lack of multi-factor authentication makes it easier for attackers to gain access with stolen credentials.
    *   **Misconfigured Authentication Plugins:**  If using LDAP, Active Directory, or GitHub OAuth, misconfigurations (e.g., weak LDAP bind credentials, incorrect group mappings) can lead to unauthorized access.

*   **Nexus Repository Manager:**
    *   **Default/Weak Passwords:**  Similar to Jenkins, default or weak passwords for administrative or user accounts.
    *   **Lack of Password Complexity Enforcement:**  Similar to Jenkins.
    *   **Lack of Account Lockout:**  Similar to Jenkins.
    *   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:**  Credentials for accessing other services might be stored insecurely.
    *   **Overly Permissive API Keys/Tokens:**  Similar to Jenkins.
    *   **Weak or No MFA:**  Similar to Jenkins.

*   **SonarQube:**
    *   **Default/Weak Passwords:**  Similar to Jenkins and Nexus.
    *   **Lack of Password Complexity Enforcement:**  Similar to Jenkins and Nexus.
    *   **Lack of Account Lockout:**  Similar to Jenkins and Nexus.
    *   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:**  Similar to Jenkins and Nexus.
    *   **Overly Permissive API Tokens:**  Similar to Jenkins and Nexus.
    *   **Weak or No MFA:**  Similar to Jenkins and Nexus.

*   **Docker Registry (if used):**
    *   **Default/Weak Credentials:**  If using a private registry, default or weak credentials for accessing it.
    *   **Lack of Authentication:**  The registry might be configured without any authentication, allowing anyone to pull or push images.
    *   **Insecure Token Management:**  If using token-based authentication, tokens might be stored insecurely or have overly broad permissions.

*   **SSH Access to Host:**
    *   **Default/Weak SSH Passwords:**  The host machine might have a default or easily guessable SSH password.
    *   **Password Authentication Enabled:**  Password authentication for SSH is inherently less secure than key-based authentication.
    *   **Lack of SSH Key Management:**  SSH keys might be poorly managed, with compromised keys not being revoked.

*   **Other Tools:** Any other tools added to the stack will have similar potential vulnerabilities related to weak credentials and authentication.

#### 4.3 Attack Vector Identification

Here are some example attack vectors:

*   **Brute-Force Attack on Jenkins:**  An attacker uses a tool like Hydra to try common usernames and passwords against the Jenkins login page.  If successful, they gain administrative access to Jenkins.
*   **Credential Stuffing Attack on Nexus:**  An attacker uses a list of leaked credentials (obtained from a data breach) to try to log in to Nexus.  If a user has reused their password, the attacker gains access.
*   **Exploiting a Weak API Token:**  An attacker finds a Jenkins API token stored insecurely (e.g., in a public GitHub repository or a compromised developer workstation).  They use this token to trigger builds or modify job configurations.
*   **SSH Brute-Force:** An attacker uses a tool to brute-force the SSH password of the host machine.  If successful, they gain full control of the server and all the Docker containers running on it.
*   **Phishing for Credentials:** An attacker sends a phishing email to a developer, tricking them into revealing their Jenkins or Nexus credentials.

#### 4.4 Mitigation Strategy Development

Here are specific mitigation strategies:

*   **Strong Password Policies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies across all tools (Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube, etc.).  This includes minimum length (e.g., 12 characters), complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and password history (preventing reuse).
    *   Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   Implement MFA for all user accounts across all tools.  This adds a significant layer of security, even if passwords are compromised.  Use time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or hardware security keys.

*   **Account Lockout:**
    *   Configure account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.  Lock accounts after a small number of failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts).

*   **Secure Credential Storage:**
    *   **Never** store credentials in plain text within configuration files or job definitions.
    *   Use Jenkins' built-in credential management system to store sensitive information securely.
    *   Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and manage credentials for external services.
    *   Use environment variables to inject secrets into Docker containers, rather than hardcoding them in Dockerfiles or scripts.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Grant users and API tokens only the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid granting administrative privileges unless absolutely required.
    *   Regularly review and audit user permissions and API token scopes.

*   **Secure SSH Access:**
    *   Disable password authentication for SSH.  Use key-based authentication only.
    *   Use strong SSH keys (e.g., RSA 4096-bit or Ed25519).
    *   Implement a robust SSH key management process, including key rotation and revocation.
    *   Consider using a bastion host or SSH jump server to restrict direct SSH access to the CI/CD server.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the entire CI/CD pipeline, including credential management practices.
    *   Use automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses.

*   **Authentication Plugin Configuration (if applicable):**
    * If using external authentication providers (LDAP, Active Directory, GitHub OAuth), ensure they are configured securely.  Use strong bind credentials, proper group mappings, and secure communication protocols (e.g., LDAPS).

* **Docker Registry Security (if applicable):**
    * Always use authentication for your Docker registry.
    * Use token-based authentication with limited scope and expiration times.
    * Regularly rotate registry credentials.

#### 4.5 Residual Risk Assessment

After implementing these mitigations, the residual risk is significantly reduced but not eliminated.  Remaining risks include:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  A new vulnerability in one of the tools could bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker could still trick a user into revealing their credentials, even with MFA in place (e.g., through a sophisticated phishing attack).
*   **Insider Threats:**  A malicious insider with legitimate access could still misuse their privileges.
*   **Compromised Third-Party Libraries:**  A compromised library used by one of the tools could introduce vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6 Detection and Monitoring Recommendations

*   **Monitor Login Attempts:**  Log and monitor all login attempts (successful and failed) across all tools.  Look for unusual patterns, such as:
    *   High numbers of failed login attempts from a single IP address.
    *   Login attempts from unusual geographic locations.
    *   Login attempts outside of normal working hours.
*   **Audit API Token Usage:**  Regularly review API token usage logs to identify any suspicious activity.
*   **Implement Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  Use an IDS to monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity, such as brute-force attacks or credential stuffing.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Use a SIEM system to aggregate and analyze security logs from all components of the CI/CD pipeline.  This can help identify and correlate security events.
*   **Regular Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools.
* **Alerting:** Configure alerts for suspicious events, such as multiple failed login attempts or unusual API token usage.

### 5. Conclusion

Weak credentials and authentication represent a significant risk to the `docker-ci-tool-stack`. By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce this risk and improve the overall security of the CI/CD pipeline.  Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.  The principle of least privilege, strong passwords, MFA, and secure credential storage are the cornerstones of mitigating this attack vector.
