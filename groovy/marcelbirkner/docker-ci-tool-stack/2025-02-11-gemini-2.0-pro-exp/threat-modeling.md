# Threat Model Analysis for marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack

## Threat: [Malicious Image Pull](./threats/malicious_image_pull.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Image Pull

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious image to a public registry (e.g., Docker Hub) with a name similar to a legitimate image, or compromises a legitimate image's tag. The DCTS pipeline, configured to pull images based on name/tag, unknowingly pulls and executes the malicious image. This leverages the DCTS's core reliance on Docker images.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the build environment, potential exfiltration of source code, credentials, and other sensitive data. Deployment of malicious software to production environments. This is a direct attack on the DCTS's image handling.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Engine (within Jenkins agents or other build nodes), Docker Registry (interaction point), Jenkinsfile (or equivalent pipeline configuration within DCTS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Image Digest Pinning:** Use specific image digests (e.g., `myimage@sha256:abcdef...`) in the `Dockerfile` and DCTS pipeline configuration.
        *   **Image Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning (e.g., Trivy, Clair) into the DCTS pipeline *before* using any image. Fail the build if vulnerabilities are found.
        *   **Trusted Registry:** Use a private, trusted Docker registry with strict access controls, managed as part of the DCTS.
        *   **Content Trust:** Enable Docker Content Trust (Notary) to verify image signatures within the DCTS environment.
        *   **Regular Base Image Audits:** Review and update base images used in `Dockerfile`s, managed within the DCTS's version control.

## Threat: [Compromised Build Artifact in Repository (Nexus)](./threats/compromised_build_artifact_in_repository__nexus_.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Build Artifact in Repository (Nexus)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Nexus Repository Manager *within the DCTS* and replaces a legitimate build artifact with a malicious version. Subsequent deployments orchestrated by the DCTS use the compromised artifact.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious software to production environments, potential data breaches, system compromise. This directly impacts the DCTS's artifact management.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nexus Repository Manager (specifically, the hosted repositories *as part of the DCTS*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the DCTS's Nexus instance, limiting access.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Configure the DCTS pipeline to verify checksums of artifacts downloaded from the DCTS's Nexus.
        *   **Artifact Signing:** Sign build artifacts and verify signatures before deployment, integrated into the DCTS workflow.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically audit the contents of the DCTS's Nexus repositories.
        *   **Immutable Artifacts:** Configure the DCTS's Nexus to prevent overwriting of existing artifacts.

## Threat: [Docker Socket Exposure](./threats/docker_socket_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Docker Socket Exposure

    *   **Description:** The Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is exposed to a container running *within the DCTS environment* (e.g., a Jenkins agent container). An attacker exploiting a vulnerability within that container can use the Docker socket to gain root access to the host machine running the DCTS components.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the host machine running the DCTS, allowing the attacker to access all containers, data, and potentially other systems on the network. This is a direct threat to the DCTS's infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Docker Engine (host configuration within the DCTS), Jenkins agent container (configuration within the DCTS), potentially other containers running on the same DCTS host.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Mounting the Socket:** Do *not* mount the Docker socket into containers within the DCTS unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Docker-in-Docker (DinD) Alternatives:** Use DinD alternatives like Kaniko, Buildah, or img within the DCTS, which do not require access to the Docker socket.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run containers within the DCTS with the least privileged user possible (non-root).
        *   **Security Profiles:** Use AppArmor or SELinux to restrict container capabilities within the DCTS and prevent access to the Docker socket.
        *   **User Namespaces:** Enable user namespaces in Docker within the DCTS to map container root to a non-root host user.

## Threat: [CI/CD Pipeline Configuration Tampering (DCTS-Specific)](./threats/cicd_pipeline_configuration_tampering__dcts-specific_.md)

*   **Threat:** CI/CD Pipeline Configuration Tampering (DCTS-Specific)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the version control system *hosting the DCTS configuration* (e.g., GitLab) and modifies the CI/CD pipeline configuration files (e.g., Jenkinsfile, .gitlab-ci.yml) *that define the DCTS itself*. This is distinct from tampering with *application* pipelines; it's tampering with the *DCTS's own pipeline*.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the DCTS's build environment, potential compromise of the entire DCTS infrastructure, data exfiltration, disruption of all CI/CD processes managed by the DCTS.
    *   **Affected Component:** GitLab (repository hosting DCTS config), Jenkins (pipeline execution within DCTS), Version Control System (Git, specifically for the DCTS configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the version control system hosting the DCTS configuration.
        *   **Code Review:** Require code reviews for *all* changes to the DCTS's pipeline configuration files.
        *   **Protected Branches:** Use protected branches for the DCTS configuration repository to prevent direct commits.
        *   **Audit Trails:** Enable detailed audit logging in the version control system to track changes to the DCTS's pipeline configuration.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Jenkins/GitLab (within DCTS)](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_jenkinsgitlab__within_dcts_.md)

*  **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Jenkins/GitLab (within DCTS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Jenkins or GitLab web interface *that are part of the DCTS*, through weak passwords, compromised credentials, or exploiting vulnerabilities. This is about compromising the DCTS's *own* Jenkins/GitLab instances.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to trigger builds, modify configurations, access source code, and potentially compromise the entire DCTS pipeline and any projects it manages.
    *   **Affected Component:** Jenkins (web interface within DCTS), GitLab (web interface within DCTS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for all user accounts on the DCTS's Jenkins and GitLab.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all user accounts on the DCTS's Jenkins and GitLab.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the DCTS's Jenkins, GitLab, and all plugins up to date.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the DCTS's Jenkins and GitLab.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the DCTS's Jenkins and GitLab servers from the public internet.

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities in DCTS Components](./threats/unpatched_vulnerabilities_in_dcts_components.md)

* **Threat:** Unpatched Vulnerabilities in DCTS Components

    * **Description:**  The DCTS itself relies on various components (Jenkins, GitLab, Nexus, Docker, SonarQube, etc.).  Unpatched vulnerabilities in any of *these specific DCTS components* can be exploited by an attacker. This focuses on the security of the DCTS itself, not the applications it builds.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete compromise of the DCTS and all projects it manages.
    * **Affected Component:** Any of the DCTS's core components (Jenkins, GitLab, Nexus, Docker, SonarQube, etc.).
    * **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Implement a process for regularly updating *all* DCTS components to the latest stable versions. This is a core maintenance task for the DCTS.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the DCTS components themselves.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools to track and update third-party libraries used by the DCTS components.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories and mailing lists for the DCTS components.
