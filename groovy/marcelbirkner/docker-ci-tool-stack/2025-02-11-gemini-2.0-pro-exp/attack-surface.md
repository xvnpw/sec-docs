# Attack Surface Analysis for marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack

## Attack Surface: [1. Base Image Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__base_image_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the base Docker images used by the project (e.g., `maven:3-jdk-11`, `node:12`).
*`docker-ci-tool-stack` Contribution:* The project specifies base images by tag, not digest, making it vulnerable to image updates that introduce new vulnerabilities or malicious code (supply-chain attack). It doesn't inherently enforce image scanning.
*Example:* A vulnerability is discovered in the `node:12` base image that allows remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability in a container built using `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*Impact:* Remote code execution within the container, potential container escape, data breaches, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Image Scanning:** Integrate container image scanning (e.g., Trivy, Clair, Anchore) into the CI/CD pipeline *before* building with `docker-ci-tool-stack`. Fail the build if vulnerabilities above a defined threshold are found.
    *   **Digest Pinning:** Modify the `docker-compose.yml` and Dockerfiles to use image digests instead of tags (e.g., `node:12@sha256:...`). This guarantees the image is immutable. Automate the process of updating digests.
    *   **Minimal Base Images:** Explore using distroless or other minimal base images.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating base images.

## Attack Surface: [2. Docker Socket Mounting](./attack_surfaces/2__docker_socket_mounting.md)

*Description:* Granting a container access to the host's Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) gives it full control over the Docker daemon.
*`docker-ci-tool-stack` Contribution:* The project's flexibility *could* lead users to mount the Docker socket for tasks like building other images within a container. This is a common, but dangerous, pattern facilitated by the tool's general-purpose nature.
*Example:* A user mounts the Docker socket to allow a container to build and push images. A vulnerability in the containerized application allows an attacker to execute `docker` commands on the host.
*Impact:* Complete host compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Avoid Socket Mounting:** This is the *primary* mitigation. Restructure the CI/CD process to eliminate the need for Docker socket access.
    *   **Docker-in-Docker (dind) (with extreme caution):** If building images within a container is *absolutely* necessary, consider dind, but run it as non-root, use TLS, and isolate the container.
    *   **Read-Only Mount (if unavoidable):** If the socket *must* be mounted, mount it read-only (`:ro`).
    *   **Strict Security Context:** If mounted, use strong seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux profiles.
    *   **Alternative Tools:** Explore tools like `kaniko`, `buildah`, or `img`.

## Attack Surface: [3. Added Software Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__added_software_vulnerabilities.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in the tools and dependencies added *on top* of the base images within the Dockerfiles.
*`docker-ci-tool-stack` Contribution:* The project's Dockerfiles add various tools (e.g., `wait-for-it.sh`) and project-specific dependencies (via `npm`, `mvn`, etc.). These additions, facilitated by the tool's build process, are potential attack vectors.
*Example:* A vulnerability is found in a Node.js package installed via `npm` within a `docker-ci-tool-stack` container.
*Impact:* Code execution within the container, data breaches, denial of service, potential container escape.
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., `npm audit`, `mvn dependency:check`, OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk).
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all added software and dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate an SBOM for each image.
    *   **Minimize Dependencies:** Only include necessary tools and dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [4. Container Escape](./attack_surfaces/4__container_escape.md)

*Description:* An attacker who gains control of a running container attempts to break out of the container's isolation and gain access to the host system.
*`docker-ci-tool-stack` Contribution:* The project doesn't inherently configure strong security contexts to prevent container escapes. It relies on default Docker settings, which may not be sufficient, and its use *facilitates* running potentially vulnerable code within containers.
*Example:* An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application running within a `docker-ci-tool-stack` container and escapes to the host.
*Impact:* Host compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Non-Root User:** Modify the Dockerfiles to create and use a non-root user.
    *   **Seccomp Profiles:** Implement seccomp profiles.
    *   **AppArmor/SELinux:** Use AppArmor or SELinux.
    *   **Capability Dropping:** Use Docker's `--cap-drop` option.
    *   **Read-Only Root Filesystem:** Use the `--read-only` flag.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Limit the container's CPU, memory, etc.
