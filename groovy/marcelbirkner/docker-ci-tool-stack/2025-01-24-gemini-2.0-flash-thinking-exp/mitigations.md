## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `--privileged` mode for dind when using `docker-ci-tool-stack`.](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__--privileged__mode_for_dind_when_using__docker-ci-tool-stack_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When setting up `dind` (Docker-in-Docker) as part of your `docker-ci-tool-stack` based CI pipeline, carefully review the Docker run command or Docker Compose configuration for the `dind` service.
    2.  Ensure that the `--privileged` flag is **not** used. This flag grants extensive host capabilities to the container and is a significant security risk, especially within a CI environment.
    3.  If you encounter issues when removing `--privileged`, investigate alternative approaches for container building within your CI. Consider using rootless Docker, or tools like `kaniko` or `buildkit` which are often better suited for secure CI container builds and may eliminate the need for `dind` and `--privileged` altogether when used with `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
    4.  If `dind` is still necessary without `--privileged` for your `docker-ci-tool-stack` setup, explore and configure Docker user namespaces to enhance isolation.
    5.  Thoroughly test your `docker-ci-tool-stack` based CI pipelines after removing `--privileged` to confirm all functionalities remain operational.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Container Escape (High Severity): Using `--privileged` significantly increases the risk of container escape from `dind` within the `docker-ci-tool-stack` environment, potentially compromising the CI host.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Container Escape: High Risk Reduction. Eliminating `--privileged` drastically reduces the attack surface for container escapes in `dind` setups used with `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented.  `docker-ci-tool-stack` examples might use `--privileged` for simplicity, but secure usage should avoid it.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `docker-ci-tool-stack` documentation and examples should strongly discourage `--privileged` and provide clear guidance on secure `dind` setup without it, specifically within the context of the tool stack.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement User Namespaces for dind when using `docker-ci-tool-stack`.](./mitigation_strategies/implement_user_namespaces_for_dind_when_using__docker-ci-tool-stack_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When deploying `docker-ci-tool-stack` with `dind`, ensure your Docker daemon supports and is configured for user namespaces.
    2.  Configure user namespace remapping for the `dind` container within your `docker-ci-tool-stack` setup. This isolates user and group IDs within the `dind` container from the host system.
    3.  Use Docker's `--userns-remap` option or Docker Compose configuration to define user namespace settings for the `dind` service in your `docker-ci-tool-stack` deployment.
    4.  Carefully plan user and group ID mappings to maintain proper permissions within the `dind` container while enhancing host isolation in your `docker-ci-tool-stack` environment.
    5.  Test your `docker-ci-tool-stack` based CI pipelines to ensure user namespace remapping doesn't cause functional issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Container Escape (Medium Severity): User namespaces in `dind` (used with `docker-ci-tool-stack`) reduce the impact of container escapes by limiting host privileges.
    *   Host File System Access (Medium Severity): Limits unauthorized host file system access from a compromised `dind` container in `docker-ci-tool-stack` setups.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Container Escape: Medium Risk Reduction. User namespaces significantly reduce the potential damage from `dind` container escapes in `docker-ci-tool-stack` environments.
    *   Host File System Access: Medium Risk Reduction. Limits unauthorized host file system modification from `dind` within `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Potentially Missing. User namespaces are a Docker feature, but explicit configuration for `dind` in `docker-ci-tool-stack` is likely manual.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `docker-ci-tool-stack` documentation should guide users on configuring user namespaces for `dind` to improve security when using the stack. Examples in documentation or configurations would be beneficial.

    1.  Create a custom Seccomp profile (JSON format) to restrict system calls for the `dind` container used with `docker-ci-tool-stack`. Start with a restrictive base profile and add necessary system calls as needed for CI tasks.
    2.  Apply the Seccomp profile to the `dind` container in your `docker-ci-tool-stack` setup using Docker's `--security-opt seccomp=<profile.json>` option in Docker Compose or your CI pipeline definition.
    3.  Thoroughly test your `docker-ci-tool-stack` based CI pipelines after applying the Seccomp profile to ensure all required system calls for container building and CI tasks are permitted and functionality is maintained.
    4.  Refine your Seccomp profile iteratively based on testing and monitoring to balance security and functionality within your `docker-ci-tool-stack` environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Container Escape (Medium Severity): Seccomp profiles for `dind` in `docker-ci-tool-stack` limit system calls, making kernel exploit-based escapes harder.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Restricting system calls can prevent certain privilege escalation attacks within `dind` containers used with `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Container Escape: Medium Risk Reduction. Seccomp profiles add a layer of defense against `dind` container escapes in `docker-ci-tool-stack` setups.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces potential for privilege escalation within `dind` containers in `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Missing. Seccomp profiles are a Docker feature, but their application to `dind` in `docker-ci-tool-stack` is not default and requires manual setup.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `docker-ci-tool-stack` documentation should recommend and guide users on using Seccomp profiles for `dind` to enhance security. Example profiles or starting points could be included in documentation.

*   **Missing Implementation:** `docker-ci-tool-stack` documentation should emphasize regularly updating the `dind` image and recommend automation strategies for this process within the context of the tool stack.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Absolutely Avoid Mounting Host Docker Socket when using `docker-ci-tool-stack` with dind.](./mitigation_strategies/absolutely_avoid_mounting_host_docker_socket_when_using__docker-ci-tool-stack__with_dind.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Thoroughly review your `docker-ci-tool-stack` configurations, especially Docker Compose files and CI pipeline definitions.
    2.  Search for any volume mounts that map `/var/run/docker.sock` from the host into any container, particularly `dind` containers within your `docker-ci-tool-stack` setup.
    3.  **Immediately remove** any such volume mounts. Mounting the host Docker socket is a critical security vulnerability when using `dind` with `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
    4.  Ensure CI processes requiring Docker access interact with the Docker daemon *inside* the `dind` container, not the host's. Use the Docker CLI *within* the `dind` container to interact with the inner Docker daemon in your `docker-ci-tool-stack` environment.
    5.  Educate your teams about the severe risks of exposing the host Docker socket in `docker-ci-tool-stack` setups and enforce policies to prevent this practice.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
