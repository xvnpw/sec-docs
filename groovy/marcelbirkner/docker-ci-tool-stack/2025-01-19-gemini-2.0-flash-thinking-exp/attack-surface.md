# Attack Surface Analysis for marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Service Ports](./attack_surfaces/exposed_service_ports.md)

*   **Description:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` exposes ports for various services like Jenkins (8080), SonarQube (9000), Nexus (8081), Selenium Hub (4444), and Mailhog (8025, 1025). These ports, if accessible from outside the intended network, become potential entry points for attackers.
    *   **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The stack's design inherently requires exposing these ports to function and be accessible for CI/CD processes. The default Docker Compose configuration defines port mappings that make these services reachable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans public IP ranges and finds the exposed port 8080 of the Jenkins instance. If Jenkins is not properly secured, they might be able to access the login page or even exploit known Jenkins vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to services, data breaches, remote code execution on the server hosting the stack, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to the exposed ports to only authorized networks or IP addresses.
        *   Use a VPN or SSH tunneling to access the services instead of directly exposing them to the public internet.
        *   Change default ports to less common ones (security through obscurity, but not a primary defense).

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Web Interfaces (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Mailhog)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_web_interfaces__jenkins__sonarqube__nexus__mailhog_.md)

*   **Description:** The web interfaces of Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, and Mailhog, if not properly secured with authentication and authorization, can be accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The stack deploys these services with default configurations that might not enforce strong authentication out of the box. Users need to configure security settings within each application.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Jenkins web interface on port 8080 without needing to log in. They can then view build logs, access credentials, or even trigger new builds.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information (code, artifacts, emails), manipulation of CI/CD pipelines, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce strong authentication and authorization for all web interfaces.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for administrative accounts.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
        *   Regularly review user permissions and remove unnecessary accounts.

## Attack Surface: [Jenkins Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jenkins_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Jenkins relies heavily on plugins, and these plugins can have their own security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The stack includes Jenkins, and users will likely install various plugins to extend its functionality. The responsibility of managing plugin security falls on the user.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a commonly used Jenkins plugin. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain control of the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Jenkins master, access to credentials, manipulation of CI/CD pipelines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install necessary Jenkins plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all installed Jenkins plugins up-to-date.
        *   Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or have known vulnerabilities.
        *   Configure Jenkins to automatically update plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Docker Socket (Potentially)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_docker_socket__potentially_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is mounted into a container without proper restrictions, a compromised container can potentially control the Docker daemon on the host.
    *   **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** While not a default configuration, users might inadvertently expose the Docker socket to containers for specific use cases within the deployed stack, increasing the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a container allows an attacker to execute commands within the container. Because the Docker socket is mounted, they can use Docker commands to create new containers, access host files, or even compromise the host system.
    *   **Impact:** Full host compromise, container escape, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid mounting the Docker socket into containers unless absolutely necessary.
        *   If mounting is required, use security tools like `docker-slim` or restrict access using AppArmor or SELinux profiles.
        *   Consider using alternative methods for container management from within containers, such as the Docker API over TLS.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Some services within the stack might have default credentials that are publicly known.
    *   **How docker-ci-tool-stack contributes:** The stack deploys these services, and if the underlying Docker images for services like Nexus are used without changing default administrative credentials upon initial setup, it introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Nexus web interface and uses the default username and password to log in with administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the affected service, data breaches, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change any default credentials for all services within the stack upon initial deployment.
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
