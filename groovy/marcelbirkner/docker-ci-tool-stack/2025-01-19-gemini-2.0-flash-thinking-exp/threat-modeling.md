# Threat Model Analysis for marcelbirkner/docker-ci-tool-stack

## Threat: [Vulnerable Base Images](./threats/vulnerable_base_images.md)

1. **Threat:** Vulnerable Base Images
    * **Description:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` utilizes specific base Docker images for its components (e.g., Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus). If the maintainers of the `docker-ci-tool-stack` choose base images with known vulnerabilities and don't update them regularly, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code within the containers.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the affected CI/CD component, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of build processes, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** Base images of all containers within the `docker-ci-tool-stack` (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, etc.).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the `docker-ci-tool-stack` to benefit from updated base images.
        * Review the Dockerfiles used in the `docker-ci-tool-stack` and consider using more secure or minimal base images.
        * Implement automated vulnerability scanning for container images and update the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s configuration to use patched base images.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Compromise of Container Images](./threats/supply_chain_compromise_of_container_images.md)

2. **Threat:** Supply Chain Compromise of Container Images
    * **Description:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` relies on pulling container images from specified repositories. If the maintainers' accounts or the repositories themselves are compromised, malicious actors could inject backdoors or malware into the images used by the stack. Users deploying the `docker-ci-tool-stack` would then unknowingly run compromised images.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the CI/CD pipeline, potential for injecting malicious code into application builds, data exfiltration, and long-term persistence within the infrastructure.
    * **Affected Component:** Docker image references within the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s configuration (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Verify the integrity and authenticity of the container images used by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`. Check for image signatures or use trusted registries.
        * Monitor the `docker-ci-tool-stack` repository for any suspicious changes to image references.
        * Consider building custom container images based on the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s configuration but from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

3. **Threat:** Insecure Default Configurations
    * **Description:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` might ship with insecure default configurations for the services it deploys (e.g., default passwords for Jenkins admin, exposed management interfaces without authentication). Attackers could exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized access to the CI/CD tools.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to CI/CD tools, manipulation of build pipelines, potential for injecting malicious code, and data breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration files and default settings provided within the `docker-ci-tool-stack` for services like Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Change all default passwords and credentials for the services deployed by the `docker-ci-tool-stack` immediately upon deployment.
        * Review and harden the configuration of each service according to security best practices, overriding the defaults provided by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
        * The `docker-ci-tool-stack` should provide clear instructions on how to secure default configurations.

## Threat: [Data Exposure in Persistent Volumes Configured by the Stack](./threats/data_exposure_in_persistent_volumes_configured_by_the_stack.md)

4. **Threat:** Data Exposure in Persistent Volumes Configured by the Stack
    * **Description:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` defines persistent volumes for its components. If these volume configurations are not secure, an attacker gaining access to the host system or a compromised container could access sensitive data stored within these volumes (e.g., Jenkins home directory, Nexus storage).
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive code, build artifacts, and potentially secrets or credentials managed by the CI/CD tools.
    * **Affected Component:** Persistent volume configurations defined in the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s `docker-compose.yml` or similar files.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement proper access controls on the host system where the persistent volumes defined by the `docker-ci-tool-stack` are stored.
        * Consider encrypting sensitive data within these persistent volumes.
        * Review the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s documentation for recommendations on securing persistent data.

## Threat: [Insecure Secrets Management within the Stack's Configuration](./threats/insecure_secrets_management_within_the_stack's_configuration.md)

5. **Threat:** Insecure Secrets Management within the Stack's Configuration
    * **Description:** The `docker-ci-tool-stack` might store secrets (passwords, API keys) insecurely within its configuration files (e.g., `docker-compose.yml`), environment variables, or even within the container images themselves. This could lead to easy discovery by attackers.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, compromise of application credentials managed by the CI/CD tools, and potential data breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration files, environment variable settings, and potentially Dockerfiles within the `docker-ci-tool-stack`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid storing secrets directly in the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s configuration files or environment variables.
        * The `docker-ci-tool-stack` should provide guidance on secure secrets management. Utilize secure secrets management solutions and integrate them with the stack.
        * Ensure secrets are not committed to version control if you are modifying the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s files.

## Threat: [Outdated Software within Containers Managed by the Stack](./threats/outdated_software_within_containers_managed_by_the_stack.md)

6. **Threat:** Outdated Software within Containers Managed by the Stack
    * **Description:** While base images are a factor, the `docker-ci-tool-stack` might not have a robust mechanism for updating the software packages *within* the running containers. If the stack doesn't facilitate or encourage regular updates, the containers could become vulnerable to exploits targeting outdated software.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the affected container, potentially leading to remote code execution or data breaches within the CI/CD environment.
    * **Affected Component:** Software packages installed within the container images as defined or managed by the `docker-ci-tool-stack`'s build process.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * The `docker-ci-tool-stack` should provide guidance or mechanisms for updating software packages within the containers.
        * Regularly rebuild the container images used by the `docker-ci-tool-stack` to incorporate the latest security patches.
        * Implement automated checks for outdated software within the running containers.
