### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Manipulate Jenkins Build Jobs [HIGH RISK]

This attack path focuses on compromising the integrity and control of the Jenkins build process. A successful attacker can leverage this to inject malicious code, steal sensitive information, or disrupt the application's deployment pipeline.

**4.1. Potential Attack Vectors and Steps:**

To manipulate Jenkins build jobs, an attacker could potentially follow these steps:

* **4.1.1. Gain Unauthorized Access to Jenkins:** This is a prerequisite for manipulating build jobs. Possible methods include:
    * **4.1.1.1. Credential Compromise:**
        * **Brute-force or dictionary attacks:** Attempting to guess usernames and passwords.
        * **Phishing:** Tricking legitimate users into revealing their credentials.
        * **Exploiting weak or default credentials:**  Jenkins installations with default admin passwords.
        * **Credential stuffing:** Using compromised credentials from other breaches.
    * **4.1.1.2. Exploiting Jenkins Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Unpatched Jenkins core vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known security flaws in the Jenkins software itself.
        * **Vulnerable Jenkins plugins:** Exploiting security flaws in installed plugins.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into Jenkins web pages to steal session cookies or execute actions on behalf of authenticated users.
    * **4.1.1.3. Network-Based Attacks:**
        * **Exploiting network vulnerabilities:** Gaining access to the network where Jenkins is hosted and then accessing the Jenkins instance.
        * **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks:** Intercepting and manipulating communication between users and the Jenkins server.
    * **4.1.1.4. Insider Threat:** A malicious insider with legitimate access to Jenkins.

* **4.1.2. Modify Existing Build Job Configurations:** Once inside Jenkins, the attacker can modify existing job configurations to inject malicious steps.
    * **4.1.2.1. Inject Malicious Shell Commands:** Adding commands to the build script that execute arbitrary code on the build agent. This could involve:
        * **Downloading and executing malware.**
        * **Stealing secrets and credentials stored in environment variables or files.**
        * **Modifying application code before deployment.**
        * **Creating backdoors for persistent access.**
    * **4.1.2.2. Modify Pipeline Scripts (Jenkinsfile):** If using Pipeline as Code, the attacker can alter the `Jenkinsfile` to introduce malicious stages or steps. This allows for more sophisticated and persistent attacks.
    * **4.1.2.3. Modify Build Parameters:** Altering parameters passed to the build process to influence its behavior in a malicious way.
    * **4.1.2.4. Change Repository URLs:**  Pointing the build job to a malicious repository containing compromised code.

* **4.1.3. Create New Malicious Build Jobs:** The attacker can create entirely new build jobs designed for malicious purposes.
    * **4.1.3.1. Data Exfiltration Jobs:** Jobs designed to collect and exfiltrate sensitive data from the build environment or connected systems.
    * **4.1.3.2. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Jobs:** Jobs that consume excessive resources, disrupting the Jenkins server or build agents.
    * **4.1.3.3. Backdoor Deployment Jobs:** Jobs that deploy backdoors or malicious components into the target environment.

* **4.1.4. Manipulate Build Artifacts:**  The attacker might attempt to modify the final build artifacts before they are deployed.
    * **4.1.4.1. Injecting Malware into Docker Images:** Modifying the Dockerfile or build process to include malicious software in the final image.
    * **4.1.4.2. Replacing legitimate artifacts with compromised ones.**

**4.2. Potential Impact:**

Successful manipulation of Jenkins build jobs can have severe consequences:

* **Compromised Application Integrity:** Malicious code injected into the build process can lead to the deployment of compromised applications, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or further exploitation of end-users.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can steal sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or customer data, that might be accessible during the build process or stored within the Jenkins environment.
* **Supply Chain Attack:** By compromising the build process, attackers can inject malicious code into the software supply chain, affecting all users of the application.
* **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can disrupt the build process, preventing new deployments and impacting the availability of the application.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  Recovery costs, legal repercussions, and loss of business can result from a successful attack.
* **Backdoor Installation:** Attackers can establish persistent access to the infrastructure through backdoors injected during the build process.

**4.3. Likelihood Assessment:**

The likelihood of this attack path being successful depends on several factors:

* **Strength of Jenkins Security Configuration:**  Are strong passwords enforced? Is multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled? Are access controls properly configured?
* **Patching and Update Status:** Is the Jenkins core and its plugins kept up-to-date with the latest security patches?
* **Network Security:** Is the Jenkins instance properly segmented and protected by firewalls?
* **Security Awareness Training:** Are developers and administrators aware of the risks and best practices for securing Jenkins?
* **Monitoring and Auditing:** Are build job configurations and executions monitored for suspicious activity?

Given the potential for misconfiguration and the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities, the likelihood of this attack path being exploitable can be considered **moderate to high** if proper security measures are not in place.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies:**
