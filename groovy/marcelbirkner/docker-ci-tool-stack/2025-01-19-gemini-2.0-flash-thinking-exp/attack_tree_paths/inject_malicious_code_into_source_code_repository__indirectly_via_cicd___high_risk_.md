### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject Malicious Code into Source Code Repository (Indirectly via CI/CD) [HIGH RISK]

**Description:** By compromising the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins), attackers can automate the process of committing malicious code into the source code repository, which will then be built and deployed.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Initial Compromise of CI/CD Pipeline:** The attacker's primary goal is to gain control over the CI/CD system. This can be achieved through various means:
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in CI/CD Software:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in Jenkins, GitLab CI, or other CI/CD tools can be exploited.
    * **Compromising CI/CD Server Credentials:**  Weak passwords, leaked API keys, or phishing attacks targeting CI/CD administrators can grant access.
    * **Malicious Plugins/Extensions:**  Installing compromised or malicious plugins within the CI/CD environment.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks on CI/CD Dependencies:**  Compromising dependencies used by the CI/CD system itself.
    * **Insider Threats:**  Malicious actions by individuals with legitimate access to the CI/CD system.
    * **Network-Based Attacks:**  Exploiting network vulnerabilities to gain access to the CI/CD server.

2. **Gaining Persistence and Control:** Once initial access is gained, the attacker will likely aim to establish persistence and gain more control over the CI/CD pipeline. This might involve:
    * **Creating New Administrative Accounts:**  Ensuring continued access even if the initial entry point is closed.
    * **Modifying CI/CD Configurations:**  Altering job configurations, build scripts, or deployment pipelines.
    * **Installing Backdoors:**  Creating mechanisms for remote access and control.

3. **Injecting Malicious Code into the Build Process:**  The attacker leverages their control over the CI/CD pipeline to introduce malicious code. This can happen in several ways:
    * **Modifying Build Scripts:**  Altering scripts to download and execute malicious payloads, inject code into application files, or modify build artifacts.
    * **Introducing Malicious Dependencies:**  Adding compromised or malicious libraries or packages to the project's dependency management file (e.g., `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).
    * **Modifying Dockerfiles:**  Injecting malicious commands into Dockerfiles to be executed during the image build process.
    * **Compromising Build Tools:**  If the CI/CD pipeline uses specific build tools, attackers might try to compromise those tools to inject code during the build.

4. **Automated Commit to Source Code Repository:**  The compromised CI/CD pipeline is then used to automatically commit the malicious code to the source code repository. This can be done by:
    * **Using CI/CD User Credentials:**  The CI/CD system often has credentials to commit changes to the repository. The attacker can leverage these.
    * **Impersonating Developers:**  In some cases, the CI/CD system might be configured to commit changes under specific developer identities.
    * **Modifying Existing Commits:**  More sophisticated attacks might involve altering existing commits to hide the malicious changes.

5. **Triggering Build and Deployment:** Once the malicious code is in the repository, the regular CI/CD process will automatically trigger a build and deployment. This ensures the malicious code is integrated into the application.

6. **Deployment of Malicious Code:** The compromised build artifacts, containing the injected malicious code, are then deployed to the target environment.

**Attack Vectors Specific to `docker-ci-tool-stack` Context:**

* **Jenkins Vulnerabilities:**  If Jenkins is used as the CI/CD server, known vulnerabilities in Jenkins itself or its plugins are prime targets.
* **Insecure Jenkins Configuration:**  Default or weak configurations of Jenkins, such as open access or lack of proper authentication, can be exploited.
* **Compromised Docker Images:**  If the CI/CD pipeline pulls base images from public registries, attackers could potentially inject malicious code into those images.
* **Lack of Secret Management:**  If sensitive credentials for accessing the source code repository or other systems are stored insecurely within the CI/CD configuration, they can be compromised.
* **Insufficient Access Controls:**  Lack of proper role-based access control within the CI/CD system can allow unauthorized users to modify critical configurations.

**Potential Impact:**

* **Data Breach:**  The injected malicious code could be designed to steal sensitive data from the application or its environment.
* **Service Disruption:**  Malicious code could cause the application to crash or become unavailable.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  If the compromised application is used by other organizations, the malicious code could propagate further.
* **Financial Loss:**  Recovery from a successful attack can be costly, involving incident response, remediation, and potential legal repercussions.
* **Loss of Intellectual Property:**  Malicious code could be used to exfiltrate valuable intellectual property.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Regular Security Audits of CI/CD Infrastructure:**  Periodically assess the security configuration of the CI/CD server and related components.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the CI/CD server and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**  Monitor network traffic and system logs for suspicious activity related to the CI/CD server.
* **Code Review and Static Analysis:**  Implement thorough code review processes and utilize static analysis tools to detect malicious code before it reaches the repository.
* **Monitoring CI/CD Activity:**  Track changes to CI/CD configurations, build scripts, and user accounts. Alert on unusual or unauthorized modifications.
* **Source Code Repository Monitoring:**  Monitor commit history for unexpected or suspicious commits.
* **Artifact Analysis:**  Scan build artifacts (e.g., Docker images) for malware or vulnerabilities.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Collect and analyze logs from various CI/CD components to identify potential security incidents.
* **Behavioral Analysis:**  Establish baselines for normal CI/CD activity and detect deviations that might indicate an attack.

**Prevention and Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Harden CI/CD Infrastructure:**
    * Keep CI/CD software and plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA).
