Successful execution of this attack can lead to various severe consequences, including data breaches, system compromise, and supply chain attacks.

Here's a breakdown of potential attack vectors and their implications:

**4.1 Attack Vectors:**

* **Compromised Source Code Repository:**
    * **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and modifies source code to include malicious code or dependencies.
    * **Mechanism:** Exploiting weak credentials, social engineering, or vulnerabilities in the repository platform.
    * **Impact:**  Malicious code is integrated into the application from the beginning, potentially leading to backdoors, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    * **Example:** Injecting a script that exfiltrates environment variables or introduces a vulnerability.

* **Malicious Dependencies:**
    * **Description:** Introducing malicious or compromised third-party libraries or packages into the project's dependencies.
    * **Mechanism:**  Typosquatting (using similar names to legitimate packages), dependency confusion attacks (exploiting private/public repository precedence), or compromised maintainer accounts.
    * **Impact:**  The malicious dependency is included in the build process and deployed with the application, potentially executing arbitrary code or introducing vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:**  A malicious logging library that sends sensitive data to an attacker's server.

* **Compromised Build Environment:**
    * **Description:** Gaining control over the build environment (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI runners) to inject malicious code during the build process.
    * **Mechanism:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform, compromising build agent credentials, or injecting malicious configuration.
    * **Impact:**  Malicious code is introduced during the build process, potentially modifying artifacts before they are deployed.
    * **Example:**  Modifying the Dockerfile to include a backdoor or injecting malicious scripts during the build steps.

* **Malicious Base Images:**
    * **Description:** Using compromised or backdoored base Docker images in the application's Dockerfile.
    * **Mechanism:**  Pulling images from untrusted registries or using outdated images with known vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:**  The application inherits the vulnerabilities or malicious code present in the base image.
    * **Example:**  A base image containing a pre-installed backdoor or a vulnerable system library.

* **Compromised Artifact Storage:**
    * **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the artifact storage (e.g., Docker Registry, artifact repositories) and replacing legitimate artifacts with malicious ones.
    * **Mechanism:** Exploiting weak credentials, insecure storage configurations, or vulnerabilities in the registry platform.
    * **Impact:**  When the application is deployed, the malicious artifact is used, leading to compromise.
    * **Example:**  Replacing a legitimate Docker image with a backdoored version.

* **Malicious Deployment Scripts:**
    * **Description:** Injecting malicious code into deployment scripts or configuration management tools.
    * **Mechanism:**  Compromising credentials used for deployment, exploiting vulnerabilities in deployment tools, or social engineering.
    * **Impact:**  Malicious code is executed during the deployment process, potentially compromising the target environment.
    * **Example:**  A deployment script that creates a backdoor user or modifies firewall rules.

* **Supply Chain Attacks on Build Tools:**
    * **Description:**  Compromising the tools used in the build process (e.g., compilers, linters, security scanners).
    * **Mechanism:**  Targeting the developers or infrastructure of these tools to inject malicious code that affects all users.
    * **Impact:**  Malicious code is silently introduced into the build process, making it difficult to detect.
    * **Example:**  A compromised compiler that injects a backdoor into every compiled binary.

**4.2 Potential Impact:**

The successful injection of malicious artifacts can have severe consequences:

* **Data Breach:**  Malicious code can be designed to steal sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, and proprietary data.
* **System Compromise:**  Attackers can gain control over the application's infrastructure, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, and disrupt services.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A security breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization and erode customer trust.
* **Financial Loss:**  Incidents can lead to significant financial losses due to recovery costs, legal fees, and business disruption.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised artifacts can be distributed to downstream users or customers, potentially affecting a wider range of systems.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious artifacts can be designed to overload resources and make the application unavailable.

**4.3 Likelihood of Success:**

The likelihood of success for this attack path depends on the security measures implemented throughout the CI/CD pipeline. Factors that increase the likelihood include:

* **Weak Access Controls:** Insufficient authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing repositories, build environments, and artifact storage.
