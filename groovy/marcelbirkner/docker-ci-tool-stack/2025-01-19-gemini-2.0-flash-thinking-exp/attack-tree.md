## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate success for the attacker. It signifies that they have gained unauthorized access and control over the target application, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in CI/CD Pipeline Components [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_cicd_pipeline_components__high_risk_.md)

This path focuses on leveraging weaknesses within the tools that build, test, and deploy the application. Compromising any of these components can have cascading effects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Jenkins Instance [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_jenkins_instance__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

Jenkins is the central automation server. Gaining control here allows attackers to manipulate the entire CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jenkins Security Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jenkins_security_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_plugin_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins, which are often easier to find and exploit than core vulnerabilities. This can grant them initial access to the Jenkins instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Jenkins Security Settings [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_jenkins_security_settings__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Access Jenkins API without Authentication [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/access_jenkins_api_without_authentication__high_risk_.md)

If the Jenkins API is not properly secured, attackers can directly interact with it to create jobs, trigger builds, or extract sensitive information without needing valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Jenkins Build Jobs [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_jenkins_build_jobs__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Build Steps [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_build_steps__high_risk_.md)

Attackers can modify existing build jobs or create new ones to inject malicious commands or scripts that will be executed during the build process, potentially compromising the application or infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Build Configuration to Introduce Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_build_configuration_to_introduce_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

Attackers can alter the build configuration to introduce vulnerable dependencies, disable security checks, or modify deployment settings, leading to a compromised application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Nexus Repository Manager [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_nexus_repository_manager__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

Nexus stores build artifacts and dependencies. Compromising it allows attackers to inject malicious components into the application supply chain.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Nexus Security Settings [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_nexus_security_settings__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Access Nexus API without Authentication [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/access_nexus_api_without_authentication__high_risk_.md)

Similar to Jenkins, an unsecured Nexus API allows attackers to upload, download, or modify artifacts without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Artifacts [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_artifacts__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Backdoored Libraries/Dependencies [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/upload_backdoored_librariesdependencies__high_risk_.md)

Attackers can upload malicious libraries or dependencies disguised as legitimate ones, which will then be included in the application build.

## Attack Tree Path: [Replace Legitimate Artifacts with Malicious Ones [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/replace_legitimate_artifacts_with_malicious_ones__high_risk_.md)

Attackers can replace genuine build artifacts with compromised versions, ensuring that a vulnerable or backdoored application is deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Vulnerabilities Through CI/CD Process [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_vulnerabilities_through_cicd_process__high_risk_.md)

This path focuses on using the legitimate CI/CD process to inject vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Source Code Repository (Indirectly via CI/CD) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_source_code_repository__indirectly_via_cicd___high_risk_.md)

By compromising the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins), attackers can automate the process of committing malicious code into the source code repository, which will then be built and deployed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Vulnerabilities via Automated Build Process [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_vulnerabilities_via_automated_build_process__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Dependencies during Build [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_dependencies_during_build__high_risk_.md)

Attackers can manipulate dependency management configurations or use compromised CI/CD tools to introduce malicious external libraries during the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Build Scripts to Introduce Backdoors [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_build_scripts_to_introduce_backdoors__high_risk_.md)

Attackers can alter the build scripts to inject backdoors or vulnerabilities directly into the application code during the compilation or packaging stages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Exposed CI/CD Artifacts [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_exposed_cicd_artifacts__high_risk_.md)

This path involves exploiting weaknesses in how CI/CD artifacts are stored and managed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Unsecured Build Artifacts [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/access_unsecured_build_artifacts__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Download Sensitive Information from Publicly Accessible Artifact Storage [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/download_sensitive_information_from_publicly_accessible_artifact_storage__high_risk_.md)

If build artifacts are stored in publicly accessible locations without proper authentication, attackers can download them and potentially extract sensitive information or find vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Unsecured Deployment Credentials [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/access_unsecured_deployment_credentials__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Extract Deployment Credentials from Build Logs or Artifacts [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/extract_deployment_credentials_from_build_logs_or_artifacts__high_risk_.md)

If deployment credentials are inadvertently stored in build logs or artifacts, attackers can easily retrieve them and use them to deploy malicious versions of the application or access the production environment.
