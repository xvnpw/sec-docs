# Threat Model Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** Attacker might gain access to sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secrets if these are stored in Gretty configuration files (e.g., `build.gradle`, external property files) and these files are inadvertently exposed. This could happen through accidental commit to public version control, insecure file permissions on developer machines, or if a developer's machine is compromised.

**Impact:** Compromise of development databases, unauthorized access to internal APIs, exposure of sensitive application logic, potential for wider system compromise if leaked credentials are reused elsewhere.

**Gretty Component Affected:** Gretty configuration loading and handling, `build.gradle` and related configuration files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in `build.gradle` or committed configuration files.
*   Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions to handle sensitive configuration.
*   Ensure `.gitignore` or equivalent version control ignore files properly exclude sensitive configuration files.
*   Implement proper file system permissions on developer machines to protect configuration files.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Embedded Server (Jetty/Tomcat)](./threats/misconfiguration_of_embedded_server__jettytomcat_.md)

**Description:** Attacker might exploit vulnerabilities arising from insecure configurations applied to the embedded Jetty/Tomcat server through Gretty's configuration options. This could include exploiting weak cipher suites, disabled security headers, or misconfigured access controls defined via Gretty's `servletContainer` settings.

**Impact:** Vulnerabilities inherent in Jetty/Tomcat become exploitable, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, session hijacking, or even remote code execution depending on the specific misconfiguration and vulnerability.

**Gretty Component Affected:** Gretty's `servletContainer` configuration, embedded Jetty/Tomcat server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and configure Jetty/Tomcat settings within `gretty.servletContainer`.
*   Follow security best practices for Jetty/Tomcat configuration, consulting official documentation.
*   Use security scanning tools to identify potential misconfigurations in the embedded server.
*   Regularly update Gretty and embedded server versions to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Gretty Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_gretty_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attacker might exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries and plugins that Gretty depends on (e.g., specific versions of Jetty, Tomcat, Gradle plugins). This could be achieved by targeting known exploits for these dependencies if they are present in the development environment or if vulnerable dependencies are inadvertently included in build artifacts.

**Impact:** Exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities could lead to various security issues, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution on the developer's machine or potentially in deployed applications if vulnerable dependencies are carried over.

**Gretty Component Affected:** Gretty's dependency management, Gradle dependency resolution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Gretty plugin to the latest version.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify vulnerable dependencies in the project and Gretty's dependencies.
*   Keep Gradle version updated.
*   Monitor security advisories for Gretty and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious or Compromised Gretty Plugin](./threats/malicious_or_compromised_gretty_plugin.md)

**Description:** Attacker might distribute a malicious or compromised version of the Gretty plugin (e.g., through a supply chain attack, compromised repository, or phishing). If developers unknowingly use this malicious plugin, it could execute arbitrary code during the build process, potentially injecting backdoors, stealing credentials, or manipulating build artifacts.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of developer machines, theft of source code, injection of malicious code into applications, supply chain attacks affecting multiple projects using the compromised plugin.

**Gretty Component Affected:** Gretty plugin distribution and installation, Gradle plugin resolution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use the official Gretty plugin from trusted sources (e.g., Gradle Plugin Portal, Maven Central).
*   Verify plugin checksums or signatures if available.
*   Be cautious about using forks or unofficial versions of the plugin.
*   Implement code review for build scripts and plugin configurations.
*   Use dependency management tools that can verify plugin integrity.

## Threat: [Tampering with Build Artifacts](./threats/tampering_with_build_artifacts.md)

**Description:** Attacker might compromise the Gradle build process using Gretty (e.g., through a malicious plugin, compromised build environment, or by directly modifying build scripts) to tamper with the resulting build artifacts (WAR files, exploded directories). This could involve injecting malicious code, backdoors, or altering application logic.

**Impact:** Distribution of compromised application artifacts, potentially leading to security breaches in environments where these artifacts are deployed. Even if primarily for development, compromised artifacts could be accidentally deployed or used in testing.

**Gretty Component Affected:** Gradle build process integration, Gretty plugin's build tasks, overall build environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the build environment and infrastructure.
*   Implement code review for build scripts and plugin configurations.
*   Use trusted and verified plugins and build tools.
*   Implement build artifact integrity checks (e.g., signing, checksum verification).
*   Regularly audit the build process for security vulnerabilities.
