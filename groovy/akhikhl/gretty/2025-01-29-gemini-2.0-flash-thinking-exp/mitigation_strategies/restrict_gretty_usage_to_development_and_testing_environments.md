    *   **Opportunities:**
        *   **Integration with Existing CI/CD:**  Can be seamlessly integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines.
        *   **Extend to Other Development-Only Tools:**  Checks can be expanded to detect other development-specific tools or configurations that should not be in production.
        *   **Static Analysis Integration:**  Integrate static analysis tools to enhance the detection of Gretty and related configurations.
    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Check Bypasses:**  Sophisticated attackers or unintentional misconfigurations might bypass the checks.
        *   **False Negatives:**  Checks might fail to detect Gretty if implemented incorrectly or incompletely.
        *   **Maintenance Overhead:**  Checks require ongoing maintenance to remain effective as build configurations evolve.
