# Attack Surface Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Development Web Server due to Gretty Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposed_development_web_server_due_to_gretty_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Gretty's configuration options can lead to the embedded development web server being unintentionally exposed beyond the developer's local machine, creating a high-risk attack surface.

    *   **Gretty Contribution:** Gretty's `httpInterface` configuration in `build.gradle` directly controls the network interface the embedded server binds to. Misconfiguration (e.g., setting it to `0.0.0.0` or a public IP) directly causes exposure.

    *   **Example:** A developer, misunderstanding Gretty's `httpInterface` setting, configures it to `0.0.0.0` to access the development server from another device on their local network. However, this also inadvertently exposes the server to the wider network or even the internet if the development machine is not properly firewalled. An attacker can then access the development application.

    *   **Impact:**  If the development application is exposed, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the application or the embedded server, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service. Development environments often lack production-level security hardening, increasing the impact.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (if exposed to public internet or sensitive internal networks).

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly Bind to `localhost`:** Ensure `gretty.httpInterface` is explicitly set to `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` in `build.gradle` to restrict access to the local machine only.
        *   **Review Network Bindings:** Carefully review the configured `httpInterface` and `httpPort` in `build.gradle` to confirm the server is binding to the intended interface and port.
        *   **Network Security Best Practices:** Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to prevent external access to development machines, regardless of Gretty configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Embedded Servlet Container Managed by Gretty](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_embedded_servlet_container_managed_by_gretty.md)

*   **Description:** Gretty's reliance on embedded servlet containers (Jetty or Tomcat) introduces a critical attack surface if Gretty uses outdated or vulnerable versions of these dependencies.

    *   **Gretty Contribution:** Gretty manages the inclusion of Jetty or Tomcat as dependencies. If Gretty's dependency management is not up-to-date, or if specific Gretty versions are bundled with vulnerable servlet container versions, it directly exposes the development environment to these vulnerabilities.

    *   **Example:** Gretty bundles or defaults to an older version of Jetty that has a publicly known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability on the exposed development server (as described in the previous point) to gain complete control of the development machine.

    *   **Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the embedded servlet container can lead to **Critical** impacts, including:
        *   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the development server.
        *   **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to complete compromise of the development machine and potentially the wider development environment.
        *   **Data Breach and Lateral Movement:** Attackers can access sensitive data, source code, and potentially use the compromised machine to move laterally within the network.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**. Vulnerabilities in embedded servlet containers, especially RCE vulnerabilities, are considered critical.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always Use Latest Gretty Version:** Upgrade to the latest stable version of Gretty, as plugin updates often include updates to embedded servlet container dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Explicitly Manage Servlet Container Version (if possible):** If Gretty allows, explicitly manage the version of Jetty or Tomcat used in your `build.gradle` to ensure you are using the latest patched and secure versions.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning tools into your development pipeline to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in Gretty's dependencies, including the embedded servlet container.
        *   **Regular Updates and Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for security advisories related to Gretty and its embedded servlet container dependencies and apply updates promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities in Gretty Itself](./attack_surfaces/plugin-specific_vulnerabilities_in_gretty_itself.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within the Gretty plugin code itself can introduce a high-risk attack surface, potentially allowing attackers to compromise the build process or development environment.

    *   **Gretty Contribution:** This attack surface is inherent to the Gretty plugin's codebase. Bugs or security flaws in Gretty's Gradle plugin logic are directly exploitable if an attacker can influence the Gradle build process or interact with the development environment where Gretty is used.

    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in Gretty's code parsing or handling of specific Gradle configurations could allow an attacker to inject malicious code that gets executed during the Gradle build. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or the build server.

    *   **Impact:** Plugin-specific vulnerabilities can have **High** to **Critical** impacts:
        *   **Code Injection and Remote Code Execution:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Gretty could lead to arbitrary code execution during the build process.
        *   **Build Process Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate the build process to inject backdoors, steal credentials, or modify application artifacts.
        *   **Supply Chain Risks:** Compromised build processes can introduce supply chain risks, potentially affecting the security of the final application artifacts.

    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**, depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability. Code injection and RCE vulnerabilities are **Critical**.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Latest Stable Gretty Version:**  Always use the latest stable version of Gretty to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Monitor Gretty Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any reported security vulnerabilities in Gretty by monitoring the project's GitHub repository and security-related communications.
        *   **Secure Build Environment:**  Harden the build environment itself to limit the impact of potential plugin vulnerabilities. Use secure build servers and restrict access to the build environment.
        *   **Code Review and Security Audits (for plugin developers/maintainers):** For Gretty plugin developers and maintainers, rigorous code review and security audits are crucial to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities.
