# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Gretty Usage to Development and Testing Environments](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_gretty_usage_to_development_and_testing_environments.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Development-Only Gretty Plugin Usage
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Document Gretty Usage Policy:** Clearly document in project documentation (e.g., README, development guidelines) that the `gretty` Gradle plugin is intended and supported *only* for local development and testing purposes. Explicitly state it should *not* be used in production environments or production-like deployments.
    2.  **Separate Gradle Build Configurations:**  Structure your Gradle build files (e.g., using `build.gradle` for development and `build.gradle.prod` or build profiles) to ensure the `gretty` plugin and its configurations are included *only* in development-related build configurations. Production build configurations should explicitly exclude the `gretty` plugin and include configurations for a production-grade application server.
    3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Checks for Gretty Plugin:** Implement automated checks within your Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. These checks should verify that the `gretty` plugin is *not* present in the build configuration used for production deployments. This can involve scanning `build.gradle` files or checking for specific Gretty tasks or configurations. Fail the build process if Gretty is detected in production builds.
    4.  **Code Review Focus on Gretty Usage:** During code reviews, specifically check for any accidental inclusion of `gretty` plugin configurations or dependencies in branches intended for production deployment. Ensure developers are aware of the development-only policy for Gretty.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Accidental Production Deployment with Gretty (High Severity):** Deploying an application configured with the `gretty` plugin to a production environment. This exposes the application to vulnerabilities inherent in development-focused tools, lacks production-grade security features, and may have performance and stability issues unsuitable for production workloads.
    *   **Configuration Drift Related to Gretty (Medium Severity):** Inconsistent build configurations between development (using Gretty) and production (using a different server) can lead to unexpected behavior and security gaps when moving from development to production.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Accidental Production Deployment with Gretty:** Eliminates the risk by enforcing clear separation and automated prevention.
    *   **Configuration Drift Related to Gretty:** Significantly reduces the risk by establishing distinct build configurations and validation steps.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Documentation mentions Gretty for development, and separate build profiles are used for different environments.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline specifically looking for the presence of the `gretty` plugin in production builds are missing. Explicit checks within deployment scripts to prevent Gretty usage in production are also not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden Gretty's Embedded Server Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/harden_gretty's_embedded_server_configurations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Default Settings of Gretty's Embedded Server (Jetty/Tomcat)
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Configure Gretty to Bind to Localhost:** Within the `gretty` configuration block in your `build.gradle` file, explicitly set the `host` property to `'localhost'` or `'127.0.0.1'`. This ensures that the embedded Jetty or Tomcat server started by Gretty only listens for connections on the local machine, preventing unintended network exposure during development.
    2.  **Disable Directory Listing in Embedded Server:** Review the default configuration of the embedded Jetty or Tomcat server used by Gretty. If directory listing is enabled by default, explicitly disable it. This might involve configuring `web.xml` or server-specific configuration files that Gretty utilizes. Disabling directory listing prevents information disclosure of application structure and files.
    3.  **Minimize Access Logging in Embedded Server:** Configure the logging settings of the embedded Jetty or Tomcat server within Gretty to an appropriate level for development debugging. Avoid overly verbose access logging that could inadvertently log sensitive data. Review log configuration files and reduce logging to essential information.
    4.  **Consider Basic Security Headers via Gretty Configuration (Development):** Explore if Gretty provides mechanisms to configure basic security headers for the embedded server, even in development mode. If possible, configure headers like `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` through Gretty's configuration options or by customizing the embedded server's configuration via Gretty.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Unintended External Network Access to Gretty Server (High Severity):** Gretty's default binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) can expose the development server to the network, potentially allowing unauthorized access from other machines on the network.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Directory Listing from Gretty Server (Medium Severity):** If directory listing is enabled in the embedded server, it can expose the application's directory structure and potentially sensitive files to anyone who can access the Gretty server.
    *   **Information Leakage via Excessive Logging from Gretty Server (Low to Medium Severity):** Verbose logs generated by the embedded server might inadvertently expose sensitive data or internal application details during development.
    *   **Basic Web Application Attacks on Gretty Server (Low Severity):** Lack of basic security headers, even in development, can make the application running on Gretty vulnerable to simple attacks like clickjacking or MIME-sniffing attacks during development and testing.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Unintended External Network Access to Gretty Server:** Eliminates the risk by restricting binding to localhost.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Directory Listing from Gretty Server:** Eliminates the risk by disabling directory listing.
    *   **Information Leakage via Excessive Logging from Gretty Server:** Reduces the risk by minimizing logging verbosity.
    *   **Basic Web Application Attacks on Gretty Server:** Partially mitigates the risk by adding basic security headers if configurable through Gretty.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Gretty is generally used on developer machines, implicitly limiting external access in many cases.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit configuration of `host = 'localhost'` within the `gretty` configuration in `build.gradle` is missing. Directory listing and logging configurations of the embedded server are not explicitly reviewed or hardened through Gretty's configuration. Security headers are not implemented even for development via Gretty configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage Embedded Server Dependencies Used by Gretty Securely](./mitigation_strategies/manage_embedded_server_dependencies_used_by_gretty_securely.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Dependency Management of Jetty/Tomcat within Gretty
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Explicitly Declare Jetty/Tomcat Version in Gradle:** In your `build.gradle` file, explicitly declare the version of Jetty or Tomcat that Gretty should use. Instead of relying on Gretty's default or transitive dependencies for the embedded server, directly specify the desired version. This provides greater control over the embedded server version and facilitates easier updates.
    2.  **Regularly Update Embedded Server Version:** Implement a process for regularly reviewing and updating the declared Jetty or Tomcat version used by Gretty. Stay informed about new releases and security updates for Jetty and Tomcat. Use dependency management tools and plugins (like Gradle versions plugin) to assist in identifying and updating outdated dependencies.
    3.  **Utilize Dependency Vulnerability Scanning for Gretty Dependencies:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning tools (like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or similar Gradle plugins) into your Gradle build process. Configure these tools to scan the dependencies of your project, including the embedded Jetty or Tomcat server used by Gretty. These tools can identify known security vulnerabilities in the embedded server and other dependencies.
    4.  **Monitor Security Advisories for Jetty and Tomcat:** Subscribe to security mailing lists, RSS feeds, or security advisory databases specifically for Jetty and Tomcat. This ensures you are promptly notified of any newly discovered vulnerabilities and security updates related to the embedded servers used by Gretty.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities in Embedded Jetty/Tomcat Server (High Severity):** Using outdated and vulnerable versions of Jetty or Tomcat (managed by Gretty) can expose the application to known exploits and attacks targeting these server components.
    *   **Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities in Gretty's Embedded Server (Medium Severity):** Vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies of Gretty or the embedded Jetty/Tomcat server can also introduce security risks into the development environment.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities in Embedded Jetty/Tomcat Server:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring timely updates to patched versions and proactive vulnerability detection.
    *   **Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities in Gretty's Embedded Server:** Partially mitigates the risk through vulnerability scanning and proactive dependency management practices focused on Gretty's dependencies.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency management is in place, but explicit version declaration for Jetty/Tomcat used by Gretty and automated vulnerability scanning specifically targeting Gretty's dependencies are not fully integrated.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicitly declaring the Jetty/Tomcat version used by Gretty in `build.gradle` is missing. Integration of dependency vulnerability scanning tools into the build process to specifically scan Gretty's embedded server dependencies is missing. A formal process for regularly updating the embedded server version used by Gretty based on security advisories is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Gretty Plugin Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_gretty_plugin_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Gretty Plugin Updates
*   **Description**:
    1.  **Establish a Plugin Update Process:** Create a defined process for regularly checking for and updating the `gretty` Gradle plugin to the latest stable version. This process should be integrated into your development workflow.
    2.  **Consider Automated Plugin Updates:** Explore using automated dependency update tools or Gradle plugins (like Dependabot or similar) to automatically detect and create pull requests for updates to the `gretty` plugin. This can streamline the update process and ensure timely patching.
    3.  **Review Gretty Plugin Release Notes Before Updating:** Before applying any updates to the `gretty` plugin, carefully review the release notes associated with the new version. Understand the changes, bug fixes, new features, and especially any security-related updates included in the release. Test plugin updates in a non-critical development environment before rolling them out to all developer machines.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated**:
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities in the Gretty Plugin Itself (Medium Severity):** Outdated versions of the `gretty` plugin might contain known security vulnerabilities within the plugin code that could be exploited, potentially affecting the development environment.
    *   **Lack of Security Patches and Bug Fixes in Gretty Plugin (Medium Severity):** Security patches and bug fixes for the `gretty` plugin are released in plugin updates. Not updating the plugin can leave the development environment vulnerable to known issues that have been addressed in newer versions.
*   **Impact**:
    *   **Security Vulnerabilities in the Gretty Plugin Itself:** Reduces the risk by ensuring timely updates and access to security patches for the plugin itself.
    *   **Lack of Security Patches and Bug Fixes in Gretty Plugin:** Reduces the risk by applying available security fixes and improvements included in plugin updates.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally encouraged to update plugins, but a formal, enforced process and automated checks specifically for the `gretty` plugin are missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A formal and consistently followed process for regularly checking and updating the `gretty` plugin is missing. Automated dependency update tools are not currently utilized for `gretty` plugin updates. Reviewing release notes before updating the Gretty plugin is not consistently enforced as part of the update process.
