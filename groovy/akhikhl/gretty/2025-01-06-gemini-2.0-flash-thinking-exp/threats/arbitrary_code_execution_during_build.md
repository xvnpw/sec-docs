        "    * **Secure Configuration:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in build configuration files. Use secure secrets management solutions.",
        "    * **Network Security:** Restrict network access from the build environment to only necessary resources. Use firewalls and network segmentation.",

        "    * **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust monitoring and logging of the build process to detect suspicious activity or errors.",
        "    * **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider using immutable infrastructure for the build environment, where changes are made by replacing components rather than modifying them in place.",
        "**Code Reviews for Build Scripts:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to `build.gradle` files and other build-related scripts to identify potentially malicious or insecure code.",
