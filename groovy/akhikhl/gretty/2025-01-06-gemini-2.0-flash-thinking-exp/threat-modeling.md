# Threat Model Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Threat: [Jetty Configuration Injection](./threats/jetty_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the Gretty plugin allows external input to directly influence the underlying Jetty configuration without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious configuration parameters. This could lead to arbitrary code execution (e.g., by configuring a malicious handler) or other security breaches.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the development server, complete compromise of the development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Gretty's configuration parameters are validated and sanitized before being passed to Jetty.
        *   Avoid allowing external, untrusted input to directly control Jetty configuration through Gretty.
        *   Keep the Gretty plugin updated as security vulnerabilities in configuration handling might be addressed in newer versions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data in `build.gradle`](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data_in__build_gradle_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys intended for development) directly within the `gretty` configuration block in `build.gradle`. If this file is committed to a version control system (especially a public one), these credentials could be exposed to attackers.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of development credentials, leading to unauthorized access to development resources or services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in `build.gradle`.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management solutions to manage sensitive configuration data.
        *   Ensure that `.gitignore` or similar mechanisms prevent the accidental commit of sensitive configuration files.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution During Build](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_during_build.md)

*   **Description:** If the Gretty plugin's execution process has vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code that gets executed during the Gradle build process. This could happen if Gretty processes untrusted input or dependencies in an insecure manner.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the developer's machine or the build environment, potential for supply chain attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Gretty plugin updated to the latest version to benefit from security fixes.
        *   Be cautious about using untrusted or unverified Gretty plugins or extensions.
        *   Implement security best practices for the build environment.
