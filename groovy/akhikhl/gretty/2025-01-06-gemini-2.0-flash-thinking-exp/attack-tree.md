## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Gretty Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_gretty_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a critical point of failure for application security.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the application, potential data breach, service disruption, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Gretty Configuration (e.g., build.gradle)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_gretty_configuration__e_g___build_gradle_.md)

*   **Description:** Successful access to the `build.gradle` file allows the attacker to manipulate Gretty's settings and the build process.
*   **Impact:** Enables exploitation of embedded server configuration, abuse of Gradle integration, and potentially file manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code or Files](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_or_files.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the successful injection of malicious code into the application's codebase or deployment.
*   **Impact:** Direct code execution on the server, application takeover, persistent backdoors, and potential data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Ability to Modify `build.gradle` or Included Gradle Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/gain_ability_to_modify__build_gradle__or_included_gradle_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to gaining access to Gretty configuration, but specifically focuses on the ability to alter Gradle build logic.
*   **Impact:** Enables arbitrary code execution during the build process, introduction of malicious dependencies, and manipulation of the application's build artifacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Gradle Tasks or Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_gradle_tasks_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Successful injection of malicious code through Gradle tasks or by introducing compromised dependencies.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution during build or runtime, potentially leading to full server compromise or introduction of vulnerabilities within the application itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gretty's Embedded Server Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gretty's_embedded_server_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the Gretty configuration and modify the embedded Jetty server settings to introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Disable Security Features:** Disabling authentication or CORS allows unauthorized access and cross-site scripting attacks.
    *   **Expose Sensitive Endpoints:** Exposing debugging or administrative interfaces without proper protection can lead to information disclosure and potential control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Gretty's File Handling and Deployment Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_gretty's_file_handling_and_deployment_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit Gretty's file handling to inject malicious code directly into the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Overwrite Existing Application Files with Malicious Content:** Replacing legitimate files with malicious ones leads to code execution when the application runs.
    *   **Introduce New Malicious Files (e.g., backdoors, web shells):** Adding new malicious files allows for persistent access and remote control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Gretty's Integration with Gradle](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_gretty's_integration_with_gradle.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the Gradle build process to execute malicious code or introduce vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Code During Gradle Build or Gretty Startup:** Injecting malicious Gradle tasks allows for code execution during the build or when Gretty starts the application.
    *   **Introduce Malicious Dependencies that are Executed by the Application:** Adding compromised dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities or execute malicious code when the application uses those dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Gretty's Hot Reloading/Auto-Deployment Features (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gretty's_hot_reloadingauto-deployment_features__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit the hot reloading or auto-deployment features to inject malicious code during the update process.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Replace Updated Files with Malicious Versions:** Replacing legitimate updated files with malicious versions before they are deployed.
    *   **Inject Malicious Code into Updated Files:** Modifying files during the update process to include malicious code.
