# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Limit Gretty Usage to Development Environments](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_limit_gretty_usage_to_development_environments.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Clearly document in project documentation (e.g., README, development guidelines) that Gretty is exclusively for development and testing purposes and must not be used in production environments. Emphasize that Gretty is a development-time plugin and not designed for production serving.
    *   Step 2:  Configure build scripts (Gradle, Maven, etc.) to explicitly prevent Gretty from being included in production build artifacts or deployment processes. This might involve using Gradle profiles or conditional logic to exclude the Gretty plugin and its configurations from production builds.
    *   Step 3:  Implement checks in CI/CD pipelines to verify that production deployments do not include Gretty configurations or dependencies. Fail deployments if Gretty-related configurations are detected in production build artifacts.
    *   Step 4:  Educate developers on the risks of using development tools like Gretty in production and reinforce the importance of separating development and production environments.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Production Exposure of Development Tooling: - Severity: High (If Gretty is used in production, it exposes development-oriented features and configurations, potentially leading to information disclosure, unexpected behavior, and increased attack surface. Gretty is not optimized for production security or performance.)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Production Exposure of Development Tooling: High Risk Reduction (Completely eliminates the threat if strictly enforced, ensuring Gretty is never active in production.)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Gradle build scripts and project documentation state Gretty is for development only.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Enforcement in CI/CD pipeline to automatically reject deployments with Gretty configurations to production environments. Automated checks in build process to flag inclusion of Gretty in production artifacts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Default Gretty Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_default_gretty_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Thoroughly review the default Gretty configurations in `build.gradle` or `gretty-config.groovy` files for each project. Understand each configuration option and its security implications within the development context.
    *   Step 2:  Disable or modify any default Gretty configurations that are not strictly necessary for development and could potentially introduce security risks, even in a development environment.  Specifically review:
        *   **Remote Debugging:** Ensure it is disabled by default and only enabled intentionally and temporarily when needed. Secure remote debugging access if enabled.
        *   **Hot Reloading/Automatic Deployment:** Understand the potential (though limited in Gretty's scope) security implications of these features and ensure they are used responsibly and not exposing sensitive information.
    *   Step 3:  Consider enabling HTTPS for development environments using Gretty by configuring `httpEnabled = false` and `httpsEnabled = true` in Gretty settings. This helps mimic production security practices and encourages secure development habits.
    *   Step 4:  Document the hardened Gretty configurations and the rationale behind them in project documentation or internal wikis to ensure consistency and understanding across the development team.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Unnecessary Features via Gretty: - Severity: Low (Disabling unnecessary Gretty features reduces the attack surface and potential for misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in those features, even in development.)
    *   Insecure Default Settings in Gretty: - Severity: Low to Medium (Hardening defaults ensures that development environments using Gretty are not running with insecure or overly permissive configurations provided by the plugin.)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Unnecessary Features via Gretty: Low Risk Reduction (Marginally reduces attack surface related to Gretty's features, primarily a preventative measure.)
    *   Insecure Default Settings in Gretty: Medium Risk Reduction (Improves the baseline security posture of development environments using Gretty by addressing potential insecure defaults.)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Basic review of configurations is done, but systematic hardening and documentation specifically for Gretty configurations are lacking. HTTPS for development using Gretty is not consistently enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Create a checklist or guidelines for reviewing and hardening Gretty configurations.  Enforce HTTPS for development environments using Gretty as a standard practice.  Document standard hardened Gretty configurations and best practices in project guidelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Keystore Management for HTTPS with Gretty](./mitigation_strategies/secure_keystore_management_for_https_with_gretty.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  If using HTTPS with Gretty for development (recommended), generate separate keystores specifically for development and testing purposes. Do not reuse production keystores with Gretty.
    *   Step 2:  Avoid committing development keystores directly to version control repositories.  This is crucial as Gretty configurations are often stored in version control.
    *   Step 3:  Use secure methods for distributing development keystores to developers who need to run Gretty with HTTPS. This could involve secure file transfer, password-protected archives shared through secure channels, or using dedicated secrets management tools (if appropriate for development secrets).
    *   Step 4:  Ensure that developers are instructed to store development keystores securely on their machines and avoid publicly accessible locations.
    *   Step 5:  Consider rotating development keystores periodically, even though they are not for production, as a general security hygiene practice.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Development Keystores via Gretty Configuration: - Severity: High (If keystores are inadvertently committed to version control alongside Gretty configurations, they could be exposed if the repository is compromised or becomes publicly accessible.)
    *   Unauthorized Use of Development Keystores: - Severity: Medium (If development keystores are not managed securely, they could be misused, although the impact is typically lower than production key compromise, it can still lead to trust issues in development workflows.)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Development Keystores via Gretty Configuration: High Risk Reduction (Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of keystores in version control, especially within Gretty configuration context.)
    *   Unauthorized Use of Development Keystores: Medium Risk Reduction (Reduces the risk of misuse by controlling distribution and storage of keystores used with Gretty.)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Developers are generally discouraged from committing keystores, but formal secure distribution and management processes specifically for Gretty development are not in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a secure keystore distribution process for development using secure channels or secrets management (if applicable).  Establish clear guidelines for secure storage and rotation of development keystores used with Gretty. Add checks to prevent keystore files from being committed to version control alongside Gretty configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Gretty Plugin Version](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_gretty_plugin_version.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Establish a process for regularly checking for updates to the Gretty Gradle plugin. This can be part of routine dependency updates or triggered by monitoring Gretty's GitHub repository for releases and security announcements.
    *   Step 2:  Update the Gretty plugin version in the project's `build.gradle` file to the latest stable release. Follow Gretty's release notes for any security-related updates or breaking changes.
    *   Step 3:  Test the application thoroughly after updating the Gretty plugin in the development environment to ensure compatibility and that no regressions are introduced in the development workflow.
    *   Step 4:  Monitor Gretty's release notes and security advisories (if any are published on their GitHub or related channels) for any reported vulnerabilities and promptly apply updates that address them.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Gretty Plugin: - Severity: Medium to High (Outdated Gretty plugin versions may contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited, potentially affecting the development environment or even indirectly impacting built artifacts if vulnerabilities are exploited during the build process.)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Gretty Plugin: Medium to High Risk Reduction (Addresses known vulnerabilities in the Gretty plugin itself, depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities fixed in updates. Keeps development tooling secure.)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Plugin updates are done periodically as part of general dependency updates, but not driven by a proactive vulnerability monitoring process specifically for Gretty.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Integrate Gretty plugin update checks into dependency vulnerability scanning processes.  Establish a process for reviewing Gretty release notes and security advisories (if available) for security-related information.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review Gretty Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_gretty_configurations.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Include `build.gradle` and `gretty-config.groovy` files (or equivalent configuration files where Gretty is configured) in the standard code review process for all project changes. Treat these configurations as code that requires security scrutiny.
    *   Step 2:  Train code reviewers to specifically look for security-related misconfigurations or deviations from hardened configuration standards in Gretty configurations. Provide reviewers with guidelines on secure Gretty configuration practices.
    *   Step 3:  Use code review checklists or create simple automated linters (if feasible) to help identify potential security issues in Gretty configurations, such as overly permissive settings or insecure feature usage.
    *   Step 4:  Ensure that code reviews for Gretty configurations are performed by developers with sufficient security awareness and knowledge of Gretty best practices, or provide security-focused developers with the opportunity to review Gretty configuration changes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental Misconfigurations in Gretty: - Severity: Low to Medium (Code reviews can catch accidental misconfigurations in Gretty that might introduce security weaknesses in the development environment, even if unintentional.)
    *   Deviation from Security Standards for Gretty: - Severity: Low (Reviews help ensure that Gretty configurations adhere to established security standards and best practices defined for the project, preventing configuration drift.)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental Misconfigurations in Gretty: Medium Risk Reduction (Reduces the likelihood of accidental errors in Gretty configuration through peer review.)
    *   Deviation from Security Standards for Gretty: Low Risk Reduction (Enforces adherence to defined Gretty security standards, improving consistency and reducing configuration-related risks.)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - `build.gradle` files are generally included in code reviews, but specific focus on Gretty security configurations is not consistently enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop and implement a specific checklist for reviewing Gretty security configurations during code reviews.  Consider creating basic automated checks or linters for common Gretty configuration security issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Features in Gretty](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_features_in_gretty.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Review the features enabled or configured in Gretty configurations for each project. Understand the purpose of each enabled feature and whether it is strictly necessary for the current development workflow.
    *   Step 2:  Disable any Gretty features that are not strictly required for development. This might include features related to specific servlet container functionalities, verbose logging options, or deployment-related features that are not actively used in the development cycle.
    *   Step 3:  Document the rationale for disabling specific Gretty features and ensure that developers understand why these features are not enabled by default. This documentation should be easily accessible and maintained.
    *   Step 4:  Periodically re-evaluate the enabled Gretty features as development workflows evolve and disable any features that become obsolete or are no longer necessary. Regularly review Gretty's documentation for new features and assess their necessity and security implications before enabling them.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Increased Attack Surface via Gretty Features: - Severity: Low (Minimizing enabled Gretty features reduces the overall attack surface of the development environment related to Gretty, even though Gretty is primarily a development tool.)
    *   Complexity and Potential Misconfiguration in Gretty: - Severity: Low (Fewer enabled features in Gretty reduce configuration complexity and the potential for misconfiguration or unintended interactions between features, leading to a more manageable and potentially more secure setup.)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Increased Attack Surface via Gretty Features: Low Risk Reduction (Marginal reduction in attack surface related to Gretty, primarily a preventative measure to keep configurations lean and focused.)
    *   Complexity and Potential Misconfiguration in Gretty: Low Risk Reduction (Slightly reduces configuration complexity and potential for errors by simplifying Gretty setup.)

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Feature minimization is not actively practiced or enforced for Gretty configurations. Configurations tend to use defaults or enable features as needed without a systematic minimization approach.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop guidelines or best practices for minimizing enabled Gretty features.  Include feature minimization as a step in the Gretty configuration hardening checklist.  Conduct a review of currently enabled Gretty features in projects and identify features that can be safely disabled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Underlying Servlet Container (Jetty/Tomcat) used by Gretty](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_underlying_servlet_container__jettytomcat__used_by_gretty.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Identify the versions of Jetty or Tomcat that are being used by the Gretty plugin in the project's dependency tree. Gretty embeds these containers, and outdated versions can have vulnerabilities.
    *   Step 2:  Use Gradle dependency management (or Maven equivalent) to explicitly declare and control the versions of Jetty or Tomcat used by Gretty. Avoid relying solely on Gretty's default or transitive dependency versions. This allows for direct control over these critical components.
    *   Step 3:  Establish a process for regularly checking for updates to Jetty or Tomcat. Monitor security advisories and release notes from the Jetty and Tomcat projects directly, as vulnerabilities in these containers can impact applications running through Gretty.
    *   Step 4:  Update the declared Jetty or Tomcat versions in `build.gradle` to the latest stable and secure releases. Prioritize security updates for these embedded containers.
    *   Step 5:  Thoroughly test the application in the development environment after updating Jetty or Tomcat versions used by Gretty to ensure compatibility and that no regressions are introduced in the development process.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Embedded Servlet Container (Jetty/Tomcat) within Gretty: - Severity: Medium to High (Outdated servlet container versions embedded within Gretty may contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited, even in a development environment, potentially leading to compromised development machines or processes.)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Embedded Servlet Container (Jetty/Tomcat) within Gretty: Medium to High Risk Reduction (Addresses known vulnerabilities in the underlying servlet container used by Gretty, depending on the severity of the vulnerabilities fixed in updates. Directly improves the security of the Gretty development environment.)

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Dependency updates are performed generally, but not specifically focused on proactively managing and updating Jetty/Tomcat versions used by Gretty based on security advisories.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Integrate Jetty/Tomcat version update checks (specifically in the context of Gretty dependencies) into dependency vulnerability scanning processes.  Establish a process for regularly reviewing Jetty/Tomcat security advisories and release notes and proactively updating these components in projects using Gretty.
