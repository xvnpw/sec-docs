    *   Search for publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that version.
    *   Craft and execute an exploit targeting the identified vulnerability.
*   **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS).

    *   Identify Gretty's Gradle tasks or hooks.
    *   Modify the `build.gradle` file or introduce malicious dependencies that are activated during Gretty's lifecycle.
*   **Potential Impact:** Remote code execution, persistent backdoor, data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal to Access Sensitive Files (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_to_access_sensitive_files__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how Gretty serves static files to access files outside the intended directories using ".." sequences in URLs.
*   **Potential Impact:** Access to sensitive configuration files (e.g., `.gradle` directory), source code, or other confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Debugging Endpoints or Tools (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/access_debugging_endpoints_or_tools__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If development-specific debugging endpoints or tools provided by Gretty or the embedded server are accidentally left enabled in a production environment, attackers can access them.
*   **Potential Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, ability to manipulate the application's state, potential for further exploitation.
