# Attack Surface Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Embedded Jetty Version](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_embedded_jetty_version.md)

*   **Description:** The version of Jetty bundled with Gretty might contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Gretty Contributes:** Gretty packages and uses a specific version of Jetty. If this version is outdated or has known vulnerabilities, applications using Gretty are susceptible.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in the bundled Jetty version allows for remote code execution if a specific request is crafted.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for complete compromise of the development server, including data breaches, code execution, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the Gretty plugin to benefit from updates to the bundled Jetty version.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the specific Jetty version used by Gretty and take action if vulnerabilities are found.
    *   Consider if Gretty allows specifying a specific Jetty version to use, enabling manual updates.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Debugging Endpoints (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_debugging_endpoints__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If debugging features are enabled in the Gretty/Jetty configuration, they might expose sensitive information or provide avenues for exploitation.
*   **How Gretty Contributes:** Gretty might allow enabling debugging features of the embedded Jetty server through its configuration.
*   **Example:**  A JMX console is enabled in the development server, allowing an attacker to monitor and potentially manipulate the application's runtime environment.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution or manipulation of the application's state.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure debugging features are disabled in the Gretty configuration unless explicitly required for development purposes.
    *   If debugging is necessary, restrict access to debugging endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Production Deployment with Gretty](./attack_surfaces/accidental_production_deployment_with_gretty.md)

*   **Description:**  Due to misconfiguration or oversight, an application might be deployed to a production environment using Gretty instead of a production-ready application server.
*   **How Gretty Contributes:** Gretty provides a convenient way to run the application, which could lead to its misuse in production if deployment processes are not robust.
*   **Example:** A developer mistakenly deploys the application using the `grettyRun` task to a production server.
*   **Impact:**  Significant security risks due to the development-focused nature of Gretty, including potential performance issues, instability, and exposure of development-specific configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Clearly differentiate development and production build configurations and deployment processes.
    *   Implement checks and safeguards in deployment pipelines to prevent the use of Gretty in production environments.
    *   Educate developers on the intended use of Gretty and the risks of using it in production.
