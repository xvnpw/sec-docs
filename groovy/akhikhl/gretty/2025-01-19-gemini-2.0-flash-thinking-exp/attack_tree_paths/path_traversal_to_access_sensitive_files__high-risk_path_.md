### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Path Traversal to Access Sensitive Files

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Description

Path traversal, also known as directory traversal, is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that are located outside the web server's root directory. This occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper sanitization or validation.

In the context of Gretty, which is used to run web applications during development, it often serves static files directly from specified directories. If Gretty or the underlying servlet container (e.g., Jetty) does not properly sanitize or validate the requested file path, an attacker can manipulate the URL to access files outside the intended static file directories.

The core of the attack lies in the use of ".." (dot-dot-slash) sequences within the URL. This sequence instructs the operating system to move one directory level up in the file system hierarchy. By strategically placing multiple ".." sequences, an attacker can navigate up the directory structure and access files in arbitrary locations on the server.

#### 4.2. Technical Details of Exploitation

When Gretty receives a request for a static file, it typically constructs the full file path by combining the configured static file directory with the path provided in the URL. For example, if the static file directory is configured as `src/main/webapp` and the request is for `/css/style.css`, Gretty would attempt to serve the file located at `src/main/webapp/css/style.css`.

However, if the request contains ".." sequences, such as `/../../../../etc/passwd`, and proper validation is missing, Gretty might attempt to access a file outside the `src/main/webapp` directory.

**Example Attack URLs:**

*   `http://<your-app-url>/static/../../../../.gradle/daemon/` - Attempts to access the `.gradle` directory.
*   `http://<your-app-url>/images/../../../src/main/java/com/example/YourClass.java` - Attempts to access Java source code.
*   `http://<your-app-url>/files/../../../../../../etc/shadow` - Attempts to access the shadow password file (on Linux-based systems).

The success of these attacks depends on:

*   **Gretty's configuration:** How static file serving is configured and whether any security measures are in place.
*   **The underlying operating system:** File system permissions will ultimately determine if the web server process has read access to the targeted files.
*   **The presence of vulnerabilities in Gretty or the underlying servlet container:**  While Gretty itself might not have inherent vulnerabilities, misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in the underlying components can be exploited.

#### 4.3. Gretty's Role and Potential Weaknesses

Gretty simplifies the process of running web applications during development. While it provides a convenient way to serve static files, it's crucial to understand its limitations and potential security implications.

**Potential Weaknesses in the Context of Path Traversal:**

*   **Default Configuration:** The default configuration of Gretty might not include strict path validation or sanitization for static file requests.
*   **Reliance on Underlying Servlet Container:** Gretty relies on the underlying servlet container (e.g., Jetty) for handling requests. Vulnerabilities in the servlet container's static file serving mechanism could be exploited.
*   **Developer Oversight:** Developers might not be fully aware of the potential for path traversal vulnerabilities when configuring static file serving in Gretty.

#### 4.4. Potential Impact (Detailed)

Successful exploitation of this path traversal vulnerability can have significant consequences:

*   **Access to Sensitive Configuration Files:**
    *   `.gradle` directory: Contains build configurations, potentially including repository credentials, signing keys, and other sensitive information.
    *   `.git` directory: Contains the entire version history of the application, including source code, commit messages, and potentially sensitive data committed by developers.
    *   Configuration files (e.g., `application.properties`, `web.xml`): May contain database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive application settings.
*   **Exposure of Source Code:** Access to source code allows attackers to understand the application's logic, identify other vulnerabilities, and potentially exfiltrate intellectual property.
*   **Access to Other Confidential Information:** Depending on the application's file structure and the permissions of the web server process, attackers might gain access to other sensitive data, such as temporary files, logs, or user data.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, which can lead to further attacks, data breaches, and reputational damage.

#### 4.5. Likelihood of Exploitation

The likelihood of exploiting this vulnerability is **high** if proper security measures are not in place. Path traversal is a well-known and relatively easy-to-exploit vulnerability. Attackers can use readily available tools and techniques to test for and exploit these weaknesses.

The likelihood increases if:

*   The application serves static files from directories containing sensitive information.
*   The default Gretty configuration is used without implementing additional security measures.
*   Developers are unaware of the risks associated with path traversal.

#### 4.6. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of path traversal attacks when using Gretty, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate and sanitize user-supplied input used to construct file paths.**  This includes rejecting requests containing ".." sequences or other potentially malicious characters.
    *   **Use canonicalization techniques** to resolve symbolic links and ensure that the requested path is within the intended directory.
*   **Secure Configuration of Gretty:**
    *   **Carefully configure the directories from which Gretty serves static files.**  Avoid serving files from the root directory or directories containing sensitive information.
    *   **Consider using a dedicated directory for static assets** that does not contain any sensitive configuration files or source code.
    *   **Explore Gretty's configuration options for restricting access to specific file types or paths.**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Ensure that the web server process runs with the minimum necessary privileges.** This limits the potential damage if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.
    *   **Restrict file system permissions** to prevent the web server process from accessing sensitive files outside the intended static file directories.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing** to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including path traversal.
    *   **Use automated security scanning tools** to detect common web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Update Dependencies:**
    *   **Keep Gretty and the underlying servlet container (e.g., Jetty) up to date** with the latest security patches. Vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited.
*   **Consider Using a Reverse Proxy:**
    *   **Deploy the application behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache)** that can provide an additional layer of security, including path normalization and request filtering.

#### 4.7. Detection Strategies

Detecting path traversal attempts is crucial for timely response and prevention of further attacks. The following methods can be used:

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can inspect incoming requests and block those that contain suspicious patterns, such as ".." sequences in URLs.
*   **Log Analysis:**
    *   **Monitor web server access logs for suspicious patterns** like multiple ".." sequences in requested URLs.
    *   **Look for unusual file access patterns** that might indicate an attacker trying to access sensitive files.
    *   **Implement automated log analysis tools** to identify and alert on potential path traversal attempts.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Network-based IDS/IPS can detect malicious traffic patterns, including those associated with path traversal attacks.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** FIM tools can monitor critical files and directories for unauthorized access or modification, which could be a consequence of a successful path traversal attack.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** SIEM systems can aggregate logs and security events from various sources, allowing for correlation and identification of path traversal attempts.

#### 4.8. Example Attack Scenario

1. An attacker identifies an application running with Gretty that serves static files from the `src/main/webapp/static` directory.
2. The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing ".." sequences: `http://<your-app-url>/static/../../../../.gradle/daemon/registry.bin`.
3. The attacker sends this request to the application.
4. If Gretty or the underlying servlet container does not properly validate the path, it attempts to access the file `/.gradle/daemon/registry.bin` on the server's file system.
5. If the web server process has sufficient permissions, the attacker successfully retrieves the contents of the `registry.bin` file, which might contain sensitive build information.
6. The attacker can then use this information for further malicious activities.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Path Traversal to Access Sensitive Files" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using Gretty. By exploiting weaknesses in static file serving, attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive configuration files, source code, and other confidential information.

Implementing robust mitigation strategies, including input validation, secure configuration, and regular security assessments, is crucial to prevent this type of attack. Furthermore, establishing effective detection mechanisms allows for timely identification and response to potential path traversal attempts, minimizing the potential impact on the application and its users. Developers and security teams must be aware of this vulnerability and take proactive steps to secure their applications.
