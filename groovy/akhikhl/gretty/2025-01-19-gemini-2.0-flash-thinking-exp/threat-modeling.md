# Threat Model Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_default_configuration_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker could scan for open ports and identify the Gretty development server running on a non-localhost interface (e.g., 0.0.0.0). They could then attempt to access the application without proper authorization, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the application itself.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the development application, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of application state, or further exploitation of application vulnerabilities.

**Affected Gretty Component:**  `gretty` plugin configuration, specifically the `httpBindAddress` and `httpPort` settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Explicitly configure Gretty to listen only on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) or specific trusted networks using the `httpPort` and `httpBindAddress` configuration options in `build.gradle` or `gretty-config.groovy`.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Secrets through Gretty Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_secrets_through_gretty_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the project's source code repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account or a public repository) could find sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets hardcoded within Gretty configuration files (`build.gradle`, `gretty-config.groovy`, or included configuration files).

**Impact:** Compromise of application secrets, allowing the attacker to access backend systems, databases, or external services, leading to data breaches, financial loss, or reputational damage.

**Affected Gretty Component:**  `gretty` plugin configuration files (`build.gradle`, `gretty-config.groovy`), and potentially any files included through Gretty's configuration mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid hardcoding secrets in configuration files.
*   Utilize environment variables to manage sensitive configuration. Gretty supports accessing environment variables within its configuration.
*   Use dedicated secret management tools and integrate them into the development workflow.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Development Server to the Internet](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_development_server_to_the_internet.md)

**Description:** A developer might misconfigure Gretty or the network settings on their machine, unintentionally making the development server accessible from the public internet. This could happen due to incorrect `httpBindAddress` configuration.

**Impact:**  Exposure of the development application to potential attacks from anyone on the internet, significantly increasing the risk of exploitation.

**Affected Gretty Component:**  `gretty` plugin configuration (`httpBindAddress`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Educate developers on secure Gretty configuration practices and the importance of restricting network access.
*   Regularly review Gretty configurations.
*   Enforce the use of `localhost` as the default `httpBindAddress` through project templates or guidelines.

## Threat: [Using Gretty in Production Environment](./threats/using_gretty_in_production_environment.md)

**Description:** A developer might mistakenly or intentionally deploy an application using Gretty in a production environment. Gretty is designed for development and lacks the security features, performance optimizations, and robustness required for production deployments.

**Impact:**  Significant security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, instability, and potential data loss in the production environment.

**Affected Gretty Component:**  The entire `gretty` plugin and its embedded server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Clearly communicate that Gretty is for development purposes only.
*   Implement deployment pipelines that explicitly exclude Gretty and use appropriate production-ready application servers.
