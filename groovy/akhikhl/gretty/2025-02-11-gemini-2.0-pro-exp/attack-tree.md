## Attack Tree Path: [Path: 2 -> 2.2 -> 2.2.1 (Use Default Admin/Manager Credentials)](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_-_2_2_-_2_2_1__use_default_adminmanager_credentials_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to gain access to the application or its management interface by using default or easily guessable credentials. This leverages a misconfiguration where default credentials provided by Gretty or the underlying servlet container (Jetty/Tomcat) have not been changed.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify the presence of a management interface (e.g., Jetty's or Tomcat's manager application).
    *   Attempt to log in using common default credentials (e.g., admin/admin, tomcat/tomcat, jetty/jetty).
    *   If successful, gain administrative access.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Mandatory:* Change all default credentials immediately after installation or deployment.
    *   Enforce a strong password policy.
    *   Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
    *   Disable the administrative interface if it's not strictly necessary.
    *   Monitor login attempts and alert on failed logins, especially with common usernames.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path: 2 -> 2.1 -> 2.1.1 (Access .gradle Files Containing Secrets)](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_-_2_1_-_2_1_1__access__gradle_files_containing_secrets_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the project's `.gradle` files, which mistakenly contain hardcoded secrets (API keys, database passwords, etc.). This exploits a common developer error of storing sensitive information in version-controlled files.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Gain access to the source code repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account, a public repository with insufficient access controls, or a server misconfiguration).
    *   Locate and examine `.gradle` files.
    *   Extract any hardcoded secrets found within the files.
    *   Use the extracted secrets to access other resources or escalate privileges.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low (once access to the repository is obtained)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Mandatory:* Never store secrets directly in `.gradle` files or any other version-controlled files.
    *   Use environment variables.
    *   Use secure build server configurations (e.g., Gradle's `gradle.properties` in the user's home directory, *not* in the project).
    *   Employ a dedicated secret management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Implement code scanning tools to detect secrets committed to the repository.
    *   Educate developers on secure coding practices and secret management.
    *   Enforce strict access control on the source code repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path: 3 -> 3.1 -> 3.1.1 and Path: 3 -> 3.2 -> 3.2.1 (Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Servlet Container)](./attack_tree_paths/path_3_-_3_1_-_3_1_1_and_path_3_-_3_2_-_3_2_1__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_servlet_container_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the specific version of the servlet container (Jetty or Tomcat) used by Gretty. This leverages the fact that the application is running on an outdated or unpatched component.  Paths 3.1 and 3.2 are essentially the same, just emphasizing different aspects of the same underlying problem.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify the version of the servlet container being used (e.g., through server banners, HTTP headers, or error messages).
    *   Research known vulnerabilities for that specific version.
    *   Obtain or develop an exploit for a suitable vulnerability.
    *   Launch the exploit against the application server.
    *   Gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   *Mandatory:* Keep the servlet container (Jetty/Tomcat) up-to-date. Use the latest stable versions.
    *   Implement a regular patching schedule.
    *   Use a dependency management tool (like Gradle's built-in dependency management) to track and update dependencies.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for the chosen servlet container.
    *   Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help mitigate known exploits.
    *   Use an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and potentially block exploit attempts.
