# Threat Model Analysis for akhikhl/gretty

## Threat: [Malicious Gretty Plugin Replacement](./threats/malicious_gretty_plugin_replacement.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine, build server, or a public repository and replaces the legitimate Gretty plugin JAR with a modified, malicious version. The attacker could inject code to steal credentials, modify the application during build/test, or install a backdoor. This is a *direct* attack on Gretty itself.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the development/testing environment. The attacker could gain control over the application, steal sensitive data, or deploy malicious code.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gretty Plugin JAR (the core plugin itself). Specifically, any class within the plugin could be modified.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Gradle's dependency verification (checksums) to ensure the integrity of the downloaded Gretty JAR. Obtain the correct checksum from the official Gretty GitHub releases page.
        *   Use a private, trusted artifact repository (Artifactory, Nexus) to host the Gretty plugin, reducing reliance on potentially compromised public repositories.
        *   Implement strong access controls on build servers and developer machines to prevent unauthorized modification of build scripts and dependencies.
        *   Regularly update Gretty to the latest version.

## Threat: [Gretty Configuration Tampering (SSL Settings)](./threats/gretty_configuration_tampering__ssl_settings_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the project's build files (e.g., `build.gradle`, `gretty.properties`) and modifies Gretty's *own* SSL configuration. They could disable SSL, force the use of weak ciphers, or specify a malicious certificate *for Gretty's internal operations*. This is distinct from configuring the *application's* SSL; this affects Gretty's security.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted *to or from Gretty itself* during development/testing (e.g., if Gretty is used for remote debugging or farm deployments with internal communication). Compromise of Gretty's internal operations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gretty's SSL configuration handling. Specifically, the `gretty.ssl` configuration block within `build.gradle` or settings in `gretty.properties` related to SSL *for Gretty's own use* (e.g., `sslEnabled`, `sslKeyStore`, `sslKeyStorePassword`, `sslTrustStore`, `sslTrustStorePassword`, `sslKeyPassword`, `sslProtocol`, `sslCipherSuites`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store Gretty configuration files in a version control system (Git) and monitor for unauthorized changes.
        *   Implement strict access controls on build files and configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive SSL configuration values (passwords, keystore paths) instead of hardcoding them in configuration files.
        *   Regularly review Gretty's SSL configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices.

## Threat: [Hot Reloading Enabled in Production-like Environment](./threats/hot_reloading_enabled_in_production-like_environment.md)

*   **Description:** Hot reloading, a feature *of Gretty*, is accidentally left enabled in an environment that resembles production (e.g., a staging or pre-production environment). This could allow an attacker to trigger code reloads and potentially expose source code or internal application state. This is a direct threat due to Gretty's functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of source code, internal application state, or potentially sensitive data. Increased attack surface.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gretty's hot reloading functionality. Specifically, the `gretty.fastReload` or `gretty.scanIntervalSeconds` settings (or any configuration that enables automatic code reloading).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicitly disable hot reloading in any environment that is not strictly for local development.** This is the most important mitigation.
        *   Use environment-specific configurations to ensure hot reloading is only enabled in the appropriate environments.
        *   Implement build processes that prevent hot reloading configurations from being deployed to production-like environments.

## Threat: [Gretty Running with Excessive Privileges](./threats/gretty_running_with_excessive_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** Gretty *itself* is run as a privileged user (e.g., root). This is a direct security issue with how Gretty is used. If a vulnerability exists in Gretty, it could be exploited to gain those elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. An attacker could gain full control of the machine running Gretty.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Gretty plugin and the underlying operating system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never run Gretty as a privileged user.** This is a fundamental security principle.
        *   Ensure that the user running Gretty has only the necessary permissions to access the application's code and resources. Use the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Insecure Logging Configuration](./threats/insecure_logging_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Gretty's *own* logging configuration might inadvertently include sensitive information if Gretty itself logs such data (e.g., during its internal operations, especially if debugging is enabled at a very verbose level). This is distinct from the application's logging.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information related to Gretty's internal operations in log files, potentially leading to further compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** Gretty's logging configuration. Specifically, settings related to log levels, log file locations, and log formats *for Gretty's own logs*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure Gretty's logging to an appropriate level (avoid excessive verbosity, especially in non-development environments).
        * Use a logging framework that supports redaction or masking of sensitive data, if Gretty's internal operations might log such data.
        * Ensure log files are stored securely with appropriate access controls.
        * Implement log rotation and retention policies.
        * Review Gretty's source code (if necessary) to understand what information it might log internally.
