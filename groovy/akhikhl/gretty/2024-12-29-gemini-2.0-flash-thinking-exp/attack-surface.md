Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Gretty, with High or Critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposed HTTP/HTTPS Ports
    *   **Description:** The application's web interface is accessible via HTTP or HTTPS on specific ports.
    *   **How Gretty Contributes:** Gretty allows developers to configure the HTTP (`httpPort`) and HTTPS (`httpsPort`) ports used by the embedded Jetty or Tomcat server. If these ports are left open or accessible in non-development environments, they become potential entry points for attackers.
    *   **Example:** A developer configures `httpPort = 8080` in their `build.gradle`. If this instance is accidentally deployed to a public server without proper firewalling, an attacker can directly access the application on `http://<server_ip>:8080`.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application, potential data breaches, manipulation of application functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if exposed in non-development environments).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper firewall rules are in place to restrict access to the configured ports in non-development environments.
        *   Avoid using default or well-known ports.
        *   Document the intended access restrictions for the configured ports.
        *   Consider using network segmentation to isolate development environments.

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration Injection via Gradle Properties
    *   **Description:** Gretty's configuration is often driven by Gradle properties, which can be sourced from various locations.
    *   **How Gretty Contributes:** If Gradle properties used to configure Gretty are sourced from untrusted sources (e.g., command-line arguments, environment variables without proper sanitization), attackers might be able to inject malicious configurations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could execute `gradle grettyRun -Dgretty.httpPort=1234` to force the application to run on an unexpected port, potentially bypassing security controls. More critically, they could inject JVM arguments to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:**  Manipulation of application behavior, potential for remote code execution, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical, especially if arbitrary code execution is possible.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control the sources of Gradle properties used for Gretty configuration.
        *   Avoid sourcing Gretty configuration from untrusted or external sources without validation.
        *   Document the expected values and sources for Gretty configuration properties.
        *   Implement checks and validation for critical configuration parameters.

*   **Attack Surface:** `jvmArgs` and `webappArgs` Configuration
    *   **Description:** Gretty allows specifying JVM arguments and web application arguments.
    *   **How Gretty Contributes:**  If these arguments are not carefully controlled and are sourced from potentially untrusted locations (similar to Gradle properties), they can be used to inject malicious code or manipulate the runtime environment.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a `-javaagent` argument via a Gradle property to load a malicious agent into the JVM when Gretty starts the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the host system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control the sources of `jvmArgs` and `webappArgs`.
        *   Avoid allowing external or untrusted sources to influence these configurations.
        *   Document and review the intended `jvmArgs` and `webappArgs`.
        *   Implement checks and validation for these arguments.
