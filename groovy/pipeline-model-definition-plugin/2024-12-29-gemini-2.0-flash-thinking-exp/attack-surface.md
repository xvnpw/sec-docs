*   **Attack Surface:** Maliciously Crafted Declarative Pipeline Syntax
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the plugin's parsing and interpretation of the declarative pipeline syntax.
    *   **How Pipeline-Model-Definition-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin is responsible for parsing and executing the declarative pipeline definitions. Flaws in this parsing logic can be targeted.
    *   **Example:**  A deeply nested or specially crafted `when` condition could cause excessive resource consumption during parsing, leading to a Denial of Service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the Jenkins controller, potentially impacting all pipelines. Unexpected behavior or errors during pipeline execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on pipeline definitions before parsing.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits for Jenkins processes to prevent excessive consumption.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Pipeline Model Definition Plugin updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

*   **Attack Surface:** Injection Attacks via Pipeline Parameters
    *   **Description:** Injecting malicious code or commands through pipeline parameters defined in the declarative model.
    *   **How Pipeline-Model-Definition-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin facilitates the definition and use of parameters within the declarative syntax, which are then passed to the pipeline execution environment.
    *   **Example:** A pipeline parameter intended for a shell script could contain malicious commands like `$(rm -rf /)`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins agent or controller, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameter Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all pipeline parameters within the pipeline script before using them in commands or scripts.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run pipeline steps with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Avoid Direct Execution of User Input:**  Avoid directly using pipeline parameters in shell commands or script execution without proper escaping or sanitization.

*   **Attack Surface:** Manipulation of `agent` Directive for Code Execution on Unintended Nodes
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting the `agent` directive to force pipeline execution on specific Jenkins agents, potentially targeting vulnerable or privileged nodes.
    *   **How Pipeline-Model-Definition-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin uses the `agent` directive to determine where pipeline stages or the entire pipeline will execute.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could modify the pipeline definition (e.g., through a compromised Git repository) to force execution on an agent with access to sensitive credentials or internal networks.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious code on specific Jenkins agents, potential access to sensitive resources or networks accessible by that agent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Access to Pipeline Definitions:** Control who can modify pipeline definitions (e.g., through Git repository permissions).
        *   **Agent Security:** Secure Jenkins agents and limit their access to sensitive resources.
        *   **Node and Label Restrictions:** Implement restrictions on which pipelines can run on specific nodes or with certain labels.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsafe Use of `script` Blocks for Arbitrary Code Execution
    *   **Description:**  Leveraging the `script` block within the declarative pipeline to execute arbitrary Groovy code.
    *   **How Pipeline-Model-Definition-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin allows embedding Groovy scripts within the declarative structure using the `script` block.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor could inject a `script` block that executes commands to steal credentials, modify Jenkins configurations, or compromise the controller.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins controller, full compromise of the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Use of `script` Blocks:**  Favor the declarative syntax over `script` blocks whenever possible.
        *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review any `script` blocks for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Restrict Permissions for Pipeline Editing:** Limit who can edit and commit pipeline definitions.
        *   **Consider Sandboxing:** Explore options for sandboxing Groovy execution within pipelines (though this can be complex).

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Shared Libraries
    *   **Description:**  Introducing vulnerabilities through the use of compromised or insecure shared libraries referenced in the pipeline definition.
    *   **How Pipeline-Model-Definition-Plugin Contributes:** The plugin allows referencing and using shared libraries to reuse pipeline code.
    *   **Example:** A shared library could contain malicious code that is executed within the context of any pipeline using it.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities within pipelines using the compromised library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Shared Library Management:** Implement strict controls over who can create, modify, and approve shared libraries.
        *   **Code Review for Shared Libraries:**  Thoroughly review the code of shared libraries for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:**  Scan shared libraries for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Shared Libraries:**  Grant shared libraries only the necessary permissions.
