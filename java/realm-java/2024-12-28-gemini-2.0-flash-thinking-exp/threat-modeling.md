## High and Critical Realm Java Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `realm/realm-java` library:

* **Threat:** Unencrypted Local Data Storage
    * **Description:** An attacker gains physical access to the device or compromises the operating system and directly accesses the Realm database file. Without Realm encryption being enabled, the attacker can read and potentially modify sensitive data stored within the file using Realm tools or other database viewers.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential data theft, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential for data manipulation.
    * **Affected Component:** Local Realm Database File (core component of Realm Java)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enable Realm Encryption:** Always enable Realm encryption using a strong, randomly generated key when initializing the Realm configuration.
        * **Secure Key Management:** Store the encryption key securely using platform-specific mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, operating system's credential management).

* **Threat:** Insecure Encryption Key Management
    * **Description:** The encryption key used for the Realm database is stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the application code, stored in shared preferences without encryption). An attacker could retrieve the key and decrypt the Realm database, bypassing the encryption.
    * **Impact:** Complete bypass of Realm encryption, confidentiality breach, data theft, unauthorized access to all data stored in Realm.
    * **Affected Component:** Encryption Key Handling (application-specific implementation, directly impacting Realm's encryption functionality)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Utilize Platform-Specific Secure Storage:** Use secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) to store the encryption key.
        * **Avoid Hardcoding Keys:** Never hardcode encryption keys directly in the application code.
        * **Implement Key Rotation:** Consider implementing a key rotation strategy for enhanced security.

* **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Synchronization
    * **Description:** When using Realm Object Server or Realm Cloud for synchronization, an attacker intercepts network traffic between the application (using `realm-java`) and the server. If TLS/SSL is not properly implemented or configured within the application's Realm configuration, the attacker can eavesdrop on or even modify the data being synchronized.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of synchronized data, data tampering, potential for injecting malicious data into the Realm database, unauthorized access to synchronized data.

* **Threat:** Replay Attacks on Synchronization
    * **Description:** An attacker captures valid synchronization requests sent by the application (using `realm-java`) and replays them to perform unauthorized actions, such as creating, modifying, or deleting data in the Realm database.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized data manipulation, potential for financial loss or other negative consequences depending on the application's functionality.
    * **Affected Component:** Synchronization Process (within `realm-java` when interacting with Realm Object Server/Cloud)
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Nonces or Timestamps:** Implement logic in the application and/or server to include unique, non-repeating values (nonces) or timestamps in synchronization requests to prevent replay attacks.
        * **Implement Request Signing:** Digitally sign synchronization requests to verify their authenticity and integrity.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Realm Native Libraries
    * **Description:** `realm-java` relies on native libraries (written in C++). Vulnerabilities in these underlying libraries could be exploited by attackers, potentially leading to crashes, data corruption within the Realm database, or even remote code execution within the application's context.
    * **Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption within the Realm database, potential for remote code execution, complete compromise of the application.
