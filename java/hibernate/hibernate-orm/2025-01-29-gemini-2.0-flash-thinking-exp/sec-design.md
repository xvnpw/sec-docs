# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust and performant Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java applications.
  - Simplify database interactions for developers, reducing boilerplate code and improving development productivity.
  - Offer a wide range of features and database compatibility to meet diverse application needs.
  - Maintain a stable and reliable framework with backward compatibility to ensure long-term usability.
  - Foster a strong community and provide adequate documentation and support.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the Hibernate ORM framework could lead to data breaches or application compromise in systems that depend on it.
  - Performance issues or instability could negatively impact applications using Hibernate, leading to downtime or poor user experience.
  - Lack of compatibility with new database versions or Java platforms could limit adoption and require significant migration efforts.
  - Decreased community support or project abandonment could leave users without necessary updates and security patches.
  - Misuse of Hibernate ORM by developers due to lack of understanding or improper configuration could introduce security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks in applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are conducted by maintainers as part of the contribution process. (Implemented in: GitHub repository contribution workflow)
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are in place to ensure the correctness and stability of the framework. (Implemented in: GitHub repository test suite)
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting process via Jira and mailing lists. (Described in: Hibernate ORM project documentation and website)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on developers to use Hibernate ORM securely and configure it properly within their applications.
  - accepted risk: Security of underlying databases and application servers is outside the scope of Hibernate ORM project itself.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning tools to identify and manage known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Hibernate ORM.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits of Hibernate ORM by external security experts.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using Hibernate ORM to mitigate common security risks.
  - security control: Establish a clear Security Response Plan to handle reported vulnerabilities efficiently and transparently.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Hibernate ORM itself does not handle application user authentication. It relies on the application to establish authenticated database connections.
    - Requirement: Secure storage and management of database credentials used by Hibernate ORM configurations should be ensured by the application using it.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Hibernate ORM should respect database-level authorization and access control mechanisms.
    - Requirement: Applications using Hibernate ORM are responsible for implementing application-level authorization logic to control data access based on user roles and permissions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Hibernate ORM should provide mechanisms to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by using parameterized queries or prepared statements by default.
    - Requirement: Applications using Hibernate ORM should validate user inputs before using them in queries, even when using ORM features, to prevent potential injection attacks.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Hibernate ORM should support secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for database connections if required by the underlying database and application environment.
    - Requirement: Hibernate ORM itself does not provide data encryption at rest. Applications requiring data encryption at rest should utilize database-level encryption features or other appropriate encryption mechanisms.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Data persistence and retrieval for Java applications using Hibernate ORM.
  - Secure and reliable operation of applications that depend on Hibernate ORM for database interactions.
  - Development productivity and efficiency of Java developers using Hibernate ORM.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Application data managed by Hibernate ORM: Sensitivity depends on the specific application using Hibernate. Could range from publicly accessible data to highly confidential personal or financial information.
  - Database credentials used by Hibernate ORM configurations: Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to unauthorized database access and data breaches.
  - Hibernate ORM framework code itself: Moderately sensitive. Vulnerabilities in the framework could impact many applications.
  - Build and release artifacts of Hibernate ORM: Moderately sensitive. Compromised artifacts could be distributed to users, leading to supply chain attacks.
