# Threat Model Analysis for hibernate/hibernate-orm

## Threat: [HQL/JPQL Injection](./threats/hqljpql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious HQL or JPQL code into application queries by manipulating user input. This allows execution of arbitrary database commands.

**Impact:** Data breach (reading, modifying, deleting sensitive data), potential denial of service, and in rare cases, potential for remote code execution on the database server.

**Hibernate ORM Component Affected:** Query Language Parsing and Execution (`SessionFactory`, `Session`, Query creation methods).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use parameterized queries for HQL/JPQL.
*   Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in queries.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts.
*   Conduct regular code reviews focusing on HQL/JPQL query construction.

## Threat: [Native SQL Injection via Hibernate](./threats/native_sql_injection_via_hibernate.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code when the application uses native SQL queries through Hibernate's `session.createNativeQuery()` and fails to properly parameterize user input. This allows direct execution of arbitrary SQL commands on the database.

**Impact:** Data breach (reading, modifying, deleting sensitive data), potential denial of service, and potential for remote code execution on the database server.

**Hibernate ORM Component Affected:** Native Query Execution ( `Session`, `session.createNativeQuery()`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using native SQL queries whenever possible. Prefer HQL/JPQL or Criteria API.
*   If native SQL is necessary, rigorously use parameter binding provided by Hibernate for all user-controlled input.
*   Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in native SQL queries.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to database user accounts.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of all native SQL queries.

## Threat: [Mapping Misconfigurations - Data Exposure](./threats/mapping_misconfigurations_-_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** Incorrect Hibernate entity mappings, particularly around relationships and field access, can unintentionally expose sensitive data to unauthorized users or contexts.

**Impact:** Unintentional data breaches and exposure of sensitive information.

**Hibernate ORM Component Affected:** Entity Mapping (`@Entity`, `@Column`, Relationships annotations), Fetching Strategies.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and review Hibernate entity mappings, focusing on relationships and data visibility.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege in mappings, only mapping necessary fields and relationships.
*   Use projection queries to retrieve only necessary data fields, avoiding fetching entire entities when not required.
*   Regularly review mappings for potential misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Mapping Misconfigurations - Data Corruption via Cascade Operations](./threats/mapping_misconfigurations_-_data_corruption_via_cascade_operations.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured cascade types in entity relationships can lead to unintended data modifications or deletions, causing data corruption or loss.

**Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, and application instability.

**Hibernate ORM Component Affected:** Entity Mapping (Relationship annotations, `CascadeType`), Persistence Operations.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure cascade types, understanding the implications of each type.
*   Thoroughly test cascade operations in various scenarios to ensure intended behavior.
*   Avoid overly permissive cascade types like `CascadeType.ALL` unless absolutely necessary and well-understood.
*   Implement proper data backup and recovery mechanisms.

## Threat: [Insecure Hibernate Configuration - Database Credentials Exposure](./threats/insecure_hibernate_configuration_-_database_credentials_exposure.md)

**Description:** Storing database credentials directly in Hibernate configuration files can lead to credential exposure if these files are compromised, allowing unauthorized database access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breach, and potential system compromise.

**Hibernate ORM Component Affected:** Configuration Loading (`Configuration`, `SessionFactoryBuilder`), Connection Provider.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Externalize database credentials using environment variables, system properties, or secure configuration management tools.
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in configuration files.
*   Implement proper access control for configuration files.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (If using XML Configuration)](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__if_using_xml_configuration_.md)

**Description:** If using XML-based Hibernate configuration, and the XML parser is not properly configured, an attacker can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to read local files or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Impact:** Information disclosure (local file access), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Hibernate ORM Component Affected:** XML Configuration Parsing (`Configuration`, `SessionFactoryBuilder` when using XML configuration files).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Prefer programmatic configuration over XML-based configuration.
*   If XML configuration is necessary, configure the XML parser to disable external entity processing.
*   Keep Hibernate and underlying XML parsing libraries up-to-date.
