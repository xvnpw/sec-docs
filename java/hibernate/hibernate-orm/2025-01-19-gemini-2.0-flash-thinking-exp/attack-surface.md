# Attack Surface Analysis for hibernate/hibernate-orm

## Attack Surface: [HQL/JPQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/hqljpql_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into Hibernate Query Language (HQL) or Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) queries, leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    *   **How Hibernate-ORM Contributes:** Hibernate executes these queries against the database. If user input is directly incorporated into the query string without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**  A web application takes a username as input and uses it in an HQL query like: `session.createQuery("FROM User WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'")`. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, privilege escalation, potential for remote code execution depending on database permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Named Parameters or Positional Parameters):** This is the most effective defense. Hibernate supports parameterized queries, which treat user input as data, not executable code. Example: `session.createQuery("FROM User WHERE username = :username").setParameter("username", userInput)`. 
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against injection, validating and sanitizing user input can help reduce the attack surface. However, rely primarily on parameterized queries.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user Hibernate connects with has only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Criteria API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/criteria_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper use of Hibernate's Criteria API, especially when dynamically building criteria based on user input, can lead to unexpected query construction and potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Hibernate-ORM Contributes:** Hibernate translates the Criteria API calls into SQL queries. If user-controlled data influences the structure of the criteria, it can be manipulated.
    *   **Example:**  Dynamically adding restrictions based on user-provided field names: `criteria.add(Restrictions.eq(userInputFieldName, userInputValue))`. An attacker could provide a sensitive field name to access unauthorized data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, potential for data manipulation depending on the context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Fields/Properties:**  Instead of directly using user input for field names, validate against a predefined list of allowed fields.
        *   **Use Static Criteria Where Possible:**  Avoid dynamic criteria construction based on untrusted input whenever feasible.
        *   **Careful Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the format and content of user input used in criteria construction.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Mapping Configuration](./attack_surfaces/improper_mapping_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect or insecure entity mappings can expose sensitive data or create unintended relationships, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.
    *   **How Hibernate-ORM Contributes:** Hibernate relies on the mapping configuration to understand how application objects relate to database tables. Misconfigurations can lead to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Example:**  Mapping a sensitive field without specifying `@Access(AccessType.PROPERTY)` might expose the field through the getter method even if the field itself is private. Incorrectly configured inheritance strategies could allow access to data from parent or child classes unintentionally.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, potential for data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly Review Mapping Configurations:** Carefully review all entity mappings, including field access types, relationships, and inheritance strategies.
        *   **Use Access Modifiers Appropriately:**  Leverage private and protected access modifiers to restrict direct access to sensitive fields.
        *   **Apply Security Annotations:** Utilize Hibernate's security-related annotations (if available or through custom interceptors) to enforce access control at the entity level.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Interceptors and Filters](./attack_surfaces/custom_interceptors_and_filters.md)

*   **Description:**  Poorly implemented custom Hibernate interceptors or filters can introduce new vulnerabilities or bypass existing security measures.
    *   **How Hibernate-ORM Contributes:** Hibernate allows developers to create custom interceptors and filters to modify Hibernate's behavior. If these components are not implemented securely, they can become attack vectors.
    *   **Example:**  A custom interceptor designed to log data might inadvertently log sensitive information or introduce a vulnerability if it doesn't handle input properly. A filter intended to enforce security might have logic flaws that can be bypassed.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies widely depending on the vulnerability introduced by the custom component, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or other security issues.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if not carefully implemented)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thoroughly Review and Test Custom Interceptors and Filters:**  Treat custom components with the same level of scrutiny as core application code. Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing.
        *   **Follow Secure Coding Practices:**  Apply secure coding principles when developing custom interceptors and filters, including input validation and output encoding.
        *   **Minimize the Use of Custom Components:**  Only implement custom interceptors and filters when absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Issues](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  If Hibernate entities are serialized and deserialized (e.g., for caching or communication), vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization can be exploited.
    *   **How Hibernate-ORM Contributes:**  While Hibernate itself doesn't directly handle serialization in most common use cases, if entities are serialized for caching (especially distributed caching) or for communication with other systems, this becomes a concern.
    *   **Example:**  If Hibernate entities are serialized and stored in a Redis cache, and the application uses a vulnerable deserialization library, an attacker could inject malicious code during deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if vulnerable deserialization is used)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Serializing Entities if Possible:**  Consider alternative approaches for caching or data transfer that don't involve serialization.
        *   **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** If serialization is necessary, use libraries known to be secure and actively maintained.
        *   **Implement Deserialization Filtering:**  If using Java serialization, implement object input stream filtering to restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
