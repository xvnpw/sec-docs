# Threat Model Analysis for hibernate/hibernate-orm

## Threat: [HQL Injection](./threats/hql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user-supplied input that is directly incorporated into Hibernate Query Language (HQL) queries. They might inject malicious HQL code to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary database commands. This is done by crafting input that alters the intended logic of the HQL query.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, data manipulation or deletion, potential for database compromise depending on database permissions, and application downtime.

**Affected Component:** `hibernate-core` - `org.hibernate.Session`, `org.hibernate.query.Query` (specifically when using `createQuery` with string concatenation).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements): Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for HQL. This prevents the direct injection of malicious code by treating user input as data rather than executable code.
*   Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input before using it in HQL queries. This includes checking data types, formats, and lengths, and escaping special characters.

## Threat: [Native SQL Injection via Hibernate](./threats/native_sql_injection_via_hibernate.md)

**Description:** Even when using Hibernate, applications might execute native SQL queries. If user input is directly embedded into these native SQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This allows them to perform unauthorized database operations, similar to HQL injection.

**Impact:** Same as HQL Injection: Unauthorized data access, data breaches, data manipulation or deletion, potential for database compromise, and application downtime.

**Affected Component:** `hibernate-core` - `org.hibernate.Session`, `org.hibernate.query.NativeQuery` (specifically when using `createNativeQuery` with string concatenation).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Parameterized Queries for Native SQL: Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements when executing native SQL through Hibernate. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection.
*   Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into native SQL queries.

## Threat: [Lazy Loading Exploitation (Information Disclosure)](./threats/lazy_loading_exploitation__information_disclosure_.md)

**Description:** Hibernate's lazy loading feature delays the loading of associated entities until they are explicitly accessed. An attacker might manipulate the application's data access patterns or exploit vulnerabilities in the application logic to trigger the loading of sensitive related data that they should not have access to. This could involve making specific requests that force the loading of related entities containing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information that should have been protected by access controls or not loaded for the current user's context.

**Affected Component:** `hibernate-core` - Entity associations, proxy objects generated for lazy loading.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Careful Design of Entity Relationships and Fetching Strategies: Thoroughly design entity relationships and choose appropriate fetching strategies (eager vs. lazy) based on the application's needs and security requirements. Avoid overly broad lazy loading that might inadvertently expose data.
*   Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Instead of directly exposing Hibernate entities to the presentation layer, use DTOs to transfer only the necessary data. This prevents the accidental loading and exposure of sensitive related entities.

## Threat: [Lazy Loading Exploitation (Denial of Service)](./threats/lazy_loading_exploitation__denial_of_service_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can craft requests or manipulate application behavior to trigger excessive lazy loading of associated entities. This can result in a large number of database queries being executed, potentially overwhelming the database and leading to performance degradation or a complete denial of service. This is often related to the "N+1 select problem."

**Impact:** Application performance degradation, database overload, and potential denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** `hibernate-core` - Entity associations, proxy objects generated for lazy loading.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Optimize Fetching Strategies: Carefully choose fetching strategies (eager or `JOIN FETCH` in HQL) to minimize the number of database queries.
*   Use Batch Fetching: Configure batch fetching to load multiple related entities in a single query, reducing the number of round trips to the database.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Related, but relevant due to Hibernate's potential use with serialized objects)](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities__indirectly_related__but_relevant_due_to_hibernate's_potential_use_w_2d193848.md)

**Description:** If Hibernate is used to persist or retrieve serialized Java objects, and the application does not properly sanitize or validate the serialized data before deserialization, it can be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. An attacker can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server.

**Affected Component:** While not directly a Hibernate component, it affects how Hibernate interacts with serialized objects.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data: The best defense is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
*   Use Safe Serialization Mechanisms: Consider using safer serialization mechanisms like JSON or Protocol Buffers instead of Java's built-in serialization.
*   Implement Deserialization Filters: If deserialization is necessary, use deserialization filters to restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
