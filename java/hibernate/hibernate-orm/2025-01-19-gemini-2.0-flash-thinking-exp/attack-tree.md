## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Language Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_language_vulnerabilities.md)

* Exploit Query Language Vulnerabilities (HQL/JPQL Injection):
    * Attack Vector: Attackers identify input points where user-controlled data is directly incorporated into HQL or JPQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify Injection Point: Locate vulnerable code where HQL/JPQL queries are dynamically constructed using user input.
        2. Inject Malicious HQL/JPQL: Craft malicious input that, when incorporated into the query, alters its intended logic. This can be used to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, modify data, or even execute database commands.
    * Impact: Potential for significant data breaches, data manipulation, and in some cases, command execution on the database server.

* Exploit Query Language Vulnerabilities (Native SQL Injection):
    * Attack Vector: Similar to HQL/JPQL injection, but targets native SQL queries used within the application.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify Injection Point in Native Query: Locate code where native SQL queries are dynamically constructed with user input.
        2. Inject Malicious SQL in Native Query: Craft malicious SQL input to manipulate the query's behavior, leading to data breaches, modifications, or privilege escalation within the database.
    * Impact: Similar to HQL/JPQL injection, with potentially more direct access to database functionalities.

* Exploit Query Language Vulnerabilities (Native SQL Injection):
    * Attack Vector: Similar to HQL/JPQL injection, but targets native SQL queries used within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (Insecure Database Connection Settings):
    * Attack Vector: Attackers target misconfigurations that expose database credentials.
    * Steps:
        1. Obtain Database Credentials: This can be achieved by:
            * Exploiting Misconfigured Hibernate Configuration File: Finding plaintext credentials or weakly protected credentials within Hibernate configuration files.
            * Exploiting Other Application Vulnerabilities to Access Credentials: Leveraging other vulnerabilities in the application to gain access to where database credentials are stored (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
    * Impact: If successful, attackers gain full access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying JDBC Driver](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_jdbc_driver.md)

* Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying JDBC Driver:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the specific version of the JDBC driver used by the application.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify Used JDBC Driver and Version: Determine the exact JDBC driver and its version being used by the application.
        2. Leverage Known JDBC Driver Vulnerabilities: Research and exploit known vulnerabilities in that specific driver version. These vulnerabilities could range from SQL injection bypasses to authentication flaws.
    * Impact: Can lead to database compromise, bypassing application-level security measures.

* Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hibernate ORM Library Itself:
    * Attack Vector: Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities within the specific version of the Hibernate ORM library being used.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify Hibernate ORM Version: Determine the exact version of the Hibernate ORM library used by the application.
        2. Leverage Known Hibernate ORM Vulnerabilities: Research and exploit known vulnerabilities in that specific Hibernate version. These could include remote code execution flaws, denial-of-service vulnerabilities, or other security weaknesses.
    * Impact: Can lead to severe consequences, including remote code execution on the server or denial of service.
