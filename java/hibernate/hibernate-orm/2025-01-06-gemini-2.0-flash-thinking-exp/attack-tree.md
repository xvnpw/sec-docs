## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Language Vulnerabilities -> HQL/JPQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_language_vulnerabilities_-_hqljpql_injection.md)

*   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious HQL or JPQL code into user input fields, URL parameters, or configuration settings that are used to construct database queries.
    *   Mechanism: When the application uses this unsanitized input to build and execute HQL/JPQL queries via Hibernate, the injected code is interpreted as part of the query.
    *   Potential Impact: Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In some cases, can lead to denial of service by executing resource-intensive queries.
    *   Mitigation: Employ parameterized queries (placeholders) for all user-supplied data. Implement strict input validation and sanitization. Use static analysis tools to detect potential injection points.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Query Language Vulnerabilities -> Native SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_query_language_vulnerabilities_-_native_sql_injection.md)

*   Attack Vector: Injecting malicious SQL code into parts of the application where native SQL queries are constructed using user input.
    *   Mechanism: Unlike HQL/JPQL, native SQL bypasses some of Hibernate's abstraction, making it easier to inject raw SQL commands.
    *   Potential Impact: Same as HQL/JPQL injection, but with potentially broader impact depending on the database user's permissions. Could even lead to operating system command execution if the database supports it and the attacker crafts the query accordingly.
    *   Mitigation: Minimize the use of native SQL. If necessary, use parameterized queries with native SQL as well. Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Exposed Database Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_exposed_database_credentials.md)

*   Attack Vector: Locating and extracting database credentials that are stored insecurely within the application's configuration files (e.g., `hibernate.cfg.xml`, `persistence.xml`, application properties).
    *   Mechanism: Attackers can gain access to these files through various means, such as exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities, accessing a compromised server, or through insider threats.
    *   Potential Impact: Complete compromise of the database, bypassing the application entirely. Attackers can read, modify, or delete any data, and potentially create new administrative accounts.
    *   Mitigation: Never store plain-text database credentials in configuration files. Use environment variables, secure secret management systems (like HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted configuration. Implement proper file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerable Hibernate ORM Version](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerable_hibernate_orm_version.md)

*   Attack Vector: Identifying that the application is using an outdated version of the Hibernate ORM library that has known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Mechanism: Attackers can use publicly available information about these vulnerabilities to craft exploits targeting the specific Hibernate version in use.
    *   Potential Impact: Can range from remote code execution to data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   Mitigation: Regularly update Hibernate ORM to the latest stable version. Implement a robust dependency management process and use tools to identify outdated and vulnerable libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerable Dependencies of Hibernate](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerable_dependencies_of_hibernate.md)

*   Attack Vector: Identifying vulnerabilities in libraries that Hibernate ORM depends on (transitive dependencies).
    *   Mechanism: Exploiting these vulnerabilities in the dependent libraries can indirectly compromise the application.
    *   Potential Impact: Similar to exploiting vulnerabilities in Hibernate itself, potentially leading to RCE or data breaches.
    *   Mitigation: Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies. Keep all dependencies up to date. Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
