# Threat Model Analysis for hibernate/hibernate-orm

## Threat: [HQL/JPQL Injection](./threats/hqljpql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is incorporated into Hibernate Query Language (HQL) or Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) queries executed by Hibernate. This can involve manipulating query parameters or injecting malicious code into string-based query construction.

**Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary database commands, potentially leading to data breaches (reading sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), or denial of service (resource exhaustion).

**Affected Component:** `org.hibernate.Query`, `org.hibernate.Session`, HQL/JPQL parser and execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) for dynamic data in HQL/JPQL.
*   Avoid constructing HQL/JPQL queries by concatenating strings with user input.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before using it in queries.
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege for database access.

## Threat: [Native SQL Injection](./threats/native_sql_injection.md)

**Description:** When using Hibernate's native SQL query functionality, an attacker injects malicious SQL code into the query string. This occurs when user input is directly embedded into the SQL string without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact:** Similar to HQL/JPQL injection, attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `org.hibernate.SQLQuery`, `org.hibernate.Session`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Prefer using HQL/JPQL with parameterized queries whenever possible.
*   When native SQL is necessary, always use parameterized queries provided by Hibernate.
*   Avoid string concatenation for building native SQL queries with user input.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Bypass of Access Controls through Query Manipulation](./threats/bypass_of_access_controls_through_query_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts HQL/JPQL or native SQL queries that circumvent intended access control mechanisms implemented at the application layer. This might involve manipulating joins, conditions, or subqueries to access data they should not have permission to see.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or modification of data belonging to other users or entities.

**Affected Component:** `org.hibernate.Query`, `org.hibernate.SQLQuery`, query execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authorization checks at the service layer, independent of database queries.
*   Design queries to explicitly filter data based on the current user's permissions.
*   Be cautious with dynamic query generation based on user roles or permissions, ensuring it cannot be manipulated.
*   Consider using database-level access controls in conjunction with application-level checks.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities via Entity Updates](./threats/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities_via_entity_updates.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how entity updates are handled, allowing them to modify attributes they should not have access to. This can happen if the application blindly accepts and applies all provided data during an update operation.

**Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation (e.g., modifying user roles), or unauthorized changes to critical entity properties.

**Affected Component:** `org.hibernate.Session.update()`, `org.hibernate.Session.merge()`, entity lifecycle management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never directly bind request parameters to entity objects for updates.
*   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or specific command objects to represent update requests.
*   Explicitly define which fields can be updated for each entity and enforce these restrictions in the application logic.
*   Implement proper authorization checks before performing update operations.

## Threat: [Use of Deprecated or Vulnerable Hibernate Versions](./threats/use_of_deprecated_or_vulnerable_hibernate_versions.md)

**Description:** Using outdated versions of Hibernate that contain known security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Exposure to publicly known exploits that could compromise the application.

**Affected Component:** The entire Hibernate ORM library.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Hibernate dependencies up-to-date with the latest stable versions.
*   Regularly review security advisories and patch vulnerabilities promptly.
*   Use dependency management tools to track and manage Hibernate dependencies.
