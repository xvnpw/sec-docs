### High and Critical Disruptor-Specific Attack Surfaces

*   **Attack Vector:** Unvalidated Data Publication by Producers
    *   **Description:** Producers publish data to the Ring Buffer without proper validation or sanitization.
    *   **How Disruptor Contributes:** The Disruptor acts as a high-throughput conduit for data. If producers are not careful, it efficiently propagates malicious or malformed data to consumers. The library itself doesn't enforce data validation at the publication stage, and its speed amplifies the impact of publishing invalid data.
    *   **Example:** A producer receives user input and directly publishes it as an event without checking for length limits or malicious characters. A consumer processing this event might then be vulnerable to a buffer overflow or other injection attack due to the unvalidated data delivered via the Disruptor.
    *   **Impact:** Consumers might crash, behave unexpectedly, or become vulnerable to further exploitation depending on how they process the invalid data. Could lead to data corruption or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the producer logic *before* publishing data to the Ring Buffer.
        *   Define clear data schemas or contracts for events and enforce them at the producer level.
        *   Consider using data serialization libraries that offer built-in validation features.

*   **Attack Vector:** Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Producers
    *   **Description:** Attackers control a producer and flood the Ring Buffer with events, overwhelming consumers.
    *   **How Disruptor Contributes:** The Disruptor's high-performance nature allows for rapid event publication. Without proper controls, this can be exploited to quickly exhaust consumer resources. The library is designed for speed and throughput, making it efficient for an attacker to overwhelm consumers.
    *   **Example:** A compromised producer continuously publishes large, computationally expensive events, causing consumers to fall behind and potentially crash due to memory pressure or CPU overload because the Disruptor efficiently delivers these malicious events.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the availability and responsiveness of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms on producers.
        *   Monitor producer activity for unusual spikes in event publication.
        *   Design consumers to handle backpressure gracefully, potentially discarding or delaying processing of excess events.
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for producers to prevent unauthorized publication.

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Wait Strategy Weaknesses
    *   **Description:** Certain wait strategies can be exploited to cause resource exhaustion or denial of service.
    *   **How Disruptor Contributes:** The choice of wait strategy directly impacts how consumers wait for new events. Some strategies, like `BusySpinWaitStrategy`, consume significant CPU even when idle. This behavior is inherent to the Disruptor's design and configuration options.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might intentionally cause periods of inactivity in producers when a `BusySpinWaitStrategy` is used by consumers, leading to unnecessary CPU consumption and potentially impacting other application components due to the Disruptor's configured wait strategy.
    *   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion, potentially leading to denial of service or performance degradation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(While generally medium, in specific resource-constrained environments, this could escalate to High if it leads to significant service disruption)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully choose the wait strategy based on the application's performance and resource constraints. Consider strategies like `BlockingWaitStrategy` or `SleepingWaitStrategy` in resource-sensitive environments.
        *   Monitor CPU usage of consumer threads to detect potential exploitation of wait strategies.

It's important to note that while "Vulnerabilities in Event Handler Logic" can be critical, the vulnerability lies within the *handler code* itself, not directly within the Disruptor. The Disruptor acts as a transport mechanism in that case. Similarly, race conditions in custom logic are primarily due to application-level concurrency issues, although the Disruptor's concurrency model is the context. This filtered list focuses on aspects where the Disruptor's design and features directly contribute to the attack surface.
