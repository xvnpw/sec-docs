## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit DBeaver Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Storage of Database Credentials -> Credentials Stored in Plain Text in DBeaver Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dbeaver_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_storage_of_database_credentials_-_credentia_0d4c74f6.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains access to the file system where DBeaver's configuration files are stored. These files contain database credentials in plain text.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - This depends on the security practices of the development and deployment teams. It's a common misconfiguration, especially in less mature environments.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation grants the attacker full access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete any data. This directly compromises the application's data integrity and confidentiality.
*   **Effort:** Minimal - If the attacker has file system access (e.g., through a compromised server or internal network), accessing and reading the configuration file is trivial.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice - Requires basic file system navigation skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - This vulnerability can be easily detected by automated tools that scan for sensitive information in configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit DBeaver Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Misconfigured Network Access -> DBeaver Instance Publicly Accessible](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dbeaver_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_misconfigured_network_access_-_dbeaver_instance_publ_0ca9ab6f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The DBeaver instance is configured to be accessible from the public internet without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Likelihood:** Low - This is less common in production environments but can occur due to misconfigurations or during development/testing phases.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Publicly accessible DBeaver provides a direct gateway to the connected databases. Attackers can use DBeaver's interface to manage the database, execute queries, and potentially compromise the underlying system if DBeaver has excessive permissions.
*   **Effort:** Minimal - Once the public accessibility is discovered (e.g., through port scanning), accessing DBeaver might only require default or weak credentials (if not properly secured).
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner - Requires basic networking knowledge and the ability to use DBeaver's interface.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Network scanning tools can easily identify publicly exposed DBeaver instances.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit DBeaver Software Vulnerabilities -> Exploiting Known DBeaver Vulnerabilities -> Exploiting Publicly Disclosed CVEs in DBeaver](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dbeaver_software_vulnerabilities_-_exploiting_known_dbeaver_vulnerabilities_-_exploiting_pub_4b050475.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs) in the specific version of DBeaver being used by the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - The likelihood depends on the severity and exploitability of the known vulnerabilities and how quickly the application's DBeaver instance is updated. Actively exploited CVEs have a higher likelihood.
*   **Impact:** Significant to Critical - The impact varies depending on the specific vulnerability. It can range from information disclosure and data breaches to remote code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Moderate - Exploits for known CVEs are often publicly available or can be developed relatively easily.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires understanding of vulnerability exploitation techniques and potentially the use of exploit frameworks.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - Vulnerability scanners can detect known CVEs. Intrusion detection systems might detect exploitation attempts if signatures are available.
