# Attack Surface Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_database_credentials.md)

* **Description:** Database connection credentials (usernames, passwords) required by DBeaver are stored in a way that is accessible to unauthorized individuals or processes.
    * **How DBeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DBeaver provides functionality to save connection credentials. If the application relies on DBeaver's built-in credential storage mechanisms (e.g., in its configuration files or internal storage) and these are not adequately protected, they become a target.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the file system where DBeaver's configuration files are stored and retrieves the database credentials saved within.
    * **Impact:**  Full compromise of the database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data. This can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Avoid relying on DBeaver's built-in credential storage. Implement secure credential management practices within the application, such as using a dedicated secrets management vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) or environment variables with restricted access.
        * **Users:** If direct DBeaver usage is necessary, avoid saving credentials within DBeaver. Use temporary credentials or prompt for credentials each time a connection is established. Encrypt the file system where DBeaver configuration is stored.

## Attack Surface: [Connection String Injection](./attack_surfaces/connection_string_injection.md)

* **Description:** The application dynamically constructs database connection strings that are then used by DBeaver. If these strings are not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious parameters.
    * **How DBeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DBeaver accepts connection strings as input. If the application passes unsanitized, dynamically generated connection strings to DBeaver, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks.
    * **Example:** An attacker manipulates an input field in the application that is used to build a connection string. By injecting parameters like `&options=-c 'system command'` (for PostgreSQL), they could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    * **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the database server, unauthorized access to the database, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all components used to build connection strings. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where possible. Avoid directly concatenating user-provided input into connection strings. Utilize secure connection string builders provided by database drivers.
        * **Users:**  Be cautious about the source of connection string information. Report any unexpected behavior or prompts related to database connections.

## Attack Surface: [Execution of Arbitrary SQL Queries](./attack_surfaces/execution_of_arbitrary_sql_queries.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the application to execute arbitrary SQL queries through DBeaver against the connected database.
    * **How DBeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DBeaver's core function is to execute SQL queries. If the application allows users or external entities to influence the SQL queries executed by DBeaver (even indirectly), it creates an attack vector. This could be through vulnerable plugins or by gaining control of a DBeaver session used by the application.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable plugin used by the application allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL into a query that is then executed by DBeaver. This could be used to exfiltrate data or modify database records.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the database, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Minimize the application's reliance on executing dynamic SQL through DBeaver. If necessary, carefully sanitize and validate any user-provided input that influences SQL queries. Implement strict access controls and the principle of least privilege for database users. Regularly audit and update DBeaver plugins.
        * **Users:** Be wary of untrusted plugins or extensions used with DBeaver. Monitor database activity for suspicious queries.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in DBeaver Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_dbeaver_plugins.md)

* **Description:**  Third-party or even official DBeaver plugins contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    * **How DBeaver Contributes to the Attack Surface:** DBeaver's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. If the application relies on specific plugins, vulnerabilities within those plugins become part of the application's attack surface.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable DBeaver plugin has an unpatched cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in its user interface, which an attacker exploits to gain control of a user's DBeaver session and subsequently access connected databases.
    * **Impact:**  Code execution within the DBeaver application, access to database credentials, or the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Thoroughly vet and audit any DBeaver plugins used by the application. Keep plugins updated to the latest versions. Consider the security reputation of plugin developers. If possible, limit the use of plugins to only essential functionalities.
        * **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Keep plugins updated. Be aware of the permissions requested by plugins.
