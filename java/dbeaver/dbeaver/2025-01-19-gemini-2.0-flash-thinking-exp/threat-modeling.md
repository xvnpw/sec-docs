# Threat Model Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials stored by DBeaver](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_stored_by_dbeaver.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the DBeaver configuration directory (e.g., `.dbeaver` folder) on a developer's machine. They then read the configuration files where database connection details, including potentially weakly encrypted or even plaintext passwords, are stored.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Connection String Injection via DBeaver (if application logic uses DBeaver's connection mechanisms)](./threats/connection_string_injection_via_dbeaver__if_application_logic_uses_dbeaver's_connection_mechanisms_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input fields within the application that are used to construct database connection strings passed directly to DBeaver's connection handling. This allows them to inject malicious parameters into the connection string, potentially connecting to unintended databases or executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [SQL Injection vulnerabilities introduced through DBeaver's query editor](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerabilities_introduced_through_dbeaver's_query_editor.md)

*   **Description:** A developer with access to DBeaver's query editor executes a crafted SQL query containing malicious code that exploits vulnerabilities in the database. This is a direct interaction with the database through DBeaver's interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via DBeaver's export features](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_dbeaver's_export_features.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or compromised developer uses DBeaver's built-in export functionality to extract sensitive data directly from the database through the DBeaver application and transfer it to an unauthorized location.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Malicious DBeaver Plugins](./threats/malicious_dbeaver_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** A developer installs a malicious or compromised DBeaver plugin. This plugin, being part of the DBeaver ecosystem, could have various malicious capabilities, such as stealing database credentials managed by DBeaver, executing arbitrary code within the DBeaver environment, or manipulating data through DBeaver's interfaces.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Exploitation of known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the DBeaver application itself](./threats/exploitation_of_known_or_zero-day_vulnerabilities_in_the_dbeaver_application_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers directly exploit security vulnerabilities within the DBeaver application code to gain unauthorized access to developer machines or potentially the databases they are connected to through DBeaver.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for actively exploited vulnerabilities) to High (for known but not actively exploited).

## Threat: [Insecure DBeaver Configuration](./threats/insecure_dbeaver_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Developers may configure DBeaver with insecure settings within the application itself, such as disabling security features related to connection management or data handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
