### 2. Scope

This analysis will focus on the following aspects:

### 4. Deep Analysis of Connection String Injection via DBeaver

#### 4.1 Understanding the Threat

The core of this threat lies in the application's reliance on user-provided or externally influenced data to construct database connection strings that are then directly used by DBeaver's connection mechanisms. Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious parameters into these strings.

**How it Works:**

Database connection strings are typically composed of key-value pairs specifying connection details like hostname, port, username, password, database name, and other driver-specific options. If the application concatenates user-controlled input directly into this string without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject additional parameters.

**Example:**

Consider a simplified scenario where the application allows users to specify the database name:

```
String databaseName = userInput; // User provides "my_database;${malicious_parameter}"
String connectionString = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/" + databaseName + "?user=app_user&password=secure_password";
// Resulting connection string: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/my_database;${malicious_parameter}?user=app_user&password=secure_password
```

In this example, the attacker injected `;${malicious_parameter}`. The interpretation of this malicious parameter depends on the specific database driver and its parsing logic.

#### 4.2 Potential Attack Vectors

Several potential attack vectors could be exploited:

*   **Web Forms/API Endpoints:** Input fields in web forms or parameters in API requests that are used to determine connection details (e.g., database name, server address, authentication method).
*   **Configuration Files:** If the application reads connection string components from configuration files that can be modified by an attacker (e.g., through a separate vulnerability).
*   **Environment Variables:** If the application uses environment variables to construct connection strings and these variables can be manipulated.
*   **Indirect Injection:**  An attacker might compromise another part of the system that feeds data into the connection string construction process.

#### 4.3 Potential Impacts

The impact of a successful connection string injection can be severe:

*   **Connecting to Unauthorized Databases:** An attacker could redirect the connection to a database they control, potentially exfiltrating sensitive data or planting malicious data.
*   **Executing Arbitrary Commands on the Database Server:** Some database drivers allow the execution of arbitrary commands through connection string parameters. For example, in some JDBC drivers, parameters like `options=-c "SET application_name='malicious_code'"` could be used to execute SQL commands upon connection.
*   **Bypassing Authentication:**  Attackers might be able to manipulate authentication parameters to bypass normal authentication mechanisms or connect with elevated privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Injecting parameters that cause the database server to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Injecting parameters that reveal internal database configurations or connection details.

The specific impact depends on the database system being used and the capabilities of its driver.

#### 4.4 DBeaver's Role

DBeaver acts as the intermediary that interprets and utilizes the constructed connection string. While DBeaver itself might not have inherent vulnerabilities leading to this injection, its functionality in establishing database connections based on provided strings makes it a crucial component in the attack chain.

**Key Considerations regarding DBeaver:**

*   **Driver Support:** DBeaver supports a wide range of database drivers, each with its own syntax and potentially exploitable parameters within the connection string.
*   **Connection Handling Logic:** The way DBeaver parses and processes connection strings for different database types is critical. If the application passes a maliciously crafted string, DBeaver will attempt to establish a connection based on that string.
*   **No Built-in Sanitization:** DBeaver is designed to connect to databases based on the provided information. It generally does not perform extensive sanitization or validation of connection string parameters beyond what the underlying database driver expects.

**It's important to emphasize that the vulnerability lies in the application's insecure construction of the connection string, not necessarily in DBeaver's functionality itself.** DBeaver is simply executing the instructions provided in the connection string.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of connection string injection, the development team should implement the following strategies:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that could influence the connection string. Use whitelisting to allow only expected characters and formats. Reject any input that deviates from the expected pattern.
*   **Parameterized Queries (or Equivalent for Connection Strings):**  Instead of directly concatenating user input into the connection string, use parameterized connection string construction mechanisms if available in the chosen libraries or frameworks. This helps to separate the connection string structure from the dynamic data.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions required for its functionality. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully inject malicious parameters.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Store connection string components securely and avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the application code. Use secure configuration management practices to protect these credentials.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on the parts of the application that handle database connections. Look for potential injection points and insecure coding practices.
*   **Consider Using Connection Pooling Libraries:** Some connection pooling libraries offer features that can help mitigate injection risks by managing connections and potentially sanitizing connection parameters.
*   **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of the risks associated with connection string injection and understand secure coding practices for database connections.

#### 4.6 Example Scenario

Consider an application that allows users to filter data based on a database name they provide. The application uses this input to construct a connection string to a specific database instance.

**Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

```java
String userProvidedDatabase = request.getParameter("databaseName");
String connectionString = "jdbc:postgresql://db.example.com:5432/" + userProvidedDatabase + "?user=readonly_user&password=password";
// ... use DBeaver to establish connection with connectionString ...
```

**Attack:**

An attacker could provide the following input for `databaseName`:

```
vulnerable_db;options='-c statement=''DROP TABLE users;'' --'
```

The resulting connection string would be:

```
jdbc:postgresql://db.example.com:5432/vulnerable_db;options='-c statement=''DROP TABLE users;'' --'?user=readonly_user&password=password
```

Depending on the PostgreSQL driver's interpretation of the `options` parameter, this could potentially execute the `DROP TABLE users;` command upon connection, even with the `readonly_user` credentials if the driver allows such execution during connection setup.

**Mitigation:**

The application should validate the `databaseName` parameter to ensure it only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores. Alternatively, instead of allowing arbitrary database names, the application could provide a predefined list of allowed databases and let the user select from that list.

### 5. Conclusion

Connection String Injection via DBeaver poses a significant risk to applications that rely on user-provided or externally influenced data to construct database connection strings. While DBeaver facilitates the connection process, the root cause of the vulnerability lies in the application's insecure handling of connection string construction.

By implementing robust input validation, utilizing parameterized connection mechanisms (if available), adhering to the principle of least privilege, and conducting regular security assessments, the development team can effectively mitigate this threat and protect the application and its data. Understanding the potential attack vectors and impacts is crucial for prioritizing and implementing the necessary security measures.
