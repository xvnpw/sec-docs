# Threat Model Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in DBeaver Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_dbeaver_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the system or user's profile where DBeaver is configured could potentially read the stored connection details, which might include database usernames and passwords. This could happen through malware, insider threat, or exploiting other system vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the targeted database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Connection Manager (credential storage mechanism)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid storing passwords directly in DBeaver connection configurations. Utilize OS credential managers or secure vault solutions integrated with DBeaver.
*   Encrypt DBeaver configuration files at rest.
*   Implement strong access controls on systems where DBeaver is used and its configuration files are stored.
*   Regularly review and rotate database credentials.

## Threat: [Execution of Arbitrary SQL through DBeaver Interface](./threats/execution_of_arbitrary_sql_through_dbeaver_interface.md)

**Description:** A malicious user with access to the DBeaver application could use its SQL editor or similar functionalities to execute arbitrary SQL commands directly against the connected database.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, privilege escalation within the database, potential execution of stored procedures with unintended consequences.

**Affected Component:** SQL Editor, Data Editor

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict authorization controls within DBeaver to limit access to query execution features based on user roles.
*   Consider using DBeaver's features to restrict allowed SQL commands or database objects.
*   Monitor and log SQL queries executed through DBeaver.

## Threat: [Exploitation of DBeaver's Data Export Features for Data Exfiltration](./threats/exploitation_of_dbeaver's_data_export_features_for_data_exfiltration.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the DBeaver application could utilize its data export features to extract sensitive data from the database to a local file or other accessible location.

**Impact:** Data breaches, loss of confidential information, potential violation of data privacy regulations.

**Affected Component:** Data Export module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict access to DBeaver's export functionalities based on user roles and permissions within DBeaver.
*   Implement monitoring and logging of data export activities within DBeaver.
*   Consider disabling or restricting export formats that are easily exfiltrated (e.g., CSV, plain text) within DBeaver's settings.

## Threat: [Malicious DBeaver Extensions or Plugins](./threats/malicious_dbeaver_extensions_or_plugins.md)

**Description:** If users are allowed to install arbitrary DBeaver extensions, a malicious extension could be installed that introduces vulnerabilities, such as keylogging, data exfiltration, or remote code execution within the DBeaver environment.

**Impact:** Compromise of the DBeaver instance, potential access to database credentials managed by DBeaver, exfiltration of data accessed through DBeaver, potential for further system compromise if the DBeaver environment is not properly isolated.

**Affected Component:** Extension Manager, Plugin System

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Restrict the installation of DBeaver extensions to trusted sources only.
*   Implement a process for vetting and approving DBeaver extensions before they are allowed to be installed.
*   Regularly review installed extensions within DBeaver and remove any that are unnecessary or suspicious.
*   Ensure DBeaver and its extensions are kept up to date with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Specific DBeaver Versions](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_specific_dbeaver_versions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the specific version of DBeaver being used. This could involve leveraging publicly disclosed exploits or zero-day vulnerabilities targeting DBeaver itself.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution within the DBeaver application, information disclosure from DBeaver's memory or configuration, denial of service of DBeaver, or other forms of compromise affecting DBeaver and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep DBeaver updated to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories related to DBeaver to stay informed about potential threats.
*   Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the installed DBeaver version.
