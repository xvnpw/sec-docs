# Attack Surface Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Attack Surface: [Storage of Connection Credentials](./attack_surfaces/storage_of_connection_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Storage of Connection Credentials
    *   **Description:** DBeaver stores database connection credentials for convenience. If this storage is insecure, credentials can be exposed.
    *   **How DBeaver Contributes:** DBeaver's method of storing and managing these credentials determines the security. Weak encryption or easily accessible storage locations increase the risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the DBeaver configuration files on a user's machine and decrypts the stored database credentials due to a weak encryption algorithm.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive databases, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (DBeaver):** Utilize strong encryption algorithms for storing credentials. Consider using operating system-level credential management where appropriate. Provide options for users to use secure credential storage mechanisms.
        *   **Users:** Utilize master passwords or other security features offered by DBeaver to protect stored credentials. Secure the machine where DBeaver is installed.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugins/Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_pluginsextensions.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Plugins/Extensions
    *   **Description:**  DBeaver's plugin architecture allows for extending functionality. Malicious or poorly written plugins can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How DBeaver Contributes:** DBeaver provides the framework for loading and executing plugins. If the plugin loading process or the plugin API has vulnerabilities, malicious plugins can exploit them.
    *   **Example:** A user installs a seemingly helpful plugin that secretly contains code to exfiltrate database connection details or execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, remote code execution, compromise of the DBeaver application and potentially the user's system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (DBeaver):** Implement a secure plugin loading mechanism with proper sandboxing and permission controls. Establish a process for vetting and signing plugins.
        *   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Carefully review the permissions requested by plugins before installation. Keep plugins updated.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Update Mechanism](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Update Mechanism
    *   **Description:** If DBeaver has an auto-update feature, vulnerabilities in this process can be exploited to deliver malicious updates.
    *   **How DBeaver Contributes:** DBeaver's implementation of the update process determines its security. Lack of integrity checks or insecure communication channels can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack during a DBeaver update, replacing the legitimate update with a malicious version containing malware.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malware, compromise of the DBeaver application and potentially the user's system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (DBeaver):** Implement secure update mechanisms using HTTPS and code signing to verify the integrity of updates.
        *   **Users:** Ensure that DBeaver's update settings are configured to use secure channels. Verify the authenticity of updates if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Local File System Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/local_file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Local File System Access Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** DBeaver interacts with the local file system for configuration, logs, and potentially importing/exporting data. Vulnerabilities in how it handles file paths can be exploited.
    *   **How DBeaver Contributes:**  Improper handling of file paths provided by users or within configuration files can lead to path traversal or arbitrary file write vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A user imports a specially crafted data file where the filename contains path traversal characters, allowing DBeaver to write data to an unintended location on the file system.
    *   **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, information disclosure, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers (DBeaver):** Implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths. Avoid constructing file paths directly from user input. Use secure file handling APIs.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious when importing or exporting files, especially from untrusted sources. Understand the file paths being used by DBeaver.
