## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via DBeaver Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_dbeaver_exploitation.md)

**Goal:** Compromise the application utilizing DBeaver by exploiting vulnerabilities within DBeaver itself, focusing on high-risk scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data.md)

* [High-Risk Path] Access Sensitive Data:
    * This path represents scenarios where the attacker's primary goal is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the application's database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Stored Connection Details](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_stored_connection_details.md)

* [High-Risk Path] **Exploit Stored Connection Details** [Critical Node]:
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker targets the way the application stores database connection credentials used by DBeaver. If these credentials are not properly secured, the attacker can retrieve them and directly access the database.
    * **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        * Insecure storage of credentials (e.g., plaintext in configuration files, environment variables, or weakly encrypted storage).
        * Insufficient access controls on credential storage locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Plaintext Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/access_plaintext_credentials.md)

* **Access Plaintext Credentials** [Critical Node]:
    * **Attack Vector:**  The attacker directly accesses and retrieves database credentials that are stored in an unencrypted, readable format.
    * **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        * Lack of encryption for sensitive data.
        * Poor configuration management practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL (Access Sensitive Data)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql__access_sensitive_data_.md)

* [High-Risk Path] **Inject Malicious SQL** [Critical Node]:
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them into the application's interaction with DBeaver. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially bypassing security controls.
    * **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        * Lack of input sanitization or validation on user-provided data that is used in SQL queries executed by DBeaver.
        * Use of dynamic SQL construction where user input is directly concatenated into queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage User Input Passed to DBeaver (Access Sensitive Data)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_user_input_passed_to_dbeaver__access_sensitive_data_.md)

* **Leverage User Input Passed to DBeaver** [Critical Node]:
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates user-provided input fields within the application, knowing that this input will be used to construct SQL queries executed by DBeaver.
    * **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        * Failure to properly sanitize or escape user input before incorporating it into SQL queries.
        * Lack of parameterized queries or prepared statements.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application Data](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_data.md)

* [High-Risk Path] Modify Application Data:
    * This path represents scenarios where the attacker's primary goal is to alter or corrupt data within the application's database, potentially disrupting functionality or causing financial harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SQL (Modify Application Data)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql__modify_application_data_.md)

* **Inject Malicious SQL** [Critical Node]:
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries and injects them into the application's interaction with DBeaver. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially bypassing security controls.
    * **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        * Lack of input sanitization or validation on user-provided data that is used in SQL queries executed by DBeaver.
        * Use of dynamic SQL construction where user input is directly concatenated into queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage User Input Passed to DBeaver (Modify Application Data)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_user_input_passed_to_dbeaver__modify_application_data_.md)

* **Leverage User Input Passed to DBeaver** [Critical Node]:
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates user-provided input fields within the application, knowing that this input will be used to construct SQL queries executed by DBeaver.
    * **Vulnerabilities Exploited:**
        * Failure to properly sanitize or escape user input before incorporating it into SQL queries.
        * Lack of parameterized queries or prepared statements.
