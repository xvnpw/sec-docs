# Attack Surface Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Attack Surface: [1. Credential Exposure (DBeaver Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/1__credential_exposure__dbeaver_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to database credentials stored within DBeaver's configuration files or connection profiles, if these are used or exposed by the application.
*   **DBeaver Contribution:** DBeaver stores connection information, including credentials, in its own configuration.  If the application relies on or exposes these files, they become a direct target.
*   **Example:** The application uses DBeaver's default configuration file location, and this location is accessible to unauthorized users or processes.  Or, the application programmatically accesses and exposes DBeaver's connection profiles.
*   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data theft, data modification, data destruction, potential lateral movement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   *Do not* rely on DBeaver's default configuration for production applications.  Instead, use a secure secrets management solution to provide credentials to the application.
        *   If DBeaver configuration *must* be used (e.g., for a specific integration), ensure the configuration files are stored in a secure location with restricted access permissions (only the application's user should have access).
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within the DBeaver configuration files (if supported by DBeaver and the chosen configuration format).
        *   *Never* commit DBeaver configuration files containing credentials to source code repositories.
        *   If the application programmatically interacts with DBeaver's configuration, ensure this interaction is secure and does not expose credentials.

## Attack Surface: [2. Driver-Level Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__driver-level_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the JDBC (or other) drivers that DBeaver *itself* uses to connect to the database. This is distinct from the application merely *using* DBeaver; this is about DBeaver's *own* driver usage.
*   **DBeaver Contribution:** DBeaver directly utilizes and manages database drivers.  Vulnerabilities in these drivers are a direct attack surface on DBeaver's functionality.
*   **Example:**  An outdated version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver bundled with or used by DBeaver (as configured by the application) has a known remote code execution vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific driver vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to complete database server compromise (if the vulnerability allows code execution in the context of the application using DBeaver).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   If the application manages DBeaver's driver configuration, ensure that only the latest, patched versions of drivers are used.
        *   Regularly update the drivers used by DBeaver (if the application controls this).
        *   Monitor security advisories for the specific drivers used by DBeaver (as configured by the application).
        *   Consider using a separate, isolated environment for DBeaver if its driver requirements conflict with other application components.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unsecured Database Connections (DBeaver Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/3__unsecured_database_connections__dbeaver_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** Database connections established by DBeaver, as configured by the application, are not properly secured (e.g., missing TLS/SSL), allowing interception.
*   **DBeaver Contribution:** DBeaver handles the connection establishment.  If the application configures DBeaver to use insecure connections, this is a direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** The application programmatically configures DBeaver to connect to a remote database without enabling TLS/SSL encryption, or it uses a DBeaver connection profile that disables encryption.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, potential man-in-the-middle attacks, data modification.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   If the application configures DBeaver's connections, *enforce* the use of TLS/SSL encryption.
        *   Validate server certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Use strong cipher suites and protocols.
        *   If using DBeaver connection profiles, ensure they are configured to use secure connection settings.
        *   Avoid using DBeaver features that might bypass secure connection settings.
