## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit DBeaver Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_dbeaver_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 Vulnerable Dependencies [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1 Outdated JDBC Driver Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Exploit known CVE in a specific JDBC driver (e.g., SQL injection, RCE) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in outdated JDBC drivers used by DBeaver to connect to databases.  This could involve SQL injection, remote code execution (RCE), or other driver-specific exploits.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Database compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits may be publicly available)
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.1.3 Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.1.3.2 Install a malicious plugin disguised as a legitimate one. [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  An attacker creates a malicious DBeaver plugin that mimics the functionality of a legitimate plugin.  They then trick users into installing it, either through social engineering, compromised plugin repositories, or other distribution methods.  Once installed, the malicious plugin can perform various actions, including stealing credentials, exfiltrating data, or executing arbitrary code.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full control over DBeaver client)
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

*   **1.2 DBeaver Core Vulnerabilities**

    *   **1.2.1 SQL Injection in DBeaver's own SQL processing**
        *   **1.2.1.1 Bypass DBeaver's input validation to inject malicious SQL. [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  An attacker finds a way to bypass DBeaver's built-in input validation mechanisms and inject malicious SQL code into queries processed by DBeaver itself (not just passed through to the database). This could occur in features like the SQL editor, data export, or other areas where DBeaver handles SQL internally.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Database compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **1.2.2 Authentication Bypass**
        *   **1.2.2.1 Exploit flaws in DBeaver's connection management to bypass authentication to the database. [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in how DBeaver manages database connections, allowing them to bypass the normal authentication process and connect directly to the database without valid credentials.
            *   **Likelihood:** Very Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Direct database access)
            *   **Effort:** High to Very High
            *   **Skill Level:** High to Very High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

    *   **1.2.3 Privilege Escalation within DBeaver**
        *   **1.2.3.2 Elevate privileges within the database through DBeaver. [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration or vulnerability in DBeaver, combined with a misconfiguration in the database itself, to gain higher privileges within the database than they should have.  For example, a connection configured with limited privileges might be exploited to gain administrative access.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Database compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.3 Configuration Vulnerabilities**

    *   **1.3.2 Insecure Storage of Connection Profiles [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **1.3.2.1 Access unencrypted or weakly encrypted connection details. [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:**  An attacker gains access to the files or storage location where DBeaver stores connection profiles.  If these profiles are stored unencrypted or with weak encryption, the attacker can extract database credentials (usernames, passwords, connection strings) and use them to connect directly to the databases.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Access to database credentials)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.1 Vulnerable Web Application Components (Specific to the server-side deployment) [HIGH RISK]**

    *   **2.1.1 Authentication Bypass in the web interface. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker finds a way to bypass the authentication mechanisms of the DBeaver server's web interface, gaining access to the application without providing valid credentials.

        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **2.1.2 Authorization Bypass (accessing features or data without proper permissions). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker, even if authenticated, finds a way to access features or data within the DBeaver server's web interface that they should not have access to based on their assigned roles or permissions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High

    *   **2.1.4 Input Validation Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection in the web interface). [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the DBeaver server's web interface handles user input.  This could include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where malicious scripts are injected into the web interface, or SQL injection attacks, where malicious SQL code is injected to manipulate the database through the web interface.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium

    *   **2.2.1 Outdated web server, application server, or database driver vulnerabilities. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The DBeaver server relies on various software components (web server, application server, database drivers).  If these components are outdated and have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to gain control of the server or access the database.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.3 Misconfigured Server Environment**

    *   **2.3.1 Weak or default credentials for the server or database. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The DBeaver server or the database it connects to is configured with weak or default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin").  Attackers can easily guess or brute-force these credentials to gain access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

*   **2.4 API Vulnerabilities (if DBeaver exposes an API)**

    *   **2.4.1 Authentication/Authorization flaws in the API. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** If DBeaver exposes an API, attackers might find vulnerabilities in the API's authentication or authorization mechanisms, allowing them to access API functions without proper credentials or permissions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High

    *   **2.4.2 Input validation vulnerabilities in API endpoints. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Similar to web interface vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit input validation flaws in the DBeaver API endpoints to inject malicious code or data, potentially leading to SQL injection, command execution, or other attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
