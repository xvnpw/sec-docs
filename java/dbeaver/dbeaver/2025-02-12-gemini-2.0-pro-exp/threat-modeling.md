# Threat Model Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via SQL Editor](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_sql_editor.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (malicious insider or compromised account) uses DBeaver's SQL Editor to craft and execute unauthorized SQL queries, bypassing application-level access controls. They might attempt to read sensitive data, enumerate tables, or discover database schema details.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, loss of data integrity, potential for further attacks.
    *   **DBeaver Component Affected:** SQL Editor, Connection Manager (if credentials are compromised).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict database-level permissions (Principle of Least Privilege).
        *   Enable comprehensive database auditing and regularly review logs.
        *   Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for database connections.
        *   Restrict database user accounts to only necessary privileges (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on specific tables/views.  Avoid granting broad permissions.
        *   Use database roles to manage permissions effectively.

## Threat: [Data Modification/Deletion via SQL Editor](./threats/data_modificationdeletion_via_sql_editor.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses the SQL Editor to execute unauthorized `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements, potentially corrupting or deleting critical data.  They might target specific records or perform mass deletions.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, application downtime, reputational damage.
    *   **DBeaver Component Affected:** SQL Editor, Connection Manager.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict database-level permissions (Principle of Least Privilege).  Restrict `UPDATE` and `DELETE` privileges to only authorized users and specific tables/rows.
        *   Database auditing and log review.
        *   MFA for database connections.
        *   Implement database backups and a robust recovery plan.
        *   Consider using "soft deletes" (marking records as deleted instead of physically removing them) where appropriate.

## Threat: [Credential Theft from Connection Manager](./threats/credential_theft_from_connection_manager.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a user's workstation and steals database credentials stored within DBeaver's Connection Manager. This could involve accessing the DBeaver configuration files or using malware to capture keystrokes or screen contents.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, potential for data breaches and other attacks.
    *   **DBeaver Component Affected:** Connection Manager, Secure Storage (if used, but potentially compromised).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing passwords directly in DBeaver connection profiles.
        *   Use a secure password manager.
        *   Utilize integrated credential management systems (e.g., OS credential providers).
        *   Implement strong workstation security (antivirus, EDR, regular patching).
        *   Educate users about phishing and social engineering risks.
        *   Use MFA for database access.

## Threat: [Exploitation of DBeaver Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_dbeaver_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a DBeaver plugin (e.g., a third-party extension for a specific database system) to gain control of the DBeaver client or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for complete system compromise, data breaches, and other attacks.
    *   **DBeaver Component Affected:** Plugins/Extensions system, potentially the entire DBeaver application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources (official DBeaver marketplace or reputable vendors).
        *   Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are unnecessary or outdated.
        *   Perform vulnerability scanning of workstations.
        *   Disable unused plugins.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Data Export Feature](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_data_export_feature.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses DBeaver's data export functionality (e.g., exporting query results to CSV, SQL, or other formats) to exfiltrate large amounts of sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of sensitive information, potential regulatory violations.
    *   **DBeaver Component Affected:** Data Editor, Result Set Viewer, Export functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor database activity for unusually large data transfers.
        *   Implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools.
        *   Consider restricting or disabling the data export functionality for certain users or roles, if feasible.
        *   Audit data export activities.

## Threat: [Execution of Malicious Scripts via Script Manager](./threats/execution_of_malicious_scripts_via_script_manager.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads and executes a malicious SQL script through DBeaver's Script Manager (or by opening a malicious `.sql` file). The script could contain commands to steal data, modify the database, or install backdoors.
    *   **Impact:** Database compromise, data breaches, system compromise.
    *   **DBeaver Component Affected:** Script Manager, SQL Editor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review any SQL scripts before executing them.
        *   Avoid running scripts from untrusted sources.
        *   Implement database-level input validation and restrictions on the types of commands that can be executed.
        *   Use a secure development workflow for managing SQL scripts (version control, code reviews).
