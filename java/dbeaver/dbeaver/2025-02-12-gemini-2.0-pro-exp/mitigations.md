# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Master Password and Secure Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_master_password_and_secure_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Master Password:** All DBeaver users *must* enable the master password feature within DBeaver's settings (Security or Connections).
    2.  **Strong Master Password Policy:** Users must create a strong, unique master password (not used elsewhere), meeting organizational complexity requirements.
    3.  **Configuration Directory Permissions:** Ensure the DBeaver configuration directory has restricted file system permissions. Only the DBeaver user should have read/write access (managed via OS-level permissions).
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review DBeaver configuration files to ensure no insecure credential storage (e.g., plain text passwords).
    5.  **Disable Auto-Save:** Disable the auto-save feature for passwords within DBeaver connection configurations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access via Stolen Credentials/Configuration (Severity: Critical):** Prevents direct database access if DBeaver configuration is compromised.
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: High):** Reduces risk of credential leaks from shared or leaked configuration files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Significantly reduced; attackers need to crack the master password.
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Significantly reduced; credentials are encrypted.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Master Password enabled for some users (in onboarding guide).
    *   Basic file system permissions checked during initial setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, enforced policy for *all* users on master password usage.
    *   Automated, regular review of configuration file permissions/contents.
    *   Centralized DBeaver configuration management (if feasible).
    *   Documentation on secure configuration directory locations for all OSes.
    *   Auto-save is not disabled by default.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage OS Credential Manager or Environment Variables (DBeaver Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_os_credential_manager_or_environment_variables__dbeaver_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Supported OS:** Check if the user's OS supports a secure credential manager (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service).
    2.  **Configure DBeaver Integration:** If supported, configure DBeaver to use the OS credential manager. This is done within DBeaver's connection settings.
    3.  **Environment Variables (Fallback):** If OS credential manager integration isn't possible, use environment variables. Define variables for sensitive connection parameters (e.g., `DB_PASSWORD`).
    4.  **DBeaver Configuration:** Configure DBeaver connection profiles to read parameters from environment variables (e.g., `${env:DB_PASSWORD}`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access via Stolen Credentials/Configuration (Severity: Critical):** Credentials aren't stored directly in DBeaver's files.
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: High):** Reduces exposure in configuration files or accidental sharing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access:** Significantly reduced; attackers need to compromise the OS credential manager or environment variables.
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Documentation provides examples of using environment variables for some database types.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive documentation/procedures for using OS credential managers with *all* supported database types.
    *   Enforced policy requiring OS credential managers or environment variables, *prohibiting* direct password storage in DBeaver profiles.
    *   Automated checks to ensure DBeaver configurations aren't storing passwords directly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Encrypted Connections (DBeaver Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_encrypted_connections__dbeaver_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **DBeaver Connection Settings:** In DBeaver, configure *all* database connections to use SSL/TLS. Select "SSL" or "TLS" and specify certificate details if needed.
    2.  **Certificate Verification:** Enable certificate verification within DBeaver to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    3.  **SSH Tunneling (Remote Connections):** For remote connections, *always* use SSH tunneling. Configure DBeaver to connect via an SSH tunnel.
    4.  **SSH Key-Based Authentication:** Use SSH key-based authentication for the SSH tunnel (not password-based). Configure DBeaver to use the SSH private key.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Network Eavesdropping (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks) (Severity: High):** Prevents interception of database communication.
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access (via intercepted credentials) (Severity: Critical):** Protects credentials sent over the network.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Network Eavesdropping:** Risk eliminated with proper SSL/TLS and SSH tunneling.
    *   **Unauthorized Database Access (via intercepted credentials):** Significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   SSL/TLS enabled for connections to the production database.
    *   SSH tunneling recommended in documentation for remote access.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Mandatory* SSH tunneling for *all* remote connections, enforced through policy and DBeaver configuration.
    *   Automated checks to ensure all DBeaver connections use SSL/TLS or SSH tunneling.
    *   Consistent SSH key-based authentication configuration across all users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular DBeaver and Dependency Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dbeaver_and_dependency_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for Updates:** Regularly check for updates to DBeaver and its JDBC drivers. Subscribe to DBeaver's release announcements.
    2.  **Testing:** Test updates in a non-production environment before deployment.
    3.  **Update Procedure:** Establish a procedure for updating DBeaver, including rollback plans.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in DBeaver or Dependencies (Severity: Variable, potentially High):** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the window of opportunity for exploiting known vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Ad-hoc updates by individual users.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized update process with regular checks, testing, and documentation.
    *   Centralized management of DBeaver versions (if feasible).
    *   Vulnerability scanning to identify outdated components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Read-Only Connections in DBeaver](./mitigation_strategies/configure_read-only_connections_in_dbeaver.md)

*   **Description:**
    1. **Identify Read-Only Users:** Determine which users primarily need to *view* data and do not require write access.
    2. **Configure Read-Only Mode:** Within DBeaver, for each connection used by read-only users, enable the "Read-Only Connection" option. This is typically found in the connection settings or properties.  This setting prevents DBeaver from sending any `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` statements to the database.
    3. **User Training:** Inform users about the read-only restriction and ensure they understand its purpose.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion (Severity: High):** Prevents accidental or malicious data changes by users who should only have read access.  This is a DBeaver-level control that complements database-level permissions.
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: High):** While it doesn't prevent SQL injection *attempts*, it limits the *impact* of an injection attack against a read-only connection.  The attacker would be unable to modify data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion:**  Significantly reduced for users with read-only connections.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Reduces the potential damage from an attack.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not consistently implemented. Some users may have read-only database accounts, but the DBeaver setting is not enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal policy and procedure for identifying read-only users and configuring DBeaver accordingly.
    *   Automated checks to ensure that read-only users have the "Read-Only Connection" option enabled in DBeaver.
    *   Documentation and training for users on the use of read-only connections.
