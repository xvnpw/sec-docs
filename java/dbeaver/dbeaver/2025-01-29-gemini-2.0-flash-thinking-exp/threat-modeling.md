# Threat Model Analysis for dbeaver/dbeaver

## Threat: [Exposed Database Credentials in DBeaver Configuration](./threats/exposed_database_credentials_in_dbeaver_configuration.md)

* **Description:** An attacker gains access to DBeaver configuration files (e.g., `.dbeaver-data`, `.dbeaver-credentials`) through insecure server configuration, file system access, or social engineering. They extract database connection details, including usernames and passwords, stored within these files.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breaches, data manipulation, potential privilege escalation within the database system, reputational damage, and financial loss.
* **DBeaver Component Affected:** Configuration Storage (specifically connection profiles and credential storage).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure server and file system permissions to restrict access to DBeaver configuration files.
    * Implement operating system-level access controls.
    * Consider using DBeaver's credential storage encryption features (if available and properly configured).
    * Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in configuration files if possible; explore alternative credential management solutions.
    * Regularly audit access to systems where DBeaver configuration files are stored.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via DBeaver Export Functionality](./threats/data_leakage_via_dbeaver_export_functionality.md)

* **Description:** A user with access to DBeaver, either maliciously or accidentally, exports sensitive data from the database using DBeaver's export features (e.g., CSV, SQL, JSON). This exported data is then stored in an insecure location, such as a local file system, shared network drive with weak access controls, or cloud storage without proper security. An attacker later gains access to this insecure location and retrieves the exported data.
* **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive personal information, financial data, or trade secrets, compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
* **DBeaver Component Affected:** Data Export Functionality (various export formats and wizards).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict access control policies for DBeaver usage within your application environment.
    * Educate users about data security best practices and the risks of exporting sensitive data to insecure locations.
    * Disable or restrict DBeaver's export functionality if it's not essential for authorized users.
    * Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to monitor and control data exports.
    * Enforce secure storage locations for exported data and provide guidance on secure data handling.

## Threat: [Malicious Data Import via DBeaver Import Functionality](./threats/malicious_data_import_via_dbeaver_import_functionality.md)

* **Description:** An attacker, or a compromised user, imports malicious data into the database using DBeaver's import features (e.g., CSV, SQL). This malicious data could contain SQL injection payloads, scripts designed to exploit database vulnerabilities, or simply corrupt data to disrupt application functionality.
* **Impact:** Database compromise, data corruption, application malfunction, potential SQL injection vulnerabilities exploited through imported data, denial of service, and introduction of backdoors.
* **DBeaver Component Affected:** Data Import Functionality (various import formats and wizards).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data imported into the database, regardless of the source.
    * Restrict DBeaver's import functionality to authorized users only.
    * Educate users about the risks of importing data from untrusted sources.
    * Implement database security measures to detect and prevent malicious SQL execution.
    * Regularly monitor database activity for suspicious import operations.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation in DBeaver](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation_in_dbeaver.md)

* **Description:** An attacker, or a compromised user, installs a malicious DBeaver plugin from an untrusted source. This plugin could contain malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the system running DBeaver or the connected databases.
* **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, remote code execution, introduction of malware, and potential supply chain attacks if plugins are sourced from compromised repositories.
* **DBeaver Component Affected:** Plugin Management System.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Restrict plugin installation to authorized administrators only.
    * Implement a plugin vetting process to review and approve plugins before installation.
    * Only allow plugin installations from trusted and official sources (e.g., DBeaver Marketplace, verified repositories).
    * Regularly review installed plugins and remove any unnecessary or untrusted plugins.
    * Keep DBeaver and plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Database Access via Weak DBeaver Access Control](./threats/unauthorized_database_access_via_weak_dbeaver_access_control.md)

* **Description:** If DBeaver is exposed in a multi-user environment or through a remote access mechanism, and access control within DBeaver is not properly configured (e.g., default administrative accounts, weak passwords, lack of role-based access control), an attacker could gain unauthorized access to DBeaver and subsequently to connected databases.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, and circumvention of application-level security controls.
* **DBeaver Component Affected:** User Authentication and Authorization (if applicable in your deployment scenario).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strong authentication mechanisms for DBeaver access (if applicable).
    * Enforce role-based access control within DBeaver to limit user privileges to only what is necessary.
    * Regularly review and audit user accounts and permissions within DBeaver.
    * If DBeaver is accessed remotely, ensure secure remote access mechanisms are in place (e.g., VPN, SSH tunneling).

## Threat: [Exploitation of DBeaver Software Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_dbeaver_software_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the DBeaver application itself. This could be achieved through network attacks, malicious files, or social engineering. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or unauthorized access to data and systems.
* **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, denial of service, remote code execution, and potential full control over the system running DBeaver.
* **DBeaver Component Affected:** Core DBeaver Application, potentially various modules depending on the vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical (for remote code execution vulnerabilities), High (for data breaches or DoS).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep DBeaver updated to the latest version and apply security patches promptly.
    * Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to DBeaver.
    * Implement network security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems) to protect the system running DBeaver.
    * Regularly scan the system running DBeaver for vulnerabilities.
    * Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) if DBeaver is exposed through a web interface (though less common for standard DBeaver usage).
