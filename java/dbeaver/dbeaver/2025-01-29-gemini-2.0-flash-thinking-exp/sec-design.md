# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert in software, cloud and cybersecurity architecture. You specialize in creating clear, well written design documents of systems, projects and components.

# GOAL

Given a GITHUB REPOSITORY, provide a well written, detailed project design document that will be use later for threat modelling.

# STEPS

- Think deeply about the input and what they are concerned with.

- Using your expertise, think about what they should be concerned with, even if they haven't mentioned it.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called BUSINESS POSTURE, determine what are business priorities and goals that idea or project is trying to solve. Give most important business risks that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for project. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or project in question. Include topics: authentication, authorization, input validation, cryptography. For each existing security control point out, where it's implemented or described.

- Under that, create a section called DESIGN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed design document including diagram.

- In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTEXT and provide mermaid graph that will represent a project context diagram showing project as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems/projects that it interacts with.

- Under that, in C4 CONTEXT subsection, create list that will describe elements of context diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTAINER and provide mermaid graph that will represent a container diagram. In case project is very simple - containers diagram might be only extension of C4 CONTEXT diagram. In case project is more complex it should show the high-level shape of the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

- Under that, in C4 CONTAINER subsection, create list that will describe elements of container diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called DEPLOYMENT and provide information how project is deployed into target environment. Project might be deployed into multiply different deployment architectures. First list all possible solutions and pick one to descried in details. Include mermaid graph to visualize deployment. A deployment diagram allows to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given deployment environment.

- Under that, in DEPLOYMENT subsection, create list that will describe elements of deployment diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called BUILD and provide information how project is build and publish. Focus on security controls of build process, e.g. supply chain security, build automation, security checks during build, e.g. SAST scanners, linters, etc. Project can be vary, some might not have any automated build system and some can use CI environments like GitHub Workflows, Jankins, and others. Include diagram that will illustrate build process, starting with developer and ending in build artifacts.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Output in the format above only using valid Markdown. Use valid markdown syntax. Don't use markdown tables at all, use markdown lists instead. Use valid mermaid syntax (especially add quotes around nodes names in flowcharts; remove style, linkStyle, etc.).

- Do not use bold or italic formatting in the Markdown (no asterisks).

- Do not complain about anything, just do what you're told.

# INPUT:

GITHUB REPOSITORY: https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver

# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a universal database tool that supports a wide range of database systems.
  - Offer a feature-rich environment for database administration, SQL development, and data analysis.
  - Maintain a stable, reliable, and performant application for users working with databases.
  - Foster a strong open-source community around the project.
  - Offer commercial versions or services to sustain development and potentially generate revenue (although primarily open-source).
- Business Risks:
  - Data breaches or data leaks through the application, potentially exposing sensitive database information.
  - Application vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise user systems or databases.
  - Loss of user trust due to security incidents or instability.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies or build processes.
  - Legal and compliance issues related to data privacy and security regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) if handling sensitive data in specific contexts.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed as part of the development process (inferred from open-source nature and community contributions, though not explicitly documented in provided link).
  - security control: Use of standard development practices for Java and related technologies (e.g., dependency management with Maven, potentially static analysis tools, though not explicitly documented in provided link).
  - security control: Regular updates and patching of dependencies (inferred best practice for open-source projects).
  - security control: User authentication to database systems is delegated to the underlying database drivers and systems. DBeaver itself does not manage user credentials directly for target databases.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party database drivers, as DBeaver relies on these for database connectivity and functionality. Mitigation is through driver updates and user awareness.
  - accepted risk: User misconfiguration of database connections or permissions within DBeaver, leading to unintended data access or modifications. Mitigation is through documentation and user education.
  - accepted risk: Potential for SQL injection vulnerabilities if query construction logic is flawed. Mitigation is through secure coding practices and input validation.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
  - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to continuously monitor and manage open-source dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits to identify and address security weaknesses in the application.
  - security control: Provide security awareness training for developers on secure coding practices, common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10), and secure development lifecycle principles.
  - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization for all user inputs, especially SQL queries and database connection parameters, to prevent injection attacks.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: DBeaver should securely manage and store database connection credentials, utilizing appropriate encryption mechanisms when stored locally.
    - Requirement: DBeaver should support and integrate with database-specific authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, Kerberos, OAuth) as provided by database drivers.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: DBeaver should respect and enforce the authorization policies defined within the connected database systems. It should not bypass database-level access controls.
    - Requirement: DBeaver should provide features for users to manage database permissions and roles in a secure and controlled manner, reflecting the underlying database authorization model.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: DBeaver must validate all user inputs, including SQL queries, connection parameters, and data inputs, to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side (DBeaver application) and, where applicable, server-side components (if any).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data, such as database credentials, should be encrypted at rest when stored locally by DBeaver.
    - Requirement: Secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) should be used for network connections to databases, where supported by the database system and drivers.
    - Requirement: Cryptographic operations should be performed using well-established and reviewed cryptographic libraries.
