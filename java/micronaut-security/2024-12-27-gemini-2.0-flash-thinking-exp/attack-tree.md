**Goal:** Compromise application by exploiting high-risk weaknesses within Micronaut Security.

**Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application via Micronaut Security
├── AND Exploit Authentication Mechanisms
│   ├── **AND Exploit Configuration Errors** **(Critical Node)**
│   │   └── Insight: Misconfigured security rules or filter chains in `application.yml` or through annotations could allow bypassing authentication checks for certain endpoints. Review configuration thoroughly.

│   │           └── Insight: While not directly a Micronaut Security issue, XSS can be used to steal session cookies managed by Micronaut Security. Implement robust XSS prevention.
│   ├── **OR Exploit JWT (JSON Web Token) Vulnerabilities (If JWT Authentication is Used)**
│   │   ├── **AND Secret Key Compromise** **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**

│   │   ├── **AND Algorithm Confusion Attack** **(High-Risk Path)**
│   │   │   └── Insight: If the application doesn't strictly enforce the expected signing algorithm, attackers might manipulate the `alg` header to use a weaker or no algorithm. Ensure strict algorithm enforcement.
│   │   ├── **AND "None" Algorithm Exploitation** **(High-Risk Path)**
│   │   │   └── Insight: Similar to algorithm confusion, if the "none" algorithm is allowed, attackers can create unsigned JWTs. Disable the "none" algorithm.

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

1. **Session Hijacking via XSS:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application (XSS vulnerability). When a victim user visits the affected page, the script executes in their browser and steals their session cookie managed by Micronaut Security. The attacker then uses this cookie to impersonate the victim.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Account Takeover)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement robust XSS prevention techniques:** Input validation, output encoding (context-aware escaping), Content Security Policy (CSP).
        * **Use HttpOnly flag for session cookies:** Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie.
        * **Regular security audits and penetration testing:** To identify and remediate XSS vulnerabilities.

2. **JWT Authentication Bypass via Secret Key Compromise:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker gains access to the secret key used to sign JWTs in the Micronaut Security application. With this key, they can forge valid JWTs, allowing them to authenticate as any user without needing their actual credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Critical (Complete Authentication Bypass, Ability to Impersonate Any User)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Securely store and manage the JWT signing secret:** Use hardware security modules (HSMs), secure vault solutions, or environment variables with restricted access.
        * **Implement proper access controls:** Limit access to the secret key to only authorized personnel and systems.
        * **Consider using asymmetric key pairs (public/private key):** This reduces the risk if the public key is compromised.
        * **Regularly rotate signing keys:** Limits the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.

3. **JWT Authentication Bypass via Algorithm Manipulation:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The attacker manipulates the `alg` (algorithm) header of a JWT to use a weaker or no algorithm (e.g., "none"). If the application's JWT verification process doesn't strictly enforce the expected algorithm, it might accept the manipulated JWT, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Critical (Authentication Bypass)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strictly enforce the expected JWT signing algorithm:** Configure Micronaut Security to only accept JWTs signed with the intended algorithm.
        * **Disable the "none" algorithm:** Ensure the application rejects JWTs with the "none" algorithm specified.
        * **Regularly review and update JWT library configurations:** To ensure best security practices are followed.

**Critical Nodes:**

1. **Exploit Configuration Errors (under Bypass Authentication Filters and Bypass Authorization Filters):**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Incorrectly configured security rules or filter chains within Micronaut Security's configuration (e.g., `application.yml`, annotations) can create loopholes, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and/or authorization checks for specific endpoints or resources.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Access to Protected Resources without Authentication/Authorization)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Manage security configurations in a version-controlled and auditable manner.
        * **Thoroughly review and test security configurations:** Use automated tools and manual reviews to identify misconfigurations.
        * **Follow the principle of least privilege:** Configure security rules to grant only the necessary access.
        * **Implement security configuration linting and validation:** To catch potential errors before deployment.

2. **Exploit Configuration Errors in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (under Privilege Escalation):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Misconfigured roles or permissions within Micronaut Security's RBAC system can allow users to gain access to resources or perform actions they are not intended to. This can lead to privilege escalation, where a user with limited privileges gains access to higher-level functionalities.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Access to Sensitive Resources or Actions, Privilege Escalation)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Design and implement a well-defined RBAC model:** Clearly define roles and their associated permissions.
        * **Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations:** Ensure roles and permissions are still appropriate and haven't been inadvertently misconfigured.
        * **Use a centralized and auditable system for managing roles and permissions.**
        * **Implement segregation of duties:** Ensure no single user has excessive privileges.

3. **Secret Key Compromise (under Exploit JWT Vulnerabilities):** (Already detailed in High-Risk Paths)

By focusing on mitigating the risks associated with these high-risk paths and critical nodes, the development team can significantly improve the security posture of their Micronaut Security application. Regular security assessments and adherence to secure development practices are crucial for maintaining a strong security defense.
