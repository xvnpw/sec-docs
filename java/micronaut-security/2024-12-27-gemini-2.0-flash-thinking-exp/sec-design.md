## Project Design Document: Micronaut Security

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed design overview of the Micronaut Security project, a module within the Micronaut framework that provides comprehensive security features for building secure applications. This document aims to clearly articulate the architecture, components, and functionalities of Micronaut Security to facilitate effective threat modeling and security analysis.

**2. Goals**

The primary goals of Micronaut Security are to:

* Provide a declarative and annotation-driven approach to securing Micronaut applications.
* Offer a flexible and extensible architecture to support various authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Integrate seamlessly with the Micronaut framework's dependency injection and AOP capabilities.
* Minimize boilerplate code required for implementing security features.
* Offer support for common security standards and protocols.
* Provide a foundation for building secure microservices and serverless applications.

**3. Overall Architecture**

Micronaut Security adopts a layered architecture, primarily relying on interceptors and filters to enforce security policies. The core components interact to authenticate and authorize requests before they reach the application's business logic.

* Request Interception: Incoming HTTP requests are intercepted by security filters and interceptors.
* Authentication:  The system attempts to authenticate the request based on provided credentials (e.g., headers, cookies).
* Authorization: Once authenticated, the system determines if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
* Security Context:  Information about the authenticated user and their roles/permissions is stored in a security context.
* Exception Handling:  Mechanisms are in place to handle authentication and authorization failures gracefully.

**4. Key Components**
