## Key Attack Surface List - Micronaut Security (High & Critical)

| Attack Surface | Description | Micronaut Security Contribution | Example | Impact | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Weak/Default Authentication** | Relying on easily guessable credentials or insecure authentication schemes. | Micronaut Security allows configuration of various authentication providers (Basic, Digest, Form, OAuth 2.0, JWT). Using default configurations or weak schemes increases risk. | Using default username/password for Basic Authentication or relying solely on HTTP Basic without HTTPS. | Unauthorized access to user accounts and application resources. | **High** | Enforce strong password policies, utilize secure authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 or JWT, always use HTTPS. Configure appropriate authentication providers and disable default/weak ones if not needed. |
| **Misconfigured Authorization Rules** | Incorrectly defined access control rules granting excessive privileges. | Micronaut Security uses annotations like `@Secured`, `@RolesAllowed`, and custom `SecurityRule` implementations to define authorization. Flawed configuration leads to privilege escalation. | A user with a "viewer" role can access endpoints intended for "admin" due to a misconfigured `@Secured` annotation. | Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access or modification, potential for lateral movement. | **High** | Implement the principle of least privilege, define granular roles and permissions, thoroughly test authorization logic, regularly review and audit security rules. |
| **Insecure Session Management** | Vulnerabilities in how user sessions are handled, leading to hijacking or fixation. | Micronaut Security manages sessions through cookies or other mechanisms. Insecure configuration (e.g., missing `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags) increases risk. | Session cookies without `HttpOnly` flag being stolen via XSS, allowing an attacker to impersonate the user. | Account takeover, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user. | **Critical** | Configure secure session management with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, use strong and unpredictable session IDs, regenerate session IDs after login, consider using stateless authentication (JWT) where appropriate. |
| **CSRF Vulnerability** | Attackers trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions. | Micronaut Security provides CSRF protection mechanisms. Disabling or misconfiguring this protection exposes the application. | A malicious website containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable application while the user is logged in, performing an action without their consent (e.g., changing email). | Unauthorized state changes, data manipulation, potential financial loss. | **High** | Enable and properly configure CSRF protection for all state-changing requests. Use synchronizer token pattern or other robust CSRF defense mechanisms provided by Micronaut Security. |
| **JWT Signature Bypass/Forgery** | Exploiting weaknesses in JWT signature verification or using a compromised secret key. | Micronaut Security supports JWT-based authentication. Weak or missing signature verification allows attackers to forge tokens. | An attacker using the `alg=none` vulnerability or a compromised secret key to create a valid-looking JWT and gain unauthorized access. | Complete authentication bypass, impersonation of any user. | **Critical** | Enforce strong signature verification algorithms (e.g., RS256, HS256), securely manage JWT signing keys (avoid storing them in code), regularly rotate keys, and avoid using the `none` algorithm. |
| **OAuth 2.0/OIDC Misconfiguration** | Flaws in the OAuth 2.0 or OIDC flow leading to authorization code or access token theft. | Micronaut Security integrates with OAuth 2.0 and OIDC providers. Incorrect configuration of redirect URIs, client secrets, or scope validation can introduce vulnerabilities. | An attacker registering a malicious redirect URI with the application's OAuth 2.0 client, intercepting the authorization code, and obtaining an access token. | Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data and resources. | **High** | Strictly validate redirect URIs (use exact matching, avoid wildcards), securely store client secrets, enforce proper scope validation, and use the state parameter to prevent CSRF during the OAuth flow. |
| **Bypassing Security Filters due to Misconfiguration** | Incorrectly configured security rules or filters allowing unauthorized access to protected endpoints. | Micronaut Security's filter chain and security rule evaluation can be bypassed if configured incorrectly. | A security rule intended to protect an admin endpoint is not applied due to an ordering issue in the filter chain or a logical error in the rule definition. | Unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities or data. | **High** | Thoroughly review and test security rule configurations, ensure correct filter ordering, and use integration tests to verify that security filters are applied as expected. |
| **Logic Flaws in Custom Security Rules** | Vulnerabilities introduced through custom `SecurityRule` implementations. | Developers can extend Micronaut Security by implementing custom `SecurityRule` classes. Errors in this custom code can create vulnerabilities. | A custom security rule intended to check for specific user attributes contains a logical flaw, allowing users without those attributes to bypass the check. | Bypassing authorization checks, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access. | **High** | Thoroughly review and test custom security rule implementations, follow secure coding practices, and consider using existing Micronaut Security features where possible instead of writing custom logic. |
