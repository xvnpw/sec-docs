Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Micronaut Security, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Authentication Bypass due to Misconfigured Authentication Providers
    *   **Description:** Attackers can bypass the intended authentication mechanism due to incorrect configuration or vulnerabilities in custom or built-in authentication providers.
    *   **How Micronaut Security Contributes:** Micronaut Security relies on properly configured authentication providers (e.g., JDBC, LDAP, custom implementations). Misconfigurations in these providers directly lead to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A JDBC authentication provider configured with overly permissive SQL queries could allow an attacker to authenticate without knowing valid credentials by manipulating the input.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application and its resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the configuration of all authentication providers.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring database access for JDBC providers.
        *   Sanitize and validate user inputs in custom authentication providers to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities in built-in providers.

*   **Attack Surface:** Brute-Force Attacks on Login Endpoints
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different combinations.
    *   **How Micronaut Security Contributes:** Micronaut Security provides the framework for authentication, and if not configured with proper protection, login endpoints can be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses automated tools to send numerous login requests with different username/password combinations to the application's login endpoint.
    *   **Impact:** Successful compromise of user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address within a given timeframe.
        *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   Consider using CAPTCHA or similar challenges to differentiate between human users and automated bots.

*   **Attack Surface:** JWT Secret Key Exposure or Weakness
    *   **Description:** If using JWT-based authentication, a weak or exposed secret key allows attackers to forge valid JWTs and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Micronaut Security Contributes:** Micronaut Security's JWT support relies on a secret key for signing and verifying tokens. If this key is compromised or weak, the entire authentication scheme is broken.
    *   **Example:** The JWT secret key is hardcoded in the application's source code or stored in a publicly accessible configuration file. An attacker finds this key and uses it to create their own valid JWTs.
    *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of authentication, allowing attackers to impersonate any user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store the JWT secret key securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or secure key stores.
        *   Use strong, randomly generated, and sufficiently long secret keys.
        *   Regularly rotate the JWT secret key.
        *   Avoid hardcoding the secret key in the application code or configuration files.

*   **Attack Surface:** Authorization Bypass due to Incorrect Security Rules
    *   **Description:** Attackers can access resources they are not authorized to access due to flaws or misconfigurations in the application's security rules.
    *   **How Micronaut Security Contributes:** Micronaut Security uses annotations like `@Secured` and `SecurityRule` implementations to define authorization rules. Incorrectly defined or overly permissive rules can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A security rule is defined such that any user with the role "VIEWER" can access sensitive administrative endpoints, even though they should only be able to view basic data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining security rules.
        *   Thoroughly test all security rules to ensure they function as intended.
        *   Regularly review and audit security rule configurations.
        *   Use specific and granular roles and authorities instead of broad, encompassing ones.

*   **Attack Surface:** CSRF Vulnerabilities due to Disabled or Misconfigured Protection
    *   **Description:** Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application.
    *   **How Micronaut Security Contributes:** Micronaut Security provides CSRF protection mechanisms. Disabling this protection or misconfiguring it leaves the application vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious website that contains a form submitting a request to the vulnerable application. A logged-in user visiting the attacker's website unknowingly triggers this request, performing an action they did not intend.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users, potentially leading to data modification, account compromise, or financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure CSRF protection is enabled globally or for relevant endpoints.
        *   Use the recommended methods for including CSRF tokens in requests (e.g., synchronizer token pattern).
        *   Properly validate CSRF tokens on the server-side for all state-changing requests.

*   **Attack Surface:** Session Fixation
    *   **Description:** An attacker can force a user to use a specific session ID, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in.
    *   **How Micronaut Security Contributes:** Micronaut Security handles session management. If not properly configured, it might be susceptible to session fixation attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a user a link containing a specific session ID. If the application doesn't regenerate the session ID upon successful login, the attacker can use that same ID to access the user's account after they log in.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the application regenerates the session ID upon successful login.
        *   Use secure session ID generation mechanisms.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Credential Storage in Custom Authentication
    *   **Description:** If using custom authentication mechanisms, developers might implement insecure methods for storing user credentials.
    *   **How Micronaut Security Contributes:** While Micronaut Security provides secure password encoding, developers implementing custom authentication might bypass these features and introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A custom authentication provider stores user passwords in plain text in a database or configuration file.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of user credentials, leading to account compromise and potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Leverage Micronaut Security's password encoding features with strong hashing algorithms (e.g., BCrypt, Argon2).
        *   Avoid storing raw passwords under any circumstances.
