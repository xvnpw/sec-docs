## High and Critical Micronaut Security Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Micronaut Security Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Authentication Bypass via Misconfigured JWT** | An attacker might exploit a weakly configured JWT authentication setup. This could involve using a default or easily guessable secret key, exploiting missing or incorrect signature verification, or leveraging a "none" algorithm vulnerability if allowed. They could forge valid-looking JWTs to gain unauthorized access. | Full access to user accounts and protected resources, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and service disruption. | `micronaut-security-jwt` (JWT Authentication Module) | **Critical** | - **Strong Secret Key:** Use a strong, randomly generated, and securely stored secret key for signing JWTs. Avoid default secrets. - **Algorithm Enforcement:** Explicitly configure and enforce strong signing algorithms (e.g., HS256, RS256) and disallow "none". - **Audience and Issuer Validation:** Properly configure and validate the `aud` (audience) and `iss` (issuer) claims in JWTs to prevent token reuse from other systems. - **Expiration Time (exp):** Ensure JWTs have a reasonable expiration time to limit the window of opportunity for compromised tokens. - **Key Rotation:** Implement a strategy for regularly rotating the JWT signing key. |
| **Authorization Bypass due to Insecure Security Rules** | An attacker might exploit overly permissive or incorrectly defined security rules. This could involve crafting requests that bypass intended access controls due to logical flaws in `@Secured` annotations, `SecurityRule` implementations, or role/permission mappings. | Unauthorized access to specific resources or functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and unintended modifications. | `micronaut-security` (Core Security Module), `@Secured` annotation, `SecurityRule` interface, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | **High** | - **Granular Authorization:** Define fine-grained security rules based on the principle of least privilege. Only grant necessary permissions. - **Thorough Testing:**  Rigorous testing of security rules with various user roles and permissions to ensure they function as intended. - **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of security rule implementations and annotations. - **Centralized Configuration:** Utilize Micronaut's centralized security configuration to manage and review security rules effectively. |
| **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Interception (Misconfigured Redirect URI)** | An attacker could register a malicious application with a legitimate OAuth 2.0 provider. If the application being developed has an improperly configured redirect URI, the attacker could intercept the authorization code intended for the legitimate application and use it to obtain an access token, gaining unauthorized access to user data. | Unauthorized access to user data and resources protected by the OAuth 2.0 provider. | `micronaut-security-oauth2` (OAuth 2.0 Client Module) | **High** | - **Strict Redirect URI Whitelisting:**  Carefully configure and strictly whitelist the allowed redirect URIs for the OAuth 2.0 client. Avoid wildcard or overly broad entries. - **HTTPS for Redirect URIs:** Ensure all redirect URIs use HTTPS to prevent interception of the authorization code in transit. |
| **Bypass via Missing Security Annotations on Endpoints** | Developers might forget to apply security annotations (`@Secured`, `@RolesAllowed`) to critical endpoints or methods, leaving them unprotected and accessible to unauthorized users. | Unintended access to application functionality and data. | `micronaut-security` (Core Security Module), `@Secured` annotation, `@RolesAllowed` annotation | **High** | - **Code Reviews:** Implement thorough code reviews to ensure all relevant endpoints are secured with appropriate annotations. - **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools to identify potentially unprotected endpoints. - **Default Deny Approach:** Configure a default deny policy and explicitly allow access where needed. |
| **Insecure Integration with External Authentication Providers (e.g., OpenID Connect)** | Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the integration with external authentication providers (e.g., incorrect client secrets, missing nonce validation) can lead to security breaches. An attacker might be able to impersonate users or gain unauthorized access. | Account takeover, unauthorized access to resources. | `micronaut-security-oauth2` (OAuth 2.0 Client Module), `micronaut-openid` (OpenID Connect Module) | **High** | - **Follow Provider Documentation:** Carefully follow the documentation provided by the external authentication provider for secure integration. - **Secure Client Secrets:** Store client secrets securely and avoid exposing them. - **Nonce Validation:** For OpenID Connect, ensure proper validation of the `nonce` parameter to prevent replay attacks. - **Token Validation:** Thoroughly validate tokens received from the external provider. |
