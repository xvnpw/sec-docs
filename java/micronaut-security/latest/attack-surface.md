# Attack Surface Analysis for `Micronaut Security`

## Attack Surface Identification
- **Digital Assets and Components:**
  - **APIs:** Micronaut Security offers APIs for authentication and authorization, including endpoints for login, token issuance, and user management.
  - **Web Applications:** Secures web applications built with the Micronaut framework, potentially exposing endpoints to the internet.
  - **Databases:** Interfaces with databases for storing user credentials, session data, and security tokens.
  - **Open Ports and Communication Protocols:** Primarily uses HTTP/HTTPS for communication, with potential exposure through open ports.
  - **External Integrations:** Supports OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and other identity providers for authentication.
  - **Cloud Services:** Deployable on cloud platforms, which may introduce cloud-specific security configurations and risks.
  - **Internet-facing Components:** APIs and web applications are often exposed to the internet, increasing the attack surface.
  - **Authentication Mechanisms:** Supports JWT, OAuth2, and session-based authentication, each with specific security considerations.
  - **Encryption Methods:** Utilizes TLS for secure communication, with potential vulnerabilities in configuration.

- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Insecure Configurations:**
  - Misconfigured authentication and authorization settings leading to unauthorized access.
  - Insecure storage of credentials or tokens, potentially exposing sensitive data.
  - Insufficient input validation in APIs, leading to injection attacks.
  - Lack of proper error handling and logging, which could aid attackers in reconnaissance.
  - Potential exposure of sensitive configuration details in public repositories or logs.
  - Inadequate session management, leading to session fixation or hijacking.

- **Reference Implementation Details:**
  - Authentication mechanisms and configurations are typically found in configuration files such as `application.yml` or `application.properties`.
  - API endpoints are defined in controller classes within the source code, often located in directories like `src/main/java`.

## Threat Enumeration
- **Spoofing:**
  - Attackers could impersonate users by exploiting weak authentication mechanisms or misconfigured OAuth2/OpenID Connect flows.

- **Tampering:**
  - Unauthorized modification of data in transit if TLS is not properly enforced or configured.
  - Alteration of configuration files or environment variables, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

- **Repudiation:**
  - Lack of comprehensive logging could allow users to deny actions performed, complicating incident response.

- **Information Disclosure:**
  - Exposure of sensitive data through misconfigured APIs or insufficient access controls.
  - Leaking of tokens or credentials in logs or error messages.

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**
  - Overloading authentication endpoints with requests, potentially leading to service disruption.
  - Exploiting resource-intensive operations in APIs to degrade performance.

- **Elevation of Privilege:**
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in role-based access control (RBAC) configurations to gain unauthorized access.

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality:**
  - High impact if sensitive user data or credentials are exposed, with a medium to high likelihood if APIs are not properly secured.

- **Integrity:**
  - High impact if data tampering occurs, especially in authentication flows, with a medium likelihood if TLS is not enforced.

- **Availability:**
  - High impact from DoS attacks on authentication services, with a medium likelihood if rate limiting is not implemented.

- **Severity Assessment:**
  - Critical vulnerabilities include those affecting authentication and data exposure.
  - Medium to high impact on business reputation and legal compliance if data breaches occur.

## Threat Ranking
- **Critical:**
  - Information disclosure through misconfigured APIs.
  - Spoofing attacks due to weak authentication.

- **High:**
  - Denial of Service on authentication endpoints.
  - Tampering with data in transit.

- **Medium:**
  - Repudiation due to lack of logging.
  - Elevation of privilege through RBAC misconfigurations.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate spoofing.
  - Regularly review and update OAuth2 and OpenID Connect configurations to ensure they are secure.

- **Data Protection:**
  - Enforce TLS for all communications to prevent tampering and information disclosure.
  - Securely store and manage credentials and tokens, using encryption and secure storage solutions.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Implement comprehensive logging to detect and prevent repudiation.
  - Monitor for unusual activity and potential DoS attacks, using automated alerting systems.

- **Configuration Management:**
  - Regularly audit and secure configuration files and environment variables.
  - Apply the principle of least privilege in RBAC settings to minimize the risk of privilege escalation.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- **Questions:**
  - Are there any specific integrations or customizations in the Micronaut Security project that could affect the threat model?
  - What are the current security controls in place for monitoring and incident response?

- **Assumptions:**
  - The project follows standard security practices for web applications and APIs.
  - The threat model is based on typical configurations and may need adjustments for specific deployments.
