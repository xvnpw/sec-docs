4. **Internal Network Boundary**: The boundary within the internal network where different components of the application communicate.

## DATA FLOWS

1. **User Authentication Flow**: User credentials are sent from the user to the application for authentication. This flow crosses the User to Application Boundary.
2. **Token Exchange Flow**: Authentication tokens are exchanged between the application and external services. This flow crosses the External Service Boundary.
3. **Data Storage Flow**: User data is sent from the application to the database for storage. This flow crosses the Application to Database Boundary.
4. **Log Generation Flow**: Logs are generated by the application and stored in a logging system. This flow may cross the Internal Network Boundary.
