# THREAT SCENARIOS

- Unauthorized access to sensitive data through misconfigured security settings.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by the project.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks during data transmission between client and server.
- Brute force attacks on authentication mechanisms leading to account compromise.
- Insufficient logging and monitoring allowing undetected malicious activities.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks due to improper input validation.
- SQL injection attacks exploiting poorly sanitized database queries.
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks overwhelming the application resources.
- Insecure storage of sensitive information leading to data breaches.
- Phishing attacks targeting users to steal credentials.
- Privilege escalation due to improper access control implementation.
- Code injection attacks through untrusted input handling.
- Session hijacking through insecure session management practices.
- Insufficient encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Supply chain attacks compromising the integrity of the software.

# THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS

- Focus on realistic, high-impact scenarios for prioritization.
- Evaluate likelihood and impact of each identified threat.
- Consider ease of exploitation for each threat scenario.
- Prioritize threats with high likelihood and impact.
- Assess current security controls against identified threats.
- Identify gaps in existing security measures.
- Consider both technical and human factors in threat analysis.
- Use threat modeling to guide security improvements.
- Balance security measures with usability and performance.
- Continuously update threat model as new threats emerge.

# RECOMMENDED CONTROLS

- Implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly update and patch third-party dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Use HTTPS to protect data in transit from man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring for early threat detection.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
- Implement rate limiting to mitigate brute force and DoS attacks.
- Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- Educate users on recognizing and avoiding phishing attacks.
- Apply the principle of least privilege to access control.

# NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

The threat scenarios identified for the Micronaut Security project focus on realistic and high-impact risks that could affect the security of the application. By prioritizing threats such as unauthorized access, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and man-in-the-middle attacks, we can address the most likely and damaging scenarios. The recommended controls aim to strengthen the security posture by implementing robust authentication, encryption, and input validation measures. It's important to balance security with usability, ensuring that protective measures do not hinder the user experience. Regular updates and user education are crucial in maintaining a secure environment. While some scenarios, like supply chain attacks, are less likely, they still warrant attention due to their potential impact.

# CONCLUSION

Prioritize realistic, high-impact threats and implement robust controls to enhance Micronaut Security's overall security posture.
