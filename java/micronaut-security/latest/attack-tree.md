# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Micronaut Security Project Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

The Micronaut Security project is a module of the Micronaut framework that provides security features for applications built using Micronaut. It offers functionalities such as authentication, authorization, and security configuration, enabling developers to secure their applications effectively. Typical use cases include securing REST APIs, web applications, and microservices.

### Key Components and Features

- **Authentication Providers**: Supports various authentication mechanisms like JWT, OAuth2, and LDAP.
- **Authorization**: Provides role-based access control and permission checks.
- **Security Filters**: Intercepts requests to enforce security policies.
- **Configuration**: Allows customization of security settings through configuration files.

### Dependencies

- Micronaut Core: The main framework that provides the foundation for Micronaut Security.
- Third-party libraries for specific authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2 client libraries).

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective**: Compromise applications using Micronaut Security by exploiting weaknesses in the Micronaut Security module.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. Inject malicious code into the Micronaut Security project.
2. Exploit existing vulnerabilities in the Micronaut Security module.
3. Compromise distribution channels to deliver a tampered version of Micronaut Security.
4. Leverage common misconfigurations or insecure implementations by users of Micronaut Security.

## 7. Analyze and Prioritize Attack Paths

### High-Risk Paths

- **Inject Malicious Code**: Particularly through social engineering attacks on maintainers, as this can lead to direct codebase compromise.
- **Exploit Existing Vulnerabilities**: Scanning for known vulnerabilities is a high-likelihood, medium-impact path that requires attention.

### Critical Nodes

- **Social Engineering Attacks**: Addressing this can mitigate risks across multiple attack paths.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scanning and patching can prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

## 8. Develop Mitigation Strategies

- **Enhance Security Practices**: Implement strong authentication (e.g., 2FA) for repository access and enforce strict code review processes.
- **Regular Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuously scan for and patch known vulnerabilities in dependencies and the codebase.
- **Secure Distribution Channels**: Use code signing and secure CI/CD practices to prevent tampering.
- **Configuration Best Practices**: Educate users on secure configuration and provide secure defaults.

## 9. Summarize Findings

### Key Risks Identified

- Potential for malicious code injection through social engineering.
- Exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Risks associated with misconfigurations and insecure implementations.

### Recommended Actions

- Strengthen access controls and review processes.
- Implement regular security audits and vulnerability management.
- Educate users on secure configuration and coding practices.

## 10. Questions & Assumptions
