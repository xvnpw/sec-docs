# Threat Modeling Analysis for the Micronaut Security Project Using Attack Trees

## 1. Understand the Project

### Overview

The Micronaut Security project is a module of the Micronaut framework that provides security features for applications built using Micronaut. It offers functionalities such as authentication, authorization, and security configuration, enabling developers to secure their applications effectively. Typical use cases include securing REST APIs, web applications, and microservices.

### Key Components and Features

- **Authentication Providers**: Supports various authentication mechanisms like JWT, OAuth2, and LDAP.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control and permission checks.
- **Security Filters**: Intercepts requests to enforce security policies.
- **Configuration**: Allows customization of security settings through configuration files.

### Dependencies

- Micronaut Core: The main framework providing the foundation for Micronaut Security.
- Third-party libraries for specific authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2 client libraries).

## 2. Define the Root Goal of the Attack Tree

**Attacker's Ultimate Objective**: Compromise applications using Micronaut Security by exploiting weaknesses in the Micronaut Security module.

## 3. Identify High-Level Attack Paths (Sub-Goals)

1. Inject malicious code into the Micronaut Security project.
