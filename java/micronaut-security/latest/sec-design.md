# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Micronaut Security project is part of the Micronaut framework, which aims to provide a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications. The primary business goal of the Micronaut Security project is to offer robust security features that can be easily integrated into applications built using the Micronaut framework. This includes authentication, authorization, and other security-related functionalities.

Business priorities include:
- Providing a comprehensive security solution that integrates seamlessly with the Micronaut framework.
- Ensuring ease of use and configuration for developers to implement security features.
- Maintaining high performance and low memory footprint, which are key characteristics of the Micronaut framework.

Important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities that could compromise applications using the Micronaut Security module.
- Complexity in configuration or integration that could deter developers from using the security features.
- Performance overhead introduced by security features that could affect the overall application performance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- Security control: Authentication mechanisms are implemented, supporting various protocols such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and JWT.
- Security control: Authorization features are provided, allowing for role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).
- Security control: Input validation is supported to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Security control: Cryptography is used for securing sensitive data, including password hashing and token encryption.

Accepted risks:
- Accepted risk: The project may rely on third-party libraries for certain security features, which could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
- Accepted risk: Developers may misconfigure security settings, leading to potential security gaps.

Recommended security controls:
- Security control: Implement security audits and code reviews to ensure the security of the codebase.
- Security control: Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- Security control: Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to help developers correctly configure security features.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Support for multiple authentication protocols and mechanisms, including OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and JWT.
- Authorization: Flexible authorization mechanisms, including RBAC and ABAC.
- Input validation: Ensure all user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.
- Cryptography: Use strong cryptographic algorithms for data protection, including password hashing and token encryption.

## BUILD

The build process for the Micronaut Security project involves the following steps:

1. Developers write and commit code to the GitHub repository.
2. A CI/CD pipeline is triggered, which includes automated build and testing processes.
3. Security checks, such as static application security testing (SAST) and linters, are performed during the build.
4. Build artifacts are generated and stored in a secure artifact repository.
5. Artifacts are deployed to the target environment using automated deployment scripts.
