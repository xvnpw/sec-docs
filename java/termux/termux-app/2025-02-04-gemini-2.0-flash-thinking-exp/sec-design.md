# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Termux project aims to provide a powerful and accessible terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android devices.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a free and open-source terminal emulator for Android.
  - Offer a complete Linux environment on Android without requiring rooting.
  - Empower users with command-line tools for development, system administration, and general computing tasks on mobile devices.
  - Maintain user privacy and security within the Termux environment.
  - Foster a community around the Termux project and encourage contributions.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the application or provided packages could compromise user devices and data.
  - Dependence on volunteer developers and maintainers can lead to slow updates or project stagnation.
  - Changes in Android OS or Google Play Store policies could break Termux functionality or distribution.
  - Competition from other terminal emulators or alternative mobile computing solutions.
  - Misuse of Termux for malicious activities due to its powerful capabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open-source codebase (publicly auditable on GitHub). Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Use of standard Linux packages and tools. Implemented: Termux environment.
  - security control: Android permission model restricting access to device resources. Implemented: Android OS.
  - security control: Regular updates of packages within the Termux environment. Implemented: `pkg` package manager.
  - security control: Distribution through reputable app stores (Google Play, F-Droid). Implemented: App store distribution channels.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on upstream package security. Risk accepted due to the nature of providing a Linux environment.
  - accepted risk: Potential for user misconfiguration leading to security issues within the Termux environment. Risk accepted as Termux provides a powerful and flexible environment.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies. Risk mitigated by regular updates and community scrutiny.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated security scanning of the Termux application code (SAST/DAST).
  - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning for packages included in the Termux environment.
  - security control: Implement reproducible builds to ensure build integrity and prevent supply chain attacks.
  - security control: User education and documentation on secure usage of Termux, including best practices for permissions and package management.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Termux itself does not require user authentication to access the terminal environment.
    - Requirement: Authentication to external services (SSH, web servers) should be handled by standard Linux tools within Termux.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Termux should respect Android's permission model to control access to device resources.
    - Requirement: Within the Termux environment, standard Linux file permissions should be enforced.
    - Requirement: Consider implementing optional fine-grained permission control for Termux features if feasible and beneficial.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement:  Input to Termux commands should be validated to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. This is primarily the responsibility of the underlying Linux tools and shell.
    - Requirement:  Ensure proper handling of user input in any Termux-specific components or scripts.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement:  Utilize standard cryptographic libraries provided by the Android OS and Linux environment for secure communication and data handling within Termux.
    - Requirement:  Ensure proper configuration and usage of cryptographic tools (e.g., SSH, GnuPG) within the Termux environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a functional and reliable terminal emulator and Linux environment on Android.
  - Maintaining the open-source nature and community around the project.
  - Ensuring user privacy and security within the Termux environment.
  - Distributing Termux through trusted channels (app stores).

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - User commands and input within the terminal: Medium sensitivity. Could contain personal or sensitive information depending on user activity.
  - Files and data stored within the Termux environment: High sensitivity. Can include user documents, code, configuration files, and potentially credentials.
  - Application code and build artifacts: Medium sensitivity. Protecting against tampering and unauthorized modification is important for maintaining trust and preventing supply chain attacks.
  - Developer credentials and signing keys: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes or malicious application releases.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific SAST/DAST tools and linters are currently used or planned for use in the Termux build process?
  - Are reproducible builds currently implemented or planned for Termux?
  - What is the process for managing and rotating signing keys for the Termux APK?
  - Are there specific security guidelines or training for Termux developers?
  - Is there a formal security incident response plan for Termux?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a free and open-source tool for users, with a focus on functionality and community rather than direct revenue generation.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a significant concern for the project, and efforts are made to maintain a secure application, but resources may be limited due to the volunteer-driven nature of the project.
  - DESIGN: The build process is automated using GitHub Actions, and distribution primarily occurs through app stores like Google Play Store and F-Droid. The project relies on standard Linux security practices within the Termux environment.
