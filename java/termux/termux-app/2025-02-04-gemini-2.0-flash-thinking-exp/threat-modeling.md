# Threat Model Analysis for termux/termux-app

## Threat: [Over-permissive storage access leading to data breach.](./threats/over-permissive_storage_access_leading_to_data_breach.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromising a script within Termux could exploit Termux's broad storage permissions to access and steal sensitive application or user data stored on the device. This is achieved by reading files accessible to Termux due to its storage permissions.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.
*   **Affected Termux-app Component:** Termux core application, file system access permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize storage permissions requested by Termux if possible.
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for scripts executed in Termux.
    *   Regularly update Termux packages to patch vulnerabilities.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest, even within Termux accessible storage.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege in application design and data storage.

## Threat: [Unintended access to Android APIs via `termux-api` leading to privacy violation.](./threats/unintended_access_to_android_apis_via__termux-api__leading_to_privacy_violation.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious script or compromised package within Termux could utilize `termux-api` to access device features like camera, microphone, or location without explicit user consent within the main application's context. This allows attackers to spy on users or collect personal information.
*   **Impact:** Privacy violation, unauthorized access to user data and device functionalities.
*   **Affected Termux-app Component:** `termux-api` package, Android permission system interaction.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using `termux-api` if possible.
    *   Strictly control and review scripts using `termux-api`.
    *   Implement robust input validation to prevent command injection in `termux-api` interactions.
    *   Monitor and log `termux-api` usage for suspicious activity.
    *   Educate users about Termux permissions and potential risks.

## Threat: [Execution of arbitrary malicious scripts leading to system compromise within Termux.](./threats/execution_of_arbitrary_malicious_scripts_leading_to_system_compromise_within_termux.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could inject and execute malicious scripts within Termux, exploiting vulnerabilities in application script handling, user misconfiguration, or compromised script sources. These scripts can cause data theft, denial of service, or further exploitation within the Termux environment.
*   **Impact:** System compromise within Termux, data theft, denial of service.
*   **Affected Termux-app Component:** Application's script execution logic, Termux shell environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for script inputs.
    *   Control script sources, using trusted sources and verifying integrity.
    *   Apply least privilege for scripts, limiting resource and functionality access.
    *   Conduct code review and security testing for script handling logic.
    *   Consider sandboxing techniques within Termux for script isolation.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Termux packages leading to compromise.](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_termux_packages_leading_to_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Packages from Termux repositories might contain vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities in packages used by the application can compromise the Termux environment and application functionality. This can be achieved by exploiting known flaws in services or libraries within these packages.
*   **Impact:** System compromise within Termux, denial of service, potential data breaches.
*   **Affected Termux-app Component:** Termux package manager (`pkg`), installed packages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update all Termux packages using `pkg upgrade`.
    *   Minimize installed packages to reduce the attack surface.
    *   Monitor security advisories for packages used in Termux.
    *   Use static analysis tools to scan packages for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Prefer minimal and well-maintained packages.
