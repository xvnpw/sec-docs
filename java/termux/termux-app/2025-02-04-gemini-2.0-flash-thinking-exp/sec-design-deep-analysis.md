    * **Existing Controls:** Android file permissions, user management of file access, potential storage encryption by Android.
    * **Recommendations:**  Clearly document and educate users about the permission implications of accessing external storage within Termux and best practices for managing sensitive data.

* **Network (Internet, Local Network):**
    * **Security Implication:** Network communication opens Termux to network-based attacks. Insecure configurations or vulnerabilities in network-facing tools within Termux (like SSH servers) can be exploited.
    * **Threats:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, remote code execution, unauthorized access to network services.
    * **Existing Controls:** Network security protocols (HTTPS, SSH), Android network permissions, user's network security configurations.
