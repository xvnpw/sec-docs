# Attack Surface Analysis for termux/termux-app

## Attack Surface: [Unintended File System Access and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/unintended_file_system_access_and_manipulation.md)

**Description:** The application running within Termux has access to the Termux home directory (`$HOME`) and potentially other parts of the Android file system.

**How Termux-app Contributes:** Termux-app provides the environment and the underlying mechanisms that grant this file system access. Without Termux-app, the application wouldn't have this level of direct file system interaction outside of its own isolated storage.

**Example:** A vulnerability in the application allows an attacker with shell access within Termux to modify the application's configuration files located in `$HOME/.config/myapp`.

**Impact:** Data breach, application malfunction due to corrupted configuration, or even replacement of the application's executable if stored within the Termux environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Store sensitive application data in secure, isolated storage not directly accessible via the Termux file system.
    * Implement strict file permission checks within the application.
    * Avoid storing executable code within the Termux home directory if possible.
    * Encrypt sensitive data stored within the Termux environment.
* **Users:**
    * Be cautious about granting storage permissions to Termux if not strictly necessary.
    * Regularly review files and directories within the Termux home directory for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via User Input to Termux Shell](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_user_input_to_termux_shell.md)

**Description:** If the application takes user input and directly executes it as shell commands within the Termux environment.

**How Termux-app Contributes:** Termux-app provides the shell environment and the execution context where these commands are interpreted and run.

**Example:** An application feature allows users to enter a filename to process, and this input is directly passed to a shell command like `grep $FILENAME log.txt`. An attacker could input `; rm -rf *` to delete files.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Termux environment, potentially leading to data loss, unauthorized access, or further attacks on the Android system (though limited by Android's security model).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * **Absolutely avoid** directly executing user-provided input as shell commands.
    * If shell interaction is necessary, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives like dedicated libraries for specific tasks.
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious commands.
* **Users:**
    * Be extremely cautious about applications that request shell access or execute commands based on user input within Termux.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Application Logic and Data through Shell Access](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_application_logic_and_data_through_shell_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gaining shell access within Termux can directly inspect the application's files, processes, and potentially memory.

**How Termux-app Contributes:** Termux-app provides the shell interface and tools (like `ps`, `cat`, `ls`) that enable this inspection.

**Example:** An attacker uses `cat` to read a configuration file containing API keys or database credentials stored within the application's Termux directory.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information, reverse engineering of application logic, and potential for further exploitation using the discovered secrets.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text within the Termux file system.
    * Use encryption for sensitive data at rest.
    * Consider code obfuscation techniques (though not a foolproof solution).
    * Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within the application itself.
* **Users:**
    * Secure their Termux environment with a strong password.
    * Be mindful of granting unnecessary permissions to applications running within Termux.
