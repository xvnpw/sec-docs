## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Native Code Vulnerabilities (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Memory Corruption)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_native_code_vulnerabilities__e_g___buffer_overflow__memory_corruption_.md)

- Description: Attackers target vulnerabilities in Termux-App's native code (C/C++) that can lead to memory corruption.
- How an attacker might compromise the application: By crafting specific inputs or interactions via the host application, an attacker can trigger a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue in Termux-App's native libraries. This allows them to overwrite memory, potentially injecting and executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the Termux-App process.
- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: High
- Effort: High
- Skill Level: High
- Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Host Application](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_host_application.md)

- Description: Occurs when the host application passes user-controlled input directly to Termux commands without proper sanitization.
- How an attacker might compromise the application:
  - Inject malicious commands via arguments passed to `TermuxService`: If the host application uses `TermuxService` to execute commands and includes unsanitized user input in the arguments, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.
  - Inject malicious commands via files or data passed to Termux: If the host application creates files or data that are then processed by Termux, and this data includes unsanitized user input, an attacker can inject malicious commands that Termux will execute.
- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: High
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Low
- Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify files used by the host application if accessible by Termux](./attack_tree_paths/modify_files_used_by_the_host_application_if_accessible_by_termux.md)

- Description: Attackers exploit scenarios where Termux-App has write access to files used by the host application.
- How an attacker might compromise the application: If Termux has write access to the host application's configuration files, data files, or libraries, an attacker can modify these files to alter the application's behavior, inject malicious code, or corrupt data. This could lead to various forms of compromise, including unauthorized access, data breaches, or denial of service.
- Likelihood: Low
- Impact: High
- Effort: Medium
- Skill Level: Medium
- Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Host Application via Termux-App](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_host_application_via_termux-app.md)

- Description: The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized control or access to the host application's data or functionality.
- Why it's critical: This is the root of the attack tree, and all successful attack paths lead to this node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Termux-App Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_termux-app_vulnerabilities.md)

- Description: This node represents attacks that directly target weaknesses or bugs within the Termux-App itself.
- Why it's critical: Successfully exploiting a vulnerability in Termux-App can provide a direct entry point for further attacks and potentially grant significant control over the Termux environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Termux-App Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_termux-app_functionality.md)

- Description: This node encompasses attacks that misuse the intended features and capabilities of Termux-App for malicious purposes.
- Why it's critical: It represents a broad range of attack vectors that can be difficult to prevent if the interaction between the host application and Termux-App is not carefully secured.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Host Application](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_host_application.md)

- Description: A specific type of abuse where the host application inadvertently allows the execution of attacker-controlled commands within the Termux environment.
- Why it's critical: Successful command injection provides a direct path to executing arbitrary code, making it a highly dangerous point of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [File System Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/file_system_manipulation.md)

- Description: This node represents attacks that involve manipulating files within the file system accessible to Termux-App, potentially impacting the host application.
- Why it's critical: The file system is a fundamental resource, and the ability to modify files used by the host application can lead to significant compromise.
