## Attack Tree Path: [1. Abuse Termux API (termux-api package) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__abuse_termux_api__termux-api_package___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the core attack surface, as `termux-api` provides the bridge between the target application and Termux's capabilities.  Exploiting this allows an attacker to leverage Termux's functionality for malicious purposes.
*   **Why Critical:**  It's the primary interface and enables many subsequent attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Inject Malicious API Commands](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_inject_malicious_api_commands.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Target App's API Handling [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_target_app's_api_handling__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** Craft malicious `termux-api` commands that the target app executes unsafely.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the target app's vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** High (Can lead to arbitrary code execution in the target app)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires vulnerability research and exploit development)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Depends on the target app's logging and security mechanisms)
*   **Details:** The attacker identifies flaws in how the target application processes input received from `termux-api`.  This could involve command injection, SQL injection (if the app uses Termux to interact with a database), path traversal, or other vulnerabilities. The attacker crafts specially formatted `termux-api` commands that exploit these flaws, causing the target application to execute unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Social Engineering / Phishing [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_social_engineering__phishing__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** Trick user into running malicious `termux-api` commands (e.g., via a deceptive script).
*   **Likelihood:** High (Humans are often the weakest link)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the commands executed)
*   **Effort:** Low (Requires crafting a convincing social engineering attack)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires user awareness and security training)
*   **Details:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques (e.g., a fake update notification, a deceptive email, a malicious website) to persuade the user to manually run `termux-api` commands.  These commands could be disguised as legitimate actions or presented as part of a seemingly harmless script.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Unauthorized Access to Device Features via API](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_unauthorized_access_to_device_features_via_api.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 Access Camera/Microphone [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1_access_cameramicrophone__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** Use `termux-camera-photo` or `termux-microphone-record` to spy on the user.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires user to grant permissions, or a vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** High (Severe privacy violation)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple commands)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Android may show permission usage indicators)
*   **Details:** The attacker uses the `termux-api` commands to activate the device's camera or microphone without the user's explicit knowledge or consent.  This could be done through social engineering or by exploiting a vulnerability that allows bypassing permission checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 Access Location [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2_access_location__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** Use `termux-location` to track the user's location.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires user to grant permissions, or a vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** High (Privacy violation, potential physical danger)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple command)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Android may show permission usage indicators)
*   **Details:** Similar to camera/microphone access, the attacker uses `termux-location` to obtain the device's GPS coordinates, potentially tracking the user's movements.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3 Access Contacts/SMS/Call Logs [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3_access_contactssmscall_logs__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** Use `termux-contact-list`, `termux-sms-list`, `termux-telephony-calllog` to steal data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Requires user to grant permissions, or a vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** High (Privacy violation, potential for identity theft)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple commands)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Android may show permission usage indicators)
*   **Details:** The attacker uses `termux-api` commands to retrieve sensitive personal information stored on the device, such as contacts, SMS messages, and call history.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.4 Access Clipboard [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_4_access_clipboard__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Action:** Use `termux-clipboard-get` and `termux-clipboard-set` to steal or modify clipboard data.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Clipboard access is often less restricted)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Can expose sensitive data like passwords)
*   **Effort:** Low (Simple commands)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring clipboard activity)
*   **Details:** The attacker uses `termux-api` to read the contents of the device's clipboard (potentially capturing passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive data) or to write malicious content to the clipboard, which could then be pasted into other applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Termux Package Management (pkg)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_termux_package_management__pkg_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Modify Existing Packages](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_modify_existing_packages.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.1 Root Access [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_1_root_access__critical_node_.md)

*   **Action:** If device is rooted, directly modify package files.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on device being rooted)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires file integrity monitoring)
*   **Details:** With root access, the attacker gains unrestricted access to the file system, allowing them to modify the files of installed Termux packages. This could involve injecting malicious code into existing binaries or libraries, effectively backdooring the packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Termux Environment for Lateral Movement](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_termux_environment_for_lateral_movement.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Bypass Android Security Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_bypass_android_security_mechanisms.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.3.1 Root Access [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_1_root_access__critical_node_.md)

*   **Action:** If device is rooted, bypass Android's security model entirely.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on device being rooted)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Details:** Root access grants the attacker privileges that circumvent Android's built-in security features, such as sandboxing and permission controls. This allows Termux to interact with the system at a much deeper level, potentially compromising the entire device.
