# Project Design Document: Termux

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the package manager. The project aims to provide a powerful and flexible terminal environment on Android devices, enabling users to perform a wide range of tasks typically associated with desktop Linux systems.

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a stable and reliable terminal environment.
*   Maintain compatibility with a wide range of Android devices.
*   Ensure the security of the user's device and data.
*   Offer a user-friendly experience, even for users unfamiliar with Linux.
*   Enable extensibility through a robust package management system.
*   Foster a strong community around the project.

Business Goals:

*   Empower users to utilize their Android devices for advanced tasks.
*   Become the leading terminal emulator solution for Android.
*   Maintain a high level of user trust and satisfaction.
*   Continuously improve the app based on user feedback and technological advancements.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Malicious packages or exploits could compromise user devices.
*   Compatibility issues with new Android versions or device-specific hardware could arise.
*   Lack of proper sandboxing or permissions management could lead to data breaches.
*   Usability issues could deter users from adopting the app.
*   Failure to keep up with security best practices could expose users to vulnerabilities.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Package management using APT, with signed repositories. (Implemented in Termux's package management system)
*   security control: Android's built-in sandboxing mechanisms. (Implemented by the Android operating system)
*   security control: Permissions model requiring user consent for sensitive actions. (Implemented by the Android operating system and Termux app)
*   security control: Regular updates to address security vulnerabilities. (Implemented through Termux's update process)
*   security control: Community vetting of packages (to some extent). (Implemented through community involvement in package maintenance)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The inherent risk of running a terminal environment with access to system resources.
*   accepted risk: Potential for user error leading to security compromises.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on the security of upstream package repositories.
*   accepted risk: Limited control over the security of third-party packages.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a more robust sandboxing mechanism specifically for Termux, potentially using technologies like seccomp or SELinux.
*   security control: Introduce mandatory code signing for all packages, including those from third-party repositories.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits of the codebase and package infrastructure.
*   security control: Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Provide clear and concise security guidelines for users.
*   security control: Integrate with Android's SafetyNet Attestation API to verify device integrity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The app should leverage Android's existing authentication mechanisms (e.g., PIN, password, biometrics) for device access.
    *   Consider optional support for SSH key-based authentication for remote access.
*   Authorization:
    *   The app should adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions to processes.
    *   Implement granular control over access to system resources and sensitive data.
    *   Clearly define and enforce permissions for different types of packages.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input should be treated as untrusted and carefully validated.
    *   Implement robust input sanitization to prevent command injection and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques to handle special characters.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for secure communication (e.g., SSH, HTTPS).
    *   Securely store sensitive data, such as passwords and keys, using Android's Keystore system.
    *   Regularly update cryptographic libraries to address known vulnerabilities.

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write and commit code to the Termux GitHub repository.
2.  A push to the repository triggers a build process on a build server (e.g., using GitHub Actions).
3.  The build server fetches the latest code from the repository.
4.  Build steps are executed, including:
    *   Compiling the code.
    *   Running linters and static analysis tools (SAST).
    *   Potentially running unit tests.
5.  The build server requests to sign build artifacts.
6.  Signing server signs APK.
7.  The build server generates build artifacts (APK file).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of a dedicated build server (GitHub Actions) for automated builds.
*   security control: Code review process before merging changes into the main branch.
