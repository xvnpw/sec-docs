## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Limit Shared Storage and Enforce Scoped Storage](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_limit_shared_storage_and_enforce_scoped_storage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **Strictly Limit Shared Storage and Enforce Scoped Storage**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Data Sensitivity:** Categorize all data as "highly sensitive," "sensitive," or "non-sensitive."
        2.  **Private Internal Storage:** Store *all* "highly sensitive" and "sensitive" data in the application's private internal storage (`Context.getFilesDir()`, `Context.getCacheDir()`). This is inaccessible to Termux.
        3.  **Scoped Storage for Non-Sensitive Data (If Necessary):** If "non-sensitive" data *must* be in shared storage, use the Storage Access Framework (SAF).
            *   **User-Initiated Actions:** Only access shared storage via explicit user actions (e.g., "Save As").
            *   **`ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT` and `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`:** Use Intents with these actions for user-mediated file selection.
            *   **Persistent Permissions (If Needed):** Use `takePersistableUriPermission()` for long-term access, and `releasePersistableUriPermission()` when done.
            *   **Avoid Direct File Paths:** Use URIs from the SAF, not hardcoded paths.
        4.  **Avoid Legacy Storage Permissions:** Do not request `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` unless absolutely necessary and clearly justified to the user.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Application Data via Termux:** (Severity: High) - Prevents Termux from directly accessing data in shared storage without explicit user permission via SAF.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (via Termux):** (Severity: High) - Makes it significantly harder for a malicious Termux script to steal data.
        *   **Data Modification (via Termux):** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized modification of application data by Termux.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with correct implementation).
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Data Modification:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Authentication tokens: `SharedPreferences` with `MODE_PRIVATE` (private storage).
        *   User profile data: Encrypted SQLite database in the private data directory.
        *   User-selected image uploads: SAF is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Cached web content: Currently in `getExternalFilesDir()`.  *Must* be moved to `getCacheDir()` (private cache). This is a direct Termux-related vulnerability on older Android versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_inter-process_communication__ipc_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify IPC Mechanisms:** List all IPC used (Intents, Content Providers, Bound Services, Broadcast Receivers).
        2.  **Explicit Intents:** For *internal* communication, *always* use explicit Intents (specify the target component's class name).
        3.  **Permission-Protected Content Providers/Services:** If exposing these:
            *   **Custom Permissions:** Define custom permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` with `protectionLevel="signature"`.
            *   **Enforce Permissions:** In the `ContentProvider` or `Service`, check permissions with `checkCallingPermission()` or `checkCallingOrSelfPermission()`. This specifically blocks Termux, which has a different signature.
        4.  **Intent Filter Review:** For implicit Intents:
            *   **Minimize Intent Filters:** Make filters as specific as possible.
            *   **`exported` Attribute:** Set `android:exported="false"` if external access is not needed. If `true`, ensure strong permission checks.
        5.  **Input Validation:** Validate *all* data received via IPC as untrusted, even with permission checks. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks even if Termux somehow bypasses initial checks.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **IPC Exploitation (by Termux):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents Termux from sending malicious Intents or interacting with exposed components.
        *   **Data Leaks via IPC (to Termux):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of data leaks through insecure IPC.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Indirectly, via Termux):** (Severity: Low) - Reduces the attack surface.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **IPC Exploitation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Data Leaks via IPC:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk remains Low, but the attack surface is smaller.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Internal activity communication: Explicit Intents.
        *   No exposed Content Providers.
        *   Bound Service (music playback): Protected with a custom permission (`com.example.app.permission.BIND_MUSIC_SERVICE`, `protectionLevel="signature"`).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Broadcast Receiver (network connectivity): Uses an implicit Intent filter (`android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE`).  Review the filter for overbreadth. Consider a dynamically registered receiver. This is a potential, though indirect, Termux-related vulnerability if a malicious Termux script could send crafted connectivity change broadcasts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Dependency on Termux:API and Implement Strict Permission Checks](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_dependency_on_termuxapi_and_implement_strict_permission_checks.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** **Minimize Dependency on Termux:API and Implement Strict Permission Checks**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Avoid Termux:API if Possible:** If core functionality doesn't *require* Termux:API, remove dependencies.
        2.  **Identify Required APIs:** If unavoidable, list *only* the necessary APIs.
        3.  **Explicit Permission Requests:** Before *any* Termux:API call, check if the user granted the corresponding Android permission to *your* application using `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission()`.  Do *not* assume permissions granted to Termux apply to your app.
        4.  **User Education:** Clearly explain in the UI and documentation:
            *   That the app interacts with Termux:API.
            *   Which device features are accessed.
            *   The potential risks.
            *   How to manage Termux:API permissions.
        5.  **Handle Permission Denials Gracefully:** Implement error handling for denied permissions, with informative messages.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Abuse of Termux:API (by malicious Termux scripts):** (Severity: High) - Prevents Termux from using your app to access device features without explicit user consent *through your app*.
        *   **Data Leakage via Termux:API:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of data leaks.
        *   **Unauthorized Device Control (via Termux:API):** (Severity: High) - Prevents Termux from controlling device features through your app.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Abuse of Termux:API:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with correct implementation).
        *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Unauthorized Device Control:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   The application does *not* use or depend on Termux:API.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   N/A - Fully implemented by not using Termux:API.
