# Attack Surface Analysis for termux/termux-app

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Command Execution via User Input](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_command_execution_via_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows user-supplied input to be directly or indirectly interpreted as commands within the Termux environment.
    *   **How Termux-App Contributes:** Termux provides the command-line interface and execution environment, making this attack possible. This is *the* core functionality of Termux.
    *   **Example:** An application feature allows users to enter a "custom script path" which is then passed to a Termux command like `bash /sdcard/Download/[user_input]`. An attacker could input a malicious command.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Termux environment, potential sandbox escape, data exfiltration, device damage, use of the device in malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Whitelisting:** *Never* directly execute user input. Use a strict whitelist of allowed commands and arguments. Pre-define all necessary operations.
            *   **Input Sanitization (secondary):** Sanitize input to remove dangerous characters.
            *   **Avoid User Input:** Redesign the application to *eliminate* the need for user-provided commands.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be extremely cautious about any application that requests command-line input when using Termux.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Package Installation (Unofficial Repositories)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_package_installation__unofficial_repositories_.md)

*   **Description:** Users add third-party, untrusted package repositories to Termux and install packages from them.
    *   **How Termux-App Contributes:** Termux's package management system *allows* the addition of arbitrary repositories. This is a core feature of Termux's package management.
    *   **Example:** A user adds a repository and installs a package containing a backdoor.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Termux environment, data theft, malware, potential sandbox escape.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Application-Managed Packages:** Pre-install required packages from the official repository. *Prevent* users from adding other repositories.
            *   **User Education:** Warn users about the dangers of unofficial repositories.
        *   **User:**
            *   *Only* use the official Termux repositories.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Outdated Packages](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_outdated_packages.md)

*   **Description:** Known vulnerabilities in outdated packages within the Termux environment are exploited.
    *   **How Termux-App Contributes:** Termux relies on a package management system, and users may not keep packages updated. This is inherent to any system with package management.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an outdated version of a package like `openssh`.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Termux environment, data theft, malware, potential sandbox escape.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Managed Updates (critical packages):** Enforce minimum versions and automate updates for *critical* packages (with consent).
            *   **Reminders:** Remind users to update Termux packages.
        *   **User:**
            *   Regularly run `pkg update && pkg upgrade` in Termux.

## Attack Surface: [Termux:API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/termuxapi_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts within Termux leverage the `termux-api` package to access sensitive Android APIs.
    *   **How Termux-App Contributes:** Termux provides the `termux-api` package, bridging Termux and Android. This is a *specific* feature of Termux.
    *   **Example:** A script uses `termux-api` to access location, contacts, and camera.
    *   **Impact:** Privacy violation, data theft, surveillance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Minimal Permissions:** Request *only* necessary Android permissions.
            *   **API Usage Audit:** Review `termux-api` usage for security.
            *   **Uninstall if Unnecessary:** Ensure `termux-api` is *not* installed if not needed.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be cautious about granting permissions to apps using Termux.
            *   Uninstall `termux-api`: `pkg uninstall termux-api` if not needed.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Script Execution (Application-Relied Scripts)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_script_execution__application-relied_scripts_.md)

*   **Description:** Application relies on scripts in Termux, and these are modified by an attacker.
    *   **How Termux-App Contributes:** Termux provides the environment where these scripts are stored and executed. This is a direct consequence of using Termux for scripting.
    *   **Example:** An attacker replaces an application's script with a malicious version.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised application functionality, data theft, further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Integrity Checks:** Use checksums or signatures for scripts. Verify *before* execution.
            *   **Secure Storage:** Protect scripts from modification.
            *   **Regular Audits:** Audit scripts for vulnerabilities.
        *   **User:**
            *   Be cautious about modifying application scripts in Termux.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc_.md)

* **Description:** The main Android application communicates with the Termux environment using an insecure IPC mechanism.
    * **How Termux-App Contributes:** The very act of integrating with Termux necessitates IPC, making this a Termux-integration-specific risk.
    * **Example:** The application sends commands to Termux via unencrypted intents, which an attacker intercepts.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the Termux environment, data exfiltration.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer:**
            *   **Secure IPC:** Use authenticated, encrypted IPC (e.g., bound services).
            *   **Input Validation (both sides):** Validate data sent to *and* from Termux.
        * **User:** (Limited mitigation; primarily a developer responsibility.)
