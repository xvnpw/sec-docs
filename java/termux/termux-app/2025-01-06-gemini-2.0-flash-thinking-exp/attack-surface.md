# Attack Surface Analysis for termux/termux-app

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Application Filesystem via Termux](./attack_surfaces/exposed_application_filesystem_via_termux.md)

* **Description:**  Sensitive files or directories within the application's data directory become accessible through the Termux filesystem due to shared storage or symbolic links created by the application or user.
* **How Termux-app Contributes:** Termux provides a user-accessible filesystem environment within Android, allowing navigation and manipulation of files that might be accessible due to Android's file system permissions or intentional sharing.
* **Example:** An application stores API keys in a configuration file within its data directory. If a symbolic link is created from the Termux home directory to this file, a malicious script running in Termux can read the API keys.
* **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential compromise of external services using the leaked credentials.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:** Avoid storing sensitive data in easily accessible locations within the application's data directory. Employ Android's internal storage mechanisms with appropriate access restrictions. Do not create unnecessary symbolic links or shared directories pointing to sensitive application data.
    * **Users:** Be cautious about creating symbolic links or sharing application data directories with Termux. Understand the implications of granting storage permissions to Termux.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Manipulation via Termux Environment](./attack_surfaces/inter-process_communication__ipc__manipulation_via_termux_environment.md)

* **Description:**  Malicious actors within the Termux environment can manipulate communication channels used by the application to interact with Termux, such as command execution or shared files.
* **How Termux-app Contributes:** Termux allows execution of arbitrary commands and scripts. If an application relies on executing commands within Termux or reading data from files modified by Termux, this creates an opportunity for manipulation.
* **Example:** An application uses Termux to execute a command-line tool for image processing. A malicious script in Termux could replace the legitimate tool with a modified version that exfiltrates the processed images before returning control.
* **Impact:**  Data corruption, unauthorized data access, execution of arbitrary code within the application's context (if not properly isolated), denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**  Minimize reliance on executing external commands through Termux. If necessary, carefully sanitize inputs and validate outputs. Use secure IPC mechanisms provided by Android instead of relying on shell commands or shared files. Implement robust error handling and integrity checks.
    * **Users:** Be cautious about running untrusted scripts within Termux, especially if the application interacts with Termux.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Android Permissions Granted to Termux](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_android_permissions_granted_to_termux.md)

* **Description:** Termux, with user-granted permissions (e.g., storage, camera, location), can perform actions that the application might not intend or be aware of.
* **How Termux-app Contributes:** Termux requests and utilizes Android permissions. If an application relies on Termux for permission-dependent tasks, a malicious actor within Termux can leverage these permissions independently.
* **Example:** An application uses Termux to access files on external storage. A malicious script in Termux, with storage permission, could access and exfiltrate other unrelated files from the storage.
* **Impact:** Privacy violations, data exfiltration, unauthorized access to device resources, potential for further exploitation using accessed resources.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:** Avoid relying on Termux for actions requiring sensitive permissions. Implement permission requests directly within the application. Clearly understand the scope of permissions granted to Termux and its potential impact.
    * **Users:** Carefully review the permissions requested by Termux and only grant necessary permissions. Be aware that Termux can act on the device within the scope of these permissions.

## Attack Surface: [SSH Server Functionality (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/ssh_server_functionality__if_enabled_.md)

* **Description:** If Termux's SSH server is enabled, standard SSH vulnerabilities can be exploited to gain remote access, potentially impacting the application indirectly.
* **How Termux-app Contributes:** Termux provides the functionality to run an SSH server. If enabled, it exposes the device to network-based attacks.
* **Example:**  A brute-force attack on the SSH server credentials could grant an attacker access to the Termux environment, allowing them to manipulate files or processes used by the application.
* **Impact:**  Remote code execution, data breach, unauthorized access to the device and potentially the application's data.
* **Risk Severity:** High (if enabled and not properly configured)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**  Avoid relying on the Termux SSH server for application functionality if possible. If necessary, ensure strong SSH configurations (strong passwords, key-based authentication, disabling password authentication, keeping SSH software updated).
    * **Users:** Only enable the SSH server if necessary. Use strong passwords or, preferably, key-based authentication. Keep the SSH server software updated. Restrict access to the SSH server using firewalls or network configurations.
