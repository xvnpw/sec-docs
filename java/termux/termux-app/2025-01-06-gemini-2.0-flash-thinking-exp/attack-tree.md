## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Functionality or Data via Termux-App](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_functionality_or_data_via_termux-app.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code within Termux Environment](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_within_termux_environment.md)

*   **Description:** Successfully executing arbitrary code within the Termux environment grants the attacker significant control and the ability to perform various malicious actions. This is a critical node as it enables further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Command Injection**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities where the application constructs and executes Termux commands based on unsanitized input.
            *   **Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization (Critical Node):** The core weakness allowing command injection.
                *   Application passes unsanitized user input to Termux commands: User-provided data is directly used in commands.
                *   Application constructs Termux commands from external data without validation: Data from external sources (files, network) is used without proper checks.
    *   **Malicious Script Execution**
        *   **Description:** Tricking the application into executing malicious scripts within the Termux environment.
            *   **Exploit Application's Trust in Termux Scripts (Critical Node):** The application assumes the integrity of scripts within Termux.
                *   Application executes scripts placed in Termux by the attacker: The attacker gains write access to place malicious scripts.
                *   Application executes scripts downloaded by Termux under attacker's control: The attacker manipulates download processes or sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application Data through Termux](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_data_through_termux.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to modify or delete application data stored within the Termux environment.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Manipulation**
        *   **Modify Application Configuration Files**
            *   **Description:** Altering configuration files to change application behavior or security settings.
                *   Application stores configuration within Termux's accessible file system: The application's design makes configuration files vulnerable.
        *   **Inject Malicious Data Files**
            *   **Description:** Introducing harmful data files that the application will process, potentially leading to code execution or data corruption.
                *   Application processes data files located within Termux: The application reads and uses data files from Termux.
        *   **Delete Critical Application Data**
            *   **Description:** Removing essential data, causing application malfunction or data loss.
                *   Application stores sensitive data within Termux's accessible file system: The application's design places sensitive data at risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing via Termux Interface](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_via_termux_interface.md)

*   **Description:** Using the Termux terminal to display deceptive prompts or messages to trick users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Trick User into Performing Malicious Actions within Termux**
        *   **Phishing via Termux Interface:**
            *   Display fake prompts or messages within the Termux terminal to trick users into revealing credentials or executing malicious commands: Exploiting user trust in the Termux interface.
