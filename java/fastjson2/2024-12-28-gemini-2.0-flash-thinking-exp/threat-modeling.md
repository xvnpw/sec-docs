### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving fastjson2

Here's a list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve the `fastjson2` library:

*   **Threat:** Deserialization Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload containing instructions to instantiate arbitrary Java classes and execute their code upon deserialization by `fastjson2`. The attacker leverages weaknesses in `fastjson2`'s `AutoType` handling or other deserialization mechanisms. This involves sending the malicious JSON through an API endpoint, user input field, or any other channel where JSON data is processed by the application using `fastjson2`.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server. The attacker can gain full control, steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.
    *   **Affected fastjson2 Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSONReader` (specifically the deserialization methods and handling of `AutoType` and type resolution). `com.alibaba.fastjson2.filter.Filter` (if bypassable). `com.alibaba.fastjson2.support.config.FastJsonConfig` (related to configuration of deserialization features).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable `AutoType` globally:**  Set `ParserConfig.getGlobalInstance().setAutoTypeSupport(false);` or use `JSONReader.Feature.SupportAutoType` selectively and with extreme caution.
        *   **Implement strict allowlists:** Define a whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization using `ParserConfig.getGlobalInstance().setAccept(String... acceptClasses);` or similar mechanisms. Avoid using blocklists as they are often incomplete.
        *   **Use `TypeReference` or explicit class mapping:** When deserializing, explicitly specify the expected class using `JSON.parseObject(jsonString, new TypeReference<MyClass>(){});` or similar methods.
        *   **Regularly update `fastjson2`:** Keep the library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with excessively nested objects or arrays. When `fastjson2` attempts to parse this deeply nested structure, it can lead to stack overflow errors or excessive memory consumption, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. The attacker targets API endpoints that accept JSON data.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, and potential resource exhaustion on the server.
    *   **Affected fastjson2 Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSONReader` (specifically the parsing logic for handling nested structures).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Set limits on maximum nesting depth:** Configure `JSONReader.Feature.MaxLevel` to limit the depth of JSON structures that `fastjson2` will parse.
        *   **Implement timeouts for parsing operations:** Set timeouts to prevent parsing operations from running indefinitely.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Large Strings
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing extremely long strings. When `fastjson2` parses this payload, it can consume excessive memory to store these strings, potentially leading to an OutOfMemoryError and crashing the application. This attack can be launched through any endpoint accepting JSON input.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption, and potential resource exhaustion on the server.
    *   **Affected fastjson2 Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSONReader` (specifically the handling of string values).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Set limits on maximum string length:** Configure `JSONReader.Feature.MaxStringSize` to limit the maximum length of strings that `fastjson2` will parse.
