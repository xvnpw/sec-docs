### High and Critical Spring Boot Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Spring Boot framework.

#### Threat 1: Unauthenticated Actuator Endpoint Access

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to access sensitive Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (e.g., `/env`, `/metrics`, `/health`) without providing valid authentication credentials. They could enumerate common Actuator paths or leverage publicly available information to discover these endpoints. Upon successful access, they can gather information about the application's environment, configuration, and health.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive configuration details, internal network information, and application dependencies. This information can be used to plan further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot Actuator (module: `spring-boot-actuator`, specifically the endpoint security mechanism).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement Spring Security and configure authentication and authorization rules for all Actuator endpoints.
    *   Use Spring Boot Actuator's built-in security features to restrict access based on roles or IP addresses.
    *   Consider disabling or exposing Actuator endpoints on a separate, internal network.
    *   Regularly review and update Actuator dependencies.

#### Threat 2: Configuration Tampering via Actuator

*   **Description:** An authenticated (or unauthenticated if Threat 1 is exploited) attacker could use Actuator endpoints like `/env` or `/configprops` to modify the application's runtime configuration. They might change database connection strings, API keys, logging levels, or other critical settings.
*   **Impact:** Application malfunction, security bypasses, data breaches, or denial of service depending on the modified configuration.
*   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot Actuator (module: `spring-boot-actuator`, specifically endpoints that allow configuration modification).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Actuator endpoints that allow configuration changes.
    *   Restrict access to configuration modification endpoints to only necessary administrative roles.
    *   Audit changes made through Actuator endpoints.
    *   Consider making critical configuration properties immutable or read-only at runtime.

#### Threat 3: DevTools Enabled in Production

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit the features of Spring Boot DevTools if it is mistakenly left enabled in a production environment. This could involve accessing the remote update feature (if enabled) to inject malicious code or exploiting other development-focused functionalities that bypass security measures.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure (e.g., stack traces), and potential for application takeover.
*   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot DevTools (module: `spring-boot-devtools`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure DevTools is disabled in production environments. Use Spring profiles to manage environment-specific configurations.
    *   Verify the `spring.devtools.restart.enabled` and `spring.devtools.remote.secret` properties are correctly configured for production.
    *   Implement infrastructure-level controls to prevent DevTools from being included in production deployments.
