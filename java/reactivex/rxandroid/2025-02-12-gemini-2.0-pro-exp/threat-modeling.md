# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxandroid

## Threat: [Threat 1: Main Thread Blocking via `observeOn` Misuse](./threats/threat_1_main_thread_blocking_via__observeon__misuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious input or exploits a vulnerability in a data source that, when processed by an RxAndroid stream, causes a long-running operation to be executed on the main thread due to incorrect use of `observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())`. The attacker might intentionally trigger a complex calculation, a large data transformation, or a network request that is unexpectedly slow.
    *   **Impact:** Application freezes (ANR - Application Not Responding), leading to forced closure by the Android OS. Denial of service (DoS) for the user, preventing them from using the application. Poor user experience.
    *   **Affected RxAndroid Component:** `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`, `observeOn()` operator.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Avoid performing long-running or blocking operations within the `observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())` block.  Use `subscribeOn()` to offload heavy computations to a background thread (e.g., `Schedulers.io()`, `Schedulers.computation()`).
        *   **Developer:** Use Android's StrictMode during development to detect accidental main thread blocking.
        *   **Developer:** Implement timeouts (`timeout()` operator) on potentially long-running operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   **Developer:** Thoroughly review code that uses `observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())` to ensure it only handles lightweight UI updates.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Memory Leak due to Unmanaged Subscriptions](./threats/threat_2_memory_leak_due_to_unmanaged_subscriptions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might trigger actions that cause the application to create numerous RxAndroid subscriptions (e.g., rapidly navigating between screens, repeatedly triggering events) without properly disposing of them. This is particularly exploitable if the subscriptions are tied to long-lived objects (like Activities or Fragments) and `Disposable.dispose()` is not called.
    *   **Impact:** Gradual increase in memory usage, eventually leading to `OutOfMemoryError` and application crash. Degraded performance over time.
    *   **Affected RxAndroid Component:** `subscribe()` method (which returns a `Disposable`), `Observable`, `Flowable`, `Single`, `Completable`, `Maybe`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Always call `dispose()` on the `Disposable` returned by `subscribe()` when the subscription is no longer needed (e.g., in `onDestroy()` of an Activity/Fragment).
        *   **Developer:** Use `CompositeDisposable` to manage multiple subscriptions and dispose of them all at once.
        *   **Developer:** Utilize lifecycle-aware components (e.g., Android Architecture Components' ViewModel) to automatically manage and dispose of subscriptions.
        *   **Developer:** Employ operators like `takeUntil()` or `takeWhile()` to automatically unsubscribe based on lifecycle events or conditions.
        *   **Developer:** Use memory profiling tools (e.g., LeakCanary) to detect and fix memory leaks during development.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Race Condition in Shared Mutable State](./threats/threat_3_race_condition_in_shared_mutable_state.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability where multiple RxAndroid streams (potentially running on different threads) modify a shared mutable object (e.g., a list, a map, a custom object) without proper synchronization. The attacker might trigger events that cause concurrent modifications, leading to unpredictable data states.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unexpected behavior, crashes. The application might display incorrect data, perform incorrect calculations, or behave erratically.
    *   **Affected RxAndroid Component:** Any RxJava/RxAndroid operator that modifies shared data, particularly when used with different `Schedulers`.  This is a general RxJava concern, but RxAndroid's threading model makes it more prominent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use thread-safe data structures (e.g., `AtomicInteger`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`) for shared mutable state.
        *   **Developer:** Implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized` blocks, locks) when accessing and modifying shared data, being mindful of potential deadlocks.
        *   **Developer:** Favor immutable data structures and transformations whenever possible.  Avoid shared mutable state.
        *   **Developer:** Use the `serialize()` operator to ensure that emissions from an Observable are processed sequentially, preventing concurrent modifications.
        *   **Developer:** Consider using a state management library (e.g., a Redux-like implementation) to centralize and manage application state in a predictable and thread-safe manner.

## Threat: [Threat 6: Vulnerability in RxAndroid/RxJava Dependency](./threats/threat_6_vulnerability_in_rxandroidrxjava_dependency.md)

* **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered and publicly disclosed in a specific version of RxAndroid or RxJava. An attacker exploits this vulnerability by crafting a specific input or triggering a particular sequence of operations that leverages the flaw.
    * **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from minor information leaks to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Affected RxAndroid Component:** Potentially any part of RxAndroid or RxJava, depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability; could be Critical or High)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developer/User:** Keep RxAndroid and RxJava dependencies up to date. Regularly check for updates and security advisories from the maintainers.
        * **Developer:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.
        * **Developer:** Follow secure coding practices in general to minimize the attack surface and reduce the impact of any potential vulnerabilities.
