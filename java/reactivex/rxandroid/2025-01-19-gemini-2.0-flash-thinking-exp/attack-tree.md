## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asynchronous Operations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asynchronous_operations.md)

**Critical Node: Exploit Asynchronous Operations**

* **Description:** Leverage the asynchronous nature of RxAndroid to introduce vulnerabilities.
* **Sub-Goals (AND - within the full tree, but relevant context for the critical node):**
    * Race Conditions in Subscribers
        * Trigger Concurrent Events Leading to Inconsistent State
            * Likelihood: Moderate
            * Impact: Moderate to High (Data corruption, inconsistent UI, crashes)
            * Effort: Low to Moderate (Accidental or intentional triggering)
            * Skill Level: Low to Moderate (Understanding of concurrency)
            * Detection Difficulty: High (Intermittent, difficult to reproduce)
    * Unintended Side Effects due to Asynchronicity
        * Manipulate Timing of Events to Cause Unexpected Behavior
            * Likelihood: Moderate
            * Impact: Low to Moderate (Incorrect behavior, UI glitches)
            * Effort: Low to Moderate (Manipulating network requests, etc.)
            * Skill Level: Low to Moderate (Understanding of asynchronous operations)
            * Detection Difficulty: Moderate to High (Requires careful logging and monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data Streams - High-Risk Path 1](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_streams_-_high-risk_path_1.md)

**Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path 1 & 2: Manipulate Data Streams**

* **Description:** Interfere with the data flowing through RxAndroid's Observables and Subscribers.
* **Sub-Goals (AND):**
    * **End of High-Risk Path 1: Data Injection/Manipulation**
        * Intercept and Modify Data Emitted by Observables
            * Likelihood: Moderate to High (If input validation is weak)
            * Impact: Moderate to High (Data corruption, application compromise)
            * Effort: Low to Moderate (Standard injection techniques)
            * Skill Level: Low to Moderate (Familiarity with injection vulnerabilities)
            * Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Input validation checks, anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data Streams - High-Risk Path 2](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_streams_-_high-risk_path_2.md)

**Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path 1 & 2: Manipulate Data Streams**

* **Description:** Interfere with the data flowing through RxAndroid's Observables and Subscribers.
* **Sub-Goals (AND):**
    * **End of High-Risk Path 2: Denial of Service via Stream Overload**
        * Flood Subscriber with Excessive Events
            * Likelihood: Moderate (If attacker controls event source)
            * Impact: Moderate (Application unresponsiveness, resource exhaustion)
            * Effort: Low to Moderate (Generating large number of events)
            * Skill Level: Low (Basic understanding of data streams)
            * Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Monitoring resource usage, event rates)

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Schedulers - High-Risk Path 3](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_schedulers_-_high-risk_path_3.md)

**Critical Node & Start of High-Risk Path 3: Abuse Schedulers**

* **Description:** Exploit the threading and scheduling mechanisms provided by RxAndroid.
* **Sub-Goals (AND - within the full tree, but relevant context for the critical node):**
    * Main Thread Blocking
        * Force Long-Running Operations onto the UI Thread
            * Likelihood: Moderate (Common developer mistake)
            * Impact: Moderate (Application freezes, poor user experience)
            * Effort: Low (Often accidental)
            * Skill Level: Low (Lack of understanding of threading)
            * Detection Difficulty: High (Difficult to detect programmatically, user reports)
    * **End of High-Risk Path 3: Resource Exhaustion via Scheduler Abuse**
        * Schedule Excessive Tasks Consuming Resources
            * Likelihood: Low to Moderate (Requires understanding of application's scheduling)
            * Impact: Moderate (Degraded performance, potential crashes)
            * Effort: Moderate (Requires understanding of scheduling mechanisms)
            * Skill Level: Moderate (Understanding of concurrency and scheduling)
            * Detection Difficulty: Moderate (Monitoring thread pool usage, resource consumption)
