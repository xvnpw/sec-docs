# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxandroid

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Race Conditions](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_race_conditions.md)

**Description:** Multiple asynchronous operations within RxJava/RxAndroid streams access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful outcomes.

**How RxAndroid Contributes:** RxAndroid facilitates asynchronous operations on different threads using Schedulers, increasing the likelihood of race conditions if not handled carefully.

**Example:** Multiple network requests updating the same UI element concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent data being displayed.

**Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for privilege escalation if sensitive data is involved.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize thread-safe data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`).
* Employ RxJava's operators for thread synchronization (e.g., `serialize()`, `synchronized`).
* Minimize shared mutable state.
* Thoroughly test concurrent operations.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Exceptions in Reactive Streams](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_exceptions_in_reactive_streams.md)

**Description:** Exceptions occurring within RxJava operators or emitted by Observables/Flowables are not properly caught and handled, leading to stream termination and potential application crashes or information leaks.

**How RxAndroid Contributes:** RxAndroid relies on RxJava's error handling mechanisms. If developers don't implement proper error handling within their reactive pipelines, exceptions can propagate unexpectedly.

**Example:** A network request within an `Observable` fails, and the error is not caught, causing the entire stream to terminate and potentially leaving the UI in an inconsistent state. Error details might be logged, revealing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, exposure of sensitive information through error logs or UI, broken functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use RxJava's error handling operators (`onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`, `doOnError`).
* Implement global error handlers for unhandled exceptions.
* Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive data.
* Provide user-friendly error messages instead of raw exception details.

## Attack Surface: [Subscription Leaks and Resource Holding](./attack_surfaces/subscription_leaks_and_resource_holding.md)

**Description:** RxJava subscriptions are not properly disposed of when they are no longer needed, leading to memory leaks and potential holding of other resources (e.g., network connections, file handles).

**How RxAndroid Contributes:** RxAndroid manages subscriptions within the Android lifecycle. If developers fail to unsubscribe in appropriate lifecycle methods (e.g., `onDestroy`), resources can leak.

**Example:** An `Observable` fetching data from a server is subscribed to in an Activity, but the subscription is not disposed of when the Activity is destroyed, leading to a memory leak and potentially a lingering network connection.

**Impact:** Memory leaks leading to performance degradation and potential crashes, resource exhaustion, battery drain.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize `CompositeDisposable` to manage multiple subscriptions and dispose of them collectively.
* Unsubscribe in appropriate Android lifecycle methods (e.g., `onDestroy` for Activities/Fragments).
* Consider using lifecycle-aware components provided by Android Architecture Components to automatically manage subscriptions.
