# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxandroid

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Observable Processing](./threats/race_conditions_in_observable_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit unsynchronized access to shared mutable state within `Observable` chains, specifically when using RxAndroid's threading capabilities. This might involve manipulating the timing of events or data emissions managed by different `Scheduler`s to cause unexpected behavior or data corruption. For example, if multiple threads are updating a shared UI element based on emissions from different `Observables` without proper synchronization, the UI might display inconsistent or incorrect information.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state leading to incorrect functionality, potential for privilege escalation if the corrupted data affects authorization or access control, denial of service if the inconsistent state leads to application crashes or hangs.

**Affected Component:** `Observable` chains, particularly when using operators like `subscribeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())`, `observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())`, `flatMap`, `merge` where concurrency is involved.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Employ proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized` blocks, `ReentrantLock`) when accessing shared mutable state from different threads involved in RxAndroid operations, especially when interacting with UI elements.
* Use thread-safe data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`).
* Carefully choose appropriate `Scheduler`s to manage thread execution and minimize unintended concurrency on the main thread.
* Consider using immutable data structures to avoid shared mutable state altogether, especially for UI-related data.

## Threat: [Deadlocks in Asynchronous Operations Managed by RxAndroid](./threats/deadlocks_in_asynchronous_operations_managed_by_rxandroid.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trigger a deadlock scenario by manipulating the order or timing of asynchronous operations specifically managed by RxAndroid's `Scheduler`s. This could involve creating circular dependencies in resource acquisition within different `Observable` streams operating on different threads managed by RxAndroid, causing threads to block indefinitely while waiting for each other. For instance, a background thread might be waiting for a lock held by the main thread, while the main thread is waiting for a result from the background thread.

**Impact:** Application freeze, unresponsiveness, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`, other `Scheduler`s used for background tasks, `Observable` chains involving multiple asynchronous operations or resource acquisition across different threads managed by RxAndroid.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Design asynchronous workflows carefully to avoid circular dependencies in resource acquisition across different threads managed by RxAndroid.
* Implement timeouts for resource acquisition to prevent indefinite blocking within RxAndroid operations.
* Analyze thread dependencies and resource locking patterns within RxAndroid workflows to identify potential deadlock scenarios.
* Avoid performing long-running or blocking operations on the main thread, as this can easily lead to deadlocks when interacting with background threads.

## Threat: [Unhandled Exceptions on the Main Thread Leading to Application Crash](./threats/unhandled_exceptions_on_the_main_thread_leading_to_application_crash.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trigger exceptions within `Observable` chains that are subscribed to or observe on the main thread (`AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`) and are not properly handled by the application's error handling mechanisms (e.g., missing `onError` handlers). These unhandled exceptions will crash the application due to the nature of the main thread in Android.

**Impact:** Application crash (denial of service).

**Affected Component:** `Observable` chains, particularly operators executed on `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` where exceptions might occur (e.g., UI updates, interactions with Android framework components).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust error handling within `Observable` pipelines that operate on the main thread using operators like `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`, and `doOnError`.
* Ensure all `Observable` chains that interact with the UI or Android framework components have proper error handling to prevent crashes.
* Consider using a global error handling mechanism that can gracefully catch and handle exceptions occurring on the main thread.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks due to Unmanaged Subscriptions on Android Components](./threats/memory_leaks_due_to_unmanaged_subscriptions_on_android_components.md)

**Description:** An attacker could indirectly cause a denial of service by exploiting memory leaks caused by failing to properly dispose of `Disposable` objects associated with `Observable` subscriptions that hold references to Android components (Activities, Fragments, Views). If these subscriptions are not disposed of when the component is destroyed, the component and its associated resources will not be garbage collected, leading to memory leaks and eventually application crashes. This could be triggered by navigating through different parts of the application that create subscriptions without proper lifecycle management.

**Impact:** Application crash (denial of service), performance degradation due to excessive memory consumption.

**Affected Component:** `Subscription` management, `Disposable` interface, `CompositeDisposable`, and the lifecycle of Android components (Activities, Fragments, Views) when used with `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` or when subscriptions hold references to these components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always store `Disposable` objects returned by `subscribe()` and dispose of them when the associated Android component is destroyed (e.g., in `onStop()` or `onDestroy()` lifecycle methods for Activities/Fragments).
* Use `CompositeDisposable` to manage multiple subscriptions associated with an Android component and dispose of them all at once in the component's lifecycle methods.
* Utilize lifecycle-aware components (e.g., `LifecycleObserver` in Android) and RxJava integrations for lifecycle management to automatically manage subscription disposal based on component lifecycle events.
* Avoid creating long-lived subscriptions that hold references to Android components without careful lifecycle management.
