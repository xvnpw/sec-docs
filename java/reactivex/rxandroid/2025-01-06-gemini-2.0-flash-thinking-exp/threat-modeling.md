# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxandroid

## Threat: [Race Condition Leading to Data Corruption or Inconsistent State](./threats/race_condition_leading_to_data_corruption_or_inconsistent_state.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might trigger specific sequences of asynchronous events within RxJava streams *managed by RxAndroid's Schedulers* that exploit a race condition. This could involve rapidly sending multiple inputs or manipulating the timing of events to cause shared mutable state to be updated in an unintended order, leading to corrupted data or an inconsistent application state. The vulnerability arises from the concurrent nature facilitated by RxAndroid.
*   **Impact:** The application might exhibit incorrect behavior, display wrong information, or even crash due to the corrupted data. In some scenarios, this could lead to financial loss or data breaches if sensitive information is involved.
*   **Affected Component:** `Observable`, `Flowable`, Schedulers (specifically when using `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` in conjunction with background Schedulers and shared mutable state).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Employ thread-safe data structures and synchronization mechanisms when dealing with shared mutable state accessed by different RxJava streams or threads managed by different RxAndroid Schedulers.
    *   Carefully design the flow of data and operations to minimize the need for shared mutable state. Favor immutable data structures where possible.
    *   Utilize RxJava operators that provide guarantees about the order of execution and thread safety, such as `concatMap` or `synchronized`.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios, including edge cases and high-load situations, to identify potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities in RxJava or RxAndroid Libraries](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_in_rxjava_or_rxandroid_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities within the RxJava or RxAndroid libraries themselves if the application is using an outdated or vulnerable version. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution or other forms of compromise *within the application leveraging RxAndroid's functionalities*.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's device, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire RxAndroid and RxJava library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a known exploitable vulnerability exists)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update RxJava and RxAndroid libraries to the latest stable versions to benefit from security fixes.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues related to these libraries.
    *   Use dependency management tools to easily update and manage library versions.
