## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via RxAndroid](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_rxandroid.md)

*   Attacker's overarching goal to leverage RxAndroid vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause harm, or disrupt the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Threading/Concurrency Management [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_threadingconcurrency_management__critical_node_.md)

*   **Introduce Race Condition [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Manipulate Shared State Concurrently:
        *   Exploit Lack of Proper Synchronization (e.g., missing `synchronized`, incorrect use of `SerializedSubject`): Attackers exploit the absence or misuse of synchronization mechanisms to cause unpredictable behavior when multiple threads access shared resources.
        *   Exploit Non-Atomic Operations on Shared Data: Attackers leverage operations on shared data that are not atomic, leading to interleaved execution and data corruption.
    *   **Cause Data Inconsistency:**
        *   Trigger Incorrect UI Updates due to Race: Race conditions lead to the UI displaying outdated or incorrect information, potentially misleading users or hiding malicious activity.
        *   Corrupt Application Data due to Race [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Race conditions result in the corruption of application data, leading to incorrect functionality or data loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Data Inconsistency](./attack_tree_paths/cause_data_inconsistency.md)

*   Trigger Incorrect UI Updates due to Race: Race conditions lead to the UI displaying outdated or incorrect information, potentially misleading users or hiding malicious activity.
        *   Corrupt Application Data due to Race [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Race conditions result in the corruption of application data, leading to incorrect functionality or data loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect `observeOn()`/`subscribeOn()` Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect__observeon____subscribeon____usage.md)

*   Force Operations onto Unexpected Threads:
        *   Trigger Security-Sensitive Operations on Untrusted Threads [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Attackers manipulate thread scheduling to execute sensitive operations on threads lacking appropriate security context or permissions.
        *   Bypass Security Checks Designed for Specific Threads [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Attackers circumvent security checks that are designed to be enforced based on the executing thread's identity or permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Force Operations onto Unexpected Threads](./attack_tree_paths/force_operations_onto_unexpected_threads.md)

*   Trigger Security-Sensitive Operations on Untrusted Threads [HIGH-RISK PATH]: Attackers manipulate thread scheduling to execute sensitive operations on threads lacking appropriate security context or permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Error Handling Weaknesses in Reactive Streams [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_error_handling_weaknesses_in_reactive_streams__critical_node_.md)

*   **Cause Unhandled Exceptions to Crash Application [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Trigger Exceptions in Observable Chains without Proper `onErrorResumeNext()` or `onErrorReturn()`: Attackers trigger errors in the reactive stream that are not gracefully handled, leading to application crashes.
    *   Exploit Lack of Robust Error Handling in Subscribers: Attackers exploit the absence of proper error handling within Subscriber implementations, causing unhandled exceptions and crashes.

*   **Leak Sensitive Information via Error Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   Trigger Exceptions that Expose Internal Application State: Attackers craft inputs or scenarios that cause exceptions revealing sensitive internal application details in error messages.
    *   Log Detailed Error Information that Includes Sensitive Data: Attackers exploit overly verbose logging configurations that inadvertently include sensitive data in error logs.
