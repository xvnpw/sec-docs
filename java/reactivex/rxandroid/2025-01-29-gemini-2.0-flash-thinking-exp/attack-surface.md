# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxandroid

## Attack Surface: [Asynchronous Operations on the Main Thread (UI Thread)](./attack_surfaces/asynchronous_operations_on_the_main_thread__ui_thread_.md)

*   **Description:** Performing long-running or blocking operations directly on the Android main thread (UI thread), leading to UI freezes and Application Not Responding (ANR) errors.
*   **RxAndroid Contribution:** RxAndroid provides `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` which allows developers to easily schedule operations on the main thread.  Misuse by executing heavy tasks directly on this scheduler is a direct contribution to this attack surface. The ease of use of `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` can inadvertently encourage developers to perform operations that should be offloaded to background threads, thus directly increasing the risk of ANRs.
*   **Example:** An application uses RxAndroid to process a large image and updates the UI with the processed image using `observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())`. If the image processing itself is also performed within the same Rx chain *without* being offloaded to a background thread (e.g., using `subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())`), it will block the main thread, causing an ANR.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - application becomes unresponsive and unusable, forcing the user to force-close the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strictly offload** all computationally intensive or I/O bound operations to background threads using appropriate Schedulers like `Schedulers.io()` or `Schedulers.computation()` using operators like `subscribeOn()`.
        *   **Reserve `observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())` exclusively for short, non-blocking UI updates** that occur *after* background processing is fully completed.
        *   Implement **timeouts** for operations, especially network requests or complex calculations, to prevent indefinite blocking of the main thread even if background threading is used incorrectly.
        *   Conduct **rigorous performance testing**, particularly under simulated load and stress conditions, to proactively identify and eliminate any main thread bottlenecks introduced by RxAndroid usage.
        *   Utilize **strict code review processes** to ensure developers are correctly using `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()` and are not inadvertently performing heavy operations on it.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Limited mitigation for users.** Force closing the application and restarting it is the primary user action to recover from an ANR.
        *   **Avoid triggering application features** that are consistently observed to cause freezes or unresponsiveness.
        *   **Ensure the device has sufficient resources** (CPU, memory) as low-end devices are more susceptible to ANRs under load.
