# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
 - Provide a library that simplifies asynchronous programming on the Android platform.
 - Enable developers to write cleaner, more maintainable, and more efficient Android applications by leveraging reactive programming principles.
 - Offer a robust and well-tested solution for handling background tasks, UI updates, and event streams in Android development.
 - Foster a community around reactive programming in Android and contribute to the wider RxJava ecosystem.
- Most important business risks:
 - Risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities in the library that could affect applications using it.
 - Risk of the library becoming outdated or unmaintained, leading to compatibility issues or security concerns in the long term.
 - Risk of the library not meeting the evolving needs of the Android development community, potentially leading to decreased adoption.
 - Risk of supply chain vulnerabilities if dependencies are compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
 - security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and contributions. Implemented in: Open-source nature of the project.
 - security control: Build process likely uses standard Android and Java development tools. Implemented in: Build scripts and project configuration.
- Accepted risks:
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be introduced by community contributors.
 - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities are publicly known once discovered.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on external dependencies (RxJava, Android SDK) for security.
- Recommended security controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
 - security control: Conduct regular dependency vulnerability scanning and updates.
 - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Encourage and facilitate security audits by the community.
- Security requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable for a library. RxAndroid itself does not handle authentication. Applications using RxAndroid will manage their own authentication.
 - Authorization: Not applicable for a library. RxAndroid itself does not handle authorization. Applications using RxAndroid will manage their own authorization.
 - Input validation: RxAndroid should perform input validation where applicable to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes due to malformed input from the application using the library. This is especially relevant for any public APIs that accept parameters.
 - Cryptography: Cryptography is likely not a core requirement for RxAndroid itself. If applications using RxAndroid need cryptography, they should implement it within their application logic, potentially using other libraries. RxAndroid should not introduce cryptography unless strictly necessary for its core functionality.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process we are trying to protect:
 - Ensuring the reliability and security of Android applications that depend on RxAndroid.
 - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the RxAndroid library for the Android developer community.
 - Protecting the reputation and trust associated with the RxAndroid project.
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
 - Source code of RxAndroid: Sensitive, as its compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in the library and applications using it.
 - Build artifacts (AAR/JAR files): Sensitive, as their compromise could lead to distribution of malicious versions of the library.
 - Project infrastructure (CI/CD, repository): Sensitive, as its compromise could lead to unauthorized modifications or malicious releases.
 - Developer credentials and access keys: Highly sensitive, as their compromise could lead to unauthorized access and control over the project.
 - Issue reports and vulnerability disclosures: Sensitive, should be handled securely and responsibly.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What CI/CD system is currently used for RxAndroid? (Assumption: GitHub Actions is a likely candidate for open-source GitHub projects).
 - Are there any automated security scans currently implemented in the build process? (Assumption: Basic build and test automation is likely present, security scans might be missing or basic).
 - What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in RxAndroid? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting process via GitHub issues or security channels).
 - Is there a formal security audit process for RxAndroid? (Assumption: Likely no formal, regular security audits, relying more on community review and ad-hoc contributions).
- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a useful and reliable open-source library for the Android developer community.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important but might not be the top priority compared to functionality and ease of use in an open-source library context. Security relies heavily on community contributions and standard open-source practices.
 - DESIGN: The architecture is relatively straightforward for a library. The main complexity lies in the interaction with the Android platform and RxJava. Deployment is primarily through dependency management in Android projects. Build process is likely automated using standard tools.
