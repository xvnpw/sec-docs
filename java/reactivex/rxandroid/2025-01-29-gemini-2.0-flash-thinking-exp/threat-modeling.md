# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxandroid

## Threat: [Race Conditions and Data Corruption due to Asynchronous Operations](./threats/race_conditions_and_data_corruption_due_to_asynchronous_operations.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could potentially exploit race conditions in RxAndroid code by sending concurrent requests or triggering specific sequences of events that interact with shared mutable state in an unsynchronized manner. This can lead to data corruption or inconsistent application state.
- **Impact:** Data integrity issues, application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if data corruption leads to exploitable conditions (e.g., privilege escalation, bypassing security checks).
- **RxAndroid Component Affected:** General RxAndroid usage patterns involving shared mutable state and asynchronous operations (Observables, Subscribers, Operators).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers should minimize the use of shared mutable state in RxAndroid streams. Favor immutable data structures and reactive data flows.
    - When shared mutable state is necessary, developers must implement proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., thread-safe data structures, locks, or RxJava operators for concurrency control).
    - Conduct thorough testing, including concurrency testing, to identify and eliminate potential race conditions.

## Threat: [Excessive Backpressure Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/excessive_backpressure_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could flood the application with requests or data inputs designed to overwhelm Rx stream consumers. If backpressure is not properly handled, this can lead to excessive buffering of data in memory, potentially causing memory exhaustion and application crashes, resulting in Denial of Service.
- **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, application crashes, performance degradation, Denial of Service.
- **RxAndroid Component Affected:** Backpressure handling mechanisms in RxJava (operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`), Observables and Subscribers dealing with data flow.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers should implement appropriate backpressure handling strategies using RxJava's backpressure operators to manage data flow and prevent buffer overflows.
    - Carefully design Rx streams to ensure consumers can keep up with producers or implement flow control mechanisms to limit data emission rates.
    - Implement monitoring of resource usage and application performance to detect and address potential backpressure issues.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in RxJava or RxAndroid Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_rxjava_or_rxandroid_libraries.md)

- **Description:** If security vulnerabilities are discovered in the RxJava or RxAndroid libraries themselves, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses affected versions of these libraries. Exploitation could range from Denial of Service to more severe impacts like remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
- **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially including Denial of Service, data breaches, remote code execution, and complete compromise of the application.
- **RxAndroid Component Affected:** RxAndroid library dependency, underlying RxJava library.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Developers must keep RxAndroid and RxJava libraries updated to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    - Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for RxJava, RxAndroid, and related dependencies.
    - Implement a robust dependency management strategy to track and update library dependencies proactively and promptly apply security updates.
