## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Observable/Flowable (Critical Node and Start of a High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_observableflowable__critical_node_and_start_of_a_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious data into an RxJava stream at its source. This could be through various means depending on how the stream is created, such as:
    *   Manipulating external data sources that feed into the stream (e.g., databases, message queues, APIs).
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in components that generate the initial emissions of the stream.
    *   If the stream originates from user input (less common for direct RxJava streams but possible in some architectures), exploiting input validation flaws.
*   **Why it's High-Risk:** This is a fundamental attack vector because the integrity of the entire stream processing pipeline depends on the initial data. If malicious data enters the stream, it can propagate through various operators and potentially compromise downstream logic, leading to:
    *   Data corruption or manipulation.
    *   Execution of unintended code or commands.
    *   Bypassing security checks or authorization mechanisms.
    *   Information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Deadlocks or Blocking Operations (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/cause_deadlocks_or_blocking_operations__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the asynchronous nature of RxJava by introducing blocking operations within the reactive streams, specifically within the `subscribeOn` or `observeOn` operators. This can be achieved by:
    *   Crafting input or triggering conditions that cause a thread within a scheduler to become blocked indefinitely (e.g., waiting for a resource that will never be available, entering an infinite loop).
    *   Exploiting dependencies on external systems that might become unresponsive, causing the RxJava stream to halt while waiting.
*   **Why it's Critical:** Deadlocks or blocking operations can lead to a complete standstill of the affected part of the application or even the entire application. This results in:
    *   Denial of service (DoS) as the application becomes unresponsive.
    *   Resource starvation as threads are held up indefinitely, preventing them from processing other requests.
    *   Potential cascading failures if other parts of the system depend on the blocked components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Race Conditions in Shared State (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/race_conditions_in_shared_state__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the concurrent nature of RxJava to create race conditions when multiple asynchronous operations access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization. This can be done by:
    *   Sending concurrent requests or events that trigger simultaneous updates to shared variables or data structures.
    *   Exploiting timing windows where the order of operations is not guaranteed, leading to inconsistent state.
*   **Why it's Critical:** Race conditions can lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous outcomes, including:
    *   Data corruption as updates are lost or applied in the wrong order.
    *   Inconsistent application state, leading to incorrect behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    *   Authorization bypasses if access control decisions are based on the inconsistent state.
    *   Unexpected errors or crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Force Execution on Malicious Thread (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/force_execution_on_malicious_thread__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** In specific application architectures where external control over RxJava schedulers is possible (though generally discouraged), an attacker could attempt to force the execution of reactive streams on a thread they control. This is a more advanced attack and relies on specific vulnerabilities in how schedulers are configured and managed.
*   **Why it's Critical:** If successful, this attack grants the attacker significant control over the execution environment of the RxJava stream, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   Access sensitive resources or data that the application has access to.
    *   Manipulate the application's behavior in a highly controlled manner.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Unmanaged Backpressure (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_unmanaged_backpressure__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the lack of proper backpressure handling in RxJava streams by overwhelming the consumer with more data than it can process. This can be achieved by:
    *   Flooding the source of an Observable or Flowable with a large volume of emissions.
    *   Triggering events that cause a rapid generation of data within the stream processing pipeline.
*   **Why it's Critical:**  Without backpressure, the consumer of the stream will be unable to keep up, leading to:
    *   Memory exhaustion as the unprocessed data accumulates in buffers.
    *   CPU overload as the system tries to process the excessive data.
    *   Application slowdown or complete unresponsiveness, resulting in a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Discover and Exploit Known RxJava Bugs (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/discover_and_exploit_known_rxjava_bugs__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of the RxJava library. This involves:
    *   Staying informed about security advisories and vulnerability databases related to RxJava.
    *   Identifying applications using vulnerable versions of the library.
    *   Leveraging existing exploits or developing custom exploits to take advantage of the identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Why it's Critical:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities can have a high impact because:
    *   Exploits are often readily available or can be developed relatively easily once a vulnerability is known.
    *   The impact of the vulnerability can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the bug.
    *   It highlights the importance of keeping dependencies updated to patch known security flaws.
