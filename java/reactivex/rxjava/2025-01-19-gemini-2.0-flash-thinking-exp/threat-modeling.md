# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxjava

## Threat: [Unbounded Streams Causing Backpressure Issues and DoS](./threats/unbounded_streams_causing_backpressure_issues_and_dos.md)

**Description:** An attacker might trigger or exploit scenarios where an `Observable` emits data at a rate faster than the subscriber can process. This is a direct consequence of RxJava's asynchronous nature and can lead to backpressure buildup, potentially overwhelming the application and causing resource exhaustion. The attacker doesn't need to exploit a vulnerability in RxJava itself, but rather the application's failure to handle backpressure correctly within the RxJava stream.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, and potential crashes due to resource exhaustion (e.g., memory overflow, CPU overload).

**Affected RxJava Component:** `Observable`, `Subscriber`, and operators related to backpressure handling (e.g., `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`, `throttleFirst`, `debounce`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement appropriate backpressure strategies based on the application's needs using RxJava's backpressure operators.
* Use operators like `throttleFirst` or `debounce` to control the rate of data processing within the RxJava stream.
* Design subscribers to handle data at a sustainable rate, considering the processing capacity.
* Monitor resource usage and identify potential backpressure bottlenecks within the reactive streams.

## Threat: [Race Conditions Due to Shared Mutable State in Reactive Streams](./threats/race_conditions_due_to_shared_mutable_state_in_reactive_streams.md)

**Description:** An attacker might manipulate the timing of events in asynchronous reactive streams that interact with shared mutable state without proper synchronization. This is a direct consequence of RxJava's concurrency model and can lead to inconsistent data and unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. The attacker exploits the lack of thread-safety in the application's use of RxJava.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, and unpredictable behavior.

**Affected RxJava Component:** Any part of the reactive stream that accesses and modifies shared mutable state, particularly within operators or subscriber logic executed on different threads managed by RxJava's Schedulers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid shared mutable state whenever possible within RxJava streams. Favor immutable data structures.
* If shared mutable state is necessary, use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized` blocks, locks, atomic variables) when accessing it within RxJava operators or subscribers.
* Use RxJava's concurrency utilities like `ReplaySubject` or `BehaviorSubject` with extreme caution when dealing with shared state, ensuring proper synchronization.
* Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios involving shared state within RxJava streams to identify and prevent race conditions.

## Threat: [Deadlocks Due to Improper Scheduler Usage](./threats/deadlocks_due_to_improper_scheduler_usage.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft scenarios where threads managed by different RxJava Schedulers block each other indefinitely, leading to a deadlock. This is a direct consequence of how RxJava manages concurrency and can occur when threads are waiting for resources held by other threads in a circular dependency within the reactive pipeline.

**Impact:** Application freeze, complete unresponsiveness, and potential need for manual intervention to recover.

**Affected RxJava Component:** `Scheduler` implementations (e.g., `Schedulers.io()`, `Schedulers.computation()`, `Schedulers.newThread()`) and operators that involve switching between schedulers (`subscribeOn`, `observeOn`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan scheduler usage within RxJava and avoid complex interdependencies between threads on different schedulers.
* Avoid performing blocking operations within reactive streams, especially on shared Schedulers, as this can easily lead to deadlocks.
* Use timeouts for operations that might potentially block indefinitely within RxJava streams.
* Thoroughly test concurrent scenarios involving different Schedulers to identify potential deadlocks.

## Threat: [Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Issues in Asynchronous RxJava Operations](./threats/time-of-check_to_time-of-use__toctou__issues_in_asynchronous_rxjava_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit the asynchronous nature of RxJava to introduce TOCTOU vulnerabilities. This arises directly from RxJava's non-blocking execution model where a security check might be performed in one part of the stream, but by the time the action based on that check is executed in a later asynchronous step within the RxJava pipeline, the underlying conditions might have changed.

**Impact:** Authorization bypass, privilege escalation, and other security violations.

**Affected RxJava Component:** The asynchronous nature of `Observable` and `Subscriber`, and the timing of operations within the reactive stream pipeline managed by RxJava.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that security checks and the actions they authorize are performed within the same atomic operation or within a tightly controlled sequence within the RxJava stream.
* Pass necessary security context along with the data in the reactive stream to ensure decisions are based on the correct state at the time of execution.
* Use transactional operations or optimistic locking principles when dealing with state changes within asynchronous RxJava workflows to prevent race conditions that can lead to TOCTOU issues.

## Threat: [Injection of Malicious Data Exploiting RxJava Operators](./threats/injection_of_malicious_data_exploiting_rxjava_operators.md)

**Description:** An attacker might inject malicious data into an `Observable` or `Subject`, and this data is then processed by RxJava operators in a way that leads to a vulnerability. This is a direct consequence of how RxJava processes data flowing through its streams. For example, if an operator like `map` executes code based on the input data without proper sanitization, it could be exploited.

**Impact:** Code injection, data corruption, denial of service, or other application-specific vulnerabilities depending on how the malicious data is processed by RxJava operators.

**Affected RxJava Component:** `Observable`, `Subject`, and various operators that process data, especially those that execute functions based on the data (e.g., `map`, `flatMap`, `filter` with complex predicates).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly validate and sanitize all external data *before* it enters the RxJava stream.
* Avoid executing arbitrary code based on data within RxJava operators without strict validation.
* Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases within RxJava streams.
* Encode output data appropriately to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the data processed by RxJava is used in web contexts.
* Implement input validation rules to ensure data conforms to expected formats and constraints before being processed by RxJava operators.
