# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxjava

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Data Streams - Denial of Service (DoS) via Stream Flooding](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_data_streams_-_denial_of_service__dos__via_stream_flooding.md)

* **Description:** An attacker floods an RxJava stream with a large volume of data, overwhelming the application's processing capacity.
* **How RxJava Contributes:** RxJava's asynchronous nature, if not coupled with proper backpressure handling, can make it vulnerable to DoS attacks where a fast-emitting upstream overwhelms downstream consumers.
* **Example:** An attacker sends a massive number of events to an `Observable` that is being processed without proper backpressure handling, leading to excessive memory consumption and application unresponsiveness.
* **Impact:** Application unresponsiveness, resource exhaustion (CPU, memory), potential application crash.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement backpressure strategies (e.g., `onBackpressureBuffer()`, `onBackpressureDrop()`, `onBackpressureLatest()`) appropriate for the data source and processing pipeline.
    * Use rate limiting or throttling operators (e.g., `throttleFirst()`, `debounce()`) within the RxJava stream to control the rate of data processing.

## Attack Surface: [Operator Abuse - Resource Exhaustion via Buffering Operators](./attack_surfaces/operator_abuse_-_resource_exhaustion_via_buffering_operators.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates the conditions under which RxJava's buffering operators accumulate data, leading to excessive memory consumption.
* **How RxJava Contributes:** Operators like `buffer()`, `window()`, or `toList()` temporarily store data within the RxJava stream. If the conditions for emitting or clearing these buffers are controllable by an attacker (e.g., through input or timing), they can force the application to hold onto large amounts of data.
* **Example:** An application uses `buffer(timeout)` to collect events within a time window. An attacker can manipulate the timing of events to force the buffer to grow indefinitely, leading to an OutOfMemory error.
* **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, application crash.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Set reasonable limits on the size or duration of buffers used in RxJava operators.
    * Avoid unbounded buffering where possible within RxJava streams.
    * Carefully consider the conditions under which buffering operators emit data in your RxJava implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities - Outdated RxJava Library](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_-_outdated_rxjava_library.md)

* **Description:** Using an outdated version of the RxJava library with known security vulnerabilities.
* **How RxJava Contributes:**  Like any dependency, RxJava can have vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time. Using an old version directly exposes the application to these known issues within the RxJava library itself.
* **Example:** An older version of RxJava has a vulnerability that allows for a specific type of DoS attack or data manipulation within the reactive streams.
* **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities within the RxJava library, potentially leading to various security breaches.
* **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update the RxJava library to the latest stable version.
    * Monitor security advisories specifically for RxJava and its dependencies.
    * Use dependency management tools to track and update RxJava and other libraries.
