# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxjava

## Attack Surface: [Observable/Subject Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/observablesubject_data_injection.md)

* **Description**: Malicious or unexpected data is injected into an RxJava stream from an untrusted source.
    * **How RxJava Contributes**: RxJava's `Observable` and `Subject` components act as conduits for data flow. If these components receive data from external, unvalidated sources, they can directly introduce vulnerabilities into the reactive pipeline.
    * **Example**: An application uses a `PublishSubject` to broadcast user-entered commands. An attacker injects a specially crafted command that is then executed by a downstream component without proper validation.
    * **Impact**: Can lead to various issues depending on the downstream processing, including application crashes, data corruption, information disclosure, or even remote code execution if the injected data is interpreted as code.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data entering RxJava streams from untrusted sources *before* it enters the stream.
        * Use appropriate data types and avoid implicit type conversions that could lead to vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Operators and Plugins Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_operators_and_plugins_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description**: Security flaws exist within custom RxJava operators or plugins developed for the application.
    * **How RxJava Contributes**: RxJava's extensibility allows developers to create custom operators and plugins that become integral parts of the reactive stream. Vulnerabilities in these custom components are directly within the RxJava flow.
    * **Example**: A custom operator performing data transformation has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker can craft input that, when processed by the custom operator within the RxJava stream, triggers this overflow, potentially leading to code execution.
    * **Impact**: Can range from application crashes and data corruption to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom component.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Apply secure coding practices when developing custom RxJava operators and plugins.
        * Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom components.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when designing custom components.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Issues in Reactive Streams](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_issues_in_reactive_streams.md)

* **Description**: If RxJava streams handle serialized data, vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization can be introduced.
    * **How RxJava Contributes**: `Observables` or `Subjects` might be used to transmit serialized objects (e.g., Java serialization) as part of the reactive data flow. If deserialization is not handled securely within the RxJava stream processing, attackers can exploit it.
    * **Example**: An `Observable` receives serialized Java objects from an external source. An attacker sends a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized within the RxJava processing pipeline, executes arbitrary code on the application server.
    * **Impact**: Remote code execution, denial of service, or other severe security breaches.
    * **Risk Severity**: Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Avoid using Java serialization for inter-process communication or when dealing with untrusted data within RxJava streams. Prefer safer alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
        * If Java serialization is necessary, implement robust deserialization filtering to prevent the instantiation of malicious classes within the RxJava processing.
        * Keep deserialization libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
