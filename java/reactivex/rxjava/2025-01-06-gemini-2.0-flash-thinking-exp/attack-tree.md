## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_data_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to manipulate the data flowing through RxJava's reactive streams to cause unintended behavior, bypass security checks, or gain unauthorized access. This path is critical because successful data manipulation can have wide-ranging and severe consequences.

    *   **Critical Node: Malicious Operator Logic Injection**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code or logic within custom RxJava operators.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Potential for arbitrary code execution, data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Critical Node: Observable Stream Poisoning**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious data into an Observable stream before it reaches critical processing stages or manipulating data within operators to cause unintended side effects.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Can lead to data corruption, logic bypass, or denial of service)
        *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_resource_exhaustion_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to overwhelm the application's resources by triggering excessive computations or memory usage within the RxJava framework, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. This path is high-risk due to the potential for easy execution and severe impact.

    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting areas where RxJava is used to process potentially unbounded streams or handle a large volume of events.
    *   **Critical Node: Unbounded Observable Streams**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Introducing or triggering an Observable stream that emits an excessive number of items without proper backpressure handling.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Denial of Service, application crash)
        *   **Effort:** Low/Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Error Handling Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_error_handling_weaknesses.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the application's error handling mechanisms within RxJava to gain sensitive information or cause disruptions. This path is high-risk due to the ease of exploiting information disclosure.

    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Error Handling Weaknesses**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Triggering errors in RxJava streams to observe error messages and potentially glean sensitive information.
    *   **Critical Node: Information Disclosure through Error Messages**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Triggering errors that expose sensitive information in error messages or stack traces.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Exposure of sensitive information)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in RxJava Dependencies (Transitive)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_rxjava_dependencies__transitive_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the libraries that RxJava depends on. This path is high-risk because it's a common attack vector with potentially high impact and a relatively low barrier to entry.

    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in RxJava Dependencies (Transitive)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging public exploits for known vulnerabilities in RxJava's dependencies.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low/Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes (Not Part of Explicit High-Risk Paths but Significant)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes__not_part_of_explicit_high-risk_paths_but_significant_.md)

*   **Exploit Concurrency and Synchronization Issues**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting race conditions or deadlocks arising from concurrent operations within RxJava pipelines.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Data corruption, inconsistent application state, security vulnerabilities, application freeze)
    *   **Effort:** Medium/High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate/Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High/Medium

*   **Abuse Subject/Processor Behavior**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting unauthorized data or manipulating the state of Subjects or Processors to influence application behavior or bypass security controls.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium/High (Data manipulation, logic bypass, triggering unintended actions)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
