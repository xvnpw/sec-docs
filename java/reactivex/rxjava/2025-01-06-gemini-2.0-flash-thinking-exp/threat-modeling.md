# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxjava

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Custom Operators](./threats/race_conditions_in_custom_operators.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the timing of asynchronous events processed by a custom RxJava operator to cause unexpected behavior. This could involve sending carefully timed data streams to exploit a lack of synchronization within the operator's logic, leading to data corruption or incorrect state transitions.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for unauthorized actions if the race condition affects security-critical logic, denial of service if the race condition leads to a crash.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly test custom operators under concurrent load. Use thread-safe data structures when managing internal state. Leverage RxJava's built-in operators where possible, as they are generally well-tested for concurrency issues. Employ synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock`) or reactive alternatives if shared mutable state is necessary.

## Threat: [Deadlocks due to Incorrect Scheduler Usage](./threats/deadlocks_due_to_incorrect_scheduler_usage.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger a deadlock by sending specific sequences of events that cause different parts of the RxJava processing pipeline to block each other indefinitely. This could involve exploiting scenarios where operations on different schedulers are waiting for each other to complete.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application hangs, inability to process further requests.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully choose schedulers based on the nature of the operation (IO-bound vs. CPU-bound). Avoid blocking operations within observable chains. If blocking is unavoidable, isolate it to dedicated schedulers and ensure proper timeouts are in place. Thoroughly test concurrent execution paths.

## Threat: [Unintended Shared State Modification](./threats/unintended_shared_state_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit scenarios where multiple observables or subscribers concurrently access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization. By sending concurrent requests or events, they could introduce race conditions that lead to data corruption or inconsistent application state.

**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for security bypasses if the shared state controls access or permissions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Minimize the use of shared mutable state. If shared state is necessary, use thread-safe data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`) or synchronization mechanisms. Consider using immutable data structures and reactive state management techniques.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Unbounded Observables](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_unbounded_observables.md)

**Description:** An attacker could flood the application with events that are processed by an observable without proper backpressure handling. This could lead to the accumulation of unprocessed events in memory, eventually causing an out-of-memory error and denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, performance degradation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement proper backpressure strategies using RxJava's backpressure operators (e.g., `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`). Set appropriate buffer sizes and overflow strategies. Monitor resource usage and implement mechanisms to handle excessive event rates.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Custom Operators leading to Security Flaws](./threats/logic_errors_in_custom_operators_leading_to_security_flaws.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities introduced by flawed logic within custom-built RxJava operators. This could involve manipulating input data to trigger unintended behavior, bypass security checks, or cause data corruption due to programming errors in the operator's implementation.

**Impact:** Data corruption, security bypasses, potential for unauthorized actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly test custom operators with various inputs and edge cases. Follow secure coding practices when developing custom operators. Conduct code reviews to identify potential logic errors. Consider using well-established and tested built-in operators whenever possible.
