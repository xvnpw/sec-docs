### High and Critical RxJava Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats directly involving the RxJava library:

* **Threat:** Race Conditions in Operators
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit race conditions within the implementation of RxJava operators, particularly if custom operators are used. This could involve manipulating the order of execution or the state of internal variables within the operator, leading to unexpected and potentially exploitable behavior. For example, a race condition in a custom operator could lead to incorrect data transformations or security checks being bypassed.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential security bypasses.
    * **Affected RxJava Component:** RxJava Core Operators, Custom Operators.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test custom operators for thread safety.
        * Understand the concurrency characteristics of built-in RxJava operators.
        * Avoid sharing mutable state within operator implementations without proper synchronization.
        * Consider using immutable data structures within operators.

* **Threat:** Deadlocks due to Improper Scheduler Usage
    * **Description:** An attacker could induce a deadlock by exploiting how the application uses RxJava Schedulers. This could involve triggering scenarios where threads managed by different Schedulers are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other. For example, an attacker might trigger a sequence of asynchronous operations that create a circular dependency across different Schedulers.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (application becomes unresponsive).
    * **Affected RxJava Component:** Schedulers, `subscribeOn()` and `observeOn()` operators.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully plan the use of different Schedulers and their interaction.
        * Avoid performing blocking operations on Schedulers intended for non-blocking tasks (e.g., `Schedulers.computation()`).
        * Design reactive streams to avoid circular dependencies in asynchronous operations across different Schedulers.
        * Monitor thread activity and resource usage related to RxJava Schedulers.

* **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion from Unbounded Streams (RxJava Level)
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit a lack of backpressure handling within the RxJava stream itself, causing the application to consume excessive resources. This could involve a source Observable emitting items faster than downstream operators or the Subscriber can process them, leading to memory exhaustion. This is a threat directly within the RxJava flow, not just at the data source.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crashes or becomes unresponsive), increased infrastructure costs.
    * **Affected RxJava Component:** Observables, Subscribers, operators that buffer data (if not configured with limits), backpressure operators (if not used correctly).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement backpressure strategies using operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`, or `throttleFirst`.
        * Carefully configure buffer sizes and eviction policies for buffering operators.
        * Monitor resource consumption related to RxJava streams.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Custom Operators
    * **Description:** An attacker could directly exploit security vulnerabilities introduced in custom RxJava operators. This could involve flaws in input validation, insecure data transformations, or improper handling of asynchronous operations within the custom operator's logic.
    * **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including data corruption, information disclosure, or remote code execution (in severe cases).
    * **Affected RxJava Component:** Custom Operators.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Apply secure coding practices when developing custom operators.
        * Implement thorough input validation and sanitization within custom operators.
        * Avoid performing security-sensitive operations directly within custom operators without careful consideration and security review.
        * Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom operators, including penetration testing.
        * Isolate custom operator logic and limit their access to sensitive resources.
