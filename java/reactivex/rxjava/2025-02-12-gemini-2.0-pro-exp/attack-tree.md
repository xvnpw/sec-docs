## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application (DoS or RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application__dos_or_rce___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker: to either cause a Denial of Service (making the application unavailable) or achieve Remote Code Execution (gaining control over the application and potentially the underlying system).
*   **Why Critical:** This represents the successful completion of the attack, with severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attack that aims to make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Why Critical:**  DoS can disrupt business operations, cause financial losses, and damage reputation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attack that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **Why Critical:** RCE is one of the most severe vulnerabilities, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (Threads/Memory) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__threadsmemory___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  A common attack vector in RxJava applications, where the attacker exploits vulnerabilities to consume excessive system resources (threads or memory), leading to a DoS.
*   **Why Critical:**  This is a readily achievable and high-impact attack vector in RxJava.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Infinite Streams (-> HIGH RISK ->)](./attack_tree_paths/1__infinite_streams__-_high_risk_-_.md)

*   **Description:**  Creating RxJava streams that never terminate (e.g., `Observable.interval()` without proper disposal).  An attacker might trigger the creation of many such streams.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS due to resource exhaustion)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Always dispose of subscriptions to `Observable`s when they are no longer needed. Use `Disposable` and `CompositeDisposable` effectively.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Unbounded Buffers (-> HIGH RISK ->)](./attack_tree_paths/2__unbounded_buffers__-_high_risk_-_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using RxJava operators like `buffer()`, `window()`, or `toList()` without specifying a maximum size or time window. An attacker could flood the system with data to trigger an OutOfMemoryError.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS due to OutOfMemoryError)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Always specify a maximum size or time window when using buffering operators.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unexpected/Unhandled Errors](./attack_tree_paths/unexpectedunhandled_errors.md)

**Description:** Errors within RxJava pipeline that can lead to application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Unhandled Exception Swallowing (-> HIGH RISK ->)](./attack_tree_paths/5__unhandled_exception_swallowing__-_high_risk_-_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using RxJava operators like `onErrorResumeNext()` to return a default value without logging or properly handling the error. This masks critical failures and can lead to data corruption or inconsistent state.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** Medium (Instability, data corruption, masked vulnerabilities)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (attacker benefits from pre-existing vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice (to introduce the vulnerability), Intermediate/Advanced (to exploit the consequences)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:** Never silently ignore exceptions. Always log them and handle them appropriately.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_deserialization.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in deserialization process.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Untrusted Data Input (Deserialization) (-> HIGH RISK ->)](./attack_tree_paths/7__untrusted_data_input__deserialization___-_high_risk_-_.md)

*   **Description:**  If RxJava streams process data that is then deserialized, and the data source is untrusted, an attacker could inject malicious serialized objects. This is a general deserialization vulnerability, but RxJava might be the conduit.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (directly through RxJava; higher if RxJava is used to handle untrusted data)
*   **Impact:** Very High (potential for RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. If necessary, use a secure deserialization library and validate the data after deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Scheduler Use](./attack_tree_paths/improper_scheduler_use.md)

**Description:** Misusing RxJava schedulers.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Blocking Calls in Computation Scheduler (-> HIGH RISK ->)](./attack_tree_paths/10__blocking_calls_in_computation_scheduler__-_high_risk_-_.md)

*   **Description:**  The `computation()` scheduler is for CPU-bound tasks. Making blocking I/O calls within this scheduler can lead to thread starvation. An attacker might trigger code paths that perform blocking operations on this scheduler.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (DoS due to thread starvation)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Use the correct scheduler for each operation. Use `Schedulers.io()` for I/O-bound tasks, and avoid blocking operations on `Schedulers.computation()`.
