# Attack Surface Analysis for reactivex/rxjava

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Memory)](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_resource_consumption__memory_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker triggers excessive memory allocation within RxJava streams, leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness.
    *   **RxJava Contribution:** RxJava's `Observable` (without backpressure) and improper use of buffering operators can easily lead to unbounded memory consumption.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of requests that trigger an `Observable` to emit a massive number of items without any `Flowable` backpressure mechanisms, `windowing`, or `buffering` with size limits.
    *   **Impact:**  Application crash (OutOfMemoryError), denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory `Flowable` with Backpressure:**  Strictly enforce the use of `Flowable` and appropriate backpressure strategies (`onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`) for any stream that could potentially have a high emission rate.
        *   **Bounded Buffers:**  If buffering is required, *always* use operators like `buffer(int count)` with a strictly enforced, reasonable size limit.  Never use unbounded buffers.
        *   **Windowing/Throttling:** Employ operators like `window`, `throttleFirst`, `throttleLast`, `debounce` to control the emission rate and prevent overwhelming downstream consumers.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorous input validation is crucial to prevent attackers from controlling the size or frequency of emissions.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Implement proactive monitoring to detect excessive memory usage and trigger alerts before a crash occurs.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Threads)](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_resource_consumption__threads_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker causes the creation of an excessive number of threads through RxJava's scheduler mechanisms, leading to thread starvation.
    *   **RxJava Contribution:**  Incorrect use of `subscribeOn` and `observeOn`, particularly misusing `Schedulers.io()` for CPU-bound tasks, can result in uncontrolled thread creation.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker triggers numerous concurrent operations, each incorrectly using `subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())` for a CPU-intensive task, creating far more threads than the system can handle.
    *   **Impact:**  Thread starvation, application slowdown, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Scheduler Usage Guidelines:**
            *   `Schedulers.io()`: *Only* for I/O-bound operations.
            *   `Schedulers.computation()`: *Always* for CPU-bound operations.
            *   `Schedulers.single()`: For sequential execution requirements.
            *   Custom Schedulers: Define custom thread pools with appropriate, limited sizes for specific, well-defined tasks.
        *   **Prohibit `Schedulers.io()` for CPU-Bound Tasks:** Enforce a strict code review policy and potentially static analysis rules to prevent the misuse of `Schedulers.io()`.
        *   **Concurrency Limits:** Use operators like `flatMap` with a `maxConcurrency` parameter to strictly control the number of concurrent subscriptions.
        *   **Thread Pool Monitoring:** Implement monitoring of thread pool usage and enforce hard limits to prevent exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service via Long-Running Operations](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_via_long-running_operations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits RxJava operations that take a long time to complete (without timeouts), tying up resources.
    *   **RxJava Contribution:** RxJava streams can easily encapsulate long-running operations; the absence of timeouts makes them vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker sends a request that triggers an `Observable` making a network call to a malicious server, which intentionally delays the response indefinitely.
    *   **Impact:**  Resource exhaustion, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Timeouts:**  Enforce the use of the `timeout()` operator on *any* `Observable` or `Flowable` that involves a potentially long-running operation (especially network calls).  Set reasonable, context-specific timeout durations.
        *   **Retry Logic with Limits and Backoff:** If retries are necessary, use `retry()` *judiciously* with a strictly limited number of retries and a backoff strategy to avoid exacerbating DoS conditions.
        *   **Circuit Breaker Pattern (Consider):** Evaluate the use of a circuit breaker pattern (often implemented with external libraries) to prevent repeated calls to failing services, providing resilience.

## Attack Surface: [Logic Errors due to Concurrency Issues](./attack_surfaces/logic_errors_due_to_concurrency_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Race conditions and data corruption due to improper handling of shared mutable state within concurrent RxJava streams.
    *   **RxJava Contribution:** RxJava's asynchronous nature necessitates careful management of shared state to avoid concurrency problems.
    *   **Example:** Multiple subscribers to an `Observable` modify a shared mutable data structure (e.g., a `List`) without any synchronization, leading to data inconsistencies.
    *   **Impact:**  Data corruption, unpredictable application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities (depending on the data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immutability First:** Prioritize immutable data structures and functional programming principles to eliminate shared mutable state whenever possible.
        *   **Strict Synchronization:** If shared mutable state is *unavoidable*, use appropriate synchronization:
            *   `synchronized` blocks or methods.
            *   Atomic variables (e.g., `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`).
            *   Concurrent data structures (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`).
        *   **Controlled `observeOn` and `subscribeOn`:** Use these operators carefully to manage which threads access shared state, and consider `serialize()` to enforce sequential processing of emissions if necessary.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Enforce thorough code reviews with a specific focus on identifying and mitigating potential concurrency issues.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Errors and Application Crashes](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_errors_and_application_crashes.md)

*   **Description:**  Errors within RxJava streams are not handled, leading to application crashes or inconsistent states.
    *   **RxJava Contribution:** RxJava requires explicit error handling; unhandled errors can terminate the stream and potentially the application.
    *   **Example:** An `Observable` making a network request encounters an error, but no `onError` handler is provided, causing the application to crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, data inconsistency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory `onError` Handlers:** Enforce the presence of an `onError` handler in *all* subscriptions (e.g., `subscribe(onNext, onError, onComplete)`).
        *   **Comprehensive Error Handling Operators:** Utilize a range of error handling operators:
            *   `onErrorResumeNext`: Switch to a fallback `Observable`.
            *   `onErrorReturnItem`: Emit a default value.
            *   `retry` (with caution and limits): Retry the operation.
            *   `doOnError`: Perform a side effect (e.g., logging).
        *   **Centralized Error Handling:** Implement a centralized error handling strategy for RxJava streams to ensure consistent error management.
        *   **Robust Logging:** Log all errors with sufficient detail (including stack traces) for effective debugging and monitoring.
