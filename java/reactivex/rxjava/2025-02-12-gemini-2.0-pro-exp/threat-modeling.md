# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxjava

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Observable Emission Flood (DoS)](./threats/uncontrolled_observable_emission_flood__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Uncontrolled Observable Emission Flood (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers an event source connected to an RxJava `Observable`. The attacker sends a massive number of events or data faster than downstream components can process, overwhelming the system due to a lack of backpressure handling *within the RxJava pipeline*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, threads, network connections). Other legitimate users are unable to use the application.
    *   **Affected RxJava Component:** `Observable` creation (e.g., `Observable.create()`, `Observable.fromPublisher()`, event listener integrations), operators lacking backpressure support (e.g., missing `onBackpressureXXX` operators).  The core issue is the *misuse or absence* of RxJava's backpressure mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement backpressure handling: Use operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`, or `throttleLatest` to control the flow of data *within the RxJava stream*.
        *   Use `Flowable` instead of `Observable` when backpressure is required. `Flowable` is designed for backpressure.
        *   Limit the rate of event generation at the source *if controllable and part of the RxJava integration* (e.g., a custom `Observable` source).
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization *within the RxJava pipeline* to prevent malicious input from triggering excessive emissions.
        *   Monitor resource usage and set alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Subscription Leak (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/subscription_leak__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Threat:** Subscription Leak (Resource Exhaustion)

    *   **Description:** A logic error *within the RxJava subscription management* prevents `Disposable.dispose()` from being called on an RxJava subscription. The subscription remains active, consuming resources even though it's no longer needed. Repeated occurrences lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:** Gradual resource exhaustion (memory leaks, thread leaks), leading to performance degradation and eventual application instability or crashes.
    *   **Affected RxJava Component:** `Subscription` / `Disposable` management. Any component that creates subscriptions (e.g., `subscribe()`, `subscribeWith()`) *and fails to manage their lifecycle correctly*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always call `dispose()` on `Disposable` objects when the subscription is no longer needed.
        *   Use `CompositeDisposable` to manage multiple subscriptions and dispose of them together.
        *   Use lifecycle-aware components (if applicable) to automatically manage subscriptions based on component lifecycle events, *ensuring correct integration with RxJava*.
        *   Use operators like `takeUntil`, `takeWhile`, or `using` to automatically dispose of subscriptions based on specific conditions.
        *   Use static analysis tools or code reviews to identify potential subscription leaks *specifically within RxJava usage*.

## Threat: [Unbounded Thread Pool Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/unbounded_thread_pool_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unbounded Thread Pool Exhaustion (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers many concurrent operations scheduled on RxJava's default `Schedulers.computation()` or `Schedulers.io()` *without any limits imposed by the RxJava pipeline*. This creates an excessive number of threads, consuming system resources and causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to thread exhaustion. The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
    *   **Affected RxJava Component:** `Schedulers.computation()`, `Schedulers.io()`, operators that use these schedulers implicitly (e.g., `subscribeOn`, `observeOn`), and *failure to use custom, bounded Schedulers*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use bounded thread pools: Create custom schedulers with limited thread pools using `Schedulers.from(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n))`.        
        *   Carefully control the concurrency level using operators like `flatMap` with a `maxConcurrency` parameter *within the RxJava chain*.
        *   Implement timeouts and retries with appropriate backoff strategies *within the RxJava pipeline* to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        *   Monitor thread usage and set alerts for excessive thread creation.

## Threat: [Race Condition in Shared Mutable State (within RxJava Streams)](./threats/race_condition_in_shared_mutable_state__within_rxjava_streams_.md)

*   **Threat:** Race Condition in Shared Mutable State (within RxJava Streams)

    *   **Description:** Multiple RxJava streams (or different parts of the same stream) access and modify shared mutable data *without proper synchronization mechanisms provided by or used in conjunction with RxJava*. The attacker manipulates the timing of events to cause inconsistent data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or incorrect business logic execution.
    *   **Affected RxJava Component:** Any operator that accesses or modifies shared mutable state, especially when used with `observeOn` or `subscribeOn` to switch threads. Custom operators are particularly susceptible *if they don't handle concurrency correctly*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Prefer immutable data structures whenever possible *within the RxJava pipeline*.
        *   Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms: `synchronized` blocks, `AtomicReference`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, or other thread-safe data structures *when interacting with shared state from within RxJava operators*.
        *   Carefully review the thread safety of any custom operators.
        *   Use tools that can detect race conditions during testing.

## Threat: [Unhandled Exception Leading to Crash (within RxJava)](./threats/unhandled_exception_leading_to_crash__within_rxjava_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unhandled Exception Leading to Crash (within RxJava)

    *   **Description:** An operation *within an RxJava stream* throws an exception. The stream lacks an `onError` handler, causing the exception to propagate and potentially crash the application.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service.
    *   **Affected RxJava Component:** `subscribe()` method (without an `onError` handler), any operator that can throw an exception *and is not handled within the RxJava pipeline*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always provide an `onError` handler in every `subscribe()` call.
        *   Use operators like `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResumeNext`, or `retry` to handle errors *within the stream itself*.
        *   Implement a global error handler using `RxJavaPlugins.setErrorHandler` to catch any unhandled exceptions *that escape the RxJava streams*.
        *   Use try-catch blocks within operators and propagate exceptions using `onError`.

## Threat: [Deadlock due to Blocking Operations (within RxJava)](./threats/deadlock_due_to_blocking_operations__within_rxjava_.md)

*   **Threat:** Deadlock due to Blocking Operations (within RxJava)

    *   **Description:** Improper use of blocking operations (like `blockingSubscribe`, `blockingFirst`) or incorrect synchronization *within an RxJava stream* leads to a deadlock. This is often exacerbated by limited thread pools.
    *   **Impact:** Application hangs or becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Affected RxJava Component:** `blockingSubscribe`, `blockingFirst`, `blockingIterable`, `blockingLatest`, `blockingMostRecent`, `blockingNext`, any custom operator that uses blocking operations or incorrect synchronization *within the RxJava context*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using blocking operations within RxJava streams whenever possible. Use asynchronous alternatives provided by RxJava.
        *   If blocking operations are unavoidable, execute them on a dedicated, bounded thread pool *managed in conjunction with the RxJava pipeline*.
        *   Use timeouts with blocking operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   Carefully analyze the dependencies between `Observable` streams to identify and eliminate potential circular dependencies that could lead to deadlocks *within the RxJava logic*.
