# BUSINESS POSTURE

The RxJava project is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It provides a reactive programming paradigm that simplifies the development of concurrent and distributed systems.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Enable developers to build responsive and efficient applications.
  - Simplify the handling of asynchronous operations and event streams.
  - Improve code maintainability and readability for complex asynchronous logic.
  - Facilitate the development of reactive systems that can handle backpressure and concurrency effectively.

- Most important business risks:
  - Dependency vulnerabilities: As a library, RxJava is a dependency for other projects. Vulnerabilities in RxJava can impact all dependent applications.
  - Performance bottlenecks: Incorrect usage of RxJava can lead to performance issues, such as memory leaks or excessive resource consumption, impacting application stability and responsiveness.
  - Integration complexity: Integrating RxJava into existing projects might introduce complexity and require developers to learn a new programming paradigm, potentially leading to errors and delays.
  - Compatibility issues: Upgrades to RxJava versions might introduce breaking changes, requiring refactoring of dependent applications and potentially causing compatibility issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Open Source Community Review - The project is open source and benefits from community review, which can help identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented through public code repository and contribution process.
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Developers using RxJava are expected to perform dependency scanning on their projects, which would include RxJava as a dependency. Implemented by developers using dependency scanning tools in their projects.
  - security control: Static Analysis - Developers using RxJava are expected to perform static analysis on their projects, which would include code that uses RxJava. Implemented by developers using static analysis tools in their projects.

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security - Security relies heavily on the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities. There is a risk that vulnerabilities might be discovered and exploited before a patch is available.
  - accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities - RxJava itself depends on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these transitive dependencies could indirectly affect RxJava and dependent applications.
  - accepted risk: Misuse by Developers - Developers might misuse RxJava APIs in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities in their applications, such as improper handling of errors or uncontrolled resource consumption.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning in the RxJava project's CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the RxJava codebase by security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities that might not be caught by community review or automated tools.
  - security control: Security Guidelines for Users - Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using RxJava to help them avoid common security pitfalls and use the library securely.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to provide a channel for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly and to manage the vulnerability patching process effectively.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable to RxJava library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use RxJava.
  - Authorization: Not applicable to RxJava library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use RxJava.
  - Input validation: RxJava should handle inputs robustly and avoid vulnerabilities related to input manipulation. Input validation within RxJava itself is limited as it primarily processes data streams provided by the application. Applications using RxJava must perform input validation at the application level before data enters RxJava streams.
  - Cryptography: RxJava itself does not provide cryptographic functionalities. If applications using RxJava require cryptography, they should use dedicated cryptography libraries and ensure proper key management and secure implementation.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
  - For RxJava itself, the critical process is maintaining the integrity and availability of the library for the open-source community and dependent projects.
  - For applications using RxJava, the critical business processes are application-specific and depend on the functionality of those applications. RxJava is used to enhance the reliability and responsiveness of these processes.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - RxJava library code itself is public and open source. The primary data to protect is the integrity of the library releases and the build process to prevent supply chain attacks.
  - Applications using RxJava will handle various types of data depending on their purpose. The sensitivity of this data is application-specific and needs to be assessed in the context of those applications. RxJava itself does not directly handle or store sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the typical use cases and application domains where RxJava is commonly used? Understanding the common use cases will help tailor security recommendations.
  - What are the common security concerns and attack vectors that are relevant to applications using reactive programming libraries like RxJava?
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements that applications using RxJava might need to adhere to?

- Assumptions:
  - RxJava is primarily used as a library in other Java applications and is not deployed as a standalone service.
  - Security is a shared responsibility. While the RxJava project focuses on the security of the library itself, applications using RxJava are responsible for their own application-level security.
  - Developers using RxJava are expected to have a basic understanding of reactive programming principles and secure coding practices.
  - The deployment environment for applications using RxJava can vary widely, from on-premises data centers to cloud environments. The deployment diagram provided is a representative example of a cloud-based deployment.
