# Threat Model Analysis for reactivex/rxjava

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Parallelism leading to Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/uncontrolled_parallelism_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger actions that cause the application to create an excessive number of parallel RxJava streams or tasks, for example, by sending a large volume of requests processed using `flatMap` without proper concurrency control. This overwhelms system resources (CPU, memory, threads).
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to resource exhaustion, leading to Denial of Service for legitimate users.
    *   **RxJava Component Affected:** `flatMap`, `parallel`, Schedulers (e.g., `computation()`, `io()`, `newThread()`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure schedulers with bounded thread pools.
        *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to control data processing rate.
        *   Use operators like `concatMap` or `switchMap` when parallelism is not essential.
        *   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests to control the volume of processed data.
        *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, thread count) and set up alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Race Conditions and Data Corruption due to Shared Mutable State](./threats/race_conditions_and_data_corruption_due_to_shared_mutable_state.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit race conditions in RxJava streams that access shared mutable state concurrently. By sending carefully timed requests or inputs, they could manipulate the execution order and cause data corruption or inconsistent application state. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential data leaks, authorization bypasses if data integrity is crucial for security decisions.
    *   **RxJava Component Affected:** Operators and Observers accessing shared mutable state, Schedulers facilitating concurrency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Favor immutability and functional programming principles within RxJava streams.
        *   If mutable state is necessary, use thread-safe data structures or explicit synchronization mechanisms (locks, atomic variables) within operators and observers.
        *   Conduct thorough concurrency testing, including race condition detection tools, to identify and fix potential issues.
        *   Implement unit tests that specifically target concurrent execution paths and data integrity.

## Threat: [Ignoring Backpressure leading to Buffer Overflow and Memory Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/ignoring_backpressure_leading_to_buffer_overflow_and_memory_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could overwhelm the application by sending a high volume of data to an RxJava stream that is not properly handling backpressure. If backpressure is ignored, unbounded buffers can grow indefinitely, leading to memory exhaustion and application crash.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes due to OutOfMemoryError, becomes unresponsive, leading to Denial of Service.
    *   **RxJava Component Affected:** Backpressure mechanisms (`onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`), Operators that buffer data (e.g., `buffer`, `window`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement appropriate backpressure strategies using RxJava operators like `onBackpressureBuffer`, `onBackpressureDrop`, `onBackpressureLatest`, or custom backpressure handling.
        *   Choose backpressure strategies that align with the application's requirements and resource constraints.
        *   Monitor buffer sizes and memory usage to detect potential backpressure issues.
        *   Implement rate limiting on data producers to control the input rate.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in RxJava Library or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_rxjava_library_or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Security vulnerabilities might be discovered in the RxJava library itself or in its transitive dependencies. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of RxJava to compromise the application. This could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, Denial of Service, information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **RxJava Component Affected:** RxJava library itself, transitive dependencies of RxJava.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for DoS or Information Disclosure)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep RxJava library and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub security advisories) for RxJava and its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to automatically identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for promptly patching or upgrading dependencies when vulnerabilities are discovered.
