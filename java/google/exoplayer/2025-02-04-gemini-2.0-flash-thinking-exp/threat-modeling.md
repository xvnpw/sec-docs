# Threat Model Analysis for google/exoplayer

## Threat: [Malformed Media File Exploitation](./threats/malformed_media_file_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious media file (audio, video, subtitles, manifest) specifically designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities within **ExoPlayer's** media parsing components. When **ExoPlayer** attempts to parse and play this file, it can trigger buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other memory safety issues. This could lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution within the context of the application using **ExoPlayer**.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **ExoPlayer Component Affected:** Media Parsers (e.g., `Mp4Extractor`, `TsExtractor`, `WebmExtractor`), Demuxers, Sample Queues within **ExoPlayer core modules**.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep **ExoPlayer** updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization of media sources *before* passing them to **ExoPlayer**.
    *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for media processing to limit the impact of potential exploits.

## Threat: [Codec Vulnerabilities Exploited via ExoPlayer](./threats/codec_vulnerabilities_exploited_via_exoplayer.md)

*   **Description:** **ExoPlayer** relies on underlying media codecs (both software and hardware) provided by the operating system or device.  Known vulnerabilities in these codecs can be indirectly exploited through **ExoPlayer**. An attacker can provide media encoded with a vulnerable codec that, when processed by **ExoPlayer** using the vulnerable codec, triggers memory corruption or other issues. This can lead to application crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution through the codec execution within the application using **ExoPlayer**.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **ExoPlayer Component Affected:** Codec renderers (e.g., `MediaCodecVideoRenderer`, `MediaCodecAudioRenderer`) within **ExoPlayer renderers module**, indirectly affecting underlying codec libraries used by the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific codec vulnerability severity).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the underlying operating system and device firmware are updated to patch codec vulnerabilities, as **ExoPlayer** relies on system codecs.
    *   Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in common media codecs used by the target platforms.
    *   While less direct mitigation within **ExoPlayer** itself, limiting supported codecs in the application (if feasible) can reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Subtitle Processing Vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer](./threats/subtitle_processing_vulnerabilities_in_exoplayer.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious subtitle files (e.g., SRT, WebVTT) to exploit parsing flaws specifically within **ExoPlayer's** subtitle rendering engine. When **ExoPlayer** processes these malicious subtitles, it can lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or logic errors in the subtitle parsing and rendering components. This could result in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if subtitles are rendered in a web context via **ExoPlayer**, Denial of Service, or unexpected application behavior.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (in web contexts), Denial of Service (DoS), unexpected application behavior.
*   **ExoPlayer Component Affected:** Subtitle Renderers (e.g., `TextRenderer`) and Subtitle Parsers (e.g., `SrtParser`, `WebvttParser`) within **ExoPlayer text module**.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and validate subtitle files *before* processing them with **ExoPlayer** to remove potentially malicious content.
    *   Consider using a more secure or simpler subtitle rendering approach if the application's requirements allow.

## Threat: [DRM Bypassing or Weaknesses in ExoPlayer's DRM Implementation](./threats/drm_bypassing_or_weaknesses_in_exoplayer's_drm_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers may discover and exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in **ExoPlayer's** Digital Rights Management (DRM) implementation or its integration with underlying DRM systems (like Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay). This could allow attackers to bypass content protection mechanisms within **ExoPlayer**, enabling unauthorized access to premium or protected media content. This bypass could be due to flaws in **ExoPlayer's** DRM handling logic, license acquisition process, or interaction with the DRM framework.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to premium content, copyright infringement, revenue loss for content providers.
*   **ExoPlayer Component Affected:** DRM modules (e.g., `DefaultDrmSessionManager`, `FrameworkMediaDrm`) and DRM scheme implementations (Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay) within **ExoPlayer DRM module**.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong and reputable DRM systems and ensure they are correctly integrated with **ExoPlayer**.
    *   Keep **ExoPlayer** and its DRM related components updated to benefit from security fixes and improvements in DRM handling.
    *   Regularly review and test the DRM integration within your application and **ExoPlayer** for potential weaknesses or misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer Dependencies (High/Critical Severity)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_exoplayer_dependencies__highcritical_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** **ExoPlayer** relies on various third-party libraries and components. If any of these dependencies have high or critical severity security vulnerabilities, they can indirectly affect applications using **ExoPlayer**. Attackers could exploit these dependency vulnerabilities through **ExoPlayer's** usage of the vulnerable component, potentially leading to a range of impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, including Denial of Service or Remote Code Execution within the application using **ExoPlayer**.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability - could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution.
*   **ExoPlayer Component Affected:** **ExoPlayer core** and any module that depends on the vulnerable third-party library. This is not a specific **ExoPlayer** module, but rather the overall **ExoPlayer** library and its ecosystem.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Critically important:** Keep **ExoPlayer** updated to the latest version. Updates often include fixes for vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
    *   Proactively monitor security advisories for **ExoPlayer** and its known dependencies.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools in your development pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including those used by **ExoPlayer**, and update accordingly.
