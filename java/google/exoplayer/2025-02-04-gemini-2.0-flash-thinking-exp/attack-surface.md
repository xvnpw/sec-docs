## Attack Surface: [Crafted Media Files (Format Parsing Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/crafted_media_files__format_parsing_vulnerabilities_.md)

### 1. Crafted Media Files (Format Parsing Vulnerabilities)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's media format parsers by providing specially crafted media files designed to trigger parsing errors and potentially lead to memory corruption or code execution.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer's core functionality relies on parsing various media formats (MP4, MPEG-TS, HLS, DASH, etc.). Vulnerabilities within these parsers are inherent to ExoPlayer's design and processing of media data.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious MP4 file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in ExoPlayer's MP4 parser. When ExoPlayer attempts to play this file, it leads to memory corruption, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Memory Corruption, Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  **Crucially important.** Keep ExoPlayer updated to the latest version. Google actively patches parser vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer releases.
    *   **Content Source Control:** Limit media playback to trusted and controlled sources. Avoid playing media from untrusted user uploads or unknown origins where malicious crafting is more likely.
    *   **Sandboxing (OS Level):** Utilize OS-level sandboxing features to limit the potential damage if a parser vulnerability is exploited within ExoPlayer.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Subtitle Files (Subtitle Parsing Vulnerabilities - Memory Corruption)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_subtitle_files__subtitle_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_memory_corruption_.md)

### 2. Malicious Subtitle Files (Subtitle Parsing Vulnerabilities - Memory Corruption)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's subtitle parsers by providing crafted subtitle files that trigger parsing errors leading to memory corruption.  Focus is on memory corruption as the high severity impact.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer handles parsing and rendering of various subtitle formats (SRT, VTT, TTML, etc.).  Vulnerabilities in these subtitle parsers are part of ExoPlayer's subtitle processing functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious SRT subtitle file with excessively long lines or format string exploits that trigger a buffer overflow in ExoPlayer's SRT parser. Parsing this subtitle leads to memory corruption and potentially DoS or further exploitation.
*   **Impact:** Memory Corruption, Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep ExoPlayer updated to benefit from subtitle parser vulnerability fixes.
    *   **Content Source Control:** Use subtitles from trusted sources.
    *   **Subtitle Sanitization (Limited Effectiveness):** While complex, some basic sanitization of subtitle files might offer marginal benefit, but robust parsing vulnerability mitigation relies on ExoPlayer updates.

## Attack Surface: [Playlist Manipulation (HLS, DASH - Content Injection/Redirection)](./attack_surfaces/playlist_manipulation__hls__dash_-_content_injectionredirection_.md)

### 3. Playlist Manipulation (HLS, DASH - Content Injection/Redirection)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities by manipulating or injecting malicious content into streaming playlists (HLS, DASH manifests) that ExoPlayer processes, leading to the playback of attacker-controlled media.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer directly fetches and processes HLS and DASH playlists to manage adaptive streaming. If playlist sources are not secured, attackers can manipulate them and ExoPlayer will follow the modified instructions.
*   **Example:** An attacker, through a Man-in-the-Middle attack or by compromising a playlist server, modifies an HLS playlist to replace URLs of legitimate media segments with URLs pointing to malicious media files hosted on an attacker-controlled server. ExoPlayer, processing the altered playlist, fetches and plays the malicious content.
*   **Impact:** Content Injection/Substitution, Redirection to Malicious Media Servers, potentially leading to malware delivery or phishing if malicious media is crafted accordingly.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS for Playlists:** **Mandatory.** Always fetch playlists over HTTPS to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks and playlist manipulation during transit.
    *   **Playlist Integrity Checks (Advanced):**  Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of playlists, such as digital signatures or checksums if the infrastructure allows.
    *   **Content Source Control:** Obtain playlists from trusted and controlled sources and servers.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_exoplayer_dependencies.md)

### 4. Vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer Dependencies

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities present in third-party libraries and components that ExoPlayer directly depends upon for its functionality.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer relies on external libraries (e.g., Android MediaCodec, potentially others for specific format support). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact ExoPlayer's security as they are part of its runtime environment.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the Android MediaCodec library used by ExoPlayer for video decoding. This vulnerability can be triggered by crafted media content processed by ExoPlayer, potentially leading to remote code execution within the application context.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Memory Corruption, Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** **Essential.** Keep ExoPlayer updated. ExoPlayer updates include updates to its dependencies, incorporating critical security patches from underlying libraries.
    *   **Dependency Monitoring (Development Process):**  Implement dependency scanning tools in the development process to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's dependencies and trigger updates.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure ExoPlayer Configuration (Disabling Security Features)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_exoplayer_configuration__disabling_security_features_.md)

### 5. Insecure ExoPlayer Configuration (Disabling Security Features)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguring ExoPlayer settings in a way that explicitly disables or weakens built-in security features, making the application more vulnerable.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer offers configuration options that, if misused, can reduce security.  Specifically, disabling features like HTTPS enforcement or certificate validation directly impacts ExoPlayer's secure operation.
*   **Example:** A developer, perhaps for testing purposes or due to misunderstanding, disables certificate validation for HTTPS connections in ExoPlayer's configuration. This makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, negating the security benefits of using HTTPS URLs for media.
*   **Impact:** Weakened Security Posture, Increased Vulnerability to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, potential for content injection or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Review:**  Thoroughly review ExoPlayer configuration settings before deployment. Ensure security-related features like HTTPS enforcement and certificate validation are enabled and correctly configured for production environments.
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to documented security best practices for ExoPlayer configuration. Avoid disabling security features without a very strong and well-understood reason.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews of ExoPlayer initialization and configuration code to identify and correct any insecure settings.
