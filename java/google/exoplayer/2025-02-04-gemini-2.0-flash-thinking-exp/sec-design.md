# BUSINESS POSTURE

The ExoPlayer project is an open-source media player library for Android. Its primary business goal is to provide a flexible, extensible, and feature-rich alternative to Android's MediaPlayer API.  It aims to empower Android developers to build robust media playback experiences in their applications, supporting a wide range of audio and video formats and streaming protocols.

Business priorities for ExoPlayer include:
- Feature completeness: Supporting a wide array of media formats, streaming protocols, and playback features (e.g., adaptive streaming, DRM, subtitles).
- Performance and efficiency: Ensuring smooth and efficient playback across a range of Android devices.
- Extensibility and customization: Allowing developers to customize and extend the player to meet specific application needs.
- Community adoption: Fostering a strong community of users and contributors to ensure the library remains actively maintained and improved.

Key business risks associated with ExoPlayer include:
- Software defects: Bugs in the library could lead to application crashes, poor user experience, and negative perception of applications using ExoPlayer.
- Security vulnerabilities: Security flaws in ExoPlayer could be exploited by malicious media content, potentially leading to device compromise or data breaches in applications using the library. This is a significant risk as media players process untrusted data.
- Compatibility issues: Incompatibility with certain Android devices or versions could limit the reach and usability of applications using ExoPlayer.
- Licensing and legal risks:  Dependencies or included components might have licensing restrictions that could impact the usage and distribution of ExoPlayer and applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

security control: Use of GitHub for source code management, providing version control and transparency. Implemented: GitHub repository.
security control: Open-source project, allowing for community security review. Implemented: GitHub repository, open development model.
security control: Google's involvement and maintenance, suggesting internal security practices and reviews are likely in place. Implemented: Google's development processes.

accepted risk:  Being a media player library, ExoPlayer inherently processes untrusted media content from various sources. The risk of encountering malicious or malformed media that could exploit vulnerabilities is always present.
accepted risk:  Reliance on underlying Android platform security. Vulnerabilities in the Android OS or media frameworks could indirectly affect ExoPlayer.

recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline, including SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and dependency vulnerability scanning.
recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, focusing on media parsing and playback functionalities.
recommended security control: Implement fuzzing techniques to test media parsing robustness against malformed or malicious media files.
recommended security control:  Maintain a security vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle reported security issues effectively.

Security Requirements:

Authentication:
- Not directly applicable to ExoPlayer library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using ExoPlayer to secure access to media sources if needed.

Authorization:
- Not directly applicable to ExoPlayer library itself. Authorization for accessing media content is the responsibility of the application using ExoPlayer. ExoPlayer should respect authorization decisions made by the application.

Input Validation:
- Critical for ExoPlayer.  ExoPlayer must perform robust input validation on all media data it processes to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, and other memory corruption issues. This includes validating media container formats, codecs, and metadata.
- Input validation should be applied at all stages of media processing, from parsing the container format to decoding individual media samples.

Cryptography:
- Relevant for DRM (Digital Rights Management) and secure streaming protocols (e.g., HLS with encryption, DASH with encryption).
- ExoPlayer should correctly implement and utilize cryptographic libraries and APIs provided by the Android platform for DRM and secure streaming.
- Ensure proper handling of encryption keys and secure key storage mechanisms as per DRM provider requirements.
- For secure streaming, ensure proper implementation of TLS/HTTPS for communication with media servers.
