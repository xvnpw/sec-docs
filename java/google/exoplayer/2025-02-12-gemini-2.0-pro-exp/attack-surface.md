# Attack Surface Analysis for google/exoplayer

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Media Sources](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_media_sources.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows playback of media from sources that are not fully trusted or controlled. This leverages ExoPlayer's parsing and decoding capabilities, making it the primary target.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer's core function is to parse and decode media from various sources (network, local files, etc.).  It provides the *mechanisms* (parsers, decoders, network stack) that are directly exploited by malicious input. This is *direct* involvement.
*   **Example:** A user provides a URL to a crafted MP4 file designed to exploit a buffer overflow in ExoPlayer's MP4 parser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Information Disclosure
    *   Content Spoofing
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Source Whitelist:** Implement a whitelist of *only* trusted media sources.  *Never* allow arbitrary user-provided URLs.
    *   **Input Validation (if user input is unavoidable):** If user input *must* be accepted, implement *extremely* strict validation:
        *   **Protocol Validation:** Enforce HTTPS *only*.
        *   **Domain Validation:** Check against a whitelist.
        *   **Path Validation:** Ensure the path conforms to expected patterns (using a carefully crafted regular expression *as a supplementary check*).
        *   **Content Type Validation:** Verify the `Content-Type` header.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict media source domains.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Run ExoPlayer in an isolated process or sandbox.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep ExoPlayer updated.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Codecs and Parsers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_codecs_and_parsers.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits targeting vulnerabilities within ExoPlayer's internal parsers or the platform codecs that ExoPlayer utilizes for media decoding.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer *directly* uses and manages these codecs and parsers. While some codecs are platform-provided, ExoPlayer's code interacts with them and handles the data flow.  Vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's *own* parsers (e.g., for container formats like MP4, Matroska) are a direct concern.
*   **Example:** A legitimate-looking MP4 file from a trusted source triggers a vulnerability in the platform's H.264 decoder (used by ExoPlayer) or in ExoPlayer's own MP4 parser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Information Disclosure
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep ExoPlayer Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation. ExoPlayer updates include security fixes for its own components and often address issues related to platform codec interactions.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer and related components.
    *   **Codec Selection (Limited Control):** If possible (and it often isn't), prefer more secure codecs.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Codecs/Features:** If your application only needs to support a limited set of formats, consider disabling support for unnecessary codecs and features within ExoPlayer.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks during Streaming](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_during_streaming.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker intercepts and modifies the network communication between the application and the media server, specifically targeting the media stream or manifest files that ExoPlayer is fetching.
*   **ExoPlayer Contribution:** ExoPlayer *directly* handles the network communication for streaming media (HTTP, HTTPS, DASH, HLS). It's responsible for fetching manifests and media segments.  The attack exploits ExoPlayer's network handling.
*   **Example:** The application streams video over HTTP (insecure). An attacker intercepts the traffic and replaces a video segment with a malicious one, which is then processed by ExoPlayer.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Content Spoofing
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:** *Always* use HTTPS for all media streaming and manifest retrieval.
    *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning to add an extra layer of protection.
