## DEPLOYMENT

ExoPlayer is a library, not a standalone application. Therefore, it doesn't have its own deployment process in the traditional sense. Instead, it's included as a dependency in other Android applications. The deployment of an application using ExoPlayer typically involves the following:

Possible deployment solutions:

1.  **Standard Android Application Deployment:** The most common scenario. The application is built into an APK or AAB file and distributed through the Google Play Store or other distribution channels.
2.  **Instant App Deployment:** ExoPlayer can be used within Android Instant Apps, which are small, lightweight versions of apps that can be run without installation.
3.  **Embedded Systems:** While less common, ExoPlayer could potentially be used in embedded Android systems, such as smart TVs or set-top boxes.

Chosen deployment solution (Standard Android Application Deployment):
