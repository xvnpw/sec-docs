## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ExoPlayer Implementation/Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_exoplayer_implementationconfiguration.md)

  *   **Insecure Deserialization**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how ExoPlayer or its extensions deserialize data from untrusted sources. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Conditional on custom `DataSource` or extensions)
        *   **Impact:** High (Potential for RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Use safe deserialization practices; avoid deserializing untrusted data; use allowlists for classes.

        *   **[***Custom DataSource***]**
            *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within a custom `DataSource` implementation provided by the application. This is not an ExoPlayer bug, but a consequence of extending it.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on custom code quality)
            *   **Impact:** High (Potential for RCE, data exfiltration, etc.)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous code review, testing, and security audits of the custom `DataSource`.

        *   **[***Untrusted DataSource***]**
            *   **Description:** The application uses a `DataSource` that fetches data from a user-controlled or otherwise untrusted source (e.g., a URL provided by the user).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If the application allows untrusted input)
            *   **Impact:** High (Attacker controls input to ExoPlayer)
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:** Strict input validation; avoid using user-provided URLs directly; use a whitelist of trusted sources.

    *   **[***Vulnerable Dependencies***]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that ExoPlayer depends on (e.g., for networking, media decoding).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Wide range of impacts, including RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low to High (Depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to High (Depends on the vulnerability)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep all dependencies updated to the latest versions; use vulnerability scanners.

        *   **[***Outdated Component***]**
            *   **Description:** Using an old version of ExoPlayer or one of its dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on update practices)
            *   **Impact:** High (Known vulnerabilities are easily exploited)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
            *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update ExoPlayer and all dependencies; use automated dependency management tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***Exploit Media Stream Content/Format***]](./attack_tree_paths/_exploit_media_stream_contentformat_.md)

    *   **[***DoS via Crafted Stream***]**
        *   **Description:** Attacking service availability by providing a stream designed to cause excessive resource consumption or other disruptive behavior.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Service disruption)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement resource limits, rate limiting, and robust error handling; validate manifests.

        *   **[***Oversized Segments***]**
            *   **Description:** Providing media segments that are excessively large, leading to memory exhaustion and a denial-of-service.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Medium (DoS)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:** Enforce limits on segment size; monitor memory usage; implement robust error handling.
