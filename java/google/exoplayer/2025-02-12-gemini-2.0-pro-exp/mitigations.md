## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Custom Components (within ExoPlayer)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_custom_components__within_exoplayer_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Custom Component Implementation within ExoPlayer.

**Description:**
1.  **Design Review (ExoPlayer Context):** When designing custom `DataSource`, `Renderer`, `Extractor`, or other ExoPlayer components, specifically consider how they handle data provided by ExoPlayer and how they interact with other ExoPlayer components.
2.  **Secure Coding (ExoPlayer Context):**  Within the custom component's code, be mindful of ExoPlayer's internal data structures and APIs. Avoid making assumptions about the data provided by ExoPlayer.
3.  **Input Validation (ExoPlayer Context):** Validate data received *from* other ExoPlayer components or from within the ExoPlayer framework.  For example, a custom `Renderer` should validate the format and size of the data it receives from the `MediaCodec` before processing it.
4.  **Least Privilege (ExoPlayer Context):**  Ensure the custom component only interacts with the necessary ExoPlayer APIs and data. Avoid accessing or modifying internal ExoPlayer state unnecessarily.
5.  **Code Review (ExoPlayer Focus):** During code review, pay close attention to how the custom component interacts with ExoPlayer's APIs and data structures. Look for potential vulnerabilities related to ExoPlayer's internal workings.
6.  **Fuzz Testing (ExoPlayer Integration):**  Fuzz test the custom component *in the context of* a running ExoPlayer instance.  This means providing fuzzed data through ExoPlayer's standard input mechanisms (e.g., a fuzzed `DataSource`) to see how the custom component handles it.
7. **Sandboxing (Limited Applicability):** Sandboxing is generally *not* directly controllable *within* ExoPlayer itself. This is an OS-level concern. However, be aware of the process context in which your custom component runs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (via ExoPlayer) (Severity: High):** Prevents vulnerabilities in custom components from being exploited through malicious data provided *by* ExoPlayer.
*   **Buffer Overflows (within ExoPlayer context) (Severity: High):** Prevents buffer overflows within the custom component that are triggered by data from ExoPlayer.
*   **ExoPlayer Internal State Corruption (Severity: High):** Prevents a compromised custom component from corrupting ExoPlayer's internal state, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection (via ExoPlayer):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Buffer Overflows (within ExoPlayer context):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **ExoPlayer Internal State Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Code reviews are conducted, but fuzz testing specifically targeting ExoPlayer integration is not.

**Missing Implementation:** Fuzz testing integrated with ExoPlayer.  More rigorous code review focusing on ExoPlayer interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [DRM Configuration (within ExoPlayer)](./mitigation_strategies/drm_configuration__within_exoplayer_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure ExoPlayer DRM Configuration.

**Description:**
1.  **`MediaDrmCallback` Implementation:** Implement a secure `MediaDrmCallback` to handle communication with the DRM license server.  Ensure this callback uses HTTPS and validates the server's certificate.
2.  **Key System Selection:** Choose the appropriate DRM key system (e.g., Widevine, PlayReady) based on your content protection requirements and platform support. Use ExoPlayer's APIs to configure the selected key system.
3.  **Robust Error Handling:**  Handle DRM errors gracefully within ExoPlayer.  Do not expose sensitive information in error messages.  Implement appropriate retry mechanisms.
4.  **`DefaultDrmSessionManager` Configuration:** Configure the `DefaultDrmSessionManager` (or your custom `DrmSessionManager`) securely.  Set appropriate timeouts and retry policies.
5. **Offline Playback (if applicable):** If supporting offline playback, securely store offline licenses using ExoPlayer's offline DRM APIs. Ensure the licenses are protected from unauthorized access.
6. **ClearKey Handling (Testing Only):** If using ClearKey for testing, *never* use it in a production environment.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **DRM Circumvention (via ExoPlayer configuration) (Severity: High):**  Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting misconfigurations in ExoPlayer's DRM setup.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (on License Requests) (Severity: High):**  Ensures secure communication with the license server through the `MediaDrmCallback`.
*   **Offline License Theft (Severity: High):** Protects offline licenses from being stolen or misused.

**Impact:**
*   **DRM Circumvention (via ExoPlayer configuration):** Risk reduced.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (on License Requests):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Offline License Theft:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. HTTPS is used in `MediaDrmCallback`. Basic error handling is present.

**Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive license response validation within `MediaDrmCallback`.  Robust retry policies and timeouts are not fully configured. Offline playback security needs review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subtitle Configuration (within ExoPlayer)](./mitigation_strategies/subtitle_configuration__within_exoplayer_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure ExoPlayer Subtitle Configuration.

**Description:**
1.  **`TextRenderer` Configuration:** If using ExoPlayer's `TextRenderer`, configure it to handle subtitle data securely.
2.  **Subtitle Format Selection:**  Prefer safer subtitle formats (e.g., WebVTT) over less secure formats if you have a choice.
3.  **Feature Restriction (via `TextOutput`):**  If possible, restrict advanced subtitle features that could be exploited.  This might involve creating a custom `TextOutput` that filters or sanitizes the subtitle data before rendering.
4. **Custom `TextRenderer` (if necessary):** If you need to support a custom subtitle format or implement advanced security measures, consider creating a custom `TextRenderer`.  Apply secure coding practices during implementation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Code Injection (via Subtitles within ExoPlayer) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's subtitle rendering being exploited.
*   **Buffer Overflows (in `TextRenderer`) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of buffer overflows in ExoPlayer's subtitle handling.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection (via Subtitles within ExoPlayer):** Risk reduced.
*   **Buffer Overflows (in `TextRenderer`):** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** Minimal. Default `TextRenderer` is used.

**Missing Implementation:**  No custom `TextOutput` or `TextRenderer` to restrict features or sanitize data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular ExoPlayer Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_exoplayer_updates.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Keep ExoPlayer Library Updated.

**Description:**
1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency manager (Gradle, Maven) to include ExoPlayer in your project.
2.  **Version Monitoring:** Regularly check for new releases of ExoPlayer on the official GitHub repository or through your dependency manager.
3.  **Update Promptly:** When a new stable version is released, update your project's dependency to use the new version as soon as reasonably possible.
4.  **Testing After Update:** After updating ExoPlayer, thoroughly test your application to ensure that the update hasn't introduced any regressions or compatibility issues.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities (in ExoPlayer) (Severity: Variable, can be High):** Addresses vulnerabilities in the ExoPlayer library itself that have been discovered and patched.

**Impact:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities (in ExoPlayer):** Risk significantly reduced (depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Manual checks for updates are performed.

**Missing Implementation:** Automated update checks and notifications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Configuration (within ExoPlayer)](./mitigation_strategies/network_configuration__within_exoplayer_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure ExoPlayer Network Configuration

**Description:**
1.  **HTTPS Enforcement (via `DataSource`):** While URL validation happens *before* ExoPlayer, ensure that any custom `DataSource` implementations *only* use HTTPS for network connections.
2.  **Certificate Validation (ExoPlayer's Default Behavior):** ExoPlayer, by default, performs certificate validation when using HTTPS. *Do not* disable this validation unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason (and even then, be extremely cautious).
3. **Custom `HttpDataSource` (if necessary):** If you need to customize network behavior (e.g., setting custom headers), use a custom `HttpDataSource`. Ensure this custom implementation enforces HTTPS and performs proper certificate validation.
4. **Proxy Configuration (via `DefaultHttpDataSource`):** If your application needs to use a proxy server, configure it through ExoPlayer's `DefaultHttpDataSource.Factory`. Ensure the proxy is configured securely.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (on Media Streams) (Severity: High):** Ensures that ExoPlayer's network communication is encrypted and protected from interception.
*   **Eavesdropping (on Media Streams) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from listening in on ExoPlayer's network traffic.

**Impact:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (on Media Streams):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Eavesdropping (on Media Streams):** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially. Default `DataSource` is used, which enforces HTTPS.

**Missing Implementation:**  No custom `HttpDataSource` is used, so there's no opportunity for misconfiguration there. However, a review of network interactions is still beneficial.
