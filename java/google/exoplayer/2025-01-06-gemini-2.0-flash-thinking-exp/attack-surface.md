# Attack Surface Analysis for google/exoplayer

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Media Files](./attack_surfaces/malformed_media_files.md)

**Description:**  ExoPlayer parses various media container formats and codecs. Maliciously crafted media files can exploit vulnerabilities in this parsing logic.
*   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer's core function is to decode and render media, requiring it to process potentially untrusted data from media files.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted MP4 file with an oversized header field could cause a buffer overflow in ExoPlayer's parsing code.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial-of-service, potential for remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation: Validate the source and integrity of media files before passing them to ExoPlayer.
    *   Sandboxing: Isolate ExoPlayer's processing within a sandbox environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.
    *   Regular Updates: Keep ExoPlayer updated to the latest version, which includes bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Protocols (HTTP)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_protocols__http_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows ExoPlayer to fetch media over unencrypted HTTP, the communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.
*   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer can be configured to fetch media from various network sources using different protocols.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network can intercept an HTTP request for a media segment and replace it with malicious content.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of user data (if authentication is involved), injection of malicious content (e.g., ads, misinformation), man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS:  Always use HTTPS for fetching media to ensure encrypted communication.
    *   Certificate Pinning: Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by validating the server's SSL certificate against a known good certificate.

## Attack Surface: [DRM (Digital Rights Management) Bypasses](./attack_surfaces/drm__digital_rights_management__bypasses.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the DRM schemes supported by ExoPlayer (e.g., Widevine, PlayReady) or their implementation can allow attackers to bypass content protection.
*   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer integrates with various DRM systems to enforce content licensing and protection.
*   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a flaw in a specific Widevine implementation to decrypt protected content without a valid license.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to copyrighted content, potential revenue loss for content providers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep DRM Libraries Updated: Ensure that the DRM libraries used by ExoPlayer are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Secure Key Management: Implement secure key management practices for DRM licenses.

## Attack Surface: [Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/third-party_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** ExoPlayer relies on various third-party libraries for codec support and other functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can indirectly affect ExoPlayer's security.
*   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer integrates and depends on these external libraries for its operation.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a native codec library used by ExoPlayer could be exploited through a specially crafted media file.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for application crashes, denial-of-service, or even remote code execution depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the dependent library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Dependency Management: Use a robust dependency management system to track and update third-party libraries.
    *   Security Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.
    *   Stay Updated: Keep ExoPlayer and its dependencies updated to the latest versions, which often include fixes for security vulnerabilities.
