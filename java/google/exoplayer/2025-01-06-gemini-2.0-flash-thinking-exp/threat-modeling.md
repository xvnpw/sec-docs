# Threat Model Analysis for google/exoplayer

## Threat: [Malicious Media File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_media_file_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted media file (e.g., MP4, MKV, WebM) containing malformed data or exploiting parsing vulnerabilities within ExoPlayer's demuxers or decoders. When ExoPlayer attempts to process this file, it can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution.

**Impact:** Application crash, temporary or permanent denial of service for the user, potential compromise of the user's device if remote code execution is achieved.

**Affected Component:** ExoPlayer's demuxer modules (e.g., `Mp4Extractor`, `MatroskaExtractor`, `WebmExtractor`), decoder modules (e.g., `MediaCodecRenderer`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep ExoPlayer updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Implement server-side validation and sanitization of media files before serving them to clients.
*   Consider using a sandboxed environment for media processing if feasible.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Unencrypted Media Streams](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_unencrypted_media_streams.md)

**Description:** If the application loads media streams over insecure HTTP, an attacker on the network can intercept and potentially modify the stream content. This could involve injecting malicious content, altering the playback experience, or even redirecting the user to a different media source. This threat directly involves ExoPlayer's network handling.

**Impact:** Exposure to malicious content, altered playback experience, potential redirection to phishing sites or other malicious resources.

**Affected Component:** ExoPlayer's network loading components (e.g., `DefaultHttpDataSource`, `OkHttpDataSource`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce HTTPS for all media URLs.
*   Ensure proper certificate validation is implemented and enabled in the network data source.

## Threat: [DRM Bypass or Weaknesses](./threats/drm_bypass_or_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's Digital Rights Management (DRM) integration could allow attackers to bypass content protection mechanisms, enabling unauthorized access to protected media. This directly involves ExoPlayer's DRM framework.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to premium content, potential revenue loss for content providers.

**Affected Component:** ExoPlayer's DRM framework and specific DRM scheme implementations (e.g., `FrameworkMediaDrm`, `ExoMediaDrm`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical (for applications relying on DRM)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use the latest versions of ExoPlayer and its DRM extensions.
*   Implement robust server-side DRM license management and validation.
*   Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in the specific DRM schemes being used.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_exoplayer's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** ExoPlayer relies on various underlying libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies (e.g., codec libraries) could directly impact ExoPlayer's security and the application using it.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, ranging from crashes and denial of service to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:**  External libraries and dependencies used by ExoPlayer.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, can be High or Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep ExoPlayer and its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis tools.
*   Monitor security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's dependencies.
