# Threat Model Analysis for google/exoplayer

## Threat: [Serving Malicious Media URLs](./threats/serving_malicious_media_urls.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted URL or URI to the application, which is then passed to Exoplayer. Exoplayer attempts to fetch and process the content at this URL. The attacker hosts a specially crafted media file designed to exploit parsing or decoding vulnerabilities *within Exoplayer*.

**Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the device running the application, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal data, or control the device. It could also cause denial of service by crashing the application.

**Affected Component:** `DataSource` module (for fetching), various `Extractor` implementations (for parsing container formats), and `Decoder` implementations (for decoding audio/video streams).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all media URLs before passing them to Exoplayer.
*   Use a whitelist of trusted media sources or domains.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) where applicable to restrict the sources from which media can be loaded.
*   Consider downloading and validating media content on a secure backend before serving it to the application.

## Threat: [Exploiting Media Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_media_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a media file with specific malformations or unexpected data structures that exploit vulnerabilities in *Exoplayer's* parsing logic for different container formats (e.g., MP4, MKV, HLS manifests). Exoplayer attempts to parse this malformed data, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** This can result in buffer overflows, memory corruption, crashes, or potentially remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough. It can also lead to denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Various `Extractor` implementations responsible for parsing different media container formats (e.g., `Mp4Extractor`, `MatroskaExtractor`, `HlsMediaPlaylistParser`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Exoplayer updated to the latest stable version, as updates often include fixes for parsing vulnerabilities.
*   Implement server-side validation of media files before serving them to clients.
*   Consider using a sandboxed environment for media processing if feasible.

## Threat: [Exploiting Codec Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_codec_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exoplayer relies on underlying software or hardware codecs for decoding audio and video streams. Attackers can craft media streams that exploit known vulnerabilities in these codecs. *Exoplayer* passes the encoded data to the codec for decoding, triggering the vulnerability. While the vulnerability lies in the codec, Exoplayer is the direct interface.

**Impact:**  Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution within the codec's process, potentially compromising the application or the entire device. It can also cause crashes or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `Decoder` implementations (e.g., `MediaCodecVideoRenderer`, `MediaCodecAudioRenderer`) which interact with the underlying codecs provided by the operating system or device.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   While direct control over underlying codecs is limited, encourage users to keep their operating systems and device firmware updated to receive security patches for codecs.
*   Consider using Exoplayer's support for different rendering paths (e.g., using a software decoder as a fallback if hardware decoders are suspected to be vulnerable).
*   Monitor security advisories related to common codecs used by the target platforms.
