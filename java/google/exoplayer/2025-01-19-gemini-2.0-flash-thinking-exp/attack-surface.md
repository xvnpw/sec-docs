# Attack Surface Analysis for google/exoplayer

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Media URLs](./attack_surfaces/malicious_media_urls.md)

*   **Description:** Providing ExoPlayer with a crafted or untrusted URL pointing to media content.
    *   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer's core function is to fetch and process media from URLs. It directly initiates network requests based on the provided URL.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL to an internal network resource (SSRF), a URL leading to a denial-of-service attack on a third-party server, or a URL hosting malware disguised as media that ExoPlayer attempts to download and process.
    *   **Impact:** Server-side request forgery (SSRF), denial-of-service (DoS) against other systems, potential exposure of internal network structure, fetching and potentially triggering vulnerabilities in processing malicious content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on URLs *before* passing them to ExoPlayer. Use allowlists of trusted domains or URL schemes. Avoid directly using user-provided URLs without validation. Implement proper error handling for network requests initiated by ExoPlayer.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Media Files](./attack_surfaces/malformed_media_files.md)

*   **Description:** Providing ExoPlayer with specially crafted media files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in its parsing or decoding logic.
    *   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer parses various media container formats and uses codecs to decode the media. Vulnerabilities in these parsing or decoding components *within ExoPlayer* can be triggered by malformed files.
    *   **Example:** A crafted MP4 file with a malformed header that causes a buffer overflow in ExoPlayer's MP4 parser, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service (application crash), potential arbitrary code execution on the client device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep ExoPlayer updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. Implement robust error handling during media parsing and decoding within the application. Consider using secure media processing libraries or sandboxing techniques if processing untrusted media with ExoPlayer.

## Attack Surface: [DRM Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/drm_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in ExoPlayer's DRM (Digital Rights Management) integration or the underlying DRM schemes.
    *   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer provides APIs for integrating with various DRM systems. Vulnerabilities in *this integration within ExoPlayer* or the way it interacts with DRM schemes can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** Bypassing DRM restrictions through manipulation of ExoPlayer's DRM handling logic to access protected content without authorization. Exploiting vulnerabilities in how ExoPlayer requests or processes DRM licenses.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected content, potential revenue loss for content providers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use the latest versions of ExoPlayer and DRM libraries. Follow best practices for DRM integration as outlined in ExoPlayer's documentation. Securely manage DRM license requests and responses within the application's logic interacting with ExoPlayer.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Underlying Codec Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_underlying_codec_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in the underlying codec libraries used by ExoPlayer for media decoding.
    *   **How ExoPlayer Contributes:** ExoPlayer relies on system or third-party codec libraries for decoding. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, *ExoPlayer's use of these codecs* makes it a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a widely used H.264 codec library that can be triggered by a specially crafted video stream played *through ExoPlayer*, leading to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the client device.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep ExoPlayer updated, as updates may include workarounds or mitigations for known codec vulnerabilities. Encourage users to keep their operating systems and codec libraries updated. Consider using sandboxing techniques to isolate the media decoding process initiated by ExoPlayer.
