## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Media Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_media_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Media Processing Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Media Processing Vulnerabilities]**
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in how Exoplayer parses, demuxes, and decodes media files. These vulnerabilities can arise from incorrect handling of malformed or unexpected data within various media formats (e.g., MP4, HLS, DASH).
*   **Potential Outcomes:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, memory corruption, unexpected application behavior.
*   **Common Vulnerability Types:** Buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string bugs, logic errors in parsing and decoding algorithms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Media Content](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_media_content.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Supply Malicious Media Content **[CRITICAL NODE: Supply Malicious Media Content]**
*   **Attack Vector:** Providing Exoplayer with media content that is specifically crafted to trigger vulnerabilities in its processing logic. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Crafted Media Files:** Creating media files with specific structures or data that exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in Exoplayer's parsers or decoders.
    *   **Compromised Media Sources:** Serving malicious media from a source that has been compromised by an attacker.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**  Depends on the exploited vulnerability, but can range from arbitrary code execution to denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Crafted Media File](./attack_tree_paths/crafted_media_file.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Crafted Media File (e.g., MP4, HLS, DASH) **[CRITICAL NODE: Crafted Media File]**
*   **Attack Vector:**  Creating a media file (e.g., MP4, HLS manifest, DASH manifest, individual media segments) with malicious data embedded within its structure. This data is designed to exploit specific parsing or decoding vulnerabilities in Exoplayer.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**  Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, denial of service.
*   **Examples:**  A malformed MP4 atom that causes a buffer overflow when parsed, a DASH manifest with incorrect segment lengths leading to out-of-bounds reads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Parser/Decoder](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_parserdecoder.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Trigger Buffer Overflow in Parser/Decoder **[CRITICAL NODE: Trigger Buffer Overflow]**
*   **Attack Vector:**  Providing a media file where the size or structure of certain data elements exceeds the buffer allocated to store them during parsing or decoding. This allows the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**  Arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses or function pointers, denial of service due to crashes.
*   **Technical Details:**  Often involves manipulating the size fields within media containers or codecs to cause the decoder to read or write beyond buffer boundaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Serve Malicious Media](./attack_tree_paths/serve_malicious_media.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Serve Malicious Media from Compromised Source **[CRITICAL NODE: Serve Malicious Media]**
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker gains control over a server or storage location that the application uses to fetch media content. They then replace legitimate media files with malicious ones.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**  The application fetches and processes the malicious media, leading to exploitation of media processing vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Steps:**  Compromising the server through various means (e.g., exploiting server vulnerabilities, phishing for credentials, supply chain attacks).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities]**
*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging weaknesses in how Exoplayer communicates over the network to fetch media content or DRM licenses.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks, redirection to malicious servers, exposure of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Media Delivery](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_media_delivery.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Media Delivery **[CRITICAL NODE: MITM Attack on Media Delivery]**
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the media server. This allows them to eavesdrop on the communication and potentially modify the data being exchanged.
*   **Prerequisites:**  The attacker needs to be on the same network as the application or have control over network infrastructure.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**  Interception of media content, injection of malicious media segments, manipulation of DRM license requests/responses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and Modify Media Segments](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_modify_media_segments.md)

**[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Intercept and Modify Media Segments
*   **Attack Vector:**  During a MITM attack, the attacker intercepts individual media segments (e.g., video or audio chunks in HLS or DASH) as they are being downloaded. The attacker then modifies these segments, injecting malicious data or replacing them entirely with attacker-controlled content.
*   **Potential Outcomes:**  Triggering media processing vulnerabilities in Exoplayer, displaying manipulated content to the user, potentially leading to further exploitation.
