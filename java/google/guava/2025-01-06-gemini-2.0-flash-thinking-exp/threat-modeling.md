# Threat Model Analysis for google/guava

## Threat: [Known Vulnerabilities in Guava](./threats/known_vulnerabilities_in_guava.md)

* **Threat:** Known Vulnerabilities in Guava
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly known security vulnerability within a specific version of the Guava library. This could involve sending specially crafted input or triggering a specific sequence of operations that directly exploits a flaw within Guava's code.
    * **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the impact could range from denial of service (application crash or unresponsiveness due to a bug in Guava), information disclosure (leaking sensitive data due to a flaw in Guava's data handling), to remote code execution (allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server due to a critical vulnerability within Guava).
    * **Affected Component:** Any module or function within the vulnerable Guava version where the flaw exists. Examples include: `com.google.common.collect`, `com.google.common.base`, `com.google.common.util.concurrent`. The specific affected component depends on the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the Guava library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories and CVE databases specifically for reported Guava vulnerabilities.
        * Implement a robust dependency management system to track and facilitate timely updates of library versions.
