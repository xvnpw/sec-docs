# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for google/guava

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Cryptographically Secure Hash Functions in `Hashing` Utilities](./mitigation_strategies/employ_cryptographically_secure_hash_functions_in__hashing__utilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review all code sections utilizing Guava's `Hashing` class.
    *   Step 2: Identify instances where hash functions are used for security-sensitive operations like data integrity checks, session ID generation, or input validation.
    *   Step 3: Ensure that for these security-sensitive operations, you are using cryptographically strong hash functions provided by Guava, such as `Hashing.sha256()`, `Hashing.sha512()`, or other SHA-2 family algorithms.
    *   Step 4: Replace any usage of weaker or non-cryptographic hash functions like `Hashing.md5()`, `Hashing.murmur3_128()`, or `Hashing.crc32c()` in security-critical contexts with the stronger alternatives.
    *   Step 5: Document the rationale for choosing specific hash functions and the contexts where they are applied.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Hash Collision Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity: Attackers can exploit predictable or weak hash functions to generate numerous collisions, causing hash table performance to degrade drastically, leading to application slowdown or unavailability.
    *   Data Integrity Compromise - Medium Severity:  If weaker hash functions are used for integrity checks, collisions could allow attackers to subtly alter data without detection, potentially leading to data corruption or manipulation.
    *   Session Hijacking (in specific scenarios) - Medium Severity: If weak hashes are used in session ID generation, predictability or collisions could increase the risk of session hijacking.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Hash Collision DoS: High Reduction - Using cryptographically secure hash functions significantly reduces the probability of attackers successfully generating hash collisions, making DoS attacks based on hash collisions much harder to execute.
    *   Data Integrity Compromise: Medium Reduction -  Stronger hash functions make it computationally infeasible for attackers to find collisions and manipulate data without detection via hash-based integrity checks. However, cryptographic signatures are still recommended for the highest level of data integrity.
    *   Session Hijacking: Medium Reduction -  Reduces the risk by making session IDs less predictable and collision-resistant, but proper session management practices are also crucial.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, in the user authentication module for password hashing and session ID generation.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in the data integrity verification process for uploaded files in the file storage service. Currently using `Hashing.murmur3_128()` for file integrity checks, which should be upgraded to `Hashing.sha256()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Length Limits for Hash-Based Collections](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_length_limits_for_hash-based_collections.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify all uses of Guava's hash-based collections (e.g., `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `HashMultimap`, `HashMultiset`) and custom data structures that rely on Guava's `Hashing` utilities, especially when these collections store data derived from untrusted sources (user input, external APIs).
    *   Step 2: Analyze the expected size and length of keys and values stored in these collections.
    *   Step 3: Implement validation and sanitization to enforce reasonable limits on the length and size of input keys and values *before* they are inserted into hash-based collections.
    *   Step 4: Configure application settings or code logic to reject or truncate inputs exceeding these limits, preventing excessively long keys or values from being processed.
    *   Step 5: Log instances where input limits are exceeded for monitoring and potential security incident analysis.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Hash Collision Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium to High Severity: By limiting input lengths, you restrict the attacker's ability to craft extremely long or specifically crafted inputs designed to maximize hash collisions and degrade performance of hash-based collections.
    *   Resource Exhaustion DoS - Medium Severity:  Unbounded input lengths can lead to excessive memory consumption and CPU usage when processing and storing very large keys or values in hash-based collections, potentially causing resource exhaustion and DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Hash Collision DoS: Medium Reduction - Reduces the attack surface by limiting the attacker's control over input length, making it harder to trigger hash collisions through excessively long inputs.
    *   Resource Exhaustion DoS: Medium Reduction - Prevents unbounded resource consumption by limiting the size of data processed and stored in memory, mitigating resource exhaustion attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, input length limits are implemented for user registration fields (username, email) and form submissions in the web application frontend.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Input length limits are not consistently enforced in the API endpoints that process file uploads and external data feeds. Backend validation needs to be strengthened to enforce these limits at the API level.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Performance Monitoring for Guava Collection Operations](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_performance_monitoring_for_guava_collection_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify code sections where Guava collections are used to process data from untrusted sources, especially operations involving sorting, filtering, transformations, or complex computations on potentially large collections.
    *   Step 2: Implement resource limits (e.g., time limits, memory limits) specifically for operations performed on these Guava collections. Use techniques like timeouts for processing loops or monitoring memory usage during Guava collection operations.
    *   Step 3: Monitor the performance of these Guava collection operations in production. Track metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times for requests that involve processing large Guava collections.
    *   Step 4: Set up alerts to trigger when resource usage for Guava collection operations exceeds predefined thresholds, indicating potential performance degradation or DoS attempts.
    *   Step 5: Implement circuit breaker patterns or rate limiting to gracefully handle situations where Guava collection processing becomes excessively resource-intensive, preventing cascading failures and protecting application availability.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Algorithmic Complexity Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium to High Severity: Attackers can craft inputs that trigger computationally expensive operations on Guava collections (e.g., sorting very large lists, complex filtering), leading to excessive CPU usage and DoS.
    *   Resource Exhaustion DoS - Medium Severity:  Uncontrolled processing of large Guava collections can consume excessive memory and CPU resources, leading to resource exhaustion and application unavailability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Algorithmic Complexity DoS: Medium Reduction - Resource limits and performance monitoring help detect and mitigate attacks that exploit algorithmic complexity issues in Guava collection operations by preventing operations from consuming excessive resources for extended periods.
    *   Resource Exhaustion DoS: Medium Reduction - Limits resource consumption related to Guava collections and provides early warning signs of potential resource exhaustion attacks, allowing for proactive intervention.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, basic request timeouts are configured for API endpoints, but these are not specifically tailored to Guava collection operations. Performance monitoring is in place for overall API response times.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular resource limits and performance monitoring are missing for specific code paths that heavily utilize Guava collections for data processing. Need to implement more fine-grained monitoring and resource control for these Guava collection operations, especially in data processing pipelines and reporting modules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Audits and Updates for Guava](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_audits_and_updates_for_guava.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Integrate dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, GitHub Dependency Graph) into the project's CI/CD pipeline and development workflow.
    *   Step 2: Configure these tools to regularly scan the project's dependencies, specifically focusing on Guava and its transitive dependencies, for known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Step 3: Set up alerts or notifications to inform the development team about any identified vulnerabilities in Guava or its dependencies.
    *   Step 4: Regularly update the Guava library to the latest stable version. Follow Guava release notes and security advisories to stay informed about security patches and updates.
    *   Step 5: Review and update transitive dependencies of Guava as needed to address any vulnerabilities identified in them.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Guava - High Severity: Outdated versions of Guava or its dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other security incidents.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Guava: High Reduction - Regularly updating Guava and patching vulnerabilities significantly reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known weaknesses in the library or its dependencies.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, OWASP Dependency-Check is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and runs daily. GitHub Dependency Graph is also enabled for the repository.

*   **Missing Implementation:** While dependency scanning is in place, the process for *acting* on vulnerability reports related to Guava needs improvement. Currently, vulnerability alerts are generated, but there isn't a formalized process for prioritizing, investigating, and patching Guava related vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Need to establish a clear workflow for vulnerability management and patching specifically for Guava and its dependencies.
