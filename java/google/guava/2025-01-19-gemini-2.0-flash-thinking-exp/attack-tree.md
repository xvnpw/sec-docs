## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Guava Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_guava_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the overarching goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of Guava to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caching Mechanisms (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caching_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target Guava's caching features to inject malicious data, exhaust resources, or infer information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cache Poisoning (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/cache_poisoning__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The attacker's goal is to insert malicious data into the cache, which the application will later retrieve and process as legitimate. This can lead to various severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Cache](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_cache.md)

This is the action of inserting harmful data into the cache.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Cache Population Logic (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_cache_population_logic__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Attackers leverage flaws in how the application populates the cache. If user input is directly used to populate the cache without proper sanitization or validation, malicious payloads can be injected. This can lead to:
        *   **Code Execution:** If the cached data is later deserialized or interpreted as code.
        *   **Data Corruption:** If the malicious data overwrites legitimate entries or causes inconsistencies.
        *   **Information Disclosure:** If the malicious data allows access to sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Cacheable Data (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_on_cacheable_data__critical_node_.md)

If the application doesn't validate data before caching it, an attacker might be able to inject data that causes unexpected behavior when retrieved. While potentially less severe than code execution, this can still lead to application errors or information leaks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Input Size Validation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_size_validation__critical_node_.md)

When the application processes user-provided data using Guava collections, a lack of validation on the size of this input can be exploited. An attacker can provide extremely large input data, leading to:
        *   **Denial of Service:**  Excessive memory consumption or CPU usage can overwhelm the application, making it unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Concurrency Utilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_concurrency_utilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target Guava's concurrency features to disrupt the application's normal operation by causing deadlocks, livelocks, or race conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deadlocks or Livelocks (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/deadlocks_or_livelocks__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

The attacker aims to bring the application to a standstill by manipulating the state of concurrent operations.
        *   **Deadlock:** Threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for resources held by other blocked threads.
        *   **Livelock:** Threads are constantly changing state in response to each other, but no actual progress is made.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate State of Concurrent Operations](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_state_of_concurrent_operations.md)

This involves actions taken by the attacker to influence the execution of concurrent tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improper Synchronization (High-Risk Path, Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_synchronization__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

If the application uses Guava's concurrency utilities incorrectly, leading to insufficient synchronization between threads, an attacker can exploit this to cause:
        *   **Deadlocks:** By manipulating the order in which threads acquire locks.
        *   **Livelocks:** By triggering continuous state changes that prevent progress.
        *   **Race Conditions:** Although not explicitly a high-risk path here, improper synchronization is a prerequisite for many race conditions, which can have high impact.
