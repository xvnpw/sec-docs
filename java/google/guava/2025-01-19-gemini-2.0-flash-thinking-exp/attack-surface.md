# Attack Surface Analysis for google/guava

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code or cause other harmful effects.

**How Guava Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Guava's data structures (like `ImmutableList`, `ImmutableMap`, etc.) can be part of a serialized object graph. If an application deserializes untrusted data containing these Guava objects, and a vulnerable class is present in the classpath, it can be exploited. Guava itself doesn't provide deserialization mechanisms for arbitrary objects, but its objects can be targets within a larger deserialization attack.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, includes a Guava `ImmutableList` containing references to vulnerable classes. Deserializing this object triggers the vulnerability.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), denial of service, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
* Implement robust deserialization filtering (e.g., using `ObjectInputFilter` in Java 9+ or custom filtering mechanisms).
* Keep all dependencies, including Guava, updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using alternative serialization methods that are less prone to vulnerabilities (e.g., JSON).

## Attack Surface: [Cache Poisoning and Resource Exhaustion (LoadingCache)](./attack_surfaces/cache_poisoning_and_resource_exhaustion__loadingcache_.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious or invalid data into a cache (`LoadingCache`) or causing excessive resource consumption by repeatedly requesting expensive-to-load keys.

**How Guava Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Guava's `LoadingCache` allows for automatic loading of values when a key is not present. If the loading function is vulnerable or relies on untrusted input, attackers can poison the cache with incorrect data. Repeated requests for non-existent or rarely accessed keys can trigger expensive loading operations, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Example:** An attacker crafts specific cache keys that, when requested, cause the `LoadingCache`'s loading function to fetch malicious data from an external source or perform computationally intensive operations.

**Impact:** Serving incorrect data to users, denial of service, performance degradation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate inputs used to generate cache keys.
* Ensure the loading function for the `LoadingCache` is secure and does not rely on untrusted external data.
* Implement appropriate cache eviction policies and maximum size limits.
* Monitor cache performance and resource usage to detect potential abuse.
* Consider using a dedicated cache invalidation strategy to remove potentially poisoned entries.

## Attack Surface: [String Manipulation Vulnerabilities (Strings Class)](./attack_surfaces/string_manipulation_vulnerabilities__strings_class_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of strings, such as excessive resource consumption or injection vulnerabilities.

**How Guava Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Guava's `Strings` utility class provides methods for string manipulation (e.g., padding). If used with attacker-controlled lengths or in security-sensitive contexts without proper validation, it can contribute to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker provides an extremely large value for the padding length in `Strings.padStart()`, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation and a denial-of-service. If string manipulation is used to construct commands or file paths, improper handling can lead to command injection or path traversal.

**Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, command injection, path traversal.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in string manipulation operations.
* Be cautious when using string manipulation functions with lengths derived from external sources.
* Avoid constructing commands or file paths directly from user input; use parameterized queries or secure file handling mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [EventBus Abuse](./attack_surfaces/eventbus_abuse.md)

**Description:** Exploiting the `EventBus` component to trigger unintended actions or manipulate application state by posting malicious events.

**How Guava Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Guava's `EventBus` facilitates decoupled communication between components. If the application allows untrusted sources to post events to the bus, attackers can potentially trigger unintended behavior in subscribed components.

**Example:** An attacker gains the ability to post events to the `EventBus` and sends a crafted event that triggers a sensitive operation in a subscriber component, such as modifying user permissions or accessing restricted data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict who can post events to the `EventBus`. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for event posting.
* Carefully design event handling logic to prevent unintended side effects from malicious events.
* Validate the data contained within events before processing them.
