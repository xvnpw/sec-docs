# Threat Model Analysis for google/guava

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Collection Creation](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_collection_creation.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Large Collection Creation
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides input that causes the application to create extremely large Guava collections (e.g., `ImmutableList`, `ImmutableMap`). This can consume excessive memory, leading to application slowdowns, crashes, or denial of service. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in data parsing or input validation to inject large amounts of data.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, potential for other attacks due to resource starvation.
    *   **Affected Guava Component:** `ImmutableList`, `ImmutableSet`, `ImmutableMap`, `Multimap` (and their builder classes).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization to limit the size of data used to create collections.
        *   Set reasonable limits on the maximum size of collections.
        *   Use pagination or streaming for handling large datasets instead of loading everything into memory at once.
        *   Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for excessive memory consumption.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Guava Types](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_guava_types.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization of Guava Types
    *   **Description:** If the application serializes and deserializes Guava objects (e.g., `ImmutableList`, `ImmutableMap`), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or manipulate object states. This is a general Java deserialization risk, but Guava types can be targets if they are part of the serialized data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Guava Component:**  Primarily affects any serializable Guava type, especially immutable collections if they contain attacker-controlled objects.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid serializing Guava objects if possible, especially if the data source is untrusted.
        *   If serialization is necessary, use secure serialization mechanisms and libraries.
        *   Implement robust input validation on deserialized data.
        *   Consider using alternative data exchange formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
        *   Keep Guava and other dependencies up-to-date to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Misuse of Reflection Utilities](./threats/misuse_of_reflection_utilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Misuse of Reflection Utilities
    *   **Description:** Guava provides reflection utilities. If these are used incorrectly or without proper input validation, it could potentially open doors for attackers to manipulate object states or invoke methods they shouldn't have access to. This is a general risk with reflection in Java, and Guava's utilities can facilitate such misuse if not handled carefully.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Affected Guava Component:** `Reflection` utilities within Guava.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the use of reflection.
        *   Thoroughly validate any input used in reflection operations.
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting permissions for reflection.
        *   Consider using alternative approaches that don't rely on reflection if possible.
