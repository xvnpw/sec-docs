## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Serialization Practices (and Avoiding Direct Guava Object Serialization)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_serialization_practices__and_avoiding_direct_guava_object_serialization_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Minimize and Secure Serialization/Deserialization of Guava Objects
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer DTOs over Guava Objects for Serialization:** When transferring data, especially over networks or storing it persistently, prefer using simple Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that represent your application's data model instead of directly serializing *Guava collection types or other complex Guava objects*.
    2.  **Use Secure Serialization Formats (Especially with Guava Objects):** If serialization of *Guava objects* is necessary, opt for safer formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers over Java's native serialization, especially when dealing with untrusted data. These formats are generally less susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities *compared to Java serialization of complex objects like those in Guava*.
    3.  **Input Validation on Deserialized Data (Including Data Populating Guava Objects):**  Regardless of the serialization format, always perform thorough input validation on data received after deserialization, *especially when this data will be used to populate Guava objects after deserialization*. Validate data types, ranges, and formats to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior when working with Guava objects.
    4.  **Object Input Stream Filtering (Java Serialization of Guava Objects - if unavoidable):** If Java serialization of *Guava objects* is unavoidable when dealing with untrusted data, utilize Java's Object Input Stream Filtering (available in newer Java versions) to restrict the classes that can be deserialized, mitigating deserialization gadget attacks *that might target Guava classes or classes used within Guava*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities related to Guava Objects (High Severity):** Prevents or mitigates deserialization vulnerabilities that could arise from directly deserializing *Guava objects*, especially when handling untrusted data. These vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) *if Guava classes are involved in gadget chains*.
    *   **Information Leakage from Serialized Guava Objects (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unintentionally exposing internal implementation details of *Guava objects* through serialization, which could potentially be exploited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities related to Guava Objects (High):** High impact. Significantly reduces the risk of critical deserialization vulnerabilities, especially if the application handles untrusted serialized data and *potentially deserializes Guava objects*.
    *   **Information Leakage from Serialized Guava Objects (Medium):** Medium impact. Reduces the risk of information leakage from *Guava object serialization*, although the direct exploitability might be lower than RCE.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:**  JSON is primarily used for API communication and data persistence, which is inherently safer than Java serialization. DTOs are generally used for data transfer within the application, reducing direct serialization of *complex Guava objects*.
    *   **Location:** API endpoints, data persistence layers, internal service communication.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Explicit Policy Against Direct Guava Object Serialization:** No explicit coding guidelines or policies discouraging direct serialization of *complex Guava objects*, especially when handling external data.
    *   **Object Input Stream Filtering (Java Serialization of Guava Objects):** If Java serialization is used in any legacy components or internal processes and *potentially involves Guava objects*, Object Input Stream Filtering is not implemented to restrict deserialization classes.
    *   **Formal Deserialization Security Review (Focus on Guava Objects):** No formal security review process specifically focusing on deserialization practices and potential vulnerabilities *related to Guava object serialization*.

Identify potentially complex or nested regex patterns that could be vulnerable to ReDoS when used with these *Guava utilities*.
    2.  **Regex Performance Testing with Guava Utilities:**  Test regular expressions used with *Guava's `CharMatcher` and `Splitter`* against a variety of inputs, including long strings, strings with repeating patterns, and edge cases. Use online regex testers or dedicated tools to measure execution time and identify potential performance bottlenecks or ReDoS vulnerabilities *in the context of Guava utility usage*.
    3.  **Regex Simplification for Guava Usage:**  Simplify complex regular expressions used with *Guava's `CharMatcher` and `Splitter`* where possible. Break down complex regex into simpler, more efficient patterns or use alternative string manipulation methods if feasible *within the Guava utility context*.
    4.  **Input Length Limits for Guava Regex Processing:**  Implement input length limits for strings processed by regular expressions used with *Guava's `CharMatcher` and `Splitter`*, especially when dealing with user-provided input. This can limit the maximum execution time even if a ReDoS vulnerability exists *when using Guava regex utilities*.
    5.  **Timeouts for Guava Regex Execution:**  In critical sections where *Guava's `CharMatcher` or `Splitter`* are used with regular expressions, consider implementing timeouts for regular expression execution to prevent unbounded CPU consumption in case of ReDoS attacks.

    *   **Location:** Codebase where `CharMatcher` and `Splitter` are used with regular expressions, primarily in input processing and data parsing modules *that utilize Guava*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **ReDoS Awareness Training (Guava Specific):** Lack of formal training or guidelines for developers on ReDoS vulnerabilities and secure regex design *specifically in the context of using Guava's `CharMatcher` and `Splitter`*.
    *   **Automated ReDoS Testing (Guava Context):** No automated tools or processes to specifically test regular expressions used with *Guava's `CharMatcher` and `Splitter`* for ReDoS vulnerabilities during development or testing phases.
    *   **Regex Complexity Analysis (Guava Usage):** No tools or processes to automatically analyze regex complexity and flag potentially vulnerable patterns *specifically when used with Guava's `CharMatcher` and `Splitter`*.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Secure Caching Practices with Guava Cache
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Guava Cache Configuration:**  Carefully review the configuration of all *Guava caches* used in the application, especially those storing sensitive data. Pay attention to expiration policies (time-based, size-based), maximum size, and eviction strategies *configured for Guava caches*.
    2.  **Minimize Caching of Sensitive Data in Guava Cache:**  Avoid caching highly sensitive data in *Guava caches* if possible. If caching is necessary, consider the sensitivity level and potential impact of data leakage from the *Guava cache*.
    3.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data in Guava Cache (If Possible):** If *Guava's caching implementation* or a wrapper allows for encryption at rest within the cache, implement encryption for sensitive data to protect it from unauthorized access if the *Guava cache* storage is compromised.
    4.  **Implement Access Control for Guava Cache:**  If the *Guava cache* is accessible from different parts of the application or different user contexts, implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to authorized components or users only *for the Guava cache*.
    5.  **Regularly Clear Guava Cache (Sensitive Data):** For *Guava caches* containing sensitive data, consider implementing a mechanism to periodically clear the cache, especially when data sensitivity is time-bound or access is no longer needed *in the Guava cache*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Leakage through Guava Cache (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the *Guava cache* due to misconfiguration, excessive caching, or lack of access control. Severity depends on the sensitivity of the cached data.
    *   **Excessive Memory Consumption by Guava Cache (Medium Severity):** Prevents unbounded *Guava cache* growth due to misconfiguration, leading to potential Denial of Service due to memory exhaustion.
*   **Impact:**
