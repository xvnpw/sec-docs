# Deep Analysis: Guava Cache Poisoning Attack

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the "Cache Poisoning" attack path within the broader attack tree analysis for our application, which utilizes the Google Guava library for caching.  The primary objective is to understand the specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and effective mitigation strategies related to this attack vector, focusing on the `Inject malicious entries with long expiry` method. We will assess the practical risk and propose concrete steps to enhance the application's security posture.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on:

*   **Guava Caching:**  Specifically, the `com.google.common.cache` package and its common implementations (e.g., `CacheBuilder`, `LoadingCache`, `Cache`).  We assume the application uses Guava's in-memory caching capabilities.
*   **Cache Poisoning:**  The scenario where an attacker successfully inserts malicious data into the cache, causing the application to serve incorrect or harmful information to legitimate users.
*   **"Inject malicious entries with long expiry" Method:**  We will concentrate on the attacker's tactic of inserting malicious entries designed to persist in the cache for an extended period, maximizing the impact of the attack.
*   **Application Context:**  While the analysis is Guava-centric, we will consider the application's specific use of caching.  This includes *what* data is cached, *how* cache keys are generated, and *how* cached data is used.  We will *not* cover external caching systems (e.g., Redis, Memcached) unless Guava is used as a client to interact with them.
* **Mitigation Techniques:** We will analyze effectiveness of `Input validation`, `Rate limiting`, `limit cache size`, `use strong keys`

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Guava Caching Review:**  Examine the Guava caching API and its relevant features related to cache eviction, expiration, and key management.
2.  **Attack Scenario Definition:**  Develop a concrete, realistic scenario where an attacker could attempt to poison the Guava cache in our application. This will involve identifying:
    *   **Entry Point:**  The specific application functionality that allows user input to influence cached data.
    *   **Cache Key Generation:**  How the application generates cache keys.  Weaknesses in key generation are crucial for cache poisoning.
    *   **Cached Data:**  The type of data stored in the cache and its potential impact if compromised.
    *   **Attacker Goal:**  What the attacker hopes to achieve by poisoning the cache (e.g., data exfiltration, denial of service, code execution).
3.  **Exploitation Analysis:**  Detail the steps an attacker would take to exploit the identified vulnerability, focusing on the "long expiry" aspect. This includes:
    *   **Bypassing Input Validation:**  If input validation is present, how might an attacker circumvent it?
    *   **Crafting Malicious Input:**  What would the malicious input look like?
    *   **Achieving Long Expiry:**  How would the attacker ensure the malicious entry remains in the cache for a significant duration?
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigations (`Input validation`, `Rate limiting`, `limit cache size`, `use strong keys`) in the context of the defined attack scenario.  We will identify potential weaknesses in these mitigations and suggest improvements.
5.  **Recommendations:**  Provide specific, actionable recommendations to strengthen the application's defenses against cache poisoning, including code-level changes, configuration adjustments, and monitoring strategies.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Cache Poisoning (Inject malicious entries with long expiry)

### 4.1 Guava Caching Review

Guava's `CacheBuilder` provides several mechanisms to control cache behavior:

*   **Expiration:**
    *   `expireAfterWrite(duration)`:  Entries expire after a fixed duration since they were written to the cache.
    *   `expireAfterAccess(duration)`: Entries expire after a fixed duration since they were last accessed (read or written).
    *   `refreshAfterWrite(duration)`:  Entries become eligible for refresh after a fixed duration, but may still be served from the cache until a new value is loaded.
*   **Eviction:**
    *   `maximumSize(long)`:  Limits the cache to a maximum number of entries.  Eviction policies (typically LRU - Least Recently Used) are used when the limit is reached.
    *   `maximumWeight(long)`:  Limits the cache based on a total "weight" of entries, requiring a `Weigher` to be defined.
    *   `weakKeys()`, `weakValues()`, `softValues()`:  Use weak or soft references for keys or values, allowing the garbage collector to reclaim memory when under pressure.
*   **Key Generation:** Guava itself doesn't generate keys; this is entirely the application's responsibility.  This is a *critical* aspect for cache poisoning.
* **Removal Listener:** `CacheBuilder.removalListener` can be used to monitor and react to cache entry removals.

### 4.2 Attack Scenario Definition

Let's assume the following scenario:

*   **Application:**  An e-commerce platform that caches product details to improve performance.
*   **Entry Point:**  A product search endpoint (`/search?q=<query>`) that takes a user-provided search query.
*   **Cache Key Generation:**  The application generates cache keys by directly using the *normalized* search query string.  Normalization involves lowercasing and removing some special characters, but *does not* perform robust sanitization or escaping.  Example:  `search_query:iphone13`
*   **Cached Data:**  The cache stores a `ProductDetails` object containing the product name, description, price, and image URL.
*   **Attacker Goal:**  The attacker wants to inject a malicious product description containing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload that will be executed in the browsers of other users searching for the same product.
* **Long Expiry:** The cache is configured with `expireAfterWrite(1, TimeUnit.HOURS)`.

### 4.3 Exploitation Analysis

1.  **Bypassing Input Validation:**  The application's normalization process might remove some obvious XSS characters (e.g., `<` and `>`), but it's likely vulnerable to more subtle payloads.  For example, an attacker might use HTML entities or JavaScript event handlers:
    *   `iphone13<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` might be normalized to `iphone13img src=x onerror=alert(1)`, which is still a valid XSS payload.
    *   `iphone13%22onmouseover%3D%22alert(1)` (URL-encoded) might bypass normalization and result in a key like `search_query:iphone13"onmouseover="alert(1)`.

2.  **Crafting Malicious Input:**  The attacker crafts a search query containing the XSS payload, carefully designed to bypass the normalization process.

3.  **Achieving Long Expiry:**  The attacker simply needs to submit the malicious query *once*.  Because the cache uses `expireAfterWrite(1, TimeUnit.HOURS)`, the malicious entry will remain in the cache for up to an hour, affecting all users who search for "iphone13" (or a similar query that normalizes to the same key) during that time.  The attacker could also periodically re-submit the malicious query to keep the entry "fresh" in the cache.

### 4.4 Mitigation Analysis

Let's analyze the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation:

*   **Input Validation:**  This is the *most crucial* mitigation.  The application *must* implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS payloads from entering the system.  This should involve:
    *   **Whitelist Approach:**  Instead of trying to remove "bad" characters, define a whitelist of allowed characters for search queries (e.g., alphanumeric characters, spaces, and a limited set of safe punctuation).
    *   **Context-Specific Escaping:**  When displaying the cached product description, use proper HTML escaping (e.g., using a library like OWASP Java Encoder) to prevent any remaining potentially malicious characters from being interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
    *   **Regular Expression Validation:** Use carefully crafted regular expressions to validate the structure of the search query.
    *   **Weakness:**  If input validation is poorly implemented or bypassable, this mitigation fails completely.

*   **Rate Limiting:**  This can help mitigate the *impact* of a cache poisoning attack by limiting the number of times an attacker can submit malicious queries.  However, it doesn't prevent the attack itself.  A single successful injection can still poison the cache for the duration of the expiry time.
    *   **Weakness:**  A determined attacker might use multiple IP addresses or slow down their requests to avoid rate limits.

*   **Limit Cache Size:**  This can reduce the *scope* of the attack by limiting the number of poisoned entries that can be stored.  However, it doesn't prevent the attack, and a small cache size might negatively impact performance.  If the attacker can flood the cache with malicious entries, they might evict legitimate entries, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Weakness:**  Doesn't address the root cause of the vulnerability.

*   **Use Strong Keys:**  This is *essential*.  The current key generation mechanism (using the normalized search query) is highly vulnerable.  A better approach would be to:
    *   **Hash the Sanitized Input:**  After performing robust input validation and sanitization, hash the resulting query string using a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256).  This makes it computationally infeasible for the attacker to predict or control the cache key.
    *   **Include Additional Context:**  If the cached data depends on other factors (e.g., user location, language), include these factors in the key generation process to prevent cross-contamination.
    *   **Weakness:** If the input to the key generation is not properly sanitized, the key is still vulnerable.

### 4.5 Recommendations

1.  **Implement Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  This is the highest priority. Use a whitelist approach, context-specific escaping, and regular expressions to ensure that only safe data is used to generate cache keys and stored in the cache.
2.  **Use Cryptographic Hashing for Cache Keys:**  Hash the *sanitized* search query using a strong hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to generate cache keys. This prevents attackers from controlling the key.
3.  **Review and Refine Expiration Policies:**  Consider using `expireAfterAccess` in addition to `expireAfterWrite` to ensure that infrequently accessed entries are evicted more quickly.  Evaluate the optimal expiry time based on the application's needs and the potential impact of stale data.
4.  **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on the search endpoint to limit the number of requests from a single IP address or user.
5.  **Monitor Cache Behavior:**  Use Guava's `RemovalListener` to log cache evictions and removals.  This can help detect unusual activity, such as a large number of evictions or the presence of unexpected keys.
6.  **Security Testing:**  Regularly perform security testing, including penetration testing and fuzzing, to identify and address potential cache poisoning vulnerabilities.
7.  **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering out malicious requests before they reach the application.
8. **Consider using Cache Key Prefix/Namespace:** Add a prefix or namespace to your cache keys. This can help isolate different parts of your application and prevent accidental key collisions.

By implementing these recommendations, the application can significantly reduce its risk of cache poisoning attacks and improve its overall security posture. The combination of strong input validation, secure key generation, and appropriate cache management techniques is crucial for protecting against this type of vulnerability.
