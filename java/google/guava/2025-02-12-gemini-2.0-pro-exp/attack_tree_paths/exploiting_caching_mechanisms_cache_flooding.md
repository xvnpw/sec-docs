Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Cache Flooding" attack tree path, focusing on a Guava-based application, presented in Markdown format:

# Deep Analysis: Guava Cache Flooding Attack

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Cache Flooding" attack vector targeting a Guava-based caching implementation, identify specific vulnerabilities within the application's context, assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and recommend concrete actions to enhance the application's resilience against this attack.  We aim to go beyond the general description and delve into Guava-specific considerations.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Guava Caching:**  The analysis centers on applications using the Guava library (`com.google.common.cache`) for caching.  We will consider the `CacheBuilder` configuration and common usage patterns.
*   **Cache Flooding Attack:**  We will analyze the specific attack vector where an attacker overwhelms the cache with a large number of requests using unique, non-existent keys.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Impact:** The primary impact we are concerned with is the denial of service resulting from cache exhaustion and subsequent performance degradation or unavailability of the application.
*   **Application Context:** While a general analysis is provided, we will consider how the attack might manifest in different application scenarios (e.g., web applications, backend services).
* **Mitigation Effectiveness:** We will critically evaluate the proposed mitigations (`Limit cache size`, `Monitor cache usage`, `Rate Limiting`) in the context of Guava's capabilities and common application architectures.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Guava Cache Fundamentals Review:** Briefly review the core concepts of Guava's caching mechanism, including `CacheBuilder` options relevant to this attack.
2.  **Attack Vector Deep Dive:**  Analyze the mechanics of the cache flooding attack, considering how Guava's internal workings are affected.
3.  **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify specific configurations or usage patterns that increase the application's vulnerability to this attack.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** Evaluate the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation, considering Guava-specific implementation details and potential bypasses.
5.  **Recommendations:** Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating the risk, including code examples and configuration best practices.
6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Identify any remaining risks after implementing the recommendations.

## 2. Guava Cache Fundamentals Review

Guava's `CacheBuilder` provides a flexible and powerful way to create in-memory caches. Key configurations relevant to cache flooding include:

*   **`maximumSize(long)`:**  Specifies the maximum number of entries the cache can hold.  When the cache reaches this size, entries are evicted based on the configured eviction policy (typically LRU - Least Recently Used).
*   **`maximumWeight(long)` and `weigher(Weigher)`:**  Allows defining a maximum total "weight" for the cache, where each entry has an associated weight.  This is useful when entries have varying memory footprints.
*   **`expireAfterAccess(Duration)` and `expireAfterWrite(Duration)`:**  Set time-based expiration policies.  These are less directly relevant to cache flooding (which focuses on capacity exhaustion) but can play a role in overall cache management.
*   **`recordStats()`:** Enables statistics gathering, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting attacks.
* **`removalListener`**: Notifies when entry is removed from cache.

## 3. Attack Vector Deep Dive

The cache flooding attack exploits the finite capacity of the cache.  Here's how it works in the context of Guava:

1.  **Attacker Requests:** The attacker sends a large number of requests to the application, each requesting data associated with a *unique, non-existent key*.
2.  **Cache Misses:** For each request, the Guava cache experiences a "cache miss" because the requested key is not present.
3.  **Cache Insertion:**  The application, assuming it's designed to populate the cache on misses, fetches the (non-existent) data from the underlying data source (e.g., database, external API).  This fetch is likely to be relatively slow.
4.  **Cache Eviction:**  If the cache is configured with `maximumSize` or `maximumWeight`, and the influx of new entries exceeds the limit, Guava's eviction policy kicks in.  Legitimate, frequently accessed entries are evicted to make room for the attacker's useless entries.
5.  **Performance Degradation:**  The combination of frequent cache misses, slow data source fetches, and constant eviction leads to significant performance degradation.  The application becomes slow or unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service.
6. **Resource Exhaustion:** Even if the cache itself doesn't completely fill, the constant fetching from the underlying data source can exhaust resources there (e.g., database connections, network bandwidth).

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment

Several factors can increase an application's vulnerability:

*   **Unbounded Cache:**  A Guava cache configured *without* `maximumSize` or `maximumWeight` is highly vulnerable.  The attacker can consume all available memory.
*   **Large `maximumSize`:**  Even with a size limit, a very large `maximumSize` can still allow the attacker to consume significant resources before eviction starts.
*   **Inefficient Data Source Access:**  If fetching data from the underlying data source is slow or resource-intensive, the attack's impact is amplified.
*   **Lack of Monitoring:**  Without proper monitoring of cache statistics (hit rate, miss rate, eviction count), the attack may go unnoticed until it's too late.
*   **Predictable Key Generation:** If the application uses predictable key generation, the attacker might be able to pre-compute a set of keys that are guaranteed to cause cache misses.
* **No Rate Limiting:** Absence of rate limiting allows the attacker to send a flood of requests without any restrictions.

## 5. Mitigation Analysis

Let's analyze the proposed mitigations:

*   **`Limit cache size` (Highly Effective):**  This is the *primary* defense.  Using `maximumSize` or `maximumWeight` in `CacheBuilder` is crucial.  The size should be chosen carefully, balancing the benefits of caching with the risk of resource exhaustion.  A smaller cache is more resilient to flooding but may have a lower hit rate under normal operation.  This is a *necessary* but not *sufficient* mitigation.

    ```java
    Cache<Key, Value> cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
            .maximumSize(10000) // Limit to 10,000 entries
            .build();
    ```

*   **`Monitor cache usage` (Essential for Detection):**  Guava's `recordStats()` enables detailed statistics.  Monitoring these statistics is critical for detecting attacks and tuning the cache configuration.  Key metrics to watch:

    *   **Miss Rate:** A sudden spike in the miss rate is a strong indicator of a cache flooding attack.
    *   **Eviction Count:**  A high eviction count, especially when combined with a high miss rate, indicates that the cache is under pressure.
    *   **Load Average:** Increased load time indicates that the underlying data source is being heavily accessed.

    ```java
    Cache<Key, Value> cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
            .maximumSize(10000)
            .recordStats() // Enable statistics
            .build();

    // Later, access statistics:
    CacheStats stats = cache.stats();
    System.out.println("Miss rate: " + stats.missRate());
    System.out.println("Eviction count: " + stats.evictionCount());
    ```
    Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Micrometer) to collect and visualize these metrics. Set up alerts to trigger when thresholds are exceeded.

*   **`Rate Limiting` (Highly Effective - Prevents Flooding):**  This is a *crucial* mitigation that addresses the root cause of the attack: the flood of requests.  Rate limiting should be implemented *before* the request even reaches the caching layer.  This can be done using:

    *   **Guava's `RateLimiter` (Limited Scope):** Guava provides a `RateLimiter` class, but it's designed for *local*, in-process rate limiting.  It's *not* suitable for distributed rate limiting across multiple application instances.  It can be useful for protecting specific, internal resources, but it won't prevent an attacker from flooding the application as a whole.
    *   **Reverse Proxy/API Gateway (Recommended):**  The best approach is to use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) or an API gateway (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway) to implement rate limiting.  These tools can enforce rate limits based on IP address, API key, or other criteria, effectively preventing the flood of requests from reaching the application.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can also provide rate limiting capabilities and other security features to protect against various attacks.

## 6. Recommendations

1.  **Mandatory `maximumSize` or `maximumWeight`:**  Always configure Guava caches with a reasonable `maximumSize` or `maximumWeight`.  The specific value should be determined based on the application's memory constraints and expected workload.  Err on the side of a smaller cache size.

2.  **Implement Robust Rate Limiting:**  Use a reverse proxy, API gateway, or WAF to implement rate limiting *before* requests reach the application.  This is the most effective way to prevent the flood of requests that characterizes this attack.  Configure rate limits based on IP address, API key, or other relevant identifiers.

3.  **Enable and Monitor Cache Statistics:**  Use `recordStats()` in `CacheBuilder` and actively monitor cache statistics (miss rate, eviction count, load time) using a monitoring system.  Set up alerts to trigger when anomalies are detected.

4.  **Consider Time-Based Expiration:**  While not a direct defense against flooding, `expireAfterAccess` or `expireAfterWrite` can help to remove stale entries and reduce the overall memory footprint of the cache.

5.  **Secure Key Generation:**  Avoid predictable key generation schemes.  Use strong, random key generation to make it harder for attackers to pre-compute cache-missing keys.

6.  **Optimize Data Source Access:**  Ensure that fetching data from the underlying data source is as efficient as possible.  This reduces the impact of cache misses, whether they are caused by an attack or normal operation.  Consider database query optimization, connection pooling, and other performance tuning techniques.

7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including cache flooding.

8. **Removal Listener for Suspicious Activity:** Implement `removalListener` and analyze reasons of entries removal. If there is high rate of evictions due to `SIZE` you can log this event with higher severity.

## 7. Residual Risk Assessment

Even after implementing these recommendations, some residual risk remains:

*   **Sophisticated Attackers:**  A determined attacker might try to bypass rate limiting by using a distributed botnet or rotating IP addresses.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  There's always a possibility of undiscovered vulnerabilities in Guava or other libraries.
*   **Resource Exhaustion at Other Layers:**  The attacker might shift their focus to exhausting other resources, such as database connections or network bandwidth.

Therefore, a layered defense approach is essential.  Continuous monitoring, regular security updates, and a proactive security posture are crucial for mitigating these residual risks.
