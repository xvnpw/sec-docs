## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Caching Mechanisms: Cache Flooding](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_caching_mechanisms_cache_flooding.md)

**Description:** The attacker sends a large number of requests with different, likely non-existent, keys to the cache. This forces the cache to evict legitimate entries and consume memory, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Method:**  `Send large number of requests to fill cache`
- **Mitigation:** `Limit cache size`, `Monitor cache usage`, `Rate Limiting`
- **Why High-Risk:** Low effort, high impact (DoS), easy to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Caching Mechanisms: Cache Poisoning](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_caching_mechanisms_cache_poisoning.md)

**Description:** Attacker injects malicious entries into the cache, potentially leading to serving incorrect data or, in more complex scenarios, further exploitation.
- **Method:** `Inject malicious entries with long expiry`
- **Mitigation:** `Input validation`, `Rate limiting`, `limit cache size`, `use strong keys`
- **Why High-Risk:** Medium effort, medium to high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting EventBus: Malicious Event Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_eventbus_malicious_event_injection.md)

**Description:** The attacker registers a listener (or posts directly if allowed) and sends crafted events that trigger unintended behavior in event handlers. This could lead to information disclosure, DoS, or potentially even code execution if the handlers are vulnerable.
- **Method:** `Register malicious listener, then send crafted events`
- **Mitigation:** `Input validation on event types`, `Strict access control`
- **Why High-Risk:** Low to medium effort, potentially very high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting EventBus: EventBus DoS via Listener](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_eventbus_eventbus_dos_via_listener.md)

**Description:** The attacker registers a listener that performs expensive operations or intentionally blocks.  Then, the attacker floods the `EventBus` with events, overwhelming the system and causing a DoS.
- **Method:** `Flood with expensive events`
- **Mitigation:** `Rate limiting`, `Limit listeners`, `Monitor event processing time`
- **Why High-Risk:** Low effort, high impact (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Collection Utilities: Unbounded Collection Growth](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_collection_utilities_unbounded_collection_growth.md)

**Description:** The attacker provides input that causes the application to create extremely large or even infinitely growing collections (e.g., using `Multimap`, `Lists`, `Sets`). This leads to memory exhaustion and a DoS.
- **Method:** `Trigger creation of large/infinite collections (e.g., Multimap) via user input, leading to memory exhaustion`
- **Mitigation:** `Input validation`, `Limit collection size`, `Use bounded collections where possible`
- **Why High-Risk:** Very common vulnerability, low effort, high impact (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting `common.io` Utilities: Path Traversal via `Files.asByteSource()`](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting__common_io__utilities_path_traversal_via__files_asbytesource___.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `Files.asByteSource()` with user-supplied file paths without proper validation, the attacker can craft a path (using ".." sequences) to access files outside the intended directory. This can lead to information disclosure or potentially file modification/deletion.
- **Method:** `If application uses Files.asByteSource() with user-supplied paths without proper validation, craft a path to access files outside the intended directory`
- **Mitigation:** `Sanitize file paths`, `Use whitelisting`, `Avoid using user input directly`
- **Why High-Risk:** Well-known attack, low effort, high impact (information disclosure).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting `common.io` Utilities: Resource Exhaustion via `ByteStreams.copy()`](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting__common_io__utilities_resource_exhaustion_via__bytestreams_copy___.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `ByteStreams.copy()` with unbounded input streams (e.g., from a network connection), the attacker can provide a very large input stream, causing the application to consume excessive resources (disk space, memory), leading to a DoS.
- **Method:** `If application uses ByteStreams.copy() with unbounded input streams, trigger a large copy operation to exhaust resources (disk space, memory)`
- **Mitigation:** `Limit input stream size`, `Use timeouts`, `Monitor resource usage`
- **Why High-Risk:** Low effort, high impact (DoS).
