# Deep Analysis: Cache Poisoning/Pollution in Guava-based Applications

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the cache poisoning/pollution attack surface in applications utilizing the Google Guava `com.google.common.cache` library.  The goal is to identify specific vulnerabilities, understand their potential impact, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention.  We will go beyond the general description and delve into specific Guava features and coding practices that can lead to or mitigate this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target Library:** `com.google.common.cache` package within Google Guava.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. Guava Cache Fundamentals and Vulnerability Points

Guava's `Cache` interface and its implementations (primarily `LoadingCache` and `CacheBuilder`) provide a powerful and flexible caching mechanism.  However, this flexibility can be misused.  Key components and their relation to the vulnerability:

*   **`CacheLoader`:**  A `CacheLoader` is used to compute or retrieve the value associated with a key if it's not already present in the cache.  The `load(Key key)` method is crucial.  If the `key` is derived from untrusted input, and the `load` method uses this key to access external resources (database, file system, etc.), it creates a vulnerability.
*   **`CacheBuilder`:**  `CacheBuilder` is used to configure the cache's behavior.  Relevant configuration options include:
    *   `maximumSize(long)`: Limits the number of entries in the cache.  Failure to set this can lead to DoS.
    *   `expireAfterWrite(Duration)`:  Specifies how long an entry should remain in the cache after it's written.
    *   `expireAfterAccess(Duration)`: Specifies how long an entry should remain in the cache after it's last accessed.
    *   `weakKeys()`, `weakValues()`, `softValues()`:  These relate to garbage collection and are less directly related to cache poisoning, but improper use can lead to unexpected cache behavior.
*   **Key Generation:** This is the *most critical* aspect.  The `Key` object used in `cache.get(Key)` and `cache.put(Key, Value)` is where the vulnerability lies.  If this key is directly or indirectly derived from user input without proper sanitization, validation, or transformation, it opens the door to cache poisoning.

### 4.2. Specific Vulnerability Scenarios

Let's examine some concrete scenarios:

**Scenario 1: User ID as Cache Key (Direct Input)**

```java
// VULNERABLE CODE
LoadingCache<String, UserProfile> userProfileCache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
        .maximumSize(1000)
        .build(new CacheLoader<String, UserProfile>() {
            @Override
            public UserProfile load(String userId) throws Exception {
                return database.getUserProfile(userId); // userId directly from user input
            }
        });

// Attacker input:  userId = "../../../etc/passwd"
// Result:  Potentially retrieves the contents of /etc/passwd (if database.getUserProfile is vulnerable to path traversal).
```

**Scenario 2:  Complex Object as Key (Insufficient `hashCode` and `equals`)**

```java
// VULNERABLE CODE
class UserRequest {
    private String username;
    private String parameter; // Untrusted parameter

    // ... getters and setters ...

    // Missing or poorly implemented hashCode() and equals() methods!
}

LoadingCache<UserRequest, Result> requestCache = ...;

// Attacker 1:  new UserRequest("user1", "param1")
// Attacker 2:  new UserRequest("user1", "param2")

// Result:  If hashCode() and equals() only consider 'username', both requests might hit the same cache entry,
// leading to incorrect results or information disclosure.
```

**Scenario 3:  DoS via Large Keys**

```java
// VULNERABLE CODE
LoadingCache<String, Data> dataCache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
        .maximumSize(10000) // Not sufficient for extremely long keys
        .build(new CacheLoader<String, Data>() {
            @Override
            public Data load(String key) throws Exception {
                return processData(key);
            }
        });

// Attacker input:  key = "a" * 1000000  (a very long string)
// Result:  The cache key consumes a large amount of memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.
//           Even with a maximumSize, the *size* of the keys themselves can cause issues.
```

**Scenario 4: Deserialization of Cached Objects**
If cached objects are created from untrusted source and then deserialized, it can lead to remote code execution.

### 4.3.  Mitigation Technique Evaluation

Let's revisit the mitigation strategies and evaluate them in the context of Guava:

*   **Sanitize and Validate Input:**  This is *essential*.  Before using *any* user-supplied data in key generation, apply strict validation:
    *   **Whitelist:**  Define a set of allowed characters or patterns (e.g., alphanumeric, UUID format).
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce maximum lengths for input strings.
    *   **Type Checking:**  Ensure the input is of the expected type (e.g., integer, string).
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate the input format.

*   **Use Trusted Key Sources:**  This is the *best practice*.  Instead of using the raw user input, derive the key from internal, trusted data.  For example:
    *   **Database Primary Keys:**  If you're caching database records, use the database's primary key (which is usually an auto-incrementing integer) as the cache key.
    *   **Session IDs (with caution):**  If the data is specific to a user session, you *could* use the session ID, but ensure the session ID itself is securely generated and managed.
    *   **Internal Identifiers:**  Generate unique, internal identifiers for objects and use those as keys.

*   **Hash Input:**  Hashing the user input with a strong cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256) provides several benefits:
    *   **Fixed Size:**  The hash will always be a fixed size, preventing DoS attacks based on large keys.
    *   **Collision Resistance:**  A good hash function makes it computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash (collision).
    *   **One-Way Function:**  It's impossible to reverse the hash to obtain the original input.
    *   **Example:**
        ```java
        String userInput = ...; // Untrusted input
        String cacheKey = Hashing.sha256().hashString(userInput, StandardCharsets.UTF_8).toString();
        ```

*   **Implement Cache Limits:**  Always configure `maximumSize`, `expireAfterWrite`, and `expireAfterAccess` appropriately for your application's needs.  This prevents cache exhaustion and ensures that stale data is eventually evicted.  Consider the size of both keys *and* values when setting `maximumSize`.  Use `Weigher` if the size of cached objects varies significantly.

*   **Monitor Cache Behavior:**  Guava provides statistics that can be used for monitoring:
    *   `cache.stats()`:  Returns a `CacheStats` object with information like hit count, miss count, load success count, load exception count, total load time, and eviction count.
    *   Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track these metrics and set up alerts for anomalies (e.g., a sudden drop in hit rate or a spike in eviction count).

### 4.4. Best Practices

1.  **Never use raw, untrusted user input directly as a cache key.**
2.  **Prefer generating cache keys from trusted, internal data sources.**
3.  **If user input *must* be part of the key, sanitize, validate, and hash it using a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256).**
4.  **Always configure `maximumSize` and appropriate expiration policies (`expireAfterWrite`, `expireAfterAccess`).**
5.  **Ensure that `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods are correctly implemented for any custom objects used as cache keys.**  These methods *must* be consistent and consider all relevant fields.
6.  **Monitor cache statistics in production to detect anomalies and potential attacks.**
7.  **Consider using a `Weigher` if the size of cached objects varies significantly.**
8.  **Avoid caching sensitive data unless absolutely necessary. If you must cache sensitive data, ensure it is encrypted and that the cache is properly secured.**
9.  **Be extremely cautious when deserializing cached data.  If the data originated from an untrusted source, it could be a vector for code execution.** Use safe deserialization techniques.

### 4.5. Tooling and Monitoring Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs, SpotBugs, SonarQube) to identify potential vulnerabilities related to input validation and cache key generation.  Create custom rules to flag direct use of user input in cache keys.
*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test for cache poisoning vulnerabilities during runtime.
*   **Monitoring Systems:**  Integrate Guava's cache statistics with a monitoring system like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.  Set up alerts for:
    *   Low hit rates.
    *   High miss rates.
    *   High eviction counts.
    *   Long load times.
*   **Logging:** Log cache key generation and access patterns to help with debugging and auditing.  Be careful not to log sensitive data.
*  **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, including penetration testing, to identify and address cache poisoning vulnerabilities.
