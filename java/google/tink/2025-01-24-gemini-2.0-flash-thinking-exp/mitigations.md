### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Key Storage using a Key Management System (KMS) for Tink Keysets

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Tink's KMS Integration:**  Leverage Tink's built-in support for Key Management Systems (KMS) like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or Azure Key Vault. Tink provides specific APIs and key URI formats to interact with these KMS solutions.
    2.  **Store Tink Keysets in KMS:** Instead of storing Tink keysets locally as files or in databases, store them directly within the chosen KMS. Use KMS Key URIs when initializing Tink primitives to instruct Tink to fetch keysets from the KMS.
    3.  **Configure KMS Permissions for Tink Application:** Grant your application's service account or IAM role the necessary permissions within the KMS to access (e.g., `kms:GenerateDataKey`, `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`) the Tink keysets stored there. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    4.  **Avoid Local Key Material Handling:** Minimize or eliminate the need to handle raw key material directly in your application code. Rely on Tink's KMS integration to abstract away key retrieval and management.
    5.  **Leverage Tink's `KmsEnvelopeAead` (or similar):** For envelope encryption, consider using Tink's `KmsEnvelopeAead` primitive (or similar KMS-integrated primitives) which directly integrates with KMS for key wrapping and unwrapping, further reducing local key handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Hardcoded Keys in Tink Keysets (Severity: High):**  While Tink discourages hardcoding keys directly in code, improper keyset creation or manual key management could lead to accidentally embedding keys in configuration files or code. KMS integration prevents this by centralizing key storage.
    *   **Compromised Local Keyset Storage (Severity: High):** If Tink keysets are stored locally (e.g., in files), they are vulnerable to compromise if the application server is breached. KMS provides a hardened, centralized storage solution.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Tink Keysets (Severity: Medium):** Local keyset files might be accessible to unauthorized users or processes on the application server. KMS access control mechanisms provide finer-grained control.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Hardcoded Keys in Tink Keysets: **Significantly reduces risk.** KMS enforces separation of keys from application code and configuration.
    *   Compromised Local Keyset Storage: **Significantly reduces risk.** Offloads keyset security to a dedicated, hardened KMS infrastructure.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Tink Keysets: **Significantly reduces risk.** KMS access policies provide robust access control compared to file system permissions.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Assume: Currently implemented for database encryption keys using AWS KMS. Tink's `KmsEnvelopeAead` is used for database encryption, with keysets stored in KMS and accessed via Key URIs.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing for API communication keys. API keysets are currently managed as local files and loaded by Tink from the filesystem. This needs to be migrated to KMS for consistent and secure key management using Tink's KMS integration features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Tink's Key Rotation within Keysets](./mitigation_strategies/implement_tink's_key_rotation_within_keysets.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Tink's Key Rotation within Keysets

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Tink's Keyset Rotation Features:**  Leverage Tink's built-in keyset rotation capabilities. Tink keysets are designed to hold multiple keys, with one designated as the "primary" key for encryption/signing.
    2.  **Programmatic Keyset Rotation via Tink API:** Use Tink's API to programmatically rotate keys within a keyset. This typically involves:
        *   Generating a new key using Tink's `KeysetHandle` and appropriate `KeyTemplate`.
        *   Adding the new key to the existing keyset using `keysetHandle.addKey()`.
        *   Setting the new key as the primary key using `keysetHandle.rotate()`.
        *   Persisting the updated keyset (preferably back to KMS if KMS is used for storage).
    3.  **Automate Tink Keyset Rotation:** Implement an automated process to periodically trigger Tink keyset rotation. This can be a scheduled job or a triggered event.
    4.  **Graceful Key Transition (Tink's Built-in):** Tink's keyset structure inherently supports graceful key transition.  Older keys in the keyset remain valid for decryption/verification, ensuring backwards compatibility during rotation.
    5.  **Monitor Tink Keyset Rotation:** Monitor the automated keyset rotation process for any errors or failures. Log rotation events for auditing and security tracking.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Long-Term Key Compromise (Severity: Medium to High):**  Even with secure storage, keys can be compromised over time. Regular rotation, facilitated by Tink's features, limits the lifespan of individual keys.
    *   **Impact of Single Key Compromise (Severity: High):** If a key is compromised, regular rotation reduces the amount of data and the duration of exposure, as older data encrypted with rotated keys remains secure.
    *   **Algorithm Weakness Over Time (Severity: Medium):** Cryptographic algorithms can become weaker over time due to advances in cryptanalysis. Key rotation allows for transitioning to newer, stronger algorithms if needed (though algorithm migration in Tink is a separate, more complex process).

*   **Impact:**
    *   Long-Term Key Compromise: **Significantly reduces risk.** Tink's rotation features make regular key updates operationally feasible.
    *   Impact of Single Key Compromise: **Significantly reduces risk.** Limits the blast radius of a key compromise.
    *   Algorithm Weakness Over Time: **Minimally reduces risk.**  Key rotation itself doesn't directly address algorithm weakness, but it's a prerequisite for algorithm migration if needed in the future.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Assume: Key rotation is partially implemented for database encryption keys, with manual rotation using a script that leverages Tink's API to rotate keysets.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Automate the Tink keyset rotation process for database keys. Implement Tink keyset rotation for API communication keys, which currently use static keysets.  Need to fully automate the rotation workflow using Tink's API and potentially integrate with a scheduler.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Reviews Focused on Correct Tink API Usage and Security Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/code_reviews_focused_on_correct_tink_api_usage_and_security_configurations.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Code Reviews Focused on Correct Tink API Usage and Security Configurations

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Tink-Specific Security Checklist for Code Reviews:** Develop a code review checklist specifically focused on secure Tink usage. This checklist should include items such as:
        *   **Correct Key Template Selection:** Verify that appropriate Tink `KeyTemplate`s are used for the intended cryptographic operations, aligning with security best practices and avoiding weak or deprecated algorithms.
        *   **Proper Primitive Instantiation:** Ensure Tink primitives (e.g., `Aead`, `Mac`, `Signature`) are instantiated correctly using `KeysetHandle.getPrimitive()` and appropriate configurations.
        *   **Secure Keyset Handling:** Verify that keysets are handled securely, loaded from KMS (if applicable), and never hardcoded or exposed in logs.
        *   **Error Handling for Tink Operations:** Check for proper error handling around Tink API calls, ensuring exceptions are caught and handled gracefully without revealing sensitive information.
        *   **Compliance with Tink Best Practices:** Review code for adherence to Tink's documented best practices and security recommendations.
    2.  **Train Reviewers on Tink Security:** Provide training to code reviewers on Tink's API, security considerations, and common pitfalls when using cryptographic libraries. Focus on Tink-specific security aspects.
    3.  **Dedicated Tink Security Review Section:**  Incorporate a dedicated section in code review processes specifically for reviewing Tink-related code and configurations against the checklist.
    4.  **Utilize Tink's Example Code and Documentation:** Encourage reviewers to refer to Tink's official documentation and example code to verify correct API usage and best practices.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misuse of Tink APIs Leading to Weak Security (Severity: Medium to High):** Incorrectly using Tink APIs, such as choosing weak key templates or improper primitive instantiation, can undermine the security provided by Tink.
    *   **Configuration Errors in Tink Usage (Severity: Medium):**  Misconfigurations in how Tink is set up and used (e.g., incorrect key management, improper algorithm choices) can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developer Errors in Tink Integration (Severity: Medium):**  General coding errors when integrating Tink into the application can lead to security flaws, even if Tink itself is used correctly in isolation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Misuse of Tink APIs Leading to Weak Security: **Partially reduces risk.** Code reviews can catch common API misuse errors and ensure stronger cryptographic configurations are used.
    *   Configuration Errors in Tink Usage: **Partially reduces risk.** Reviews can identify misconfigurations and ensure Tink is set up securely.
    *   Developer Errors in Tink Integration: **Partially reduces risk.** Code reviews help catch general coding errors that might have security implications in the context of Tink integration.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Assume: Standard code reviews are conducted, but there is no specific focus or checklist for Tink security. Reviewers may have general security awareness but lack specific Tink expertise.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop and implement a Tink-specific security checklist for code reviews. Provide targeted training to reviewers on Tink security best practices.  Integrate the Tink security checklist into the standard code review process and ensure reviewers are trained to use it effectively.
