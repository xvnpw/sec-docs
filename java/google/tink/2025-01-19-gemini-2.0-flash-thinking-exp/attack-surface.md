# Attack Surface Analysis for google/tink

## Attack Surface: [Weak Key Generation](./attack_surfaces/weak_key_generation.md)

**Description:** The process of creating cryptographic keys lacks sufficient randomness or uses predictable methods, making the keys easier to guess or compromise.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Incorrect usage of Tink's key templates or manual key creation without leveraging Tink's secure generators can lead to weak keys.

**Example:** An application uses a Tink key template but doesn't properly initialize the `KeyGenerator` or relies on a weak system random number generator, resulting in predictable keys.

**Impact:** Compromised keys can allow attackers to decrypt sensitive data, forge signatures, or impersonate users.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Tink's recommended `KeyGenerator` classes and ensure they are properly initialized.
*   Rely on Tink's built-in key templates for secure default configurations.
*   Avoid manual key creation unless absolutely necessary and with a thorough understanding of cryptographic best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Key Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_key_storage.md)

**Description:** Cryptographic keys are stored in a way that allows unauthorized access.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the application developer doesn't use Tink's secure key management features or stores exported keys insecurely, it creates a significant vulnerability.

**Example:** An application uses `CleartextKeysetHandle.write` to store a keyset in a configuration file accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact:** Direct access to keys allows attackers to bypass all cryptographic protections.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Tink's recommended key management solutions, such as integration with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or secure key vaults.
*   Encrypt keys at rest using strong encryption algorithms and securely managed encryption keys.
*   Avoid storing keys directly in application code or configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Key Rotation](./attack_surfaces/improper_key_rotation.md)

**Description:** Cryptographic keys are not periodically changed or updated, increasing the risk of compromise over time.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Failure to rotate keys or insecure rotation processes when using Tink's key sets can leave the application vulnerable.

**Example:** An application uses a single Tink key for encryption for an extended period without any rotation strategy, increasing the risk if that key is ever compromised.

**Impact:** Prolonged use of a compromised key allows attackers extended access to sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a robust key rotation policy, defining the frequency and process for rotating keys.
*   Leverage Tink's key set management features to manage multiple key versions during rotation.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Key Sets/Keys](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_key_setskeys.md)

**Description:** The application deserializes Tink `Keyset` or `Key` objects from untrusted sources, potentially leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tink allows for serialization and deserialization of key sets and individual keys. If an application deserializes these objects from untrusted input without proper validation, it can be vulnerable to attacks exploiting the deserialization process.

**Example:** An application receives a serialized `Keyset` from a remote, untrusted service and directly deserializes it using Tink's `read` methods without any integrity checks.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or other arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never deserialize `Keyset` or `Key` objects from untrusted sources.**
*   If deserialization from external sources is absolutely necessary, implement strong integrity checks (e.g., using MACs or digital signatures) on the serialized data *before* deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Primitive Selection or Configuration](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_primitive_selection_or_configuration.md)

**Description:** The application uses inappropriate cryptographic primitives or configures them incorrectly, leading to weakened security.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If the application developer chooses a weaker algorithm than necessary or misconfigures the parameters of a primitive offered by Tink, the security provided by Tink is compromised.

**Example:** An application uses the `AES128_EAX` key template when `AES256_GCM` is required for the sensitivity of the data, or sets an insufficient tag size for a MAC primitive provided by Tink.

**Impact:** Data breaches, authentication bypass, or other security failures due to weak cryptography.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully evaluate the security requirements and choose appropriate Tink primitives and key templates based on those requirements.
*   Adhere to security best practices and recommendations for configuring cryptographic parameters within Tink.
*   Consult with security experts when selecting and configuring cryptographic primitives provided by Tink.
