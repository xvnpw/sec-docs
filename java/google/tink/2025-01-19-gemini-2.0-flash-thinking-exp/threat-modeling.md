# Threat Model Analysis for google/tink

## Threat: [Insecure Key Storage](./threats/insecure_key_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of Tink keys. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the storage system, gaining access to the server's filesystem, or through social engineering. Once the keys are obtained, the attacker can decrypt sensitive data, forge signatures, or perform other cryptographic operations as if they were a legitimate user.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of cryptographic security. Attackers can decrypt all data protected by the stolen key, impersonate legitimate users by forging signatures, and potentially manipulate data without detection. This can lead to significant financial loss, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.

**Affected Tink Component:** Key Management API, Keyset Handle, specific Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) if used for key derivation from a master key.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store Tink keys in secure storage solutions like Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or cloud-based Key Management Services (KMS).
*   Encrypt keys at rest using strong encryption algorithms and separate key management.
*   Implement strict access controls to the key storage location, limiting access to only authorized personnel and systems.
*   Regularly audit access logs to the key storage.

## Threat: [Insufficient Key Rotation](./threats/insufficient_key_rotation.md)

**Description:** Keys used by Tink are not rotated regularly. Over time, the risk of key compromise increases due to potential cryptanalysis advancements, insider threats, or exposure through other means. An attacker who gains access to an old key can potentially decrypt past data or forge signatures from the past.

**Impact:** Increased risk of key compromise over time. If a key is compromised, a larger amount of historical data might be affected. Repudiation issues can arise if signature keys are compromised.

**Affected Tink Component:** Key Management API, Keyset Handle, Key Templates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a robust key rotation policy defining the frequency of key rotation for different key types.
*   Automate the key rotation process using Tink's key management features or external key management systems.
*   Ensure a smooth transition during key rotation to avoid service disruption.
*   Archive old keys securely for potential future needs (e.g., legal compliance) but ensure they are not actively used.

## Threat: [Key Leakage during Generation or Transfer](./threats/key_leakage_during_generation_or_transfer.md)

**Description:** Tink keys are exposed during the key generation process or while being transferred between different components or systems. This could happen through insecure network protocols, logging sensitive key material, or vulnerabilities in the key generation process itself. An attacker intercepting the key can then compromise the cryptographic operations.

**Impact:** Direct compromise of the key material, allowing attackers to decrypt data or forge signatures.

**Affected Tink Component:** Key Generation API (e.g., `KeysetHandle.generateNew()`), potentially the underlying cryptographic primitives used for key generation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Generate keys within secure environments, ideally within HSMs or secure enclaves.
*   Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS with mutual authentication) for key transfer.
*   Avoid logging or storing key material in transit.
*   Implement secure key exchange mechanisms if keys need to be transferred between systems.

## Threat: [Use of Weak or Deprecated Algorithms](./threats/use_of_weak_or_deprecated_algorithms.md)

**Description:** Developers configure Tink to use cryptographic algorithms or key sizes that are known to be weak or have been deprecated due to security vulnerabilities. An attacker with sufficient resources can potentially break the encryption or forge signatures using these weak algorithms.

**Impact:** Reduced security strength of cryptographic operations, potentially leading to data breaches or the ability to forge digital signatures.

**Affected Tink Component:** Key Templates, Registry (for algorithm registration), specific cryptographic primitive implementations (e.g., in `tink-java-core` or algorithm-specific Tink libraries).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to Tink's recommended algorithm suites and key templates.
*   Regularly review and update Tink configurations based on current security best practices and NIST recommendations.
*   Avoid using deprecated algorithms.
*   Utilize Tink's built-in safeguards against using insecure algorithms where available.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Tink Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_tink_library_itself.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities are discovered within the Tink library code itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass cryptographic protections, cause denial of service, or potentially gain remote code execution depending on the nature of the flaw.

**Impact:** Wide-ranging impact depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to complete system compromise or data breaches.

**Affected Tink Component:** Any part of the Tink library, including core components, cryptographic primitive implementations, and API interfaces.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if a severe vulnerability is found)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest Tink releases and security advisories from the Tink team.
*   Subscribe to security mailing lists or monitoring services for notifications about Tink vulnerabilities.
*   Apply security patches and updates promptly.
*   Consider contributing to or auditing the Tink codebase to help identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Bugs in Tink's API Usage](./threats/bugs_in_tink's_api_usage.md)

**Description:** Developers incorrectly use Tink's API, leading to unintended security weaknesses. This could involve improper handling of `KeysetHandle` objects, incorrect usage of cryptographic primitives, or failure to handle exceptions properly.

**Impact:** Potential for bypassing cryptographic protections, leaking sensitive information, or introducing vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

**Affected Tink Component:** Various Tink API classes and methods, depending on the specific usage error. Examples include `AeadFactory.getPrimitive()`, `PublicKeySign.sign()`, `DeterministicAead.encryptDeterministically()`, and `KeysetHandle` methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly understand Tink's API documentation and best practices.
*   Follow secure coding guidelines when integrating Tink into the application.
*   Conduct code reviews specifically focusing on Tink integration and usage patterns.
*   Implement unit and integration tests to verify the correct usage of Tink's API.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Tink or its Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_tink_or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the development or distribution pipeline of Tink or one of its dependencies, injecting malicious code into the library. This malicious code could then be executed within the application using the compromised library.

**Impact:** Severe compromise of the application's security, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or complete system takeover.

**Affected Tink Component:** The entire Tink library or the compromised dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use trusted sources for obtaining Tink and its dependencies (e.g., official repositories).
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded libraries using checksums or digital signatures.
*   Implement security measures in the development and build pipeline to prevent the introduction of malicious code.
*   Consider using software bill of materials (SBOM) to track the components used in the application.
