# Attack Surface Analysis for google/tink

## Attack Surface: [Key Material Exposure](./attack_surfaces/key_material_exposure.md)

**Description:** Secret cryptographic keys managed by Tink are unintentionally revealed to unauthorized parties.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tink manages cryptographic keys through `Keyset` objects. Improper handling, insecure storage, or accidental disclosure of these objects directly exposes the key material.

**Example:** A developer serializes a `Keyset` containing private keys without encryption or stores it in a publicly accessible location.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the cryptographic scheme, allowing attackers to decrypt data, forge signatures, and impersonate users.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Tink's recommended secure key management solutions, such as using `CleartextKeysetHandle.write` with proper encryption (e.g., envelope encryption with a KMS).
* Integrate with dedicated Key Management Systems (KMS) for storing and managing keys.
* Avoid storing keys directly in code, configuration files, or databases without robust encryption.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Cryptographic Primitive Usage](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_cryptographic_primitive_usage.md)

**Description:** Developers select and use a cryptographic primitive provided by Tink that is not appropriate for the intended security goal.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tink offers a variety of cryptographic primitives. Choosing the wrong primitive through Tink's API directly leads to weakened security.

**Example:** Using a Message Authentication Code (MAC) provided by Tink for confidentiality instead of an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) primitive also provided by Tink.

**Impact:** Weakened or non-existent confidentiality or integrity guarantees, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly understand the security properties of each Tink primitive before implementation.
* Follow Tink's recommended best practices and guidance on choosing the appropriate primitive for specific use cases.
* Utilize Tink's recommended key templates as a starting point.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Parameterization of Cryptographic Operations](./attack_surfaces/improper_parameterization_of_cryptographic_operations.md)

**Description:** Even with the correct cryptographic primitive from Tink, incorrect parameter settings provided to Tink's APIs can weaken or negate the security benefits.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tink's APIs require developers to provide parameters for cryptographic operations. Incorrectly setting these parameters through Tink's API directly introduces vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Using a too-short nonce with a Tink AEAD primitive, leading to nonce reuse and potential key recovery.

**Impact:** Reduced security strength, potentially allowing attackers to bypass cryptographic protections implemented through Tink.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Adhere strictly to Tink's recommended parameter settings and best practices.
* Use Tink's provided key templates, which often include secure default parameters.
* Implement thorough testing to ensure correct parameter usage with Tink's APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Key Derivation Function (KDF) Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/key_derivation_function__kdf__weaknesses.md)

**Description:** When using Tink for password-based encryption or key derivation, weak KDFs provided by Tink or insufficient parameters used with Tink's KDFs can make keys susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tink provides KDF implementations. Choosing a weak KDF or using insufficient parameters (salt, iterations) through Tink's API directly impacts the security of derived keys.

**Example:** Using a simple hash function as a KDF through Tink without a proper salt or with a low iteration count.

**Impact:** Exposure of derived keys, allowing attackers to decrypt data or gain unauthorized access.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize strong, well-vetted KDFs like Argon2id provided by Tink.
* Use sufficiently long and randomly generated salts when using Tink's KDFs.
* Employ a high enough number of iterations (work factor) when configuring Tink's KDFs.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Tink's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_tink's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in the underlying cryptographic libraries or other dependencies used by Tink can indirectly expose the application to attacks.

**How Tink Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Tink relies on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a direct consequence of using Tink and its chosen dependencies.

**Example:** A known vulnerability in BoringSSL, which Tink might depend on, could be exploited to compromise cryptographic operations performed using Tink.

**Impact:** Potential compromise of cryptographic operations, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Tink to the latest version to benefit from dependency updates and security patches.
* Monitor security advisories for Tink and its dependencies.
* Employ dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Tink's dependencies.
