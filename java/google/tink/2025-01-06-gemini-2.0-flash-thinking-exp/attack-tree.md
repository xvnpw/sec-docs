*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Key Storage Mechanism:**
    *   Insecure file permissions on the key storage location, allowing unauthorized read access.
    *   Misconfigured cloud storage buckets exposing key files publicly.
    *   Lack of encryption for keys at rest.
    *   Using default or weak credentials for accessing key storage.
*   **Exploit Application Vulnerabilities to Read Key Files/Secrets:**
    *   Path traversal vulnerabilities allowing access to files outside the intended directory.
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to read key files from internal storage.
    *   SQL Injection or other injection vulnerabilities to extract keys from a database.
    *   Information disclosure vulnerabilities leaking key material in error messages or logs.

*   Compromise KMS Credentials:
    *   Phishing attacks targeting users with KMS access.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems where KMS credentials are stored.
    *   Brute-force attacks on weak KMS credentials.

*   Using insecure or default initialization vectors (IVs):
    *   Using a fixed IV for multiple encryption operations with the same key, leading to predictable ciphertext patterns.
    *   Using predictable IVs based on time or other easily guessable values.
    *   Not using authenticated encryption modes when required, making the system vulnerable to manipulation even with IV reuse.

*   Circumvent Tink's Key Access Control:
    *   Exploiting flaws in the application's authorization logic that governs access to Tink keys.
    *   Bypassing checks that ensure only authorized components can use specific keys.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow execution of code with elevated privileges, bypassing access controls.

*   Insecure Handling of Encrypted Data:
    *   Storing encrypted data in logs without proper redaction.
    *   Exposing encrypted data in temporary files or during data transfer without additional protection.
    *   Displaying encrypted data in user interfaces or error messages.

*   Improper Key Derivation or Storage in Custom Components:
    *   Using weak or easily reversible methods for deriving keys from master secrets.
    *   Storing derived keys in insecure locations (e.g., configuration files, environment variables without proper protection).
    *   Implementing custom key management logic that is vulnerable to attacks.
