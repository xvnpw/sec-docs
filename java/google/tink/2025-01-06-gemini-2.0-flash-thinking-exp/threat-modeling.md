# Threat Model Analysis for google/tink

## Threat: [Predictable Key Material Generation](./threats/predictable_key_material_generation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might be able to predict the key material generated by Tink if the application uses a weak or flawed source of randomness *within the context of Tink's key generation*, or if the key generation parameters *as used with Tink* are not correctly configured. This could allow the attacker to decrypt encrypted data or forge signatures.
*   **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality and integrity of data protected by the affected keys.
*   **Affected Tink Component:** Key generation functions within various Tink primitives (e.g., `KeyGenerator.generateNewKey()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the application leverages Tink's recommended key generation methods, which use cryptographically secure random number generators *provided by Tink*.
    *   Do not implement custom key generation logic for Tink keys unless with expert cryptographic knowledge *and understanding of Tink's requirements*.
    *   Review and adhere to Tink's recommendations for key size and parameter selection for different primitives.

## Threat: [Storing Keys in Plaintext or Insecurely](./threats/storing_keys_in_plaintext_or_insecurely.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly store Tink keys directly in code, configuration files, or databases without proper encryption or protection. An attacker gaining access to these storage locations could retrieve the keys *managed by Tink*.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all data protected by the exposed keys.
*   **Affected Tink Component:** `KeysetHandle` and any methods used to serialize or persist keys (e.g., `writeTo()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** store Tink keys in plaintext.
    *   Utilize Tink's recommended key management solutions like `CleartextKeysetHandle.write()` only for testing or in highly controlled environments.
    *   Employ secure key storage mechanisms like cloud-based Key Management Services (KMS) or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and integrate them with Tink's key management APIs.
    *   Encrypt keys at rest using a separate, strong encryption key *before or during handling with Tink's persistence mechanisms*.

## Threat: [Incorrect Usage of Cryptographic Primitives](./threats/incorrect_usage_of_cryptographic_primitives.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might misuse Tink's API, leading to insecure cryptographic operations. This could involve incorrect parameter settings *within Tink's function calls*, improper chaining of operations *using Tink primitives*, or misunderstanding the security guarantees of a particular primitive *offered by Tink*.
*   **Impact:** Weakened or broken cryptographic protection, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
*   **Affected Tink Component:** All Tink cryptographic primitives (e.g., `Aead`, `Mac`, `Signature`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly understand the documentation and usage guidelines for each Tink primitive.
    *   Follow the recommended patterns and examples provided by Tink.
    *   Implement unit and integration tests to verify the correct usage of Tink's cryptographic functions.
    *   Seek expert review of cryptographic code that utilizes Tink.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Tink Library Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_tink_library_code.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered security vulnerabilities might exist within the Tink library itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass cryptographic protections or gain unauthorized access *through flaws in Tink's implementation*.
*   **Impact:** Potentially widespread compromise of applications using the vulnerable version of Tink.
*   **Affected Tink Component:** Any part of the Tink library codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Tink library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor Tink's security advisories and release notes for information on known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application's dependencies, specifically focusing on Tink.
