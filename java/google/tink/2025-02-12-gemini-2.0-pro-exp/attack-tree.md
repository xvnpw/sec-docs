## Attack Tree Path: [1. Key Compromise [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__key_compromise__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category encompassing all methods by which an attacker gains unauthorized access to the cryptographic keys used by Tink. It's a critical node because possessing the keys grants the attacker full control over the protected data. It's high-risk due to the prevalence of key compromise attacks.
*   **Sub-Vectors (High-Risk):**

## Attack Tree Path: [1b. Key Leakage (External to Tink) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1b__key_leakage__external_to_tink___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This refers to the accidental or malicious exposure of the cryptographic keys outside of the intended secure environment. This is *not* a Tink vulnerability itself, but it completely undermines Tink's security.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Storing cleartext keysets in source code repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    *   Hardcoding keys in configuration files that are not properly secured.
    *   Accidental logging of keyset data.
    *   Compromise of the Key Management Service (KMS) used to encrypt the keyset (e.g., AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Phishing attacks targeting developers or administrators with access to keys.
    *   Insider threats (malicious or negligent employees).
    *   Exposure through insecure backups.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High (Complete loss of confidentiality and integrity.)
*   **Effort:** Varies widely (from trivial to very difficult, depending on the security measures in place).
*   **Skill Level:** Varies widely (from script kiddie to nation-state actor).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies widely (from easy to detect if keys are in plaintext in source code, to extremely difficult if a sophisticated KMS compromise occurs).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never store cleartext keysets:** Always use a KMS to encrypt keysets at rest.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use secure methods for storing and retrieving configuration data (e.g., environment variables, secrets management services).
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to access keysets and the KMS.  Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Auditing and Monitoring:** Enable audit logs for KMS access and monitor for suspicious activity. Implement intrusion detection systems.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all accounts with access to keys or the KMS.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
    *   **Employee Training:** Train employees on secure coding practices and the importance of protecting cryptographic keys.
    *   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle key compromise incidents.
    *   **Secure Backup and Recovery:** Implement secure backup and recovery procedures for keysets, ensuring that backups are also encrypted and protected.
    * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all the inputs that are used to generate keys.

## Attack Tree Path: [1c. Key Reuse (Across Contexts) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1c__key_reuse__across_contexts___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Using the same cryptographic key for multiple different purposes or applications. This significantly increases the impact of a single key compromise. If one application or service is compromised, all others using the same key are also vulnerable.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Using the same AEAD keyset to encrypt both user data and application logs.
    *   Using the same signing key for multiple microservices.
    *   Using the same key for both development and production environments.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake, especially in larger, complex systems.)
*   **Impact:** High (Compromise of one context leads to compromise of *all* contexts using the same key.)
*   **Effort:** Low (Once one context is compromised, the attacker has the key for all others.)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Exploiting key reuse is trivial once the key is obtained.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful analysis of key usage across the entire system. Difficult to detect at runtime without specific instrumentation.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Key Isolation:** Use separate keysets for different applications, services, and even different types of data within the same application.  This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Context Binding:** If possible, cryptographically bind the key to the specific context using associated data in AEAD. This helps prevent misuse even if the key is leaked.
    *   **Key Derivation:** Use key derivation functions (KDFs) to derive different keys from a single master key, ensuring that each derived key is used for a specific purpose.
    *   **Policy Enforcement:** Implement policies and procedures to prevent key reuse, and enforce them through code reviews and automated checks.
    *   **Documentation and Training:** Clearly document the importance of key isolation and provide training to developers.
