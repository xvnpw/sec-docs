# BUSINESS POSTURE

The primary business priority for the Tink project is to provide a secure, easy-to-use, and open-source cryptographic library for developers. The goal is to enable developers to easily integrate robust cryptography into their applications, reducing the likelihood of cryptographic misuse and improving overall application security.

The most important business risks associated with Tink are:

- Risk of vulnerabilities in the Tink library itself, which could be exploited by attackers to compromise applications using Tink.
- Risk of developers misusing the Tink library, leading to insecure cryptographic implementations in their applications.
- Risk of supply chain attacks targeting Tink or its dependencies, potentially introducing malicious code into the library.
- Risk of performance issues or usability problems hindering adoption and effectiveness of Tink.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Tink project include:

- security control Open source development model with public code repository on GitHub (https://github.com/google/tink). This allows for community review and contributions.
- security control Code review process for contributions to the Tink repository. This helps to identify and prevent introduction of vulnerabilities.
- security control Automated testing including unit tests and integration tests. This ensures the correctness and reliability of the cryptographic implementations.
- security control Public issue tracker on GitHub for reporting bugs and security vulnerabilities. This provides a channel for community feedback and vulnerability disclosure.
- security control Dependency management using standard build tools (e.g., Maven, Bazel, Pip). This helps to manage and track dependencies.

Accepted risks for the Tink project include:

- accepted risk Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
- accepted risk Public disclosure of vulnerabilities before patches are available, due to the open-source nature of the project.
- accepted risk Potential for misuse of the library by developers, despite documentation and examples.

Recommended security controls to implement for Tink:

- recommended security control Regular security audits by independent security experts to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control Formal vulnerability disclosure program with clear guidelines for reporting and handling security issues.
- recommended security control Automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- recommended security control Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to track components and dependencies for supply chain security.
- recommended security control Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) integration into the CI/CD pipeline.

Security requirements for the Tink project:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a cryptographic library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using Tink.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a cryptographic library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using Tink.
- Input Validation: Critical for Tink. All cryptographic functions must perform rigorous input validation to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, and injection attacks. Input validation should be implemented at the API boundaries of the library.
- Cryptography: Tink must provide correct and secure cryptographic implementations. This includes using well-vetted cryptographic algorithms, following best practices for key management, and preventing common cryptographic pitfalls. The library should offer a range of cryptographic primitives and constructions suitable for various use cases.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected: Secure cryptographic operations within applications using Tink. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data protected by cryptography.

Data being protected: Sensitive data processed by applications using Tink. The sensitivity of the data depends on the specific application context. This could include:

- Confidential data: Data that needs to be protected from unauthorized access, such as personal information, financial data, or trade secrets.
- Integrity-sensitive data: Data where unauthorized modification could lead to significant harm or business disruption.
- Authenticity-sensitive data: Data where verifying the source and integrity is crucial, such as digital signatures or transaction records.

The sensitivity level is highly dependent on the application using Tink. For a banking application, the data would be highly sensitive. For a less critical application, the sensitivity might be lower. However, given the nature of cryptography, any misuse or vulnerability can have severe security implications.
