*   **Insecure Module Loading**
    *   Description: Dynamically loading Guice modules based on external input without proper validation can allow attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   How Guice Contributes: Guice's module system allows for loading modules at runtime. If the source of these modules is untrusted or the loading process is insecure, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   Example: An application reads module class names from a configuration file provided by the user. An attacker could modify this file to point to a malicious module containing code to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   Impact: Critical - Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if malicious modules are loaded and executed.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Avoid dynamic module loading based on external input if possible.
        *   If dynamic loading is necessary, strictly validate the source and content of the modules.
        *   Use a predefined set of trusted modules.
        *   Implement strong access controls on configuration files used for module loading.

*   **Overly Permissive Bindings**
    *   Description: Bindings that are too broad or lack sufficient constraints can lead to unintended dependencies being injected, potentially exposing sensitive functionality or allowing for manipulation.
    *   How Guice Contributes: Guice's flexibility in defining bindings can be a risk if not carefully managed. Binding interfaces to concrete classes without considering potential malicious implementations can be exploited.
    *   Example: An interface `PaymentProcessor` is bound to a concrete class `ExternalPaymentGateway`. If a malicious actor can introduce a class also implementing `PaymentProcessor` and influence the binding (e.g., through a vulnerability in module configuration), their malicious implementation could be used.
    *   Impact: High - Could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or manipulation of critical application logic.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining bindings.
        *   Be specific with binding annotations (`@Named`, `@Qualifier`) to avoid ambiguity.
        *   Carefully review and control dependencies introduced through bindings.
        *   Consider using private modules to encapsulate internal bindings.

*   **Vulnerable Provider Implementations**
    *   Description: Custom `Provider` implementations used to create instances might contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited when Guice invokes them.
    *   How Guice Contributes: Guice relies on `Provider` instances to create objects when standard constructor injection is insufficient. If these providers have security flaws, they become part of the application's attack surface.
    *   Example: A `Provider` for database connections might hardcode credentials or be susceptible to connection string injection. When Guice requests an instance, this vulnerable provider is executed.
    *   Impact: High - Can expose sensitive information (credentials), allow unauthorized database access, or lead to other provider-specific vulnerabilities.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom `Provider` implementations for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in providers.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within providers.
        *   Use secure methods for accessing resources within providers.
