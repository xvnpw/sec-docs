# Threat Model Analysis for google/guice

## Threat: [Insecure Binding Configuration leading to Arbitrary Object Instantiation](./threats/insecure_binding_configuration_leading_to_arbitrary_object_instantiation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate the application's Guice module configuration to bind interfaces to malicious implementations. This could involve replacing legitimate services with compromised ones by exploiting how Guice's `Binder` is configured.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, privilege escalation, depending on the capabilities of the malicious object injected through Guice's binding mechanism.
*   **Affected Guice Component:** `com.google.inject.Binder` interface, `Module` implementations, `@Provides` methods.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Guice module configurations are loaded from trusted sources only.
    *   Avoid externalizing critical binding configurations to user-controlled locations.
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization if external configuration sources are necessary for Guice modules.
    *   Consider using compile-time dependency injection alternatives for stronger guarantees regarding Guice bindings.

## Threat: [Dynamic Binding Exploitation via Untrusted Input](./threats/dynamic_binding_exploitation_via_untrusted_input.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses Guice's dynamic binding mechanisms (e.g., `LinkedBindingBuilder.toProvider` or `LinkedBindingBuilder.toInstance` where the target instance or provider is determined by untrusted input), an attacker might be able to control the type of object being injected by manipulating the input used by Guice's binding builder. This can lead to the instantiation of malicious classes through Guice.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, depending on the capabilities of the maliciously instantiated object facilitated by Guice's dynamic binding.
*   **Affected Guice Component:** `com.google.inject.binder.LinkedBindingBuilder`, `Provider` implementations used within Guice bindings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using Guice's dynamic binding with input directly sourced from untrusted sources.
    *   If dynamic binding is necessary within Guice, implement strict validation and sanitization of the input used to determine the binding target.
    *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed binding targets within Guice instead of relying on untrusted input directly.

## Threat: [Constructor Injection Vulnerability through Malicious Dependency](./threats/constructor_injection_vulnerability_through_malicious_dependency.md)

*   **Description:**  If a class's constructor is injected by Guice with a dependency that is itself compromised or malicious (due to a binding configuration issue), the class might be instantiated with a harmful object by Guice's injection mechanism.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the malicious dependency; could lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service facilitated by Guice's dependency injection.
*   **Affected Guice Component:** Constructor injection mechanism within Guice, `@Inject` annotation on constructors.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet all dependencies used in the application's Guice modules.
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities that could be injected by Guice.
    *   Implement security scanning of dependencies used with Guice.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing dependencies managed by Guice.
