# Attack Surface Analysis for google/guice

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Binding Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_binding_injection.md)

* **Description:** An attacker manipulates the Guice module configuration to bind legitimate interfaces to malicious or compromised implementations. This allows them to inject arbitrary code into the application's dependency graph.

* **How Guice Contributes:** Guice's core functionality relies on modules to define bindings. Compromising these modules allows for the substitution of legitimate dependencies with malicious ones.

* **Example:** An attacker gains control over a configuration file used to load Guice modules and replaces the binding for a critical service interface with a malicious implementation. When the application requests this service, the attacker's code is executed.

* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service.

* **Risk Severity:** Critical

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the sources of Guice module definitions (e.g., configuration files, databases) with strong access controls.
    * Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of module configurations.
    * Utilize compile-time dependency injection validation to detect unexpected or malicious bindings early in the development process.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Components through Overly Permissive Bindings](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_components_through_overly_permissive_bindings.md)

* **Description:** Guice bindings are configured in a way that inadvertently exposes internal components or services that should not be directly accessible or injectable in certain contexts, potentially allowing attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

* **How Guice Contributes:** Guice's binding mechanism controls which components are available for injection. Overly broad or improperly scoped bindings can expose sensitive internal components.

* **Example:** An internal utility class for handling sensitive data is bound without proper scope restrictions, making it injectable throughout the application. An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in a less secure part of the application can inject and utilize this utility class to access sensitive information.

* **Impact:** Information disclosure, privilege escalation, circumvention of security controls.

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining bindings, only binding what is absolutely necessary.
    * Utilize Guice's scoping mechanisms (e.g., `@RequestScoped`, `@SessionScoped`, custom scopes) to restrict the availability of components to appropriate contexts.
    * Employ private modules to encapsulate internal implementation details and limit their visibility.
    * Regularly review the application's Guice binding configuration to identify and rectify overly permissive bindings.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Custom Providers and Factories](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_custom_providers_and_factories.md)

* **Description:** Custom `Provider` or factory implementations used with Guice contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited when Guice invokes them to create dependencies. This can lead to unintended actions or security breaches.

* **How Guice Contributes:** Guice relies on `Provider` instances to create dependencies on demand. If the logic within a custom provider is flawed or insecure, it introduces a vulnerability that can be triggered by Guice.

* **Example:** A custom `Provider` for a database connection does not properly sanitize user-provided connection parameters. When Guice invokes this provider to create a database connection, an attacker-controlled parameter can lead to SQL injection.

* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service (depending on the provider's functionality).

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly review and security test all custom `Provider` and factory implementations for potential vulnerabilities.
    * Ensure that custom providers properly handle any external input or configuration data.
    * Consider using built-in Guice mechanisms or well-vetted libraries for common dependency creation tasks to minimize the need for custom providers.

## Attack Surface: [Interceptor Manipulation (AOP Abuse)](./attack_surfaces/interceptor_manipulation__aop_abuse_.md)

* **Description:** Attackers might try to manipulate the configuration or implementation of Guice interceptors to inject malicious logic that executes around method calls, potentially allowing them to intercept, modify, or prevent legitimate operations.

* **How Guice Contributes:** Guice's AOP features allow interceptors to be applied to methods based on configuration. If this configuration is compromised or a malicious interceptor is introduced, it can be used for malicious purposes.

* **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious interceptor that logs sensitive data from method parameters or return values before the actual method execution, leading to information disclosure.

* **Impact:** Information disclosure, modification of application behavior, denial of service.

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the configuration of interceptors and prevent unauthorized modification.
    * Carefully review the logic of all interceptors to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities or perform unintended actions.
    * Limit the ability to define or register interceptors to trusted parts of the application.
    * Implement strong separation of concerns to minimize the scope and impact of individual interceptors.
