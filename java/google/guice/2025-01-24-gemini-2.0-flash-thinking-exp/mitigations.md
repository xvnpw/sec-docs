## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management of Guice Modules](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_of_guice_modules.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Configuration Management of Guice Modules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Externalize Guice Modules and Bindings:** Define Guice modules and binding configurations outside of the core application code. Use external configuration files (e.g., `.properties`, `.yaml`, `.json`) to specify bindings and module loading.
    2.  **Secure Storage for Module Configurations:** Store these configuration files in secure locations with restricted access. Utilize operating system-level permissions or dedicated configuration management systems to control who can read and modify these files.
    3.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data in Guice Configurations:** If sensitive information (like API keys or database credentials needed for objects instantiated by Guice) is present in configuration files, encrypt these values. Employ secure key management practices to protect encryption keys.
    4.  **Version Control for Guice Configurations:** Manage Guice configuration files under version control (e.g., Git). This enables tracking changes, auditing modifications, and reverting to previous configurations if needed. Implement code review processes for changes to Guice configuration files.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Guice Bindings (High Severity):** Hardcoding sensitive data directly within Guice modules or easily accessible configuration files can lead to exposure if the configuration is compromised.
    *   **Unauthorized Modification of Guice Bindings (Medium Severity):** If Guice configuration files are not secured, unauthorized users could modify them, potentially altering application behavior by changing dependency bindings or module loading in malicious ways.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Guice Bindings:** High reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data within Guice configurations.
    *   **Unauthorized Modification of Guice Bindings:** Medium to High reduction.  Reduces the attack surface for unauthorized changes to application behavior through Guice configuration manipulation.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Guice modules are defined in separate files, but sensitive data within these configurations is not yet encrypted. Version control is used for configuration files.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Encryption of sensitive data within Guice configuration files is missing. Access control hardening for Guice configuration file storage is not fully implemented. Integration with a dedicated secrets management system for Guice configurations is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege in Guice Bindings](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_in_guice_bindings.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege in Guice Bindings
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Narrowest Possible Scopes in Guice:** When defining Guice bindings, utilize the most restrictive scope appropriate for the injected object's lifecycle. Avoid default or overly broad scopes like `@Singleton` if a shorter scope (e.g., `@RequestScoped`, `@SessionScoped`, or `@Provides` methods for instance control) is sufficient.
    2.  **Interface-Based Injection in Guice:**  Favor injecting dependencies via interfaces rather than concrete classes in Guice. This limits the exposed API surface of injected components and promotes loose coupling, making it harder to exploit internal implementations through dependency injection.
    3.  **Restrict Dependency Visibility in Guice Modules:** Carefully consider which dependencies are injected into components via Guice. Ensure components only receive the dependencies absolutely necessary for their intended function. Avoid injecting dependencies that grant access to broader functionalities than required.
    4.  **Regularly Review Guice Module Bindings:** Periodically audit Guice module configurations to identify and rectify any overly permissive or unnecessary bindings. Ensure bindings adhere to the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Overly Broad Guice Bindings (Medium Severity):** Overly broad Guice bindings can inadvertently expose internal components or data that should not be accessible to certain parts of the application, potentially leading to information disclosure through dependency injection.
    *   **Privilege Escalation through Guice Injection (Medium Severity):** If a component receives dependencies with excessive privileges via Guice injection, a vulnerability in that component could be exploited to gain higher privileges than intended by leveraging the overly privileged injected dependency.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects due to Guice Scoping (Low to Medium Severity):**  Broad Guice scopes or unnecessary dependencies can lead to unintended state sharing or side effects between components managed by Guice, potentially creating unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Overly Broad Guice Bindings:** Medium reduction. Reduces the surface area for information leakage through dependency injection by limiting access to internal components via Guice bindings.
    *   **Privilege Escalation through Guice Injection:** Medium reduction. Limits the potential for privilege escalation by restricting the capabilities of components injected by Guice.
    *   **Unintended Side Effects due to Guice Scoping:** Low to Medium reduction. Improves application stability and reduces the likelihood of unexpected behavior exploitable through Guice's dependency management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Interface-based injection is common practice. Guice scopes are generally considered, but a systematic review of all bindings for least privilege is not yet completed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A comprehensive review of all Guice modules to enforce least privilege in bindings is missing. Automated tooling to detect overly broad Guice bindings is not in place. Developer training specifically on least privilege binding practices in Guice is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validation of Guice Binding Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/validation_of_guice_binding_configurations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validation of Guice Binding Configurations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Static Analysis of Guice Modules:** Integrate static analysis tools into the build process that can analyze Guice module configurations. These tools should check for common Guice misconfigurations, such as missing bindings, circular dependencies within Guice, or bindings that might lead to unexpected behavior in a Guice-managed application.
    2.  **Custom Validation Logic for Guice Bindings:** Implement custom validation logic within Guice modules or during application startup. This can involve writing code to programmatically check the correctness and security of Guice bindings based on application-specific requirements and security policies. For example, validate that certain types are only bound to specific implementations within Guice modules or that certain configurations used in `@Provides` methods are within acceptable ranges.
    3.  **Early Validation of Guice Configurations:** Perform Guice binding configuration validation as early as possible in the development lifecycle, ideally during build time or application startup. Fail fast if Guice validation errors are detected to prevent deployment of misconfigured applications relying on Guice.
    4.  **Dynamic Guice Configuration Validation:** If using dynamic or externally sourced Guice binding configurations, implement rigorous validation of these configurations before they are loaded and applied by Guice. Sanitize and validate any input used to determine Guice bindings to prevent injection of malicious configurations into the Guice container.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities in Guice (Medium to High Severity):** Incorrect or insecure Guice configurations can lead to various vulnerabilities, such as unintended access to components due to wrong bindings, bypass of security checks due to misconfigured dependencies, or application crashes caused by Guice configuration errors.
    *   **Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities via Guice Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Maliciously crafted or unintentionally flawed Guice binding configurations could be exploited to inject malicious dependencies or alter application behavior in harmful ways through the Guice container.
    *   **Denial of Service due to Guice Configuration Errors (Low to Medium Severity):** Configuration errors within Guice modules, such as circular dependencies or resource leaks due to incorrect scoping in Guice, can lead to application instability or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities in Guice:** Medium to High reduction. Proactively detects and prevents Guice misconfigurations before they can be exploited.
    *   **Dependency Injection Vulnerabilities via Guice Misconfiguration:** Medium reduction. Reduces the risk of malicious dependency injection through Guice by validating configurations.
    *   **Denial of Service due to Guice Configuration Errors:** Low to Medium reduction. Improves application stability by catching Guice configuration errors that could lead to instability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic static analysis tools are used for general code quality, but specific Guice configuration validation is not yet integrated. Some basic startup checks for missing Guice bindings exist.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Dedicated static analysis tools specifically for Guice configuration validation are missing. Custom validation logic for security-critical Guice bindings is not implemented. Validation of dynamic Guice configurations is not yet in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Dynamic or Untrusted Guice Binding Sources](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_dynamic_or_untrusted_guice_binding_sources.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Dynamic or Untrusted Guice Binding Sources
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Dynamic Guice Bindings:** Reduce the use of dynamic binding features in Guice, especially when the binding logic depends on external or untrusted input. Prefer static Guice bindings defined directly in code or well-controlled configuration files.
    2.  **Input Sanitization and Validation for Dynamic Guice Bindings:** If dynamic Guice binding is absolutely necessary, rigorously sanitize and validate any input used to determine bindings. Treat external input as untrusted and apply strict input validation rules to prevent injection attacks or unintended dependency resolutions within Guice.
    3.  **Trusted Sources for Guice Modules:** Avoid loading Guice modules or binding configurations from untrusted sources or locations that could be compromised. Only load Guice modules from known and trusted sources, such as the application's own codebase or secure configuration repositories.
    4.  **Code Review for Dynamic Guice Binding Logic:** If dynamic Guice binding is used, ensure that the code responsible for dynamic binding logic is thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities, especially injection risks related to Guice's dependency injection mechanism.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Injection Attacks via Dynamic Guice Bindings (High Severity):** Dynamic Guice binding based on untrusted input can be exploited to inject malicious dependencies through Guice, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or compromise application logic within the Guice-managed application.
    *   **Remote Code Execution via Guice Dependency Injection (High Severity):** In severe cases of dependency injection attacks through Guice, attackers could potentially achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious code through dynamic Guice bindings.
    *   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation via Malicious Guice Dependencies (Medium to High Severity):** Maliciously injected dependencies via Guice could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data or manipulate application data in unauthorized ways within the Guice context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Injection Attacks via Dynamic Guice Bindings:** High reduction. Significantly reduces the attack surface for dependency injection attacks through Guice by limiting dynamic binding and controlling Guice binding sources.
    *   **Remote Code Execution via Guice Dependency Injection:** High reduction. Mitigates the risk of remote code execution through Guice dependency injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation via Malicious Guice Dependencies:** Medium to High reduction. Reduces the potential for data breaches and manipulation through malicious dependency injection within Guice.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Largely implemented. Dynamic Guice binding is generally avoided in the project. Guice binding sources are primarily from within the application codebase.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal guidelines and code review checklists to specifically address dynamic Guice binding risks are missing. Input sanitization and validation for the few instances of dynamic Guice binding are not rigorously enforced and documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Reflection Usage in Guice Bindings](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_reflection_usage_in_guice_bindings.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize Reflection Usage in Guice Bindings
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Unnecessary Reflection in Guice Modules:** While Guice inherently uses reflection, minimize explicit or unnecessary reflection within custom Guice bindings, provider methods (`@Provides`), or extensions. Stick to standard Guice binding mechanisms whenever possible to reduce potential reflection-related vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Restrict Reflection Scope in Guice:** If reflection is unavoidable within Guice modules, restrict its scope as much as possible. Avoid using reflection to bypass access controls or instantiate objects in a way that circumvents intended security mechanisms within the Guice context.
    3.  **Secure Reflection Libraries Used with Guice:** Be cautious when using reflection-based libraries or frameworks in conjunction with Guice. Ensure these libraries are from trusted sources and are regularly updated to patch any security vulnerabilities. Review their usage within Guice modules for potential security implications.
