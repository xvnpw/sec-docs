# Attack Surface Analysis for google/guice

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Module Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_module_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious Guice modules into the application during module loading.
*   **Guice Contribution:** Guice's module loading mechanism, especially if it relies on dynamic paths or external configuration, can be exploited to load attacker-controlled modules.
*   **Example:** An application reads module paths from a configuration file that is modifiable by an attacker. The attacker changes the path to point to a malicious module hosted on their server. Upon application startup, Guice loads and executes the malicious module.
*   **Impact:**  **Critical**. Full application compromise, arbitrary code execution, data theft, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Static Module Loading: Prefer statically defining modules within the application code rather than relying on dynamic loading.
    *   Input Validation: If dynamic loading is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize module paths and configurations. Whitelist allowed module locations.
    *   Secure Configuration Management: Securely store and manage configuration files, restricting write access to authorized personnel/processes.
    *   Code Review: Regularly review module loading logic and configuration handling for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Module Overriding and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/module_overriding_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify or override existing Guice modules after application deployment, replacing legitimate modules with malicious ones.
*   **Guice Contribution:** Guice's design allows for module overriding and configuration updates, which, if not properly secured, can be abused.
*   **Example:** An application allows administrators to update Guice modules via a web interface or configuration management system. If this interface is vulnerable or lacks proper authentication, an attacker could gain access and replace a legitimate module with a malicious one.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full application compromise, arbitrary code execution, data theft, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict Configuration Access: Implement strong authentication and authorization for any mechanism that allows module configuration changes.
    *   Immutable Infrastructure:  Favor immutable infrastructure where application components, including modules, are deployed as immutable units, reducing the possibility of post-deployment modification.
    *   Integrity Checks: Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums, digital signatures) for modules to detect tampering.
    *   Audit Logging:  Log all module configuration changes for auditing and incident response.

## Attack Surface: [Binding to Vulnerable or Malicious Classes](./attack_surfaces/binding_to_vulnerable_or_malicious_classes.md)

*   **Description:** Guice bindings are configured to inject vulnerable or intentionally malicious classes.
*   **Guice Contribution:** Guice's binding mechanism relies on developer-defined configurations. Misconfigurations or bindings pointing to untrusted code can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A developer, unaware of a vulnerability in a specific library version, creates a binding that injects a class from that vulnerable library. An attacker exploits the vulnerability through the injected class. Alternatively, a malicious insider could intentionally create bindings to backdoored classes.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Depending on the vulnerability in the bound class, impact can range from data breaches to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Binding Audits: Regularly audit Guice bindings to ensure they point to trusted and secure implementations.
    *   Dependency Scanning: Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in libraries used by the application, including those targeted by Guice bindings.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Design bindings to be as specific and restrictive as possible, minimizing the scope of injected dependencies.
    *   Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding practices when developing classes that are intended to be injected by Guice.

## Attack Surface: [Unintended or Overly Broad Bindings](./attack_surfaces/unintended_or_overly_broad_bindings.md)

*   **Description:**  Overly broad or permissive Guice bindings allow for the injection of unexpected or malicious implementations.
*   **Guice Contribution:** Guice's flexibility in binding can lead to overly generic bindings if not carefully managed, opening doors for unintended class injections.
*   **Example:** An interface `PaymentProcessor` is bound without specifying a concrete implementation class, relying on classpath scanning or default binding. An attacker places a malicious class implementing `PaymentProcessor` on the classpath. Guice might inadvertently inject this malicious implementation instead of the intended one.
*   **Impact:** **High**.  Impact depends on the functionality of the interface and the capabilities of the malicious implementation. Could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Specific Bindings: Define bindings as narrowly and specifically as possible. Use concrete types instead of interfaces when appropriate.
    *   Binding Annotations: Utilize binding annotations (`@Named`, `@Qualifier`) to further refine binding targets and prevent unintended injections.
    *   Classpath Control:  Carefully manage the application's classpath to prevent the inclusion of untrusted or unexpected classes.
    *   Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test Guice configurations to ensure bindings behave as expected and prevent unintended injections.
