# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Guice aims to simplify the development of Java applications by providing a robust and efficient dependency injection framework.
  - It promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability of codebases, leading to faster development cycles and reduced maintenance costs.
  - By decoupling components, Guice enables developers to focus on business logic rather than dependency management, increasing productivity.
- Business Risks:
  - Dependency on a third-party library introduces a potential supply chain risk. If vulnerabilities are discovered in Guice, applications using it may become vulnerable.
  - Improper use of dependency injection patterns, although not directly a Guice vulnerability, can lead to complex and less secure application architectures if not implemented correctly.
  - Performance overhead, although generally minimal, could become a concern in performance-critical applications if dependency injection is not used judiciously.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository with standard security features like branch protection and issue tracking. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.
  - security control: Open source project with community review, increasing the likelihood of identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: Open nature of the project and community contributions.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As a dependency, Guice inherits the risk profile of its development and release process.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in the library after deployment in applications.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the Guice build pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits and code reviews by security experts to identify and mitigate potential security weaknesses.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues promptly and transparently.
  - security control: Promote secure coding practices within the Guice development team and community.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Guice as a library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that use Guice.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to Guice as a library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that use Guice.
  - Input Validation: Input validation within Guice primarily concerns the configuration of bindings. Guice should validate binding configurations to prevent unexpected behavior or errors. Implemented in: Guice core logic during injector creation.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for Guice itself. If applications using Guice require cryptography, they should implement it independently of Guice.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development of Java applications that rely on dependency injection for modularity, testability, and maintainability.
  - Distribution and consumption of the Guice library by the Java developer community.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Guice library source code: Sensitive as it represents the intellectual property and core functionality of the project. Confidentiality and integrity are important.
