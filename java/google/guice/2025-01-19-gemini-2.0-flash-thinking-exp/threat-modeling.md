# Threat Model Analysis for google/guice

## Threat: [Binding to Untrusted Implementations](./threats/binding_to_untrusted_implementations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the Guice configuration (e.g., through a compromised configuration file or a vulnerability in the configuration loading mechanism) to bind an interface to a malicious implementation. When the application requests an instance of that interface, Guice will inject the malicious object. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context. This threat directly involves Guice's core function of binding interfaces to concrete implementations.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, complete compromise of the application.

**Affected Guice Component:** `Module` (specifically the binding declarations within the module).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the source of Guice module configurations. Ensure configuration files are stored securely and access is restricted.
*   Implement integrity checks for configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   Avoid loading configurations from untrusted or external sources without thorough validation.
*   Use compile-time checking of bindings where possible to catch errors early.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Binding Scopes Leading to Sensitive Data Exposure](./threats/overly_permissive_binding_scopes_leading_to_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit overly broad scopes (like `@Singleton`) for objects containing sensitive information. If such a singleton is injected into a component with a lower security context or a vulnerability, the sensitive data could be exposed or misused. This threat directly involves Guice's scope management and how it controls the lifecycle and sharing of injected objects.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (API keys, credentials, personal information), potential for lateral movement or further attacks using the exposed information.

**Affected Guice Component:** Scope annotations (`@Singleton`, `@RequestScoped`, custom scopes) and the `Injector`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully consider the appropriate scope for each binding, especially for objects containing sensitive data.
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining scopes.
*   Regularly review the scopes of sensitive objects to ensure they are appropriate.
*   Consider using custom scopes to enforce stricter access control.
