# Attack Surface Analysis for google/guice

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Implementations via Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_implementations_via_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can influence the bindings configured within Guice modules, leading to the injection of malicious implementations of interfaces or classes.

**How Guice Contributes:** Guice's core functionality relies on bindings to determine which concrete implementations are injected. If the configuration of these bindings is vulnerable to manipulation (e.g., through external configuration files or environment variables), attackers can substitute legitimate implementations with malicious ones.

**Example:** An application uses a configuration file to specify the implementation of an `AuthenticationService`. An attacker modifies this file to point to a malicious `MaliciousAuthenticationService` that logs credentials or bypasses authentication.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Configuration Management:** Store and manage Guice module configurations securely. Avoid storing sensitive binding information in easily modifiable files.
* **Input Validation:** If binding configurations are derived from external sources, rigorously validate and sanitize the input to prevent injection of malicious class names or binding definitions.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of a successful attack.
* **Code Reviews:** Regularly review Guice module configurations and binding logic for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Immutable Configuration:**  Where feasible, use immutable configuration mechanisms to prevent runtime modification of bindings.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Components](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_components.md)

**Description:** Overly broad or permissive binding configurations inadvertently expose internal components or services that were not intended to be publicly injectable.

**How Guice Contributes:** Guice's flexibility in defining bindings can lead to unintentional exposure if developers are not careful about the scope and visibility of their bindings. Default bindings or overly eager binding patterns can make internal components injectable where they shouldn't be.

**Example:** An internal utility class for database connection management is accidentally bound without a specific scope, making it injectable throughout the application. An attacker could potentially obtain a database connection object and bypass intended access controls.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to internal functionalities, potential for further exploitation of internal components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Principle of Least Exposure:**  Explicitly define bindings only for components that need to be injectable. Avoid broad or wildcard bindings unless absolutely necessary and thoroughly reviewed.
* **Private Modules:** Utilize Guice's private modules to encapsulate internal bindings and prevent accidental exposure to the wider application.
* **Careful Scope Management:**  Use appropriate scopes (e.g., `@RequestScoped`, `@SessionScoped`) to limit the lifecycle and accessibility of injected components.
* **Code Reviews:**  Review binding configurations to ensure that only intended components are being made injectable.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Providers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_providers.md)

**Description:** Custom `Provider` implementations used to create instances contain vulnerabilities that are then integrated into the application through Guice.

**How Guice Contributes:** Guice relies on `Provider` instances to create objects when standard constructor injection is insufficient. If these providers have security flaws, Guice effectively integrates these flaws into the application's dependency graph.

**Example:** A custom `Provider` for a file processing service reads a file path from an external source without proper validation, leading to a path traversal vulnerability when the service is injected and used.

**Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability within the provider (e.g., arbitrary file access, remote code execution).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the provider's vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Coding Practices in Providers:**  Treat `Provider` implementations as critical security components and apply rigorous secure coding practices.
* **Input Validation in Providers:**  Thoroughly validate any external input used within `Provider` implementations.
* **Security Audits of Providers:**  Conduct security audits specifically targeting custom `Provider` implementations.
* **Consider Alternatives:**  Evaluate if simpler injection mechanisms can be used instead of complex custom providers.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Configuration values injected directly into components without proper sanitization or validation create vulnerabilities.

**How Guice Contributes:** Guice facilitates the injection of configuration values (e.g., using `@Named` or custom binding annotations). If these values are not treated as potentially untrusted input, they can be exploited.

**Example:** A database connection string is injected directly into a database access object without proper escaping. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL commands through the connection string.

**Impact:**  Similar to traditional injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the type of injection)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Treat Configuration as Untrusted Input:**  Always sanitize and validate configuration values before using them, especially in security-sensitive contexts.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to access and modify configuration data.
* **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store configuration data securely to prevent unauthorized modification.
