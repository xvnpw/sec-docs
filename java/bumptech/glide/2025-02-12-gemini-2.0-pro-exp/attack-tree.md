## Attack Tree Path: [1. Execute Arbitrary Code [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__execute_arbitrary_code__high_risk_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:**
    *   **Exploit a vulnerability in a custom Transformation or ResourceDecoder [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom code written by the application developers to extend Glide's functionality.  These vulnerabilities can include buffer overflows, format string bugs, injection flaws, or any other code execution vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Thorough code review, fuzz testing, secure coding practices (input validation, output encoding, avoiding dangerous functions), and regular security audits of custom components.

*   **Delivery:**
    *   **Upload the image through a user-controlled input field [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** If the application allows users to upload images, attackers can upload a specially crafted malicious image designed to exploit a vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** N/A (Delivery Step)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:** Strict file type validation (not just MIME type), image re-encoding, size limits, and potentially sandboxing image processing.

    *   **Trick the application into loading the image from a malicious URL [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities like Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), open redirects, or compromise a third-party service the application relies on to load images.  This allows them to force Glide to load an image from a URL they control.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** N/A (Delivery Step)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Strict URL validation (whitelist of allowed domains), avoid open redirects, secure third-party service integrations, and consider using a dedicated image proxy.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leak Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__leak_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Vulnerability:**
    *   **Leverage Glide's caching mechanism [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Glide caches images to access images that should be protected, such as those belonging to other users or containing sensitive information.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure cache storage, strong access controls, and careful cache key design.

    *   **Predict or control cache keys [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Exploit predictable cache key generation [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Description:** If cache keys are generated using easily guessable information (e.g., sequential user IDs, timestamps), attackers can predict the keys for sensitive images and access them.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** N/A (Sub-step)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:** Use cryptographically secure hash functions to generate cache keys, incorporating a secret salt and all relevant image parameters.  Avoid using user-controllable data directly in keys.

    *   **Bypass access controls:**
        *   **Exploit a flaw in the application's logic [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's code that allow them to bypass authorization checks and access cached images they shouldn't be able to.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** N/A (Sub-step)
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust authorization checks for all cached image access, following the principle of least privilege.

    *   **Exploit a custom Transformation or ResourceDecoder [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Similar to code execution, custom components can leak sensitive data if they write data to insecure locations, log sensitive information, or otherwise expose data during image processing.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium-High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:** Thorough code review, secure coding practices, and careful handling of sensitive data within custom components.
