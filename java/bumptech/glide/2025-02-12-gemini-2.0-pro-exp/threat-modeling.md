## Threat: [Denial of Service via Decompression Bomb](./threats/denial_of_service_via_decompression_bomb.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Decompression Bomb

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a URL to a "decompression bomb" â€“ a small image file that expands to a huge size when decoded. This could be a highly compressed JPEG, a PNG with a large IDAT chunk, or a GIF with many frames. Glide attempts to decode the image, consuming excessive memory and potentially CPU resources.  Glide's internal handling of image decoding and resizing is directly involved.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Crash (OOM):** The application runs out of memory (OutOfMemoryError) and crashes.
        *   **Device Unresponsiveness:** The device becomes slow or unresponsive due to excessive memory pressure.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Glide's `Downsampler` and related classes responsible for image decoding and resizing.
        *   `BitmapPool` (if the allocated bitmaps exceed the pool's capacity).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits (Dimensions):** Strictly limit the maximum dimensions (width and height) of images that can be loaded using `override()`. This is the *most effective* mitigation, and it directly interacts with Glide's configuration.
        *   **Resource Limits (File Size):** While Glide doesn't directly offer file size limits *before* decoding, you can implement a check on the `Content-Length` header (if available) *before* passing the URL to Glide. This requires custom networking logic, but it's a preventative measure before Glide processes the image.
        *   **Timeout:** Set a reasonable timeout for image loading (using Glide's request options or the underlying network library) to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely on a slow or malicious resource.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Glide](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_glide.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Glide

    *   **Description:** The application uses Glide to load images from URLs provided by an untrusted source. An attacker crafts a URL pointing to an internal service. Glide's networking components make the request, potentially exposing internal resources.  This leverages Glide's core functionality of fetching data from URLs.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker gains access to sensitive internal data or metadata.
        *   **Internal Service Manipulation:** The attacker might be able to interact with internal services.
        *   **Bypassing Network Security Controls:** The attacker uses the application as a proxy.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Glide's networking components (e.g., `HttpUrlFetcher`, `OkHttpUrlLoader`, or custom `ModelLoader` implementations). These are core parts of Glide's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (especially in cloud environments)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict URL Whitelisting:** Implement a *very strict* whitelist of allowed image sources. Only load images from trusted domains. Do *not* allow user-supplied URLs directly. This directly controls what Glide is allowed to fetch.
        *   **Input Validation (URL Parsing):** If user input *must* be used, rigorously validate and sanitize it, checking each URL component. Reject URLs pointing to internal IPs or hostnames. This is a preventative measure before the URL reaches Glide.
        *   **Disable Redirects (if appropriate):** If redirects aren't needed, disable them using a custom `ModelLoader` or by configuring the underlying network library (which Glide uses). This limits Glide's ability to be tricked into accessing unintended resources.
        *   **Network Security Configuration (Android):** Use Android's Network Security Configuration. While not *directly* Glide-specific, it's a crucial defense-in-depth measure that limits the network access of the entire application, including Glide.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Glide Library Itself](./threats/vulnerability_in_glide_library_itself.md)

*   **Threat:**  Vulnerability in Glide Library Itself

    *   **Description:** A security vulnerability is discovered in the Glide library code itself (e.g., in a custom `Transformation`, `ModelLoader`, or other component). This is a direct threat to the library's own code.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the nature of the vulnerability, but could include RCE, DoS, information disclosure, or other impacts.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific Glide component containing the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (could be Critical or High)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Glide Updated:** Regularly update Glide to the latest version. This is the *most important* mitigation, directly addressing vulnerabilities within Glide itself.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories related to Glide. Be prepared to update quickly.
        *   **Use Dependency Analysis Tools:** Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to identify known vulnerabilities in Glide.
