# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is the Glide library, an open-source media management and image loading framework for Android.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, efficient, and easy-to-use library for Android developers to load, cache, and display images and other media.
  - Improve the performance and user experience of Android applications by optimizing image loading and reducing bandwidth consumption.
  - Offer a flexible and extensible framework that can be adapted to various image loading needs and scenarios.
  - Maintain a widely adopted and trusted library within the Android development community.

- Business Risks:
  - Performance regressions or bugs in the library could negatively impact application performance and user experience.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors to compromise applications using Glide.
  - Lack of maintenance or updates could lead to the library becoming outdated and less secure over time.
  - Compatibility issues with new Android versions or devices could reduce the library's usability.
  - Reputational damage if the library is perceived as unreliable, insecure, or difficult to use.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation on image URLs and data formats handled by the library. Implemented within the library's code, specifically in the network loading and decoding components.
  - security control: Caching mechanisms to reduce network requests. Implemented within the library's disk and memory cache components.
  - security control: Reliance on Android platform security features, such as permissions and sandboxing. Inherited from the Android operating system environment.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party image formats or codecs that Glide depends on. Accepted due to the need to support a wide range of image formats.
  - accepted risk: Risk of denial-of-service attacks if the library is used to load extremely large or malformed images. Accepted as mitigation would significantly impact performance for legitimate use cases.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Glide.
  - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to detect potential security flaws in the Glide codebase.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews by experienced security engineers to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement fuzz testing to discover vulnerabilities related to handling various image formats and malformed inputs.
  - security control: Enforce secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, including input validation, output encoding, and secure error handling.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to the Glide library itself. Authentication of image sources is the responsibility of the application using Glide. Glide should support passing through authentication headers if provided by the application.
  - Authorization:
    - Not directly applicable to the Glide library itself. Authorization to access image resources is the responsibility of the application using Glide. Glide should respect any access control mechanisms implemented by the application or the image server.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library must perform robust input validation on all external inputs, including image URLs, image data, and transformation parameters, to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Implementation: Input validation should be implemented in the network loading, decoding, and transformation components of Glide.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If handling sensitive image data, the library should support encryption of cached data at rest and during transit if necessary.
    - Implementation: Consider using Android Keystore for secure storage of encryption keys if local caching of sensitive data is required. For network transit, rely on HTTPS which is the responsibility of the application or underlying network layers.

    - Compile Code: Gradle compiles the Java and Kotlin source code into bytecode.
    - Run Tests: Gradle executes unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Run Linters/SAST: Static analysis security testing (SAST) tools and linters are run to identify potential code quality issues and security vulnerabilities.
    - Package Artifacts (JAR/AAR): Gradle packages the compiled code and resources into JAR and AAR files, which are the distributable artifacts of the Glide library.
  - Artifact Repository (Maven Central): The built JAR and AAR artifacts are published to Maven Central, a public repository for Java and Android libraries, making Glide available to Android developers.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a reliable and performant image loading library for Android developers.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust of the Glide library within the Android development community.
  - Ensuring the security and stability of applications that use Glide.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Image Data: The primary data handled by Glide is image data. The sensitivity of this data depends on the applications using Glide. Some applications may handle sensitive images (e.g., personal photos, medical images).
    - Sensitivity Level: Variable, can range from public to highly sensitive depending on the application context.
  - Cached Image Data: Glide caches images in memory and on disk. Cached data can persist sensitive information if the original images are sensitive.
    - Sensitivity Level: Same as image data, variable.
  - Library Code: The source code of Glide itself. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the code is important to prevent malicious modifications and maintain trust.
    - Sensitivity Level: Moderate to High (open source but integrity is crucial).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What types of Android applications are the primary users of Glide? Are they primarily focused on image-heavy content, or is image loading a secondary feature?
  - Are there specific performance benchmarks or SLAs that Glide aims to meet?
  - What is the expected threat model for applications using Glide? Are they likely to be targeted by sophisticated attackers, or are more common threats the primary concern?
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements that applications using Glide might need to adhere to (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR)?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Glide?

- Assumptions:
  - Glide is used in a wide variety of Android applications, ranging from simple apps to complex, image-intensive applications.
  - Performance is a critical factor for Glide's usability and adoption.
  - The primary security concerns are related to common web and application vulnerabilities, such as input validation issues, image parsing vulnerabilities, and cache security.
  - Applications using Glide are expected to handle their own application-level security concerns, such as authentication and authorization for image resources.
  - The Glide project has a process for addressing reported security vulnerabilities, although the details are not explicitly provided in the input.
