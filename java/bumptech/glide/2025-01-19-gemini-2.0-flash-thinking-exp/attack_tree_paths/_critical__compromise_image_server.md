    * **Drive-by Downloads:**  Serving images that exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser, leading to malware installation.
    * **Phishing Attacks:** Displaying images that trick users into revealing sensitive information.
    * **Defacement:** Replacing images with offensive or misleading content, damaging the application's reputation.
* **Data Breach:** If the image server stores other sensitive data (beyond just images), this data could be exfiltrated.
* **Denial of Service:** The attacker could intentionally overload the server, making it unavailable and disrupting the application's functionality.
* **Reputational Damage:** Serving malicious content or experiencing prolonged downtime can severely damage the application's reputation and user trust.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Depending on the nature of the malicious content or data breach, the application owner could face legal repercussions and compliance violations.

**4.3 Implications for Glide:**

While Glide itself is primarily an image loading and caching library, a compromised image server directly impacts its functionality and the security of the application using it. Glide will faithfully load and display whatever images are served by the compromised server, including malicious ones. Therefore, the security of the image server is paramount for applications relying on Glide.

**4.4 Potential Mitigations:**

To mitigate the risk of a compromised image server, the following security measures should be implemented:

    * Configure the web server to prevent common attacks (e.g., directory listing, information disclosure).
    * Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the application and the image server.
    * Implement security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options).
* **Input Validation and Sanitization (on the server-side):** While the focus is on server compromise, ensuring the server itself is not vulnerable to image-based attacks is important.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify vulnerabilities in the server infrastructure.
* **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Monitor network traffic and server activity for malicious behavior.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protect the web server from common web attacks.
* **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  Using a CDN can provide some protection against DDoS attacks and improve performance, but it's crucial to ensure the CDN itself is secure.
* **Regular Backups and Disaster Recovery Plan:**  Enable quick recovery in case of a successful attack.
