# Threat Model Analysis for bumptech/glide

## Threat: [Loading Images from Untrusted Sources](./threats/loading_images_from_untrusted_sources.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious URL to the application, causing **Glide** to fetch and display an image from a compromised server. The attacker controls the content served at the malicious URL, and **Glide** is the mechanism used to retrieve and render it.
*   **Impact:** Displaying inappropriate or offensive content, phishing attempts by displaying fake login screens or misleading information within the image, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in image rendering libraries if the malicious image is crafted to trigger them.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of image URLs before passing them to **Glide**.
    *   Use a whitelist of trusted domains or CDNs for image sources.
    *   Consider using **Glide's** `RequestOptions` to enforce HTTPS for image loading.

## Threat: [Image Format Vulnerabilities Exploitation](./threats/image_format_vulnerabilities_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious images in specific formats that exploit vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries used by **Glide** (through Android's system libraries). When **Glide** attempts to decode such an image, it could lead to crashes or, in severe cases, remote code execution. **Glide** is the component initiating the decoding process.
*   **Impact:** Application crash (Denial of Service), potential remote code execution if the underlying library vulnerability allows it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if RCE is possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the target Android system and its WebView component updated to patch known vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries. While not directly controllable by the application, awareness of these risks when using **Glide** is important.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Glide Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_glide_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** **Glide** itself might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to various issues, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the **Glide** library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Monitor **Glide's** release notes and security advisories for any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the **Glide** library.
