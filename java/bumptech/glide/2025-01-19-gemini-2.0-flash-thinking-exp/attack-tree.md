## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Deliver Malicious Image via Compromised Server](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_deliver_malicious_image_via_compromised_server.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Serve malicious images to application users by compromising the server hosting the images.
*   Attack Steps:
    *   **[CRITICAL] Compromise Image Server:**
        *   Exploit Server Software Vulnerabilities: Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the server's operating system, web server software, or other installed applications to gain unauthorized access.
        *   Gain Unauthorized Access via Credentials: Attackers obtain valid credentials through methods like brute-forcing, phishing, or exploiting credential stuffing attacks.
*   Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends heavily on the security posture of the image server).
*   Impact: Medium to High (serving malicious content can lead to various attacks depending on the nature of the malicious image and application vulnerabilities).
*   Effort: Medium to High (requires identifying and exploiting server vulnerabilities or obtaining valid credentials).
*   Skill Level: Medium to High.
*   Detection Difficulty: Low (if no content integrity checks are in place on the client-side).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Glide](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_glide.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Force the application's server to make requests to unintended locations, potentially accessing internal resources or performing actions on internal systems.
*   Attack Steps:
    *   Manipulate Image URL to Access Internal Resources: Attackers provide a crafted URL to Glide, pointing to internal resources instead of external images.
    *   Inject Internal URL or File Path: The malicious URL contains an internal IP address, hostname, or file path that the attacker wants to access.
*   Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on the application's input validation and sanitization practices).
*   Impact: Medium to High (access to sensitive internal data, potential for further attacks on internal systems).
*   Effort: Low to Medium (requires understanding of the application's internal network structure).
*   Skill Level: Medium.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium (can be detected by monitoring outbound requests from the application server).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Image Decoding Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_image_decoding_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Execute arbitrary code on the application server or cause a denial of service by exploiting vulnerabilities in the image decoding process.
*   Attack Steps:
    *   Deliver Maliciously Crafted Image Format: Attackers provide an image file with a specially crafted structure.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Image Codecs:**
        *   Trigger Buffer Overflows, Heap Corruption, or Other Memory Errors: The malicious image triggers vulnerabilities (e.g., in libjpeg, libpng, WebP) leading to memory corruption, potentially allowing for code execution.
*   Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on the presence of unpatched vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries).
*   Impact: High (Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS)).
*   Effort: Medium to High (requires vulnerability research or leveraging existing exploits).
*   Skill Level: Medium to High.
*   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (can be difficult to detect without specific vulnerability signatures).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Glide's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_glide's_dependencies.md)

*   Attacker's Goal: Compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities in libraries that Glide depends on.
*   Attack Steps:
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in OkHttp:** Attackers exploit known security flaws in the OkHttp library, which Glide uses for network requests. This can lead to various network-level attacks.
    *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Underlying Image Codecs:** (This is a repetition from the previous high-risk path but is critical due to the direct impact). Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the libraries responsible for decoding image formats.
*   Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on the presence of unpatched vulnerabilities in the dependencies).
*   Impact: High (potential for network-level attacks, data exfiltration, Remote Code Execution).
*   Effort: Medium to High (requires vulnerability research or leveraging existing exploits).
*   Skill Level: Medium to High.
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium (IDS/IPS might detect some network exploits, but detecting vulnerabilities in decoding libraries can be harder).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Image Server](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_image_server.md)

*   Description: Gaining control of the server hosting the images allows attackers to serve malicious content directly to users.
*   Impact: High (serving malicious content can lead to various attacks).
*   Mitigation: Implement strong server security measures, including regular patching, strong access controls, and intrusion detection systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Image Codecs](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_image_codecs.md)

*   Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries can lead to direct code execution or denial of service.
*   Impact: High (Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service).
*   Mitigation: Keep Glide and its underlying image decoding libraries updated with the latest security patches. Consider using alternative, more secure libraries if feasible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in OkHttp](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_okhttp.md)

*   Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the network library can lead to network-level attacks and data exfiltration.
*   Impact: High (potential for network-level attacks, data exfiltration).
*   Mitigation: Keep Glide updated, as this typically includes updates to its dependencies like OkHttp. Monitor security advisories for OkHttp.
