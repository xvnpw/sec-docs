# Attack Surface Analysis for bumptech/glide

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Protocol Usage (HTTP)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_protocol_usage__http_.md)

*   **Description:** Loading images over unencrypted HTTP connections exposes data in transit.
*   **How Glide Contributes:** Glide, by default, can load resources from any URL provided, including HTTP. If developers don't enforce HTTPS, Glide will facilitate the insecure connection.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts the HTTP request for an image loaded by Glide and views or modifies the image data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (image content exposed), potential integrity breach (image content modified).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Enforce HTTPS for all image loading. Configure Glide to only accept HTTPS URLs or implement checks before loading. Utilize network security configuration to block HTTP traffic for relevant domains.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates Glide to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.
*   **How Glide Contributes:** If the URL passed to Glide's `load()` method is derived from user input without proper validation, an attacker can inject malicious URLs that Glide will then attempt to load.
*   **Example:** A user-controlled parameter is used to build an image URL passed to Glide. An attacker injects a URL pointing to an internal service, potentially exposing sensitive information or triggering actions.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, denial of service on internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust URL validation and sanitization on any user-provided input used in Glide's `load()` method. Use allow-lists for acceptable domains or URL patterns. Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs for Glide.

## Attack Surface: [Local File Access via File URIs (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/local_file_access_via_file_uris__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows loading images from local file URIs without proper validation, attackers can access sensitive files.
*   **How Glide Contributes:** Glide can be configured to load images from `file://` URIs. If user input controls these URIs passed to Glide's `load()` method, it can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a `file://` URI pointing to a sensitive file on the device's storage (e.g., `/data/data/com.example.app/shared_prefs/secrets.xml`). If the application uses Glide to load this URI based on attacker input, the file content might be exposed (though Glide itself won't directly display arbitrary files as images).
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (access to local files).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Avoid allowing user input to directly control `file://` URIs used with Glide. If local file access is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the file paths before passing them to Glide. Consider using Content Providers for controlled access to local files.
