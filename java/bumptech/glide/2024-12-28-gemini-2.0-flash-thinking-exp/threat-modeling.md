## High and Critical Glide Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Glide library:

- **Threat:** Malicious Image Payload Exploitation
    - **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file that exploits vulnerabilities within the image decoding libraries *used by Glide*. When Glide attempts to decode this image, the malicious payload is executed.
    - **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, potential remote code execution on the user's device, data corruption.
    - **Affected Component:**
        - `com.bumptech.glide.load.resource.bitmap.BitmapDrawableDecoder` (or similar decoders for other formats) - as Glide orchestrates the decoding process.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Regularly update Glide and its dependencies:** Ensure the application uses the latest versions of Glide and its image decoding libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
        - **Implement robust error handling:** Catch exceptions during image decoding and prevent the application from crashing.

- **Threat:** Cache Poisoning
    - **Description:** An attacker manipulates the image caching mechanism *of Glide* to store malicious or incorrect images. Subsequent requests for the same image will then serve the poisoned version from Glide's cache.
    - **Impact:** Display of incorrect or malicious content to the user, potentially leading to phishing attacks or misinformation.
    - **Affected Component:**
        - `com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.cache.DiskLruCacheWrapper` (or other disk cache implementations used by Glide).
        - `com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.cache.MemoryCache` (managed by Glide).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Enforce HTTPS:** Using HTTPS for image downloads prevents MITM attacks that could lead to cache poisoning during transit.
        - **Verify image integrity (if feasible):** If the image source provides a mechanism for verifying image integrity, implement checks before caching *within Glide's loading process*.
        - **Secure cache directory permissions:** Ensure the Glide cache directory has appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized write access.
        - **Implement cache invalidation strategies:** Regularly invalidate cached images or use time-based expiration *within Glide's cache configuration*.

- **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (Memory/Disk)
    - **Description:** An attacker causes the application to load an excessive number of large images or images with high memory requirements *through Glide*. This can overwhelm the device's memory or fill up Glide's disk cache.
    - **Impact:** Application slowdown, out-of-memory errors, application crashes, device instability, denial of service.
    - **Affected Component:**
        - `com.bumptech.glide.RequestBuilder` (the primary interface for loading images with Glide).
        - `com.bumptech.glide.MemoryCache` (managed by Glide).
        - `com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.cache.DiskCache` (managed by Glide).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Implement image resizing and downsampling:** Use Glide's transformation options to load images at appropriate sizes for the display, reducing memory consumption.
        - **Control cache size:** Configure Glide's memory and disk cache sizes to prevent them from growing indefinitely.
        - **Implement pagination or lazy loading:** Load images only when they are needed or visible to the user, controlling how Glide is used.
        - **Set timeouts for image loading:** Prevent the application from getting stuck trying to load very large or unresponsive images *through Glide*.
        - **Limit concurrent image loading requests:** Avoid making too many simultaneous image requests *using Glide*.
