## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Server-Side Vulnerability to Inject Malicious URL [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_server-side_vulnerability_to_inject_malicious_url__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability on the server-side of the application (e.g., SQL Injection, Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to URL manipulation) to inject a malicious image URL into the application's data or logic. This malicious URL is then used by Glide to load the image.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Potential for remote code execution if the malicious image exploits a vulnerability in Glide or the underlying image processing libraries, or defacement/malicious actions if the image is designed for that purpose).
* **Effort:** Medium (Requires finding and exploiting a server-side vulnerability).
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Depends on the nature of the server-side vulnerability and the logging in place).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Lack of HTTPS for Image URLs [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__lack_of_https_for_image_urls__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses `http://` URLs instead of `https://` for loading images with Glide. This allows an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the network to intercept the image download and replace the legitimate image with a malicious one.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (on public, untrusted networks), Low (on well-secured networks).
* **Impact:** High (Potential for remote code execution if the malicious image exploits a vulnerability, or serving misleading/harmful content to the user).
* **Effort:** Low (on public networks using tools like Wireshark and Ettercap), Medium (on secured networks requiring more sophisticated techniques).
* **Skill Level:** Beginner (on public networks), Intermediate (on secured networks).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Without network monitoring and inspection of image content).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Provide Malformed Image File [HIGH-RISK PATH] (Triggering Buffer Overflow in Image Decoder)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__provide_malformed_image_file__high-risk_path___triggering_buffer_overflow_in_image_d_38516450.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a specially crafted, malformed image file to the application. When Glide attempts to decode this image using an underlying image decoding library (e.g., libjpeg, libpng, libwebp), a buffer overflow vulnerability in the decoder is triggered. This can allow the attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device or server running the application.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (for older versions of Glide and image decoding libraries), Low (for up-to-date versions).
* **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution).
* **Effort:** Medium (Finding existing exploits or tools to generate malformed images), High (Developing new exploits).
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate (using existing exploits), Advanced (developing new exploits).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (May appear as a generic application crash or memory corruption error).
