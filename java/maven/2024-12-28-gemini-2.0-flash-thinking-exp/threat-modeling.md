Here are the high and critical threats directly involving Apache Maven:

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion/Substitution
    *   **Description:** An attacker might publish a malicious artifact with the same name and version as an internal dependency on a public repository. Maven, during dependency resolution, might download this malicious artifact instead of the intended internal one by querying public repositories before private ones (depending on repository configuration).
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary malicious code within the application's runtime environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker might create and publish a seemingly legitimate dependency on a public repository that contains malicious code. Developers, unaware of the malicious nature, include this dependency in their `pom.xml`. Maven will download and include this dependency in the application's build. The malicious code will then be executed when the application runs.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary malicious code within the application's runtime environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit known security vulnerabilities present in a dependency declared in the `pom.xml`. Maven will download and include this vulnerable dependency. The attacker can then leverage these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Application vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Compromised Remote Repositories
    *   **Description:** An attacker might compromise a remote Maven repository configured in the `pom.xml` or `settings.xml`. This allows the attacker to inject malicious artifacts or modify existing ones. When Maven attempts to download dependencies or plugins from this compromised repository, it will retrieve the malicious versions.
    *   **Impact:** Downloading and using compromised dependencies or plugins, leading to application compromise, build process compromise, or supply chain attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Malicious Maven Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker might create and publish a malicious Maven plugin on a public repository. A developer might include this plugin in their `pom.xml` to perform build tasks. When Maven executes this plugin during the build process, the malicious code within the plugin will be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised build environment, injection of malicious code into build artifacts, data exfiltration from the build environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Build Script Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker might find vulnerabilities in custom Maven plugins or build scripts defined within the `pom.xml`. They can then inject malicious commands or code that will be executed by Maven during the build process. This could involve manipulating plugin configurations or exploiting scripting language vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised build environment, injection of malicious code into build artifacts, data exfiltration from the build environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Hardcoded Credentials in `pom.xml` or `settings.xml`
    *   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly include credentials for private repositories or other services directly within the `pom.xml` or `settings.xml` files. If these files are committed to version control or otherwise become accessible, the credentials will be exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to repositories or other services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
