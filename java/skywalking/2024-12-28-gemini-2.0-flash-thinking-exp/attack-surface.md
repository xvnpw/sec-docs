### Key Attack Surface List: Apache SkyWalking Integration (High & Critical, SkyWalking Specific)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving SkyWalking components, focusing on those with High and Critical risk severity.

*   **Description:** Unauthenticated Access to Collector Endpoints
    *   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** SkyWalking's OAP exposes endpoints (typically gRPC and HTTP) for receiving telemetry data from agents. If these endpoints are not configured with authentication, anyone can send data *to the SkyWalking collector*.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor could send fabricated or malicious telemetry data to the OAP, potentially disrupting monitoring, injecting false information, or even exploiting vulnerabilities in the *SkyWalking collector's* data processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise within SkyWalking, monitoring disruption, potential *SkyWalking collector* compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Agent Authentication:** Configure the *SkyWalking* OAP to require authentication from agents. *SkyWalking* supports various authentication mechanisms.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the *SkyWalking* collector endpoints to only authorized agents and networks.
        *   **TLS Encryption:** Ensure communication between agents and the *SkyWalking* collector is encrypted using TLS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

*   **Description:** Agent Configuration Tampering
    *   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** *SkyWalking* agents rely on configuration files (e.g., `agent.config`) or environment variables. If an attacker gains access to the application server, they could modify these *SkyWalking agent* settings.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the *SkyWalking agent* configuration to send telemetry data to a rogue collector under their control, potentially exfiltrating sensitive application information *through SkyWalking's mechanisms*. They could also disable security features or alter sampling rates to hide malicious activity *from SkyWalking*.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration *via SkyWalking*, compromised monitoring *within SkyWalking*, potential for further application compromise *due to actions taken based on faulty SkyWalking data*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File System Permissions:** Implement strict file system permissions on the *SkyWalking agent* configuration files, limiting access to only necessary users and processes.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use secure configuration management tools and practices to manage *SkyWalking agent* configurations and prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the *SkyWalking agent* process with the minimum necessary privileges.

*   **Description:** Collector Input Validation Vulnerabilities
    *   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** The *SkyWalking* OAP needs to parse and process telemetry data received from agents. If the input validation is insufficient, attackers could send specially crafted data to exploit vulnerabilities *in the SkyWalking collector*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious trace segment with excessively long fields or unexpected characters that could cause a buffer overflow or other processing errors in the *SkyWalking collector*, potentially leading to denial of service or remote code execution *on the collector*.
    *   **Impact:** *SkyWalking collector* instability, denial of service *of the SkyWalking collector*, potential remote code execution on the *SkyWalking collector*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement thorough input validation and sanitization on the *SkyWalking* collector side to handle unexpected or malicious data.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the *SkyWalking* collector to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Keep SkyWalking Updated:** Ensure the *SkyWalking* OAP is running the latest stable version with security patches applied.

*   **Description:** UI Authentication and Authorization Bypass
    *   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** The *SkyWalking* UI provides a web interface for visualizing and analyzing telemetry data. Vulnerabilities in the *SkyWalking* UI's authentication and authorization mechanisms could allow unauthorized access *to SkyWalking data*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the *SkyWalking* UI's login process to bypass authentication and gain access to sensitive monitoring data *within SkyWalking*, potentially revealing business secrets or application vulnerabilities *exposed through SkyWalking*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive monitoring data *within SkyWalking*, potential data breaches *of information visible through SkyWalking*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication Mechanisms:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the *SkyWalking* UI, such as multi-factor authentication.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Configure RBAC to restrict access to specific data and functionalities within the *SkyWalking* UI based on user roles.
        *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the *SkyWalking* UI and its dependencies updated with the latest security patches.

*   **Description:** Collector Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** The *SkyWalking* OAP relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the *SkyWalking collector*.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of a library used by the *SkyWalking* OAP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the *SkyWalking collector* server.
    *   **Impact:** *SkyWalking collector* compromise, potential data breaches *of data stored by SkyWalking*, denial of service *of the SkyWalking collector*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a robust dependency management system to track and manage the *SkyWalking* OAP's dependencies.
        *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan the *SkyWalking* OAP's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
        *   **Security Audits:** Include dependency analysis in security audits and penetration testing of the *SkyWalking collector*.

*   **Description:** Agent Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** Similar to the collector, the *SkyWalking* agent also relies on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application where the *SkyWalking* agent is running.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a logging library used by the *SkyWalking agent* could be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the application server.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Manage *SkyWalking agent* dependencies carefully and keep them updated.
        *   **Regular Dependency Scanning:** Scan *SkyWalking agent* dependencies for vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
        *   **Minimize Agent Dependencies:** Consider using a minimal *SkyWalking agent* configuration to reduce the number of dependencies.
