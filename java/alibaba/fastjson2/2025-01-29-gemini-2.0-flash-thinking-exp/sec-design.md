# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The fastjson2 project aims to provide a high-performance and feature-rich JSON library for Java.
  - Primary goals are to offer fast JSON parsing and serialization, be compatible with various JSON standards, and be easy to integrate into Java applications.
  - The project likely targets developers and organizations that require efficient JSON processing in their applications, especially in performance-sensitive environments like microservices, data processing pipelines, and web applications.
  - For businesses adopting fastjson2, the priorities are likely to improve application performance, reduce resource consumption related to JSON processing, and ensure compatibility with existing systems that rely on JSON data exchange.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to data breaches or application compromise if exploited by attackers.
  - Performance issues or bugs in the library could cause application instability or service disruptions.
  - Compatibility issues with different JSON standards or other libraries could lead to integration problems and development delays.
  - Supply chain risks if the library's dependencies or build process are compromised.
  - Reputational damage if security flaws or critical bugs are discovered and publicized.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process (assumed for open-source projects, but not explicitly stated in the repository).
  - security control: Static code analysis (assumed, but not explicitly stated).
  - security control: Unit and integration testing (evident from the repository structure and test directories).
  - security control: Open-source nature allows for community security review and contributions.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential delay in security patch releases due to open-source development cycles.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
  - security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
  - security control: Consider fuzz testing to proactively discover input validation vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Provide security advisories for reported vulnerabilities and their fixes.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a JSON library. Authentication is handled by the applications that use fastjson2.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a JSON library. Authorization is handled by the applications that use fastjson2.
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Robust input validation is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks (e.g., if fastjson2 is used to process user-provided JSON data that is later used in other contexts).
    - security requirement: The library must handle malformed or unexpected JSON input gracefully and securely, avoiding crashes or unexpected behavior.
    - security requirement: Implement validation to prevent denial-of-service attacks through excessively large or deeply nested JSON structures.
  - Cryptography:
    - security requirement: If fastjson2 is intended to handle sensitive data within JSON, ensure that it does not introduce vulnerabilities related to cryptographic operations if any are performed (though unlikely for a core JSON library).
    - security requirement: If the library provides features for handling encrypted JSON data (e.g., JWE, JWA), these features must be implemented securely, following best practices for cryptography.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For a JSON library, the critical business process is the reliable and secure processing of JSON data within applications that depend on it.
  - If fastjson2 fails or has vulnerabilities, applications using it might malfunction, become unavailable, or be compromised, impacting any business processes those applications support.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data processed by fastjson2 depends entirely on how it is used by the consuming application.
  - fastjson2 itself does not inherently handle sensitive data unless the applications using it pass sensitive data through it for serialization or deserialization.
  - If applications use fastjson2 to process Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, or other confidential information, then the data handled by fastjson2 is considered sensitive.
  - The sensitivity level should be determined based on the context of the applications using fastjson2 and the type of data they process.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the primary use cases for fastjson2 within the organization or for its users? (e.g., web APIs, data storage, configuration files).
  - Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) that applications using fastjson2 must adhere to?
  - What are the performance requirements for JSON processing in applications using fastjson2?
  - Is there a vulnerability disclosure policy in place for fastjson2?
  - Are there specific security features or configurations of fastjson2 that are commonly used or recommended?
  - What is the process for updating fastjson2 in applications when new versions or security patches are released?

- Assumptions:
  - fastjson2 is primarily used as a library integrated into Java applications for JSON processing.
