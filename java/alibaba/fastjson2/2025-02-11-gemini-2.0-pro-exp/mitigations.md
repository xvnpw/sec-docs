## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable AutoType and Similar Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_autotype_and_similar_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Configuration:** Identify all places where fastjson2 is configured. This might include:
        *   Direct calls to `JSONReader.Feature.SupportAutoType.config(false)`.
        *   Configuration files (e.g., Spring Boot properties, XML configurations) where fastjson2 settings are managed.
        *   Framework-specific integrations (check documentation for your web framework, etc., for how they configure JSON parsing).
    2.  **Explicitly Disable:** Ensure `SupportAutoType` is set to `false` in *all* identified locations. If using a higher-level API (like `JSON.parseObject`), trace the configuration down to the underlying fastjson2 settings to confirm this.
    3.  **Centralize (Recommended):** If possible, consolidate fastjson2 configuration into a single, well-defined location (e.g., a dedicated configuration class) to avoid inconsistencies and make future updates easier.
    4.  **Verify:** After making changes, use debugging or logging to confirm that `SupportAutoType` is indeed disabled during runtime.  Attempting to deserialize a class based solely on the `@type` field *should* result in an error.
    5.  **Regularly Review:** Periodically review the configuration to ensure that it hasn't been accidentally changed or overridden.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via malicious `@type` field in JSON input.
        *   **Severity:** Critical. Allows complete system compromise.
    *   **Threat:** Deserialization of arbitrary, untrusted classes specified via `@type`.
        *   **Severity:** High to Critical (depending on available "gadget" classes).
    *   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via crafted JSON input that triggers excessive resource consumption during deserialization due to unexpected class instantiation.
        *   **Severity:** High (can disrupt application availability).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduced from Critical to Very Low (assuming no other vulnerabilities exist that allow class name injection *outside* of fastjson2's mechanisms).
    *   **Arbitrary Class Deserialization:** Risk reduced from High/Critical to Very Low.
    *   **DoS (related to autoType):** Risk significantly reduced, although other DoS vectors unrelated to fastjson2 might still exist.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Implemented in `com.example.config.FastJsonConfig` class, applied globally to all `JSON.parseObject` calls. Also configured in Spring Boot's `application.properties`."  Be specific about file paths and configuration keys.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Missing implementation for the `LegacyDataImportService`, which uses a custom `ObjectMapper` that hasn't been reviewed for fastjson2 settings.  We need to audit this component."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Strict Allowlist (if AutoType is Required)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_strict_allowlist__if_autotype_is_required_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Justify Necessity:**  *Rigorously* justify the need for autoType. Explore alternative design patterns that avoid dynamic class instantiation from JSON. This is a *critical* first step.
    2.  **Identify Safe Classes:** Create a list of *only* the absolutely essential classes that need to be deserialized via autoType. Each class should be fully vetted for security implications.
    3.  **Use `addAccept()`:** Use `ParserConfig.getGlobalInstance().addAccept("com.example.MySafeClass")` for each allowed class. Use the *fully qualified class name*.  Do *not* use wildcards.
    4.  **Avoid Wildcards/Prefixes:** Do *not* use wildcards (e.g., `com.example.*`) or package prefixes in the allowlist. Be as specific as possible. This is crucial for security.
    5.  **Centralize Allowlist:** Maintain the allowlist in a single, well-defined location (e.g., a configuration class or file).
    6.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update the allowlist. Remove any classes that are no longer needed.  This should be a scheduled task.
    7.  **Consider Custom Filters:** For complex allowlist logic (beyond simple class name matching), implement a custom `Filter` to control deserialization behavior. fastjson2 provides interfaces for this.
    8.  **Test Thoroughly:**  Test the allowlist extensively to ensure that it allows *only* the intended classes and blocks *all* others.  Use negative testing to confirm this.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** RCE via malicious `@type` (but only if the attacker can find a "gadget" class *within* the allowlist).
        *   **Severity:** High (reduced from Critical, but still significant). The risk depends entirely on the allowlist's contents.
    *   **Threat:** Deserialization of arbitrary, untrusted classes (limited to the allowlist).
        *   **Severity:** Medium (reduced from High/Critical).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduced, but still present. The effectiveness depends entirely on the security of the classes *in* the allowlist and the absence of exploitable gadgets within those classes.
    *   **Arbitrary Class Deserialization:** Risk significantly reduced, but not eliminated. The allowlist defines the scope of allowed classes.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Not currently implemented. AutoType is disabled globally." OR "Implemented in `com.example.config.FastJsonConfig` for the `SpecialDataProcessor` component, which requires deserialization of specific DTOs. The allowlist contains: `com.example.dto.DataA`, `com.example.dto.DataB`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Not applicable, as AutoType is disabled." OR "Missing implementation for any new components that might require autoType in the future. A process needs to be established for reviewing and approving additions to the allowlist *before* they are implemented."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use SafeMode (if available and applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/use_safemode__if_available_and_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check Availability:** Consult the fastjson2 documentation for your *specific* version to determine if SafeMode is supported and how it is implemented.
    2.  **Enable SafeMode:** Follow the documented instructions to enable SafeMode. This might involve a configuration setting (e.g., a system property, environment variable) or a specific API call.
    3.  **Test Functionality:** *Thoroughly* test your application after enabling SafeMode to ensure that it still functions correctly. SafeMode might disable features that your application relies on, so comprehensive testing is essential.
    4.  **Monitor for Compatibility Issues:** Be aware of potential compatibility issues with other libraries or frameworks that interact with fastjson2.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** RCE and other vulnerabilities related to autoType and similar features that SafeMode disables.
        *   **Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerabilities addressed by SafeMode in the version you are using).
    *   **Threat:** Deserialization of arbitrary classes (if SafeMode completely disables this).
        *   **Severity:** High to Critical.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE and related vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced, potentially to Very Low, depending on the comprehensiveness of SafeMode's protections.
    *   **Arbitrary Class Deserialization:** Risk significantly reduced, potentially eliminated, if SafeMode fully disables this functionality.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Not currently implemented. Will investigate compatibility with our current fastjson2 version (2.0.x)." OR "Implemented via the `FASTJSON2_SAFE_MODE=true` environment variable."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Needs investigation and testing to determine if SafeMode is suitable for our application and if it provides sufficient protection without breaking required functionality."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update fastjson2](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_fastjson2.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (Maven, Gradle, etc.) to manage the fastjson2 dependency.  This is standard practice for managing external libraries.
    2.  **Automated Updates:** Configure your build system to automatically check for new versions of fastjson2. Tools like Dependabot (for GitHub) can automate this.
    3.  **Security Notifications:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow fastjson2's official channels (e.g., GitHub releases, project website) to receive notifications about security vulnerabilities and patches.
    4.  **Testing and Deployment:** Establish a process for promptly testing and deploying updates, *especially* security patches. Prioritize updates that address CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
    5.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in place in case an update introduces compatibility issues or regressions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Exploitation of *known* vulnerabilities in older versions of fastjson2.
        *   **Severity:** Varies (from Low to Critical) depending on the specific vulnerability that has been patched.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced to Very Low for vulnerabilities that have been patched in the updated version.  This is a *reactive* mitigation, addressing issues after they are discovered.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Implemented via Maven. We use Dependabot to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates. We have a staging environment for testing updates before production deployment." OR "Partially implemented. We manually check for updates every month, which is not frequent enough."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Need to configure automated dependency updates and establish a faster response process for security patches.  Our current manual process is too slow."
