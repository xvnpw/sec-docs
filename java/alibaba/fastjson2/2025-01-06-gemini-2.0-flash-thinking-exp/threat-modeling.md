# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/fastjson2

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization of Arbitrary Classes](./threats/unsafe_deserialization_of_arbitrary_classes.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that, when processed by `JSON.parseObject` or related methods, instructs `fastjson2` to instantiate arbitrary Java classes present on the application's classpath. The attacker can manipulate the properties of these classes during deserialization. This can be used to trigger the execution of malicious code if a vulnerable class with exploitable methods or constructors is present.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application server, execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSON` (specifically the `parseObject`, `parse`, and related deserialization methods).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly into objects without strict type control.
*   Utilize `TypeReference` with explicitly allowed classes for deserialization to restrict the types that can be instantiated.
*   Disable or restrict autoType feature if it is not strictly necessary. If required, use a carefully curated whitelist of allowed classes.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
*   Keep `fastjson2` library updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Employ runtime application self-protection (RASP) solutions that can detect and block deserialization attacks.
*   Consider using a more restrictive deserialization configuration if available.

## Threat: [Gadget Chains Exploitation](./threats/gadget_chains_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Even with some restrictions on deserialization, attackers can leverage existing classes (gadgets) within the application's classpath to form chains of method calls during deserialization. These chains can be carefully constructed to achieve malicious outcomes, such as code execution, without directly instantiating explicitly blocked classes.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data manipulation, or other unintended application behavior.

**Affected Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSON` (the deserialization process and how it handles object instantiation and property setting).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the application's dependency footprint to reduce the number of potential gadget classes available.
*   Employ security scanning tools that can identify known gadget chains.
*   Implement strong input validation and sanitization.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using a security manager or similar mechanism to restrict the actions that deserialized objects can perform.
