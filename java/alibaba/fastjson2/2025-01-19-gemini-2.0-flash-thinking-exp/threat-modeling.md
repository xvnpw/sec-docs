# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/fastjson2

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `AutoType` exploitation](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via__autotype__exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload containing a `@type` directive that instructs Fastjson2 to deserialize a class that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code. This often involves using known "deserialization gadgets" present in the application's classpath or its dependencies. The attacker sends this payload to an endpoint that uses Fastjson2 to deserialize JSON data.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server or application. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSONReader` (specifically the handling of `@type` and deserialization logic).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable `AutoType` globally.
* Use allow lists for deserialization.
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
* Keep Fastjson2 updated.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Deeply Nested Objects)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__deeply_nested_objects_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with extremely deep nesting. When Fastjson2 attempts to parse and deserialize this deeply nested structure, it can consume excessive stack space or processing time, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.

**Affected Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSONReader` (parsing and object construction logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure maximum depth limits.
* Implement timeouts for deserialization.
* Implement request size limits.
* Use resource monitoring and alerting.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Large String/Array Values)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__large_stringarray_values_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing extremely large string or array values. Parsing and storing these large values can consume excessive memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to memory exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** `com.alibaba.fastjson2.JSONReader` (string and array parsing and storage).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure maximum string and array size limits.
* Implement request size limits.
* Use resource monitoring and alerting.
