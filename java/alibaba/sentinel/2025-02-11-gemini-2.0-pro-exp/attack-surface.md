# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/sentinel

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Dashboard Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_dashboard_access.md)

*Description:* Attackers gain access to the Sentinel Dashboard, allowing them to view, modify, or delete rules and configurations.
*How Sentinel Contributes:* The Dashboard is Sentinel's central management interface, providing direct control over its core functionality.  Its web-based nature and the power it wields make it a prime target.
*Example:* An attacker uses a discovered default password or exploits a vulnerability in the Dashboard's authentication mechanism to gain administrative access.  They then disable all flow control rules, leading to a successful denial-of-service attack.
*Impact:* Complete compromise of Sentinel's functionality, potential denial-of-service, data exposure (if rules reveal sensitive information), bypass of security controls.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* Dashboard users.
    *   **Authorization (RBAC):** Implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Sentinel Dashboard software *absolutely current* with the latest security patches.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF configured to protect against common web attacks targeting the Dashboard.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Dashboard from the public internet.  Use a dedicated, secure network segment.
    *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously sanitize all user inputs to the Dashboard to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Security Audits & Penetration Testing:** Conduct *frequent* security audits and penetration tests specifically targeting the Dashboard.

## Attack Surface: [Rule Manipulation via Configuration](./attack_surfaces/rule_manipulation_via_configuration.md)

*Description:* Attackers modify Sentinel's configuration files or environment variables to alter or disable protection rules.
*How Sentinel Contributes:* Sentinel's behavior is *directly* determined by its configuration.  Insecure access to this configuration provides a direct path to manipulate Sentinel's core functionality.
*Example:* An attacker gains write access to the `sentinel.properties` file (perhaps through a compromised service account or a shared file system vulnerability) and modifies it to set extremely high flow control thresholds, effectively disabling protection.
*Impact:* Weakening or disabling of Sentinel's protection, leading to denial-of-service, performance degradation, or other application-specific impacts.  Direct control over Sentinel's core logic.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a *dedicated, secure* configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).  Do *not* store configurations in easily accessible locations.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Enforce the principle of least privilege.  Only authorized users and processes should have read/write access to configuration files and environment variables.
    *   **Integrity Checks:** Implement checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of configuration files.  Detect and prevent unauthorized modifications.
    *   **Secure Transport:** Use TLS/HTTPS when loading configuration from remote sources (if applicable).
    *   **Configuration Validation:** *Validate* configuration data *before* applying it.  Ensure it conforms to expected formats and values, and reject invalid configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Dynamic Rule Source](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_dynamic_rule_source.md)

*Description:* Attackers gain control of the dynamic rule source (e.g., Nacos, Apollo, Zookeeper) and inject malicious rules.
*How Sentinel Contributes:* Sentinel's dynamic rule loading feature creates a *direct* dependency on the security of the external rule source.  Compromise of the source is a compromise of Sentinel.
*Example:* An attacker compromises the credentials for the Nacos server used by Sentinel and injects a rule that sets `grade` to `0` (allow all) for all resources, effectively disabling all of Sentinel's protection mechanisms.
*Impact:* Complete control over Sentinel's rule set, enabling attackers to disable protection, cause denial-of-service, or manipulate application behavior.  This is a direct attack on Sentinel's core functionality.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Secure the Rule Source:** Implement *strong* authentication and authorization for the dynamic rule source.  Use robust access control mechanisms.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the rule source from untrusted networks.  Use a dedicated, secure network segment.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the rule source software (Nacos, Zookeeper, etc.) *up-to-date* with the latest security patches.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the rule source for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts.  Implement alerting.
    *   **Secure Communication:** Use TLS/HTTPS for *all* communication between Sentinel and the rule source.
    *   **Rule Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of rules retrieved from the dynamic source (e.g., digital signatures or checksums).  Reject any rules that fail integrity checks.
