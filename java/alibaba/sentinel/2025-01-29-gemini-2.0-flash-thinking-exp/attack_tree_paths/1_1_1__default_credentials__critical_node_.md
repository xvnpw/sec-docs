### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1. Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]

#### 4.1. Attack Vector Breakdown

**Description:** The attack vector relies on the common security oversight of failing to change default credentials after deploying the Sentinel Dashboard.  Many applications, including management interfaces like dashboards, are often shipped with pre-configured default usernames and passwords for initial access.  If administrators neglect to change these during the setup process, they create an easily exploitable vulnerability.

**Sentinel Specifics:**  While the exact default credentials for the Sentinel Dashboard should be verified in the official documentation for the specific version being used, it's common practice for such systems to have well-known defaults like `admin/admin`, `administrator/password`, or similar combinations. Attackers are aware of these common defaults and will often attempt them as a first step in reconnaissance and exploitation.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Discovery:** The attacker first needs to identify a Sentinel Dashboard instance. This could be done through:
    * **Port Scanning:** Scanning for common ports associated with web dashboards (e.g., 8080, 8858 - Sentinel's default port for the Dashboard).
    * **Web Application Fingerprinting:** Identifying the Sentinel Dashboard through its HTTP responses, headers, or specific resources.
    * **Information Leakage:**  Accidental exposure of the Dashboard URL in documentation, public repositories, or error messages.

2. **Credential Guessing:** Once the Dashboard is identified, the attacker will attempt to log in using default credentials. This is a straightforward process:
    * **Username/Password List:** The attacker will use a list of common default usernames and passwords, including those potentially associated with Sentinel or similar management interfaces.
    * **Automated Tools:**  Tools can automate the process of trying multiple username/password combinations against the login form.

3. **Successful Login (Exploitation):** If the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker will successfully authenticate to the Sentinel Dashboard.

#### 4.2. Assessment of Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, and Detection Difficulty

* **Likelihood: Low (Should be changed, but sometimes overlooked)**
    * **Justification:**  While best practices strongly emphasize changing default credentials, human error and oversight are common. In fast-paced development or less security-conscious environments, this step can be unintentionally skipped.  The likelihood is considered "Low" because security awareness is generally increasing, and organizations are becoming more aware of this risk. However, it's not negligible.
    * **Factors Increasing Likelihood:**
        * **Rapid Deployment:**  Pressure to quickly deploy applications can lead to shortcuts in security configuration.
        * **Lack of Security Awareness:**  Developers or operators may not fully understand the risks associated with default credentials.
        * **Incomplete Documentation or Training:**  If setup documentation doesn't clearly highlight the importance of changing default credentials, it can be overlooked.
        * **Development/Testing Environments:** Default credentials might be intentionally left in place in non-production environments and accidentally carried over to production.

* **Impact: Critical (Full control of Sentinel)**
    * **Justification:**  Gaining access to the Sentinel Dashboard with default credentials grants the attacker administrative privileges over the entire Sentinel system. This "full control" is critical because Sentinel is a critical component for application resilience and traffic management.
    * **Consequences of Full Control:**
        * **Configuration Manipulation:**  Attackers can modify Sentinel rules, flow control configurations, circuit breaker settings, and other parameters. This can lead to:
            * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Disrupting application traffic flow, blocking legitimate requests, or triggering circuit breakers unnecessarily.
            * **Performance Degradation:**  Introducing latency or throttling legitimate traffic.
            * **Bypass Security Controls:**  Disabling or weakening Sentinel's protection mechanisms.
        * **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation (Indirect):** While Sentinel itself might not directly store sensitive application data, controlling its configuration can indirectly facilitate data exfiltration or manipulation by disrupting application behavior or creating vulnerabilities in protected services.
        * **Monitoring and Logging Manipulation:**  Attackers could potentially tamper with Sentinel's monitoring and logging capabilities to hide their malicious activities or disrupt incident response.
        * **Lateral Movement:**  Compromising the Sentinel Dashboard can be a stepping stone for further attacks on the underlying infrastructure or applications managed by Sentinel.

* **Effort: Low (Very easy if defaults exist)**
    * **Justification:**  Exploiting default credentials requires minimal effort.  It's essentially a matter of trying a few well-known username/password combinations.  No sophisticated tools or techniques are needed.
    * **Tools:**  Simple web browsers or basic HTTP request tools are sufficient. Automated scripts can further reduce the effort.

* **Skill Level: Beginner**
    * **Justification:**  No specialized cybersecurity skills are required to exploit default credentials.  Basic knowledge of web browsers and login forms is sufficient.  This attack vector is within the reach of even novice attackers.

* **Detection Difficulty: Easy (Login attempts can be logged)**
    * **Justification:**  Login attempts to web dashboards are typically logged by default. Failed login attempts, especially using common default usernames, should be easily detectable in security logs.
    * **Detection Mechanisms:**
        * **Login Attempt Logging:**  Sentinel Dashboard should log all login attempts, including timestamps, usernames, and success/failure status.
        * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**  Logs from the Sentinel Dashboard can be ingested into a SIEM system for centralized monitoring and alerting.
        * **Anomaly Detection:**  Unusual login patterns, especially from unexpected IP addresses or during off-hours, can be flagged as suspicious.
    * **Factors Affecting Detection:**
        * **Log Retention and Monitoring:**  Effective detection relies on proper log retention policies and active monitoring of security logs.
        * **Alerting and Response:**  Detection is only useful if alerts are generated and responded to promptly.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of default credential exploitation for the Sentinel Dashboard, the following strategies should be implemented:

1. **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:**
    * **Implementation:**  Force users to change the default password immediately upon their first login to the Sentinel Dashboard. This is the most crucial and effective mitigation.
    * **Technical Approach:**  The application should be designed to detect the first login attempt with the default credentials and redirect the user to a password change page. The system should not allow further access until the password is changed.

2. **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:**
    * **Implementation:**  Enforce a strong password policy for all Sentinel Dashboard user accounts.
    * **Policy Elements:**
        * **Minimum Password Length:**  Enforce a minimum password length (e.g., 12-16 characters).
        * **Complexity Requirements:**  Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        * **Password History:**  Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
        * **Regular Password Rotation (Optional but Recommended):**  Encourage or enforce periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days).

3. **Account Lockout Policy:**
    * **Implementation:**  Implement an account lockout policy to prevent brute-force password guessing attacks.
    * **Mechanism:**  After a certain number of failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5), temporarily lock the user account for a defined period (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
    * **Considerations:**  Ensure the lockout policy doesn't inadvertently cause denial of service for legitimate users. Consider CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to differentiate between human and automated login attempts.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Implementation:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including the presence of default credentials.
    * **Focus Areas:**  Specifically test for default credentials and weak password vulnerabilities in the Sentinel Dashboard and related systems.

5. **Security Hardening Documentation and Best Practices:**
    * **Implementation:**  Create and maintain comprehensive security hardening documentation for Sentinel deployments.
    * **Content:**  Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials, provide step-by-step instructions for secure configuration, and outline other security best practices.
    * **Accessibility:**  Make this documentation easily accessible to all developers, operators, and administrators responsible for deploying and managing Sentinel.

6. **Monitoring and Alerting for Failed Login Attempts:**
    * **Implementation:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting for failed login attempts to the Sentinel Dashboard.
    * **Alert Triggers:**  Configure alerts for:
        * **Multiple Failed Login Attempts from the Same User:**  Indicates potential brute-force attack.
        * **Failed Login Attempts with Default Usernames:**  Strong indicator of default credential exploitation attempts.
        * **Login Attempts from Unusual IP Addresses or Geolocation:**  May indicate unauthorized access attempts.
    * **Response Procedures:**  Establish clear incident response procedures to handle security alerts related to failed login attempts.

7. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Implementation:**  Apply the principle of least privilege when assigning user roles and permissions within the Sentinel Dashboard.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement RBAC to ensure users only have access to the functionalities they need to perform their job duties. Avoid granting unnecessary administrative privileges.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Default Credentials" attack path, while seemingly simple, poses a **critical risk** to Sentinel deployments due to the high impact of successful exploitation.  Gaining access to the Sentinel Dashboard with default credentials grants attackers full control over a critical infrastructure component, potentially leading to significant disruptions, security breaches, and operational failures.

The **likelihood**, while categorized as "Low," is still a real concern due to the persistent issue of human error and oversight in security configuration. The **effort** and **skill level** required for exploitation are extremely low, making this attack vector accessible to a wide range of attackers.  Fortunately, **detection** is relatively easy if proper logging and monitoring are in place.

### 6. Recommendations for Development Team

The development team should prioritize the following actions to mitigate the risk of default credential exploitation for the Sentinel Dashboard:

1. **Implement Mandatory Password Change on First Login:** This is the **highest priority** recommendation and should be implemented immediately in the next release of the Sentinel Dashboard.
2. **Enforce Strong Password Policy:**  Implement and enforce a robust password policy for all user accounts.
3. **Implement Account Lockout Policy:**  Add an account lockout mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks.
4. **Enhance Security Documentation:**  Create and prominently feature security hardening documentation that clearly emphasizes the importance of changing default credentials and outlines secure configuration best practices.
5. **Promote Security Awareness:**  Conduct internal training and awareness programs to educate developers, operators, and administrators about the risks of default credentials and other common security vulnerabilities.
6. **Integrate Security Audits into Development Lifecycle:**  Incorporate regular security audits and penetration testing into the software development lifecycle to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities.
7. **Review and Enhance Logging and Monitoring:**  Ensure comprehensive logging of login attempts and implement effective monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activity.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk associated with default credentials and enhance the overall security posture of Sentinel deployments, protecting users and their applications from potential attacks.
