### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1. Default Credentials

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Exploiting Default Credentials for Sentinel Dashboard Access

**Detailed Description:**

The Sentinel Dashboard, like many web applications, requires authentication to prevent unauthorized access to its management and monitoring functionalities.  The "Default Credentials" attack vector exploits the scenario where the Sentinel application is deployed with pre-configured, well-known usernames and passwords that are intended to be changed during the initial setup process. If administrators fail to change these default credentials, attackers can leverage this oversight to gain unauthorized access.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Discovery:** The attacker identifies a target application using Sentinel. This could be through network scanning, reconnaissance, or simply knowing the application is using Sentinel.
2. **Dashboard Identification:** The attacker locates the Sentinel Dashboard URL. This is often predictable or easily discoverable through common paths (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/sentinel`, `/admin`).
3. **Credential Guessing/Brute-forcing (Default Credentials):** The attacker attempts to log in to the Sentinel Dashboard using a list of common default usernames and passwords associated with Sentinel or similar applications. These lists are readily available online and often include combinations like:
    * `admin`/`admin`
    * `sentinel`/`sentinel`
    * `root`/`password`
    * `administrator`/`password`
    * `user`/`password`
    * And variations thereof.
4. **Successful Login:** If the default credentials have not been changed, the attacker successfully authenticates to the Sentinel Dashboard.
5. **Unauthorized Access:** Upon successful login, the attacker gains access to the Sentinel Dashboard with the privileges associated with the default account.

**Technical Considerations:**

* **Sentinel Version:** The specific default credentials (if any) might vary depending on the Sentinel version and deployment method.
* **Authentication Mechanism:** Sentinel likely uses standard web authentication mechanisms (e.g., form-based login, basic authentication). The attack vector is independent of the specific mechanism but relies on the existence of default credentials.
* **Access Control:** The level of access granted by the default account is crucial. Typically, default accounts are designed for administrative purposes, granting extensive control over the Sentinel application.

#### 4.2. Likelihood: Low (Should be changed, but sometimes overlooked)

**Justification:**

The likelihood is categorized as "Low" because:

* **Security Awareness:**  Security best practices strongly emphasize changing default credentials for all systems and applications. Most security-conscious administrators are aware of this risk.
* **Documentation and Guides:**  Sentinel documentation and deployment guides should ideally highlight the importance of changing default credentials during initial setup.
* **Security Audits and Scans:** Organizations conducting regular security audits and vulnerability scans are likely to identify and flag default credentials as a security weakness.

**Factors Increasing Likelihood:**

* **Rushed Deployments:** In fast-paced development or deployment environments, security configurations might be overlooked in favor of speed.
* **Lack of Awareness:**  Administrators with limited security knowledge or those unfamiliar with Sentinel's security requirements might not realize the importance of changing default credentials.
* **Internal Deployments:**  Organizations might perceive internal deployments as less risky, leading to relaxed security practices and overlooking default credential changes.
* **Legacy Systems:** Older Sentinel deployments might have been set up before robust security practices were fully implemented or enforced.

#### 4.3. Impact: Critical (Full control of Sentinel)

**Justification:**

The impact is categorized as "Critical" because unauthorized access to the Sentinel Dashboard via default credentials typically grants the attacker **full administrative control** over the Sentinel application. This can lead to severe consequences:

* **Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers can modify Sentinel's configuration, including:
    * **Disabling security features:** Turning off rate limiting, circuit breaking, or other protective mechanisms.
    * **Altering rules and policies:** Changing traffic shaping rules, access control lists, or monitoring thresholds.
    * **Adding backdoors:** Injecting malicious configurations to maintain persistent access or compromise the application further.
* **Monitoring Data Manipulation:** Attackers can tamper with monitoring data, logs, and metrics collected by Sentinel, potentially:
    * **Hiding malicious activity:**  Erasing or altering logs to conceal attacks.
    * **Generating false alarms:**  Creating diversions or masking real security incidents.
    * **Gaining insights into application behavior:**  Analyzing monitoring data to understand application vulnerabilities and plan further attacks.
* **Service Disruption (Denial of Service):** Attackers can intentionally misconfigure Sentinel to disrupt the protected application's availability, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
* **Data Exfiltration (Indirect):** While Sentinel itself might not directly store sensitive application data, attackers can use their control over Sentinel to:
    * **Redirect traffic:**  Route application traffic through attacker-controlled servers to intercept sensitive data.
    * **Expose internal application details:**  Gain insights into the application's architecture and vulnerabilities, facilitating further attacks that could lead to data breaches.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack exploiting default credentials can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to secure systems and protect data can lead to violations of regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

#### 4.4. Effort: Low (Very easy if defaults exist)

**Justification:**

The effort required to exploit default credentials is "Low" because:

* **No Specialized Tools or Skills:**  The attack requires minimal technical skills. Attackers can use readily available web browsers or simple scripting tools.
* **Publicly Available Information:** Default usernames and passwords for common applications are widely documented and easily accessible through online searches and security resources.
* **Automation:**  The process of trying default credentials can be easily automated using scripts or password brute-forcing tools.
* **Direct Access:**  If the Sentinel Dashboard is publicly accessible or reachable from the attacker's network, the attack can be launched directly without complex network penetration techniques.

#### 4.5. Skill Level: Beginner

**Justification:**

The skill level required to execute this attack is "Beginner" because:

* **Basic Web Interaction:**  The attack primarily involves interacting with a web login form, which is a fundamental skill for anyone familiar with web browsing.
* **No Exploitation or Coding Skills:**  No vulnerability exploitation, reverse engineering, or complex coding skills are necessary.
* **Pre-existing Knowledge:**  Attackers can leverage readily available lists of default credentials and instructions on how to access web dashboards.

#### 4.6. Detection Difficulty: Easy (Login attempts can be logged)

**Justification:**

Detection of default credential exploitation attempts is "Easy" because:

* **Login Logging:**  Web applications and security systems typically log login attempts, including usernames and timestamps. Failed login attempts, especially with default usernames, are strong indicators of potential attacks.
* **Monitoring Failed Login Attempts:** Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be configured to monitor and alert on excessive failed login attempts, particularly those using common usernames.
* **Account Lockout Policies:** Implementing account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts can automatically detect and mitigate brute-force attempts, including those targeting default credentials.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Unusual login activity from unexpected locations or at unusual times, especially using default usernames, can be flagged as suspicious.

#### 4.7. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to the Sentinel Dashboard via default credentials, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:**
    * **Implementation:** Force users to change the default password immediately upon their first login to the Sentinel Dashboard. This is the most crucial step.
    * **Mechanism:**  The application should redirect users to a password change page after successful login with default credentials.
* **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:**
    * **Implementation:** Enforce strong password policies for all Sentinel Dashboard accounts, including:
        * **Minimum password length:**  Enforce a minimum length (e.g., 12-16 characters).
        * **Complexity requirements:**  Require a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
        * **Password history:**  Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords.
    * **Mechanism:**  Integrate password policy enforcement into the user account management system of Sentinel.
* **Account Lockout Policy:**
    * **Implementation:** Implement an account lockout policy that temporarily disables an account after a certain number of failed login attempts.
    * **Mechanism:**  Configure Sentinel's authentication system to track failed login attempts and lock accounts after a threshold is reached (e.g., 5-10 failed attempts).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Implementation:**  Avoid using default administrative accounts for routine tasks. Create separate user accounts with specific roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
    * **Mechanism:**  Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within Sentinel to define granular permissions for different user roles.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Implementation:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities, including the presence of default credentials.
    * **Mechanism:**  Include checks for default credentials in security checklists and penetration testing scopes.
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * **Implementation:**  Provide security awareness training to administrators and users emphasizing the importance of changing default credentials and practicing strong password hygiene.
    * **Mechanism:**  Incorporate modules on password security and default credential risks into security training programs.
* **Disable or Remove Default Accounts (If Possible):**
    * **Implementation:**  If Sentinel allows, disable or remove default administrative accounts after initial setup and create new accounts with strong passwords.
    * **Mechanism:**  Consult Sentinel documentation to determine if default accounts can be disabled or removed.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Implementation:**  Enable MFA for Sentinel Dashboard access to add an extra layer of security beyond passwords.
    * **Mechanism:**  Integrate MFA solutions (e.g., TOTP, SMS-based codes, hardware tokens) with Sentinel's authentication system.
* **Regularly Update Sentinel:**
    * **Implementation:**  Keep Sentinel updated to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities and benefit from security enhancements.
    * **Mechanism:**  Establish a process for regularly monitoring and applying Sentinel updates.

#### 4.8. Recommendations for Development Team

Based on this deep analysis, the following recommendations are provided to the development team:

1. **Eliminate or Secure Default Credentials:**
    * **Strongly recommend removing default credentials entirely from Sentinel deployments.** If default credentials are unavoidable for initial setup, implement a **mandatory password change on first login** as a non-negotiable requirement.
    * **Clearly document the default credentials (if they exist) and the absolute necessity to change them immediately after deployment in the official Sentinel documentation and deployment guides.**
    * **Consider generating unique, random default passwords for each deployment instance** instead of using common, well-known defaults. This would significantly increase the effort for attackers.

2. **Enhance Password Security Features:**
    * **Implement and enforce strong password policies** within Sentinel's user management system.
    * **Consider integrating with existing organizational password management systems** for centralized policy enforcement and user convenience.
    * **Implement account lockout policies** to automatically mitigate brute-force attacks.

3. **Improve User Guidance and Security Awareness:**
    * **Provide clear and prominent warnings about the risks of default credentials during the initial setup process.**
    * **Include security best practices and recommendations in the official Sentinel documentation and deployment guides.**
    * **Consider adding a security checklist or hardening guide specifically for Sentinel deployments.**

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection Capabilities:**
    * **Ensure comprehensive logging of login attempts, including failed attempts and usernames.**
    * **Provide built-in monitoring dashboards or integrations with SIEM systems to easily track and alert on suspicious login activity.**

5. **Promote Security by Default:**
    * **Design Sentinel with security in mind from the outset.**  Minimize reliance on default configurations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.
    * **Prioritize security features and ease of secure configuration in the development roadmap.**

By implementing these mitigation strategies and recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the Sentinel Dashboard via default credentials and enhance the overall security posture of Sentinel deployments. This will protect users and organizations from potential critical impacts associated with this attack vector.
