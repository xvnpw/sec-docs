## Mitigation Strategy: [Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Sentinel Rule Management](./mitigation_strategies/infrastructure-as-code__iac__for_sentinel_rule_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for Sentinel Rule Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an IaC Tool:** Select a suitable IaC tool like Terraform, Ansible, or Pulumi.
    2.  **Define Sentinel Rules as Code:**  Represent Sentinel rules (flow rules, degrade rules, system rules, etc.) in a declarative configuration language supported by your chosen IaC tool. This could involve creating configuration files (e.g., Terraform `.tf` files, Ansible playbooks).
    3.  **Version Control:** Store the IaC configuration files in a version control system (e.g., Git). This enables tracking changes, rollbacks, and collaboration.
    4.  **Automated Deployment Pipeline:** Integrate the IaC configuration into your CI/CD pipeline.  Automate the process of applying Sentinel rule changes from the version-controlled configuration to your Sentinel environment.
    5.  **State Management:**  Utilize the state management capabilities of your IaC tool to track the current configuration of Sentinel and ensure consistent deployments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfigured Sentinel Rules (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of manual configuration errors leading to security bypasses or denial of service *within Sentinel*.
    *   **Lack of Auditability of Sentinel Rules (Medium Severity):**  Improves auditability by tracking rule changes in version control *specifically for Sentinel rules*.
    *   **Inconsistent Sentinel Rule Deployments (Medium Severity):** Ensures consistent rule deployments across different environments *for Sentinel configurations*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfigured Sentinel Rules:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Lack of Auditability of Sentinel Rules:** Moderately Reduces
    *   **Inconsistent Sentinel Rule Deployments:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We use Ansible for deploying application code, but Sentinel rules are currently managed manually through the dashboard.
*   **Missing Implementation:** IaC is not yet implemented for Sentinel rule management. We need to create Ansible playbooks or Terraform configurations to define and deploy Sentinel rules as code and integrate this into our CI/CD pipeline.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Formal Rule Review and Approval Process for Sentinel Rules](./mitigation_strategies/formal_rule_review_and_approval_process_for_sentinel_rules.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Formal Rule Review and Approval Process for Sentinel Rules
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles and Responsibilities:** Clearly define roles for *Sentinel rule* creation, review, and approval (e.g., developers propose rules, security team reviews, operations team approves).
    2.  **Establish a Review Workflow:** Implement a workflow (e.g., using a ticketing system or code review platform) where proposed *Sentinel rules* are submitted for review.
    3.  **Security Review:**  The security team reviews proposed *Sentinel rules* for potential security implications, ensuring they align with security policies and don't introduce vulnerabilities *through Sentinel misconfiguration*.
    4.  **Operational Review:** The operations team reviews *Sentinel rules* for operational impact, ensuring they are feasible and won't negatively affect application performance or availability *due to Sentinel rules*.
    5.  **Approval and Documentation:**  *Sentinel rules* are formally approved after review. Document the approved rules, including their purpose, justification, and review history.
    6.  **Communication:** Communicate approved *Sentinel rule* changes to relevant teams (development, operations, security).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfigured Sentinel Rules (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of deploying *Sentinel rules* with unintended security consequences due to lack of oversight.
    *   **Bypass of Security Controls via Sentinel Misconfiguration (High Severity):** Prevents deployment of *Sentinel rules* that might inadvertently weaken existing security controls.
    *   **Denial of Service due to Sentinel Rules (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of deploying *Sentinel rules* that could lead to application instability or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfigured Sentinel Rules:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Bypass of Security Controls via Sentinel Misconfiguration:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Denial of Service due to Sentinel Rules:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have informal discussions about significant rule changes, but there's no formal documented process *specifically for Sentinel rules*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to formalize the *Sentinel rule* review and approval process by documenting roles, creating a workflow (potentially using Jira or similar), and ensuring all *Sentinel rule* changes go through this process before deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Staging Environment for Sentinel Rule Testing](./mitigation_strategies/staging_environment_for_sentinel_rule_testing.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Staging Environment for Sentinel Rule Testing
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mirror Production Environment:** Create a staging environment that closely mirrors the production environment in terms of infrastructure, application configuration, and data (anonymized production-like data).
    2.  **Deploy Sentinel in Staging:** Deploy Sentinel in the staging environment with configurations and *rules* intended for production.
    3.  **Test Rule Functionality:** Thoroughly test all *Sentinel rules* in the staging environment before deploying them to production. This includes functional testing (verifying *rules* behave as expected) and performance testing (assessing impact on application performance *due to Sentinel rules*).
    4.  **Monitor and Analyze:** Monitor Sentinel metrics and application behavior in staging to identify any unintended consequences or misconfigurations of the *rules*.
    5.  **Iterate and Refine:** Based on testing results, iterate and refine the *Sentinel rules* in staging until they are validated and perform as expected.
    6.  **Promote to Production:** Once *rules* are thoroughly tested and validated in staging, promote them to the production environment.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfigured Sentinel Rules in Production (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces the risk of deploying misconfigured *Sentinel rules* to production by identifying issues in a safe environment.
    *   **Denial of Service in Production due to Sentinel Rules (Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental denial of service in production due to incorrectly configured *Sentinel rate limiting or circuit breaking*.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Sentinel Rules (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of unexpected application behavior caused by new or modified *Sentinel rules*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfigured Sentinel Rules in Production:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Denial of Service in Production due to Sentinel Rules:** Moderately Reduces
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Sentinel Rules:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have a staging environment, but it's not consistently used for testing *Sentinel rule* changes before production deployment. Rule testing is often limited to basic checks in production after deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to mandate the use of the staging environment for testing all *Sentinel rule* changes before production deployment. This requires integrating *Sentinel rule* deployment into our staging environment deployment process and establishing clear testing procedures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Sentinel Dashboard with Strong Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/secure_sentinel_dashboard_with_strong_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Sentinel Dashboard with Strong Authentication and Authorization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication:** Ensure authentication is enabled for accessing the *Sentinel Dashboard*.  If using default configurations, change default credentials immediately.
    2.  **Implement Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for *Sentinel Dashboard* user accounts (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements, password rotation).
    3.  **Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for enhanced security, especially for administrator accounts accessing the *Sentinel Dashboard*. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond passwords.
    4.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Configure RBAC within *Sentinel* or integrate with an external identity provider to control access to *dashboard* features and functionalities based on user roles (e.g., read-only, rule management, admin).
    5.  **Regularly Review User Accounts:** Periodically review *Sentinel Dashboard* user accounts and permissions. Remove or disable accounts that are no longer needed or have excessive privileges.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sentinel Dashboard (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing the *Sentinel dashboard* and potentially modifying rules or monitoring sensitive data.
    *   **Rule Manipulation by Attackers via Sentinel Dashboard (High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers gaining access to the *Sentinel dashboard* and manipulating Sentinel rules to bypass security controls or cause disruptions.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Sentinel Dashboard (Medium Severity):** Protects sensitive monitoring data displayed on the *Sentinel dashboard* from unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sentinel Dashboard:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Rule Manipulation by Attackers via Sentinel Dashboard:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Information Disclosure via Sentinel Dashboard:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have basic password authentication enabled for the Sentinel Dashboard, but default credentials were changed.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to implement strong password policies, explore and implement MFA, and configure RBAC for the Sentinel Dashboard. We also need to establish a process for regular user account reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Network Access to Sentinel Dashboard and APIs](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_network_access_to_sentinel_dashboard_and_apis.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Network Access to Sentinel Dashboard and APIs
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Necessary Access:** Determine which users and systems legitimately require access to the *Sentinel Dashboard and APIs*.
    2.  **Network Segmentation:** Place the *Sentinel Dashboard and API servers* within a private network segment, isolated from public networks.
    3.  **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewalls to restrict inbound access to the *Sentinel Dashboard and API ports* (typically HTTP/HTTPS) to only authorized IP addresses or network ranges.
    4.  **VPN or Bastion Host:** For remote access to *Sentinel Dashboard and APIs*, require users to connect through a VPN or bastion host before accessing them.
    5.  **Internal Network Access Control:** If access is required from within the internal network, implement network access control lists (ACLs) or micro-segmentation to limit access to only authorized internal systems *accessing Sentinel*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized External Access to Sentinel Dashboard and APIs (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized external access to the *Sentinel dashboard and APIs*, reducing the attack surface.
    *   **Remote Exploitation of Sentinel Dashboard/API Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Limits the potential for remote attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the *Sentinel Dashboard or APIs*.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Sentinel Infrastructure (Medium Severity):**  Restricts potential lateral movement within the network if the *Sentinel Dashboard or API server* is compromised.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized External Access to Sentinel Dashboard and APIs:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Remote Exploitation of Sentinel Dashboard/API Vulnerabilities:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Sentinel Infrastructure:** Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. The Sentinel Dashboard is accessible within our internal network, but not directly exposed to the public internet.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to implement stricter network segmentation for the *Sentinel infrastructure*, configure firewall rules to limit access to specific internal IP ranges, and enforce VPN access for remote administration of *Sentinel*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Maintain Up-to-Date Sentinel Installation](./mitigation_strategies/maintain_up-to-date_sentinel_installation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain Up-to-Date Sentinel Installation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track Sentinel Releases:** Monitor Sentinel project releases and security advisories (e.g., GitHub releases, mailing lists).
    2.  **Regular Update Schedule:** Establish a schedule for regularly updating *Sentinel* to the latest stable version.
    3.  **Testing After Updates:** After updating *Sentinel*, perform thorough testing to ensure compatibility and stability of *Sentinel and the application using it*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Sentinel Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Mitigates known vulnerabilities in *Sentinel itself* by applying security patches and updates.
    *   **Exploitation of Known Sentinel Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of *Sentinel*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Sentinel Vulnerabilities:** Significantly Reduces
    *   **Exploitation of Known Sentinel Vulnerabilities:** Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We generally try to keep our dependencies updated, but *Sentinel updates* are not performed on a regular schedule and are often reactive rather than proactive.
*   **Missing Implementation:** We need to establish a proactive schedule for *Sentinel updates*, and ensure we are actively monitoring *Sentinel security advisories*.
