# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/sentinel

## Threat: [Unauthorized Rule Modification via Management API](./threats/unauthorized_rule_modification_via_management_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Sentinel management API (if exposed) or the underlying rule storage *managed by Sentinel*. They then modify existing rules to disable protection, introduce malicious rules, or exfiltrate configuration data. This could be achieved through compromised credentials for the Sentinel dashboard or API, API vulnerabilities *within Sentinel's management interface*, or insecure storage access controls *for Sentinel's rule persistence*.

**Impact:** Complete bypass of Sentinel's protection, leading to application compromise, denial of service, or data breaches.

**Affected Sentinel Component:** `Dashboard UI` (if used), `Rule Management API`, underlying rule storage mechanism (e.g., file system, Nacos) *as managed by Sentinel*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Secure the Sentinel management API with strong authentication and authorization (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0), restrict network access to the management interface, implement role-based access control for rule management *within Sentinel*, and encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit *within Sentinel's configuration*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Rule Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_through_rule_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Sentinel rule management endpoint with a large number of requests to create, update, or delete rules. This can overwhelm the Sentinel control plane, making it unresponsive and potentially disrupting the application's protection mechanisms.

**Impact:**  Sentinel becomes unavailable, leaving the application unprotected. The control plane itself might become unstable, affecting other applications relying on the same Sentinel instance.

**Affected Sentinel Component:** `Rule Management API`, underlying rule storage *managed by Sentinel*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the rule management API *of Sentinel*, enforce authentication and authorization for rule management operations *within Sentinel*, and monitor the health and performance of the Sentinel control plane.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Sentinel Client SDK](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_sentinel_client_sdk.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits security vulnerabilities within the Sentinel client SDK integrated into the application code. This could involve sending specially crafted requests that trigger bugs in the SDK, leading to remote code execution or other malicious outcomes within the application process.

**Impact:**  Application compromise, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or further attacks on internal systems.

**Affected Sentinel Component:** `Sentinel Client SDK` (the specific language implementation used by the application).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep the Sentinel client SDK updated to the latest version, subscribe to security advisories for Sentinel, and perform regular security testing (including static and dynamic analysis) of the application with the integrated Sentinel client.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Sentinel Core or Plugins](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_sentinel_core_or_plugins.md)

**Description:**  Sentinel, like any software, relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by attackers if not properly managed.

**Impact:**  Can lead to various security issues, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Sentinel Component:** `Sentinel Core`, various `Sentinel Plugins` (e.g., for data sources, adapters).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update Sentinel and its plugins to the latest versions, use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Sentinel's dependencies, and follow secure development practices for any custom Sentinel plugins.
