## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Sentinel Rule Management -> Inject Malicious Flow Rules -> Exploit Unsecured Rule API/Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sentinel_rule_management_-_inject_malicious_flow_rules_-_exploit_unsecured_ru_15877a16.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting an unsecured API endpoint for rule management.
* Description: An attacker bypasses authentication or authorization mechanisms on Sentinel's rule management API to inject malicious flow rules. These rules can redirect traffic, block legitimate requests, or introduce vulnerabilities into the application's traffic flow.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: High (Direct control over application behavior)
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Sentinel Rule Management -> Modify Existing Flow Rules -> Exploit Unsecured Rule API/Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sentinel_rule_management_-_modify_existing_flow_rules_-_exploit_unsecured_rul_13ef0e9f.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting an unsecured API endpoint for rule management.
* Description: Similar to injecting rules, an attacker exploits the unsecured rule management API to modify existing flow rules. This can have the same detrimental effects as injecting malicious rules, potentially disrupting service or creating security loopholes.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: High (Direct control over application behavior)
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Sentinel Metrics Collection -> Inject False Metrics -> Exploit Unsecured Metrics Reporting Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sentinel_metrics_collection_-_inject_false_metrics_-_exploit_unsecured_metric_a70250b0.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting an unsecured endpoint for reporting metrics.
* Description: An attacker sends fabricated metrics data to Sentinel through an unsecured endpoint. This can mislead Sentinel's traffic control decisions, potentially causing unnecessary throttling, triggering circuit breakers inappropriately, or masking real issues.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Medium (Can lead to incorrect throttling, circuit breaking)
* Effort: Low to Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Sentinel Metrics Collection -> Manipulate Metrics for Monitoring/Alerting -> Exploit Unsecured Metrics Reporting Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sentinel_metrics_collection_-_manipulate_metrics_for_monitoringalerting_-_exp_b3fe1d1c.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting an unsecured endpoint for reporting metrics.
* Description: Attackers inject false metrics specifically to trigger false alarms or flood monitoring systems, potentially masking real attacks or causing operational disruptions due to unnecessary alerts.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Medium (Can disrupt monitoring and create confusion)
* Effort: Low to Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Sentinel Metrics Collection -> Suppress Legitimate Metrics -> Exploit Unsecured Metrics Reporting Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_sentinel_metrics_collection_-_suppress_legitimate_metrics_-_exploit_unsecured_c51eb74e.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting an unsecured endpoint for reporting metrics.
* Description: Attackers exploit the unsecured metrics reporting endpoint to prevent legitimate metrics from reaching Sentinel's monitoring and alerting systems. This can effectively blind security teams to ongoing attacks or performance issues.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Impact: Medium (Hides malicious activity, delays incident response)
* Effort: Low to Medium
* Skill Level: Intermediate
* Detection Difficulty: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via Sentinel Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_sentinel_exploitation.md)

* Description: This is the root goal of the attacker and represents the ultimate success in compromising the application by leveraging vulnerabilities within Sentinel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Sentinel Rule Management](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_sentinel_rule_management.md)

* Description: This represents a critical area of vulnerability. If an attacker can successfully exploit Sentinel's rule management, they gain significant control over the application's traffic flow and behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Unsecured Rule API/Endpoint](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_unsecured_rule_apiendpoint.md)

* Description: This specific attack vector is a critical point of failure as it enables direct manipulation of Sentinel's rules. Its presence in multiple high-risk paths highlights its importance for security.
