# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/sentinel

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Sentinel Dashboard Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_sentinel_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Sentinel Dashboard, if enabled, provides a web interface for monitoring and managing Sentinel configurations. If access is not properly secured with authentication, it becomes a direct entry point for attackers.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel provides this dashboard as a management interface. Its presence inherently introduces this attack surface if not secured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Sentinel Dashboard without logging in (due to default settings or misconfiguration) and views sensitive application metrics, flow rules, and circuit breaker configurations.
    *   **Impact:**  Information disclosure, unauthorized modification of flow rules (potentially disabling protections or introducing malicious ones), and disruption of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication on the Sentinel Dashboard.
        *   Use strong, unique credentials for dashboard access.
        *   Restrict network access to the dashboard to authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Regularly review and update dashboard access credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Sentinel Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_sentinel_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** Input fields within the Sentinel Dashboard are vulnerable to XSS attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other dashboard users.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** The Sentinel Dashboard, as a web application, handles user input. If this input is not properly sanitized, it can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a rule description field. When an administrator views this rule, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise of dashboard users, potential for further attacks against the application or infrastructure through the compromised user's session.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding within the Sentinel Dashboard codebase.
        *   Regularly scan the dashboard for XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or content within the dashboard.
        *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on Sentinel Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__on_sentinel_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** The Sentinel Dashboard lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the dashboard.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** The Sentinel Dashboard's functionality allows for state-changing operations (e.g., modifying rules). Without CSRF protection, these actions can be triggered by malicious websites or emails.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted email to an authenticated Sentinel Dashboard user. Clicking a link in the email triggers a request to the dashboard to disable a critical flow rule, effectively bypassing protection.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of Sentinel configurations, potentially leading to service disruption or security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., synchronizer tokens) on all state-changing endpoints of the Sentinel Dashboard.
        *   Ensure that the framework used for the dashboard has built-in CSRF protection enabled.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Sentinel Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_sentinel_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** The Sentinel Dashboard exposes internal object identifiers (e.g., for rules or configurations) in URLs or API requests without proper authorization checks, allowing attackers to access or modify resources they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** The way Sentinel's dashboard manages and references its internal objects can introduce IDOR vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker observes the URL for editing a specific flow rule (e.g., `/rules/edit?id=123`). They then try to access `/rules/edit?id=456`, potentially gaining access to or modifying a rule they are not authorized to manage.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of Sentinel configurations, potentially leading to service disruption or security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement proper authorization checks on all endpoints that access or modify Sentinel objects.
        *   Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs or API requests. Use indirect references or UUIDs.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Sentinel API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_sentinel_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** If Sentinel exposes an API for programmatic management (e.g., HTTP API) and this API lacks proper authentication or uses weak authentication methods, attackers can directly interact with Sentinel.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel's API provides a way to manage its functionalities. The security of this API is crucial.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers an exposed Sentinel API endpoint without authentication and uses it to disable all flow rules, effectively removing the application's protection.
    *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of Sentinel's protections, unauthorized modification of configurations, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Sentinel API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce authorization checks to ensure only authorized entities can perform specific actions.
        *   Secure the API endpoints using HTTPS.
        *   Rate limit API requests to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Sentinel Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_sentinel_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** If Sentinel rules and configurations are stored insecurely (e.g., in plain text files with weak permissions), attackers gaining access to the system can modify these configurations.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel needs to persist its configuration. The security of this storage is critical.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server's file system and modifies the Sentinel configuration file to disable all flow rules or introduce malicious ones.
    *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of Sentinel's protections, unauthorized modification of configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that Sentinel configuration files are stored with appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to authorized users only.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive configuration data at rest.
        *   Implement access controls on the storage mechanism used by Sentinel.
