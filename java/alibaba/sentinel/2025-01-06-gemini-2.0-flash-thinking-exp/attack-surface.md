# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/sentinel

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured or Weakly Secured Sentinel Dashboard Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_or_weakly_secured_sentinel_dashboard_access.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Unsecured or Weakly Secured Sentinel Dashboard Access**
    *   **Description:** The Sentinel dashboard provides a web interface for managing and monitoring Sentinel instances. If access to this dashboard is not properly secured, it can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel provides this dashboard as a core component. The security configuration of this dashboard (authentication, authorization) directly impacts the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker finds the Sentinel dashboard exposed on a public IP address without any authentication or with default credentials. They log in and can view application metrics, modify flow control rules, or even trigger circuit breakers.
    *   **Impact:**  Full visibility into application traffic and resource usage, ability to disrupt application functionality through rule manipulation (DoS), potential access to sensitive information displayed on the dashboard.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong passwords and consider multi-factor authentication for dashboard access.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Sentinel dashboard within a secure network segment, limiting access from untrusted networks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security assessments of the Sentinel dashboard and its access controls.
        *   **Disable Public Access:** Ensure the dashboard is not directly accessible from the public internet. Use VPNs or other secure methods for remote access if needed.

## Attack Surface: [Sentinel API/SDK Integration Vulnerabilities (Insecure Communication)](./attack_surfaces/sentinel_apisdk_integration_vulnerabilities__insecure_communication_.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Sentinel API/SDK Integration Vulnerabilities (Insecure Communication)**
    *   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Sentinel client SDK might be vulnerable if not properly secured.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel's architecture relies on the application integrating its SDK to enforce traffic control and collect metrics. The security of this communication channel is crucial.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and the Sentinel SDK, modifying resource identifiers or flow control requests to bypass limits or disrupt service.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing of traffic control rules, potential for resource exhaustion attacks, manipulation of metrics data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Secure Communication Protocols:** Ensure communication between the application and the Sentinel SDK uses encrypted channels (e.g., TLS/SSL).
        *   **Mutual Authentication:** Implement mutual authentication between the application and Sentinel components to verify the identity of both parties.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate any data sent to the Sentinel SDK to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Surface: [Injection of Malicious Flow Control Rules](./attack_surfaces/injection_of_malicious_flow_control_rules.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Injection of Malicious Flow Control Rules**
    *   **Description:** Attackers gaining unauthorized access to Sentinel's configuration can inject malicious flow control rules.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel's core functionality revolves around flow control rules. The mechanism for defining and applying these rules is a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises an administrator account or exploits a vulnerability in a configuration API to inject a rule that blocks all legitimate traffic to a critical service, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, disruption of application functionality, potential for resource manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Implement strict access controls for modifying Sentinel's configuration.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Maintain detailed audit logs of all configuration changes to identify and track malicious modifications.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to users and applications interacting with Sentinel's configuration.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement validation mechanisms to ensure that new or modified rules adhere to expected patterns and do not introduce security risks.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Sentinel SDK Communication](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_sentinel_sdk_communication.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Sentinel SDK Communication**
    *   **Description:** If the Sentinel SDK uses serialization for communication, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel's SDK might utilize serialization for exchanging data with the Sentinel server or other components.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the Sentinel SDK, executes arbitrary code on the application server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** If possible, avoid using deserialization for communication.
        *   **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** If deserialization is necessary, use well-vetted and secure serialization libraries with known vulnerability mitigations.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data received before deserialization.
        *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep the Sentinel SDK and its dependencies up-to-date to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Sentinel Cluster Communication](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_sentinel_cluster_communication.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Sentinel Cluster Communication**
    *   **Description:** If Sentinel instances are clustered and the communication between them is not secured, it's vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    *   **How Sentinel Contributes:** Sentinel's clustering feature involves network communication between instances, which can be targeted.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts communication between two Sentinel instances in a cluster, potentially modifying configuration data or disrupting the cluster's operation.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of Sentinel's functionality, potential for inconsistent rule enforcement, ability to manipulate cluster state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable TLS/SSL for Cluster Communication:** Encrypt all communication between Sentinel cluster members using TLS/SSL with proper certificate validation.
        *   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Ensure the network infrastructure used for cluster communication is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
        *   **Mutual Authentication:** Implement mutual authentication between cluster members to verify the identity of each instance.
