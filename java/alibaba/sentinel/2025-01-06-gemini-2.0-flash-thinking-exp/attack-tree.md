## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Sentinel Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_sentinel_core.md)

* This path represents attacks that directly exploit weaknesses in Sentinel's code.
* It is high-risk because successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.
* Critical Node: Code Injection
    * Attackers inject malicious code through vulnerabilities in rule processing or API handling.
    * Critical Node: Exploit Rule Definition Parsing Vulnerability
      * A specific type of code injection where malicious code is embedded within rule definitions. This is critical due to the potential for arbitrary code execution on the Sentinel server.
  * Critical Node: Authentication/Authorization Bypass
    * Attackers bypass security measures to gain unauthorized access to Sentinel's management interfaces or APIs.
    * Critical Node: Exploit Weak Authentication Mechanism
      * Exploiting easily guessable passwords, default credentials, or other weak authentication methods. This is critical because it provides a direct entry point for attackers.
  * Critical Node: Denial of Service (DoS)
    * Attackers overwhelm Sentinel with malicious traffic or exploit resource exhaustion bugs to make it unavailable.
    * Critical Node: Overload Sentinel with Malicious Traffic
      * A common and easily executed DoS attack that can quickly impact application availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Sentinel Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_sentinel_configuration.md)

* This path involves attackers gaining access to modify Sentinel's configuration to weaken its security posture.
* It is high-risk because it can be achieved with relatively lower technical skill if access controls are weak.
* Critical Node: Modify Blocking Rules to Allow Malicious Traffic
    * Attackers alter or remove rules that block malicious traffic, creating an opening for attacks. This is critical as it directly negates Sentinel's protective function.
  * Critical Node: Disable Critical Sentinel Features
    * Attackers disable important features like flow control or circuit breakers, reducing the application's resilience. This is critical as it removes key protective mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration of Sentinel](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_of_sentinel.md)

* This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from improper setup and configuration of Sentinel.
* It is high-risk because misconfigurations are common and often easily exploitable.
* Critical Node: Weak Default Configuration
    * Using default credentials or insecure default settings provides easy access for attackers. This is critical due to the low effort and skill required for exploitation.
  * Critical Node: Overly Permissive Access Controls
    * Incorrectly configured access controls allow unauthorized individuals to manage Sentinel, leading to potential misuse and compromise. This is critical as it grants broad access to potentially malicious actors.
