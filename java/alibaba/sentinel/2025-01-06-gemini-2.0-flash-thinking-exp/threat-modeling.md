# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/sentinel

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Sentinel Dashboard](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_sentinel_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Sentinel dashboard, potentially through exposed ports, default credentials, or credential stuffing. They might then view sensitive metrics, modify configurations, or disable rules *within Sentinel*.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption due to disabled *Sentinel* rules, exposure of application performance and usage data *managed by Sentinel*, potential manipulation of traffic control *within Sentinel* leading to denial of service or resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Sentinel Component:** Sentinel Dashboard (UI), potentially the underlying authentication/authorization mechanism *within Sentinel*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong, unique passwords for Sentinel administrator accounts and enforce password complexity policies.
    *   Restrict network access to the Sentinel dashboard (e.g., using firewalls, VPNs).
    *   Disable default administrative accounts if possible *within Sentinel*.
    *   Enable and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for dashboard access.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions *within Sentinel*.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Storage](./threats/insecure_configuration_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Sentinel's configuration, including rules and potentially sensitive information like data source credentials *used by Sentinel*, is stored insecurely (e.g., plain text files, easily accessible locations). An attacker gaining access to the server or configuration files could read or modify this information *related to Sentinel*.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data *used by Sentinel*, manipulation of traffic control rules *within Sentinel* leading to service disruption or bypass of security measures, potential compromise of backend systems if data source credentials *for Sentinel* are exposed.
*   **Affected Sentinel Component:** Configuration Management Module *within Sentinel*, potentially the persistence layer (e.g., local file system, Nacos).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest *for Sentinel*.
    *   Restrict file system permissions for Sentinel configuration files to only necessary users/processes.
    *   Utilize secure configuration management systems like Nacos with appropriate access controls *for Sentinel's configuration*.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in Sentinel configuration; use secrets management solutions.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Configuration Updates](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_configuration_updates.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between a client updating Sentinel's configuration (e.g., via API or dashboard) and the Sentinel server. They could then modify the configuration in transit, injecting malicious rules or disabling existing ones *within Sentinel*.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption due to manipulated *Sentinel* rules, bypass of security measures *enforced by Sentinel*, potential injection of rules that cause resource exhaustion or redirect traffic *managed by Sentinel*.
*   **Affected Sentinel Component:** Configuration API *of Sentinel*, communication channels between clients and the Sentinel server.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all communication with the Sentinel dashboard and configuration API *of Sentinel*.
    *   Ensure proper certificate validation is in place.
    *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced security.

## Threat: [Bypassing Rules through Payload Manipulation](./threats/bypassing_rules_through_payload_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft requests that exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in Sentinel's rule matching logic, allowing malicious traffic to bypass intended restrictions *enforced by Sentinel*.
*   **Impact:** Successful execution of attacks that Sentinel was intended to block, such as excessive requests, resource exhaustion, or exploitation of application vulnerabilities *that Sentinel should have mitigated*.
*   **Affected Sentinel Component:** Flow Control Module *within Sentinel*, potentially the integration points with the application *where Sentinel evaluates rules*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test Sentinel rules with various attack vectors and edge cases.
    *   Ensure the application properly integrates with Sentinel and passes all relevant request information *for Sentinel's rule evaluation*.
    *   Keep Sentinel and its client libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   Consider using more robust rule matching criteria and regular expression validation *within Sentinel*.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication between Application and Sentinel](./threats/insecure_communication_between_application_and_sentinel.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and Sentinel (e.g., API calls for rule evaluation) is not secured, allowing attackers to intercept or manipulate these communications *intended for Sentinel*.
*   **Impact:** Bypass of Sentinel's protection mechanisms, potential for injecting malicious requests or altering rule evaluation outcomes *within Sentinel's processing*.
*   **Affected Sentinel Component:** Sentinel Client Libraries, communication channels between the application and Sentinel core.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for all communication between the application and Sentinel.
    *   Consider using authentication and authorization mechanisms for API calls to Sentinel.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Sentinel Client Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sentinel_client_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in the Sentinel client libraries used by the application, which could be exploited to compromise the application or bypass Sentinel's protections.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, bypass of Sentinel's intended functionality.
*   **Affected Sentinel Component:** Sentinel Client Libraries (e.g., Java SDK).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Sentinel client libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when using the client libraries.
    *   Regularly review the dependencies of the client libraries for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Sentinel Core](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_sentinel_core.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the Sentinel core software itself.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of Sentinel, leading to the inability to protect the application or even enabling attacks against the application.
*   **Affected Sentinel Component:** Various modules within the Sentinel core depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Sentinel updated to the latest version with security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in Sentinel.
