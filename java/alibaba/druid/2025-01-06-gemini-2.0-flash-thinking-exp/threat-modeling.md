# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/druid

## Threat: [Connection Pool Exhaustion Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/connection_pool_exhaustion_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally or unintentionally cause the application to rapidly acquire and hold database connections from the Druid connection pool, exhausting the available connections managed by `DruidDataSource`. This could be achieved through malicious requests that don't release connections properly or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application logic that lead to excessive connection usage.
*   **Impact:** Inability of the application to establish new database connections, leading to application downtime, service disruption, and potential data loss if transactions are interrupted.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** `DruidDataSource`, connection pool management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Properly configure Druid's connection pool parameters (e.g., `initialSize`, `minIdle`, `maxActive`, `maxWait`) based on application needs and database capacity.
    *   Implement connection timeout mechanisms (e.g., `removeAbandonedTimeout`) to reclaim connections that are held for too long.
    *   Monitor connection pool usage through Druid's monitoring features and implement alerts for potential exhaustion.
    *   Implement rate limiting or request throttling at the application level to prevent malicious actors from overwhelming the connection pool.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data Through Query Logging (If Enabled)](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_through_query_logging__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If Druid's query logging feature (e.g., through `StatFilter` or `LogFilter`) is enabled, it might inadvertently log sensitive data contained within the executed SQL queries, including user credentials, personal information, or financial data. This information could be exposed if access to the Druid logs is not properly controlled.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information to individuals with access to the Druid logs, potentially leading to privacy violations, identity theft, or financial loss.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** Logging mechanisms within Druid (`StatFilter`, `LogFilter`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium (Upgraded to High if logs are easily accessible or contain highly sensitive data)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully consider the necessity of query logging in production environments.
    *   If query logging is required, implement strict access controls on Druid log files, ensuring only authorized personnel can access them.
    *   Sanitize or redact sensitive data from query logs before they are written. Configure logging to exclude sensitive parameters where possible.
    *   Use secure logging practices and ensure logs are stored securely.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities within the Druid Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_within_the_druid_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software library, Druid might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution flaws, denial-of-service vulnerabilities, or information disclosure bugs) within its code. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if present.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability but could range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution on the application server where Druid is running.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** Various modules and functions within the Druid library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical to Low, focusing here on High and Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay up-to-date with the latest stable version of the Druid library.** Regularly check for updates and security patches released by the Alibaba Druid team.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for reported issues in Druid.
    *   Apply security patches promptly after thorough testing in a non-production environment.
    *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's use of Druid.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Druid's Transitive Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_druid's_transitive_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Druid relies on other third-party libraries (transitive dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the security of applications using Druid. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities through Druid's usage of the affected dependency.
*   **Impact:** Similar to vulnerabilities within Druid itself, the impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. This could range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** Transitive dependencies of the Druid library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical to Low, focusing here on High and Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit the application's dependencies, including Druid's transitive dependencies.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, GitHub Dependency Graph) to identify known vulnerabilities in Druid's dependencies.
    *   Update vulnerable dependencies to patched versions. This might require updating the Druid library itself if the vulnerable dependency is a direct dependency of Druid and not easily overridden.
    *   Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and alerting.
