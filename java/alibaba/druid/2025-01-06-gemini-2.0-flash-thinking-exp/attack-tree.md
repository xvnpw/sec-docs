## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Default Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_default_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage default or weak credentials that are often present in default Druid configurations.
*   **Steps:**
    1. Attacker attempts to log in to the Druid admin console using default credentials (e.g., admin/admin).
    2. Upon successful login, the attacker gains full access to the Druid console.
    3. From the console, the attacker can execute malicious SQL queries directly against the connected database.
    4. Alternatively, the attacker can reconfigure data sources to point to malicious databases, enabling data exfiltration or poisoning.
*   **Impact:** Full control over Druid, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, and the ability to compromise connected databases.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting Unprotected Monitoring/Management Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploiting_unprotected_monitoringmanagement_endpoints.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Druid's monitoring and management APIs are exposed without proper authentication or with weak protection.
*   **Steps:**
    1. Attacker identifies the location of Druid's monitoring/management endpoints (often standard HTTP paths).
    2. Attacker accesses these endpoints without providing valid credentials.
    3. Through these unprotected endpoints, the attacker can retrieve sensitive configuration details, including database credentials.
    4. The retrieved credentials can then be used to directly access the database or other related systems.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data, including database credentials, allowing for further unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: SQL Injection via Druid](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_sql_injection_via_druid.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before incorporating it into SQL queries executed through Druid.
*   **Steps:**
    1. Attacker identifies input fields within the application that are used to construct SQL queries executed by Druid.
    2. Attacker crafts malicious SQL payloads and injects them into these input fields.
    3. When the application executes the query through Druid, the injected SQL is executed against the underlying database.
    4. This allows the attacker to bypass application logic and directly interact with the database.
*   **Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation, and potentially remote command execution on the database server.
