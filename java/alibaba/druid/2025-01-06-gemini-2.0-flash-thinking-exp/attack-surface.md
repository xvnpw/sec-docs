# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/druid

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Druid Monitoring Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_druid_monitoring_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Druid provides built-in web-based monitoring endpoints that display various metrics and information about the database connections and executed queries.
    *   **How Druid Contributes:** Druid inherently provides these endpoints as a feature for monitoring and diagnostics. If not secured, they become publicly accessible.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses `/druid/index.html` or `/druid/wall.html` without authentication and views recently executed SQL queries, revealing sensitive data or application logic.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential exposure of sensitive data, insights into application structure and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing Druid's monitoring endpoints. This can be done at the application level or through web server configurations.
        *   Restrict access to these endpoints based on IP address or network segments.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Druid Logs](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_druid_logs.md)

*   **Description:** Druid logs can contain detailed information about database interactions, including SQL queries, connection details, and error messages.
    *   **How Druid Contributes:** Druid's logging mechanism is responsible for generating these logs, and the level of detail is configurable.
    *   **Example:** Log files contain full SQL queries with sensitive data in the WHERE clause or connection strings with embedded credentials. An attacker gains access to these log files through a misconfiguration or vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential exposure of sensitive data, database credentials, and internal application workings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls for log files. Ensure only authorized personnel and processes can access them.
        *   Configure Druid's logging level to minimize the amount of sensitive information logged (e.g., avoid logging full SQL queries in production).
        *   Implement log rotation and secure storage mechanisms for log files.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Druid Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_druid_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured Druid settings can introduce vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.
    *   **How Druid Contributes:** Druid's configuration files and settings define how it operates, including connection parameters and security features.
    *   **Example:** The JDBC URL in Druid's configuration contains database credentials in plain text, and this configuration file is accessible due to weak file permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Potential compromise of database credentials, unauthorized access to the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store Druid's configuration files with appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information like database credentials directly in configuration files. Use secure credential management mechanisms (e.g., environment variables, secrets management tools).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Druid Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_druid_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software library, Druid might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Druid Contributes:** The application's dependency on the Druid library introduces the risk of inheriting any vulnerabilities present in Druid's code.
    *   **Example:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability in a specific version of Druid allows for remote code execution if a certain configuration is used.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical / High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Druid library updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases to stay informed about potential risks.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of JMX Interface (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_jmx_interface__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If Java Management Extensions (JMX) is enabled for Druid, it provides a way to monitor and manage the application. If not properly secured, it can be a point of attack.
    *   **How Druid Contributes:** Druid, being a Java library, can be managed through JMX.
    *   **Example:** An attacker connects to the unprotected JMX port and uses exposed management beans to reconfigure Druid or gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for complete compromise of the application and underlying database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable JMX if it is not required.
        *   If JMX is necessary, enable strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Restrict access to the JMX port using firewalls or network segmentation.
