## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Druid Console and Monitoring Endpoints](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_druid_console_and_monitoring_endpoints.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Access to Druid Console and Monitoring Endpoints
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Druid Endpoints:** Locate the specific URLs exposed by Druid for its console (typically `/druid/index.html` served by the Coordinator or Broker) and monitoring endpoints (e.g., `/druid/status`, `/druid/coordinator/v1/metadata`, `/druid/broker/v1/`). These are inherent features of Druid.
    2.  **Configure Authentication for Druid Endpoints:** Implement authentication specifically for these `/druid/*` paths. This might involve configuring a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) in front of Druid to handle authentication before requests reach Druid, or leveraging any built-in security features offered directly by Druid (refer to Druid documentation for authentication configuration if available).  Choose strong authentication methods.
    3.  **Implement Authorization for Druid Features:** Define roles and permissions relevant to Druid's functionalities. Restrict access to the Druid console and monitoring data based on user roles. For example, limit access to data modification features (if any are exposed via the console or API) to administrators only. Configure authorization rules at the reverse proxy or within Druid's security configuration if supported.
    4.  **Network Segmentation for Druid Instances:** Deploy Druid Coordinator, Broker, and other components within a private network segment. Use firewalls to strictly control network access to Druid ports (e.g., 8082 for Coordinator, 8081 for Broker) only from authorized internal networks or specific IP ranges. This isolates Druid as a backend service.
    5.  **Disable Druid SQL Console in Production:**  Specifically disable the Druid SQL console feature in production deployments. This console, if enabled, allows direct SQL query execution against Druid and is a significant risk if publicly accessible.  Disable this feature via Druid's configuration settings.
    6.  **Regularly Review Druid Access Controls:** Periodically review and update access control lists and authorization rules specifically for Druid endpoints and features to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege and current security needs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Unauthorized access to Druid's console and monitoring endpoints, which are *Druid-specific features*, can expose sensitive Druid metadata, query details, and potentially data insights.
    *   **Data Manipulation (High Severity):** If the *Druid SQL console (a Druid feature)* is enabled and accessible, attackers could execute arbitrary SQL queries against Druid, leading to data modification or deletion.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Unrestricted access to *Druid's monitoring endpoints* could allow attackers to overload Druid instances with requests, impacting Druid's performance and availability.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Weak access controls on *Druid's administrative interfaces* could allow attackers to gain unauthorized administrative privileges within the Druid system.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk for all listed threats by securing access to *Druid's own interfaces and features*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication is implemented using OAuth 2.0 at the application gateway level for the main application, but not explicitly configured for `/druid/*` endpoints which are *Druid specific paths*. Network segmentation is in place, Druid is in a private network. SQL console, a *Druid feature*, is enabled in development but should be disabled in production.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Authentication and authorization need to be explicitly configured and enforced for the `/druid/*` endpoints, *Druid's own endpoints*.  Authorization rules need to be defined to restrict access based on user roles for *Druid functionalities*. SQL console, a *Druid feature*, needs to be disabled in production deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize Queries to Prevent SQL Injection (Druid Specific Context)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_queries_to_prevent_sql_injection__druid_specific_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterize Queries to Prevent SQL Injection (Druid Specific Context)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dynamic Druid Query Construction:** Locate code sections where Druid queries are built dynamically, especially when user input is incorporated into *Druid queries*.
    2.  **Utilize Druid Parameterization Mechanisms:**  Specifically use Druid's API and query language features for parameterized queries when interacting with Druid. If Druid offers parameterization for the specific query type being used (e.g., native queries, SQL queries via Druid's SQL layer), leverage these features to pass user input as parameters, ensuring it's treated as data, not code within *Druid queries*. Refer to Druid documentation for parameterization syntax relevant to *Druid's query language*.
    3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Druid Query Context):** If direct parameterization within *Druid's query language* is not fully possible, implement input validation and sanitization specifically tailored for *Druid queries*.
        *   **Validation:** Validate user inputs against expected data types and formats relevant to *Druid query parameters*.
        *   **Druid Query Sanitization:** Escape special characters that are significant in *Druid's query language* before embedding user input into queries. Use escaping functions or libraries appropriate for *Druid's query syntax*.
    4.  **Code Review for Druid Query Security:** Conduct code reviews specifically focused on the security of *Druid query construction*. Pay close attention to how user input is handled and integrated into *Druid queries* to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    5.  **Least Privilege for Druid Database User:** Ensure the database user that *Druid uses* to connect to underlying data sources has only the minimum necessary permissions. This limits the potential impact if a SQL injection attack were to bypass other defenses and reach the underlying database *via Druid*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection in Druid Queries (Medium to High Severity):** Improper handling of user input in dynamically constructed *Druid queries* can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities within the *Druid context*. This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary *Druid queries*, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation *within Druid's data scope*.
*   **Impact:** Moderately to Significantly Reduces risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities specifically within *Druid query construction*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation is in place for user inputs used in *Druid queries*. However, explicit *Druid parameterization features* are not consistently used. Sanitization is performed using general string escaping, but might not be specifically tailored for *Druid's query language*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to refactor dynamic query construction to utilize *Druid's parameterized query features* wherever possible. Review and enhance input validation and sanitization to be specifically *Druid-query language aware*. Conduct code review specifically focused on SQL injection vulnerabilities in *Druid query construction*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Druid Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/secure_druid_configuration_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Druid Configuration Files
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict File System Permissions for Druid Configs:** Ensure that *Druid's configuration files* (e.g., files in `druid/conf/druid/`) are readable only by the *Druid process user* and system administrators. Use file system permissions to restrict access to these *Druid-specific configuration files*.
    2.  **Externalize Sensitive Druid Configuration:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like database passwords or API keys directly within *Druid configuration files*. Utilize environment variables, secure configuration management systems, or encrypted configuration files to manage sensitive parameters for *Druid deployments*.
    3.  **Regularly Audit Druid Configuration:** Periodically review *Druid configuration files* to identify any misconfigurations, insecure settings, or accidentally exposed sensitive information within *Druid's configuration*.
    4.  **Version Control and Change Management for Druid Configs:** Store *Druid configuration files* in version control systems. Implement change management procedures to track and control modifications to *Druid configuration*.
    5.  **Encryption at Rest for Druid Configs (Sensitive Data):** For deployments handling highly sensitive data with Druid, consider encrypting *Druid configuration files* at rest to protect sensitive configuration data.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration File Exposure (High Severity):** Unauthorized access to *Druid configuration files* can expose sensitive information like database credentials *used by Druid*, API keys, and internal *Druid system* details.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk of exposure of *Druid configuration files* and the sensitive information they contain.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. File system permissions are restricted to the *Druid process user* for *Druid configuration files*. Configuration files are under version control.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Sensitive configuration parameters, particularly database passwords *used by Druid*, are currently stored in plain text within *Druid configuration files*. Need to migrate to externalized configuration for *Druid sensitive settings*. Encryption at rest for *Druid configuration files* is not currently implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Druid and Dependencies Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_druid_and_dependencies_up-to-date.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Druid and Dependencies Up-to-Date
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Druid Update Process:** Define a process for regularly checking for updates to *Druid itself* and its dependencies. Monitor Druid project release notes and security advisories specifically.
    2.  **Druid Dependency Inventory:** Maintain an inventory of all dependencies used by *Druid*, including both direct and transitive dependencies. Use dependency management tools to track *Druid's dependencies*.
    3.  **Regular Druid Updates and Patching:** Schedule regular updates for *Druid* and its dependencies. Prioritize security patches and updates that address known vulnerabilities in *Druid or its dependencies*.
    4.  **Vulnerability Scanning for Druid Stack:** Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the development and CI/CD pipeline to specifically scan *Druid and its dependencies* for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Using outdated versions of *Druid* or its dependencies with known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to exploitation.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in *Druid and its ecosystem*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. There is a process for updating dependencies, but it's not strictly scheduled or automated for *Druid specifically*. Dependency inventory is maintained manually. Vulnerability scanning is not fully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for *Druid components*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to automate *Druid* and dependency updates and vulnerability scanning. Integrate vulnerability scanning for *Druid stack* into the CI/CD pipeline. Establish a regular schedule for checking and applying *Druid* and dependency updates, especially security patches.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor Druid Logs for Suspicious Activity](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_druid_logs_for_suspicious_activity.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Monitor Druid Logs for Suspicious Activity
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Centralized Logging for Druid:** Configure *Druid components* (Coordinator, Broker, etc.) to output logs to a centralized logging system. This facilitates analysis of *Druid-specific logs*.
    2.  **Druid Log Level Configuration:** Configure appropriate log levels for *Druid components*. Ensure sufficient logging detail to capture security-relevant events within *Druid's operation*.
    3.  **Define Druid Security Monitoring Rules:**  Identify log patterns in *Druid logs* that indicate suspicious activity or potential security incidents related to *Druid*. Examples include errors in *Druid components*, unusual query patterns logged by *Druid*, or authentication failures related to *Druid access*.
    4.  **Implement Alerting for Druid Logs:** Set up alerts in the centralized logging system to trigger notifications when suspicious log patterns are detected in *Druid logs*.
    5.  **Regular Druid Log Review and Analysis:** Periodically review *Druid logs* to identify trends, anomalies, and potential security incidents related to *Druid's behavior*.
    6.  **Log Retention for Druid Logs:** Establish a log retention policy to store *Druid logs* for a sufficient period for security investigations and compliance.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Delayed Incident Detection (Medium Severity):** Without proper monitoring of *Druid logs*, security incidents affecting *Druid* might go undetected.
    *   **Lack of Audit Trail (Medium Severity):** Insufficient logging of *Druid activity* can hinder security investigations related to *Druid*.
*   **Impact:** Moderately Reduces risk of delayed incident detection and improves incident response capabilities for *Druid-related security events*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. *Druid logs* are being collected and sent to a centralized logging system. Basic log levels are configured for *Druid*.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Security-specific monitoring rules and alerting are not fully configured for *Druid logs*. Regular *Druid log* review and analysis processes are not formally established. Log retention policy needs to be defined and implemented for *Druid logs*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Communication Channels (HTTPS for Druid Console and API)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_communication_channels__https_for_druid_console_and_api_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Communication Channels (HTTPS for Druid Console and API)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain SSL/TLS Certificates for Druid Interfaces:** Obtain valid SSL/TLS certificates for the domain or hostname used to access the *Druid console and API endpoints*.
    2.  **Configure HTTPS for Druid Console/API:** Configure the application server or reverse proxy serving the *Druid console and API* to use HTTPS. Specify the SSL/TLS certificate and private key for *Druid's web interfaces*.
    3.  **Enforce HTTPS Redirection for Druid:** Configure redirection to automatically redirect HTTP requests to the *Druid console and API* to HTTPS, ensuring encrypted connections to *Druid's web interfaces*.
    4.  **Enable HSTS for Druid Interfaces:** Enable HSTS for the *Druid console and API endpoints* to instruct browsers to always connect over HTTPS when accessing *Druid's web interfaces*.
    5.  **Disable HTTP Access to Druid (Optional):** If feasible, disable HTTP access entirely to the ports serving the *Druid console and API* to enforce HTTPS only communication for *Druid's web interfaces*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Using unencrypted HTTP connections to *Druid's console/API* exposes communication to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Unencrypted communication with *Druid's web interfaces* allows eavesdropping on sensitive data transmitted to and from the *Druid console and API*.
*   **Impact:** Significantly Reduces risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and data eavesdropping when interacting with *Druid's web interfaces*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTTPS is enabled for the main application, which might include proxying to *Druid*. However, explicit HTTPS enforcement for direct access to *Druid console and API endpoints* needs verification.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to explicitly configure and enforce HTTPS for direct access to *Druid console and API endpoints*. Verify HTTPS redirection is in place for *Druid interfaces*. Enable HSTS for *Druid endpoints*. Potentially disable HTTP access entirely to *Druid ports serving web interfaces*.
