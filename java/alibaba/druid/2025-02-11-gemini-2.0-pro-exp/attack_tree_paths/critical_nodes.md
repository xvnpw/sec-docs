### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1 CVE-2021-25646 (RCE via Unsafe Deserialization)

*   **Vulnerability Details:** This vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of Java objects within the `druid-web-console` component.  Specifically, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the Druid server, executes arbitrary code in the context of the Druid process.  This is a classic Java deserialization vulnerability, often triggered by libraries that don't properly validate the types or contents of objects being deserialized.  The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 0.20.1.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** An attacker identifies a publicly accessible Druid instance, potentially using search engines like Shodan or by scanning for open ports (typically 8888 for the coordinator, 8081 for the broker, etc.).
    2.  **Payload Crafting:** The attacker uses a tool like `ysoserial` (a common Java deserialization exploit tool) to generate a malicious serialized object.  This object contains a payload that, upon deserialization, will execute a command of the attacker's choice (e.g., downloading and executing a reverse shell, creating a new user account, exfiltrating data).
    3.  **Payload Delivery:** The attacker sends the crafted serialized object to the vulnerable endpoint within the `druid-web-console`.  This might involve a specially crafted HTTP request.
    4.  **Code Execution:** The Druid server deserializes the malicious object, triggering the execution of the attacker's payload.  The attacker now has remote code execution (RCE) on the Druid server.
    5.  **Post-Exploitation:** The attacker can now perform various actions, including:
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data stored in Druid.
        *   **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised Druid server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.
        *   **Persistence:**  Installing backdoors or malware to maintain access.
        *   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the Druid service.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Patching (Primary):**  Upgrade to Druid version 0.20.1 or later *immediately*. This is the most effective mitigation.
    *   **Disable Web Console (If Unused):** If the web console is not strictly required, disable it by setting `druid.web.console.enabled=false` in the Druid configuration. This eliminates the vulnerable component.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Restrict access to the Druid web console to trusted networks only.  Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to prevent external access.  Ideally, the web console should only be accessible from a management network.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While input validation can help in some deserialization cases, it's often difficult to reliably prevent all malicious payloads.  It should be considered a secondary defense, not a primary one.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be configured to detect and block known exploit patterns for Java deserialization vulnerabilities.  However, attackers can often bypass WAF rules, so this is not a foolproof solution.
    * **Monitoring:** Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for suspicious network traffic and potentially detect exploitation attempts.  Log all access to the web console and review logs regularly.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:**  Very High (Complete data breach possible)
    *   **Integrity:** Very High (Data modification and deletion possible)
    *   **Availability:** Very High (Service disruption or complete shutdown possible)

#### 4.2 Use of Default Credentials

*   **Vulnerability Details:**  Druid, like many applications, may ship with default credentials for administrative accounts or for accessing underlying databases or services (e.g., metadata storage).  If these credentials are not changed after installation, attackers can easily gain access to the system.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:**  An attacker identifies a Druid instance.
    2.  **Credential Guessing:** The attacker attempts to log in to the Druid web console or other interfaces using common default credentials (e.g., `admin/admin`, `druid/druid`, etc.).  They may also try default credentials for the metadata database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    3.  **Access Granted:** If default credentials are in use, the attacker gains access to the system.
    4.  **Post-Exploitation:**  The attacker can now perform actions based on the privileges of the compromised account, potentially including full administrative control.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Change Default Credentials (Mandatory):**  Immediately after installation, change *all* default credentials for Druid and any of its dependencies (metadata database, deep storage, etc.).  Use strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Password Policy Enforcement:**  Implement a strong password policy that requires complex passwords and regular password changes.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  If possible, enable MFA for all administrative accounts. This adds an extra layer of security even if credentials are compromised.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that user accounts have only the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid using the default administrative account for day-to-day operations.
    * **Auditing:** Regularly audit user accounts and their privileges.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Very High (Complete data breach possible)
    *   **Integrity:** Very High (Data modification and deletion possible)
    *   **Availability:** Very High (Service disruption or complete shutdown possible)

#### 4.3 Abuse of JavaScript Task Execution (leading to RCE)

*   **Vulnerability Details:**  Druid's JavaScript task execution feature allows users to define and execute tasks written in JavaScript.  If this feature is enabled and not properly secured, attackers can submit malicious JavaScript code that executes arbitrary commands on the Druid server.

*   **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** An attacker identifies a Druid instance and determines that JavaScript task execution is enabled.
    2.  **Access (Requires Prior Compromise or Misconfiguration):** The attacker needs to gain access to submit tasks. This could be through:
        *   **Compromised Credentials:**  Using stolen or default credentials (as discussed above).
        *   **Misconfigured Permissions:**  If task submission is not properly restricted to authorized users.
        *   **Exploiting Another Vulnerability:**  Using a different vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2021-25646) to gain the ability to submit tasks.
    3.  **Malicious Task Submission:** The attacker submits a Druid task containing malicious JavaScript code.  This code might:
        *   **Execute System Commands:**  Using Java's `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` or similar methods to execute arbitrary commands.
        *   **Access Files:**  Reading or writing files on the server.
        *   **Establish Network Connections:**  Creating network connections to external servers (e.g., for command and control).
    4.  **Code Execution:** The Druid server executes the malicious JavaScript code, granting the attacker RCE.
    5.  **Post-Exploitation:**  Similar to the other RCE scenarios, the attacker can now exfiltrate data, move laterally, or disrupt the service.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable JavaScript Task Execution (Recommended):**  The most effective mitigation is to disable the JavaScript task execution feature entirely by setting `druid.javascript.enabled=false` in the Druid configuration.  This eliminates the attack vector.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** If JavaScript task execution is absolutely required, restrict access to trusted users only.  Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Sandboxing (Complex):**  Implement a robust sandboxing environment for JavaScript execution to limit the capabilities of the code.  This is a complex undertaking and may not be fully effective.  Options include using a restricted Java Security Manager or a separate JavaScript engine with limited privileges.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize all JavaScript code submitted for execution.  This is difficult to do reliably, but can help prevent some attacks.  Look for patterns that indicate malicious intent (e.g., attempts to access system resources).
    *   **Code Review:**  Manually review all JavaScript tasks before they are deployed to production.
    * **Monitoring:** Monitor task submissions and executions for suspicious activity.  Log all JavaScript code that is executed.

*   **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Very High (Complete data breach possible)
    *   **Integrity:** Very High (Data modification and deletion possible)
    *   **Availability:** Very High (Service disruption or complete shutdown possible)
