## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Druid Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_druid_updated.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Keep Druid Updated**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Monitoring Process:** Set up automated alerts (e.g., using Dependabot, Renovate) to monitor the official Alibaba Druid GitHub repository (releases and issues) and security advisories.
    2.  **Regular Update Schedule:** Define a schedule for reviewing and applying updates (e.g., monthly, or immediately upon critical security patch release).
    3.  **Testing:** Before deploying to production, thoroughly test the updated Druid version in a staging environment.
    4.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a clear rollback plan.
    5.  **Documentation:** Document the update process.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Critical):** Vulnerabilities in Druid's SQL parser or filters.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):**  DoS vulnerabilities in Druid.
    *   **Information Disclosure (High):**  Vulnerabilities exposing information through Druid.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Critical):** If present in Druid.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **DoS:** Reduces likelihood.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reduces risk.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Eliminates risk if patched.

    3.  **Authorization:** Implement authorization for authorized users/roles.
    4.  **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict access to specific IP addresses/ranges.
    *This step is less directly about *Druid's* configuration and more about network configuration, but it's crucial if Druid's monitoring is exposed.*
    5. **Network Segmentation:** Consider a separate network segment.
