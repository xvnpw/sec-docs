# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/druid

## Threat: [JMX Configuration Manipulation](./threats/jmx_configuration_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** JMX Configuration Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker connects to Druid's JMX (Java Management Extensions) interface remotely (if enabled and not secured) and modifies Druid's configuration. They could change connection pool settings (e.g., `maxActive`, `minIdle`), disable security features (e.g., the SQL firewall), or alter logging configurations.  The most severe scenario involves exploiting a vulnerability in a JMX-exposed method to achieve remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (by exhausting the connection pool), information disclosure (by disabling security features or altering logging), or potentially even *code execution* (if a vulnerability exists in a JMX-exposed method).
    *   **Affected Component:** JMX interface and various Druid configuration parameters accessible via JMX.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible) or High (for DoS and information disclosure).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable remote JMX access if not absolutely necessary.
        *   If remote JMX is required, enforce strong authentication and authorization (username/password, certificate-based authentication).
        *   Use SSL/TLS to encrypt JMX communication.
        *   Configure JMX access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to specific users and operations.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via WallFilter Bypass](./threats/sql_injection_via_wallfilter_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via WallFilter Bypass

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query that bypasses Druid's SQL firewall (WallFilter). This could happen if the WallFilter is misconfigured (e.g., with overly permissive rules), disabled, or if the attacker finds a vulnerability in the WallFilter itself. The attacker then executes arbitrary SQL commands against the database. This threat directly involves a core Druid component designed for security.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (reading, modifying, or deleting data), database compromise, potentially even operating system compromise (depending on database privileges).
    *   **Affected Component:** `WallFilter` (SQL firewall component).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** *Always* use parameterized queries and proper input validation in the application code. *Never* rely solely on the WallFilter.
        *   Configure the `WallFilter` with a strict, whitelist-based policy. Only allow known-good SQL patterns.
        *   Regularly review and update the `WallFilter` configuration.
        *   Keep Druid up to date to receive security patches for the `WallFilter`.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the application.

## Threat: [Connection Pool Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/connection_pool_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Connection Pool Exhaustion (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker opens a large number of database connections through Druid, exceeding the configured maximum number of active connections (`maxActive`). This prevents legitimate users from accessing the database. This directly targets Druid's connection pooling mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) – legitimate users cannot access the database.
    *   **Affected Component:** Connection pool management (controlled by parameters like `maxActive`, `minIdle`, `maxWait`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `maxActive` to a reasonable value based on expected load and database server capacity.
        *   Set appropriate values for `minIdle`, `maxWait`, and other connection pool parameters.
        *   Implement connection pooling monitoring to detect and alert on potential exhaustion.
        *   Use a circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to StatViewServlet](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_statviewservlet.md)

* **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to StatViewServlet

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Druid StatViewServlet web interface. The attacker can then view sensitive information about the database connection pool, executed SQL queries, database schema details.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of database schema, query patterns, connection parameters, and potentially sensitive data exposed in queries. This can aid further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `StatViewServlet` (web UI component).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable `StatViewServlet` in production if not strictly required.
        *   If required, enforce strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Change the default URL path of `StatViewServlet`.
        *   Implement IP whitelisting.

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Leakage in Logs](./threats/sensitive_information_leakage_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Information Leakage in Logs

    *   **Description:** Druid logs database connection details (including usernames and potentially passwords) or raw SQL queries containing sensitive data due to misconfiguration.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure – sensitive data is exposed in log files, potentially accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   **Affected Component:** Druid's logging configuration and any components that interact with the logging system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if passwords are leaked).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Druid's logging to redact or mask sensitive information.
        *   Use a logging framework that supports data masking or redaction.
        *   Review error handling code to ensure sensitive information is not inadvertently logged.
        *   Implement strict access controls on log files.

## Threat: [Druid Configuration File Tampering](./threats/druid_configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Druid Configuration File Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the server's filesystem and modifies Druid's configuration files. They could change connection parameters, disable security features, or alter logging settings.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the modification. Could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Druid configuration files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file system permissions.
        *   Use file integrity monitoring.
        *   Store sensitive configuration values in a secure vault or secrets management system.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Druid Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_druid_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Druid Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or unknown vulnerability in Druid itself. This directly impacts the security of the Druid installation.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Could range from information disclosure to denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any Druid component, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Variable (High to Critical, depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Druid up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to Druid.
        *   Perform regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
