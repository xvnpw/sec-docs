# Deep Analysis: Restrict Access to Monitoring Endpoints (Druid)

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and completeness of the "Restrict Access to Monitoring Endpoints" mitigation strategy for a Druid deployment.  This includes identifying potential weaknesses, recommending improvements, and ensuring alignment with best practices for securing monitoring infrastructure.  The ultimate goal is to minimize the risk of information disclosure and unauthorized access to sensitive Druid monitoring data.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the mitigation strategy outlined, which includes:

*   Identifying all Druid monitoring endpoints.
*   Implementing strong authentication for these endpoints.
*   Implementing authorization controls for access.
*   Utilizing IP whitelisting to restrict network access.
*   Considering network segmentation for enhanced isolation.

The analysis will consider both Druid's internal configuration capabilities and external network-level controls.  It will *not* delve into the specifics of *what* is being monitored (e.g., specific metrics), but rather *how* access to the monitoring interfaces is controlled.  It also assumes the Druid cluster is already deployed and operational.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Endpoint Discovery:**  Systematically identify all exposed monitoring endpoints. This includes:
    *   Reviewing Druid documentation for default monitoring ports and paths.
    *   Examining Druid configuration files (`_common.runtime.properties`, `coordinator/runtime.properties`, `historical/runtime.properties`, etc.) for relevant settings.
    *   Using network scanning tools (e.g., `nmap`, `netstat`) on Druid nodes to identify open ports and services.
    *   Inspecting any existing reverse proxy or load balancer configurations that might expose monitoring endpoints.
    *   Checking for custom monitoring extensions or integrations.

2.  **Authentication Assessment:** Evaluate the current authentication mechanisms:
    *   Determine if authentication is enabled for each identified endpoint.
    *   Identify the type of authentication used (e.g., basic auth, Kerberos, custom extensions).
    *   Assess the strength of the authentication mechanism (e.g., password complexity requirements, key management practices).
    *   Verify that authentication is enforced consistently across all endpoints.

3.  **Authorization Assessment:** Evaluate the current authorization mechanisms:
    *   Determine if authorization is enabled and linked to authentication.
    *   Identify the authorization model used (e.g., role-based access control (RBAC), access control lists (ACLs)).
    *   Assess the granularity of authorization controls (e.g., can users be restricted to specific metrics or actions?).
    *   Verify that authorization rules are correctly implemented and enforced.

4.  **Network Access Control Assessment:** Evaluate network-level restrictions:
    *   Review firewall rules (e.g., `iptables`, cloud provider security groups) to verify IP whitelisting is correctly configured.
    *   Identify any network segmentation in place (e.g., VLANs, separate subnets).
    *   Assess the scope and effectiveness of existing IP whitelisting rules.
    *   Check for any unintended network exposure (e.g., misconfigured load balancers, exposed ports).

5.  **Gap Analysis:** Compare the current implementation against best practices and identify any gaps or weaknesses.

6.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Develop specific, actionable recommendations to address identified gaps and improve the overall security posture.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

**4.1 Endpoint Discovery (Detailed Breakdown)**

Druid exposes monitoring information through several channels:

*   **JMX:**  Druid services expose metrics via Java Management Extensions (JMX).  This is a standard Java technology for monitoring and management.  The default JMX port is often not explicitly defined in Druid's configuration, relying on dynamic port allocation.  This makes it crucial to use network scanning to identify the actual port in use.  Look for properties like `druid.monitoring.jmx.port` (although this might not be the *only* way JMX is configured).
*   **HTTP Endpoints (System Schema):** Druid provides a set of HTTP endpoints under the `/druid/v2/` and `/status` paths that expose system information and metrics.  Examples include:
    *   `/status/health`:  Checks the overall health of the service.
    *   `/status/properties`:  Displays runtime properties.
    *   `/druid/v2/datasources`: Lists available datasources.
    *   `/druid/coordinator/v1/metadata/datasources`: Provides detailed metadata about datasources.
    *   `/druid/indexer/v1/tasks`: Lists running and completed tasks.
    *   `/druid/v2/sql` : SQL endpoint.
*   **Custom Monitoring:**  Druid allows for custom monitoring extensions.  These might expose additional endpoints or use different protocols.  Review the Druid configuration and any deployed extensions to identify these.
* **Overlord and Coordinator UI:** Druid overlord and coordinator have web UIs that expose a lot of information.

**4.2 Authentication Assessment (Detailed Breakdown)**

*   **JMX:**  JMX authentication typically relies on Java's built-in security mechanisms.  This often involves configuring a `jmxremote.password` file and a `jmxremote.access` file to define users, passwords, and access levels.  It's crucial to ensure these files are properly secured (restricted file permissions) and that strong passwords are used.  Kerberos can also be used for stronger authentication.  Druid's documentation should be consulted for specific configuration instructions.
*   **HTTP Endpoints:**  Druid supports various authentication mechanisms for its HTTP endpoints, including:
    *   **Basic Authentication:**  A simple username/password scheme.  This is generally considered weak unless used in conjunction with TLS (HTTPS).
    *   **Kerberos:**  A strong authentication protocol that provides mutual authentication.  This is the recommended approach for production deployments.
    *   **Custom Authenticators:**  Druid allows for custom authentication extensions.  The security of these extensions depends on their implementation.
    *   **Druid-specific extensions:** Extensions like `druid-basic-security` provide more robust authentication and authorization.
*   **Missing Implementation (as stated):** The provided information indicates that authentication is "inconsistent." This is a major red flag.  All monitoring endpoints *must* have consistent, strong authentication enabled.  The lack of strong authentication is a critical vulnerability.

**4.3 Authorization Assessment (Detailed Breakdown)**

*   **JMX:**  JMX authorization is typically handled through the `jmxremote.access` file, which defines access levels (e.g., `readonly`, `readwrite`) for specific users.
*   **HTTP Endpoints:**  Druid's authorization capabilities depend on the chosen authentication mechanism and any extensions used.  The `druid-basic-security` extension, for example, provides role-based access control (RBAC).  Without such an extension, authorization might be limited or non-existent.
*   **Missing Implementation (as stated):**  The lack of "strong authentication/authorization" implies that even if authorization is present, it's likely not granular or robust enough.  RBAC, with well-defined roles and permissions, is essential.

**4.4 Network Access Control Assessment (Detailed Breakdown)**

*   **IP Whitelisting:**  This is a crucial layer of defense.  Firewall rules should be configured to allow access to Druid's monitoring ports *only* from trusted IP addresses or ranges.  This should include:
    *   Monitoring tools and dashboards.
    *   Administrator workstations.
    *   Other systems that require access to Druid metrics.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Ideally, Druid nodes should be placed in a separate network segment (e.g., a VLAN or a dedicated subnet) from other applications and services.  This limits the impact of a potential breach.  Monitoring tools that need access to Druid should be placed in a separate, trusted segment.
*   **Partially Implemented (as stated):**  The existing IP whitelisting is "not comprehensive." This means there are likely gaps in the firewall rules, potentially exposing monitoring endpoints to unauthorized access.  The lack of application to *all* endpoints is a significant concern.

**4.5 Gap Analysis**

Based on the above analysis and the "Currently Implemented" and "Missing Implementation" sections, the following gaps are apparent:

1.  **Inconsistent Authentication:**  Authentication is not consistently enforced across all monitoring endpoints.
2.  **Weak Authentication:**  The existing authentication mechanisms are likely not strong enough (e.g., relying on basic authentication without TLS, weak passwords).
3.  **Lack of Robust Authorization:**  Authorization controls are either missing or insufficient, potentially allowing unauthorized users to access sensitive monitoring data.
4.  **Incomplete IP Whitelisting:**  IP whitelisting is not applied to all monitoring endpoints, leaving some exposed.
5.  **Potential Lack of Network Segmentation:**  The description doesn't explicitly state whether network segmentation is used, but it's a recommended best practice.
6. **Unsecured Overlord and Coordinator UI:** Default Druid installation does not protect Overlord and Coordinator UI.

**4.6 Recommendations**

1.  **Enforce Strong Authentication:**
    *   Implement Kerberos authentication for all Druid monitoring endpoints (JMX and HTTP).  This provides strong, mutual authentication.
    *   If Kerberos is not feasible, use TLS (HTTPS) with strong, unique passwords for basic authentication.  *Never* use basic authentication without TLS.
    *   Ensure consistent authentication across *all* endpoints.

2.  **Implement Robust Authorization (RBAC):**
    *   Use the `druid-basic-security` extension or a similar mechanism to implement role-based access control.
    *   Define specific roles (e.g., "Druid Monitor Read-Only," "Druid Administrator") with granular permissions.
    *   Assign users to appropriate roles based on their responsibilities.

3.  **Comprehensive IP Whitelisting:**
    *   Review and update firewall rules to ensure that *all* Druid monitoring ports are only accessible from authorized IP addresses/ranges.
    *   Regularly audit and update the whitelist as needed.

4.  **Network Segmentation:**
    *   Place Druid nodes in a dedicated network segment, isolated from other applications and services.
    *   Place monitoring tools in a separate, trusted segment.

5.  **Secure JMX:**
    *   If using JMX, ensure that the `jmxremote.password` and `jmxremote.access` files are properly secured with restricted file permissions.
    *   Use strong, unique passwords for JMX users.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Druid deployment, including the monitoring infrastructure.
    *   Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses.

7.  **Harden Druid Configuration:**
    *   Review all Druid configuration files and disable any unnecessary features or services.
    *   Follow Druid's security best practices documentation.

8. **Secure Overlord and Coordinator UI:**
    * Implement authentication and authorization for Overlord and Coordinator UI.

9. **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:**
    * If certain status or monitoring endpoints are not strictly required, disable them to reduce the attack surface.

By implementing these recommendations, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of information disclosure and unauthorized access to Druid's monitoring data, enhancing the overall security posture of the Druid deployment.
