# Deep Analysis: Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data (Druid)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and completeness of the "Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data" mitigation strategy within the context of our application's interaction with Apache Druid.  We aim to identify any potential gaps, weaknesses, or areas for improvement in our implementation of this crucial security control.  This includes verifying not only Druid's configuration but also the application's code and data flow.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis encompasses the following:

*   **Druid Configuration:**  Review of all relevant Druid configuration files (e.g., `common.runtime.properties`, `coordinator/runtime.properties`, `historical/runtime.properties`, `broker/runtime.properties`, `middleManager/runtime.properties`, and any custom extensions) to identify settings related to data ingestion, query processing, and extension loading that *could* involve deserialization.
*   **Application Code:** Examination of the application code that interacts with Druid, focusing on:
    *   Data ingestion pathways (e.g., Kafka ingestion, batch ingestion from files, custom ingestion tasks).
    *   Query construction and execution (how queries are built and sent to Druid).
    *   Handling of Druid's responses.
    *   Use of any custom Druid extensions or modules.
*   **Data Flow:**  Tracing the flow of data from external sources into Druid, through the application, and back, to identify any points where untrusted data might be introduced and potentially deserialized.
*   **Third-Party Libraries:**  Identifying any third-party libraries used by the application or Druid that might perform deserialization operations.
* **Druid Extensions:** Review of any custom or third-party Druid extensions for potential deserialization vulnerabilities.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methods:

*   **Static Code Analysis:**  Using automated tools (e.g., SonarQube, FindSecBugs, Semgrep) and manual code review to identify potential deserialization vulnerabilities in the application code.  We will specifically look for:
    *   Use of Java's built-in serialization/deserialization mechanisms (`ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`).
    *   Use of libraries known to be vulnerable to deserialization attacks (e.g., older versions of Jackson, XStream, etc.).
    *   Custom deserialization logic.
*   **Configuration Review:**  Manual inspection of Druid configuration files, focusing on settings that control data ingestion, query processing, and extension loading.  We will look for:
    *   `druid.extensions.loadList`:  Examine the list of loaded extensions for any potentially vulnerable ones.
    *   `druid.ingestion.tasks.*`:  Review ingestion task configurations for any custom deserialization logic.
    *   Settings related to specific ingestion methods (e.g., Kafka, Hadoop).
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Limited):**  While full dynamic analysis with a fuzzer is outside the immediate scope, we will perform targeted testing of specific input vectors that are known to trigger deserialization vulnerabilities in common libraries. This will be done in a controlled, isolated environment.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Using tools like `dependency-check` (OWASP) or `snyk` to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by both the application and Druid.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Reviewing Druid's official documentation and security advisories to understand known deserialization vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

**2.1 Review Configuration (Druid):**

*   **`druid.extensions.loadList`:**  This is a *critical* configuration point.  We must meticulously examine each extension listed here.  For each extension:
    *   **Source:**  Is it a core Druid extension, a community-maintained extension, or a custom-built extension?
    *   **Vulnerability History:**  Research any known vulnerabilities associated with the extension, particularly those related to deserialization.
    *   **Code Review (if custom):**  If it's a custom extension, perform a thorough code review, focusing on deserialization logic.
    *   **Justification:**  Document the *reason* for using each extension.  If an extension is not strictly necessary, remove it.
*   **Ingestion Specifications:**  Examine all ingestion specifications (e.g., Kafka ingestion specs, Hadoop ingestion specs).  Look for:
    *   **`inputFormat`:**  If a custom `inputFormat` is used, review its code for deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **`parser`:**  Similarly, if a custom `parser` is used, review its code.
    *   **`transforms` and `transformSpec`:**  These can contain custom code (e.g., JavaScript transformations).  Ensure that any such code does not perform unsafe deserialization.
*   **Query Context Parameters:**  Review the documentation for all query context parameters.  Some parameters might influence how Druid processes data internally, potentially involving deserialization.  Ensure that we are not using any parameters in a way that could introduce untrusted data.
* **Security Configuration:** Review `druid.auth.*` and related configurations. While not directly related to deserialization, a misconfigured authentication/authorization system could allow an attacker to submit malicious queries or ingestion specs that exploit deserialization vulnerabilities.

**2.2 Disable Deserialization Features (Druid & Application):**

*   **Druid:**  Druid itself doesn't have a global "disable deserialization" switch.  The key is to avoid configurations and extensions that *rely* on deserialization of untrusted data.  The configuration review (2.1) is the primary mechanism for achieving this.
*   **Application:**
    *   **Avoid `ObjectInputStream`:**  The application code should *never* use Java's built-in `ObjectInputStream` to deserialize data received from external sources (including Druid).  This is a classic source of deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Libraries:**  If deserialization is absolutely necessary (e.g., for internal communication between application components), use a safe deserialization library with appropriate security controls:
        *   **JSON with a Whitelist:**  If using JSON, use a library like Jackson with a strict whitelist of allowed classes (using `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` appropriately).  *Never* enable default typing globally.
        *   **Protocol Buffers:**  Protocol Buffers are generally a safer alternative to Java serialization.
        *   **Other Safe Serializers:**  Consider other serialization formats like Avro or Thrift, which are designed with security in mind.
    *   **Data Validation:**  Even with safe libraries, *always* validate the deserialized data *after* deserialization.  Check for unexpected values, data types, and object structures.

**2.3 Input Validation (Application):**

*   **Before Sending to Druid:**
    *   **Query Validation:**  If the application constructs Druid queries dynamically based on user input, implement strict validation and sanitization of that input.  Use a query builder library (if available) to prevent injection attacks.  Avoid string concatenation for building queries.
    *   **Ingestion Spec Validation:**  If the application generates ingestion specifications dynamically, validate all fields to ensure they conform to expected types and values.  Pay particular attention to any fields that might contain custom code (e.g., JavaScript transformations).
*   **After Receiving from Druid:**
    *   **Response Validation:**  Even though Druid's responses are typically JSON, validate the structure and content of the responses to ensure they conform to expectations.  This can help detect unexpected behavior or potential attacks that might have bypassed other security controls.

**2.4 Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Critical):**  This is the primary threat.  By avoiding deserialization of untrusted data, we eliminate the risk of arbitrary code execution through deserialization exploits.  This includes vulnerabilities in:
    *   Java's built-in serialization.
    *   Vulnerable third-party libraries.
    *   Custom deserialization logic.

**2.5 Impact:**

*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  If implemented correctly, this mitigation strategy *eliminates* the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities stemming from untrusted data.
*   **Performance:**  Avoiding deserialization can sometimes improve performance, as deserialization can be a relatively expensive operation.
*   **Complexity:**  This strategy might increase the complexity of the application code, as it requires careful handling of data serialization and deserialization.  However, this complexity is a necessary trade-off for security.

**2.6 Currently Implemented:**

*   "Implemented. Configuration reviewed, no untrusted deserialization."  This statement needs to be *substantiated* by the detailed findings of sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.  We need to provide *evidence* that the configuration review was thorough and that no untrusted deserialization is occurring.  This should include:
    *   A list of all reviewed configuration files and their relevant settings.
    *   A summary of the code review findings, highlighting any areas related to deserialization.
    *   Confirmation that no `ObjectInputStream` is used with untrusted data.
    *   Details on the safe deserialization libraries used (if any).
    *   Examples of input validation checks.

**2.7 Missing Implementation:**

*   "None."  This statement should only be made *after* the thorough analysis described above.  Based on the analysis, we might identify missing implementations, such as:
    *   Missing input validation checks.
    *   Use of a vulnerable third-party library.
    *   A Druid extension with a known deserialization vulnerability.
    *   Lack of documentation for the justification of used extensions.
    *   Lack of automated security testing for deserialization vulnerabilities.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on the deep analysis, the following recommendations should be considered:

1.  **Document Findings:**  Thoroughly document all findings from the configuration review, code review, and dependency analysis.  This documentation should be kept up-to-date.
2.  **Remediate Gaps:**  Address any identified gaps or weaknesses in the implementation of the mitigation strategy.
3.  **Automated Testing:**  Implement automated security testing to detect deserialization vulnerabilities.  This could include:
    *   Static analysis tools integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Dependency vulnerability scanning.
    *   (Ideally) Dynamic analysis with a fuzzer, targeting known vulnerable libraries and input vectors.
4.  **Regular Reviews:**  Conduct regular security reviews of the Druid configuration and application code, particularly after any changes to the codebase or dependencies.
5.  **Stay Informed:**  Keep up-to-date with the latest security advisories for Druid and any third-party libraries used by the application.
6. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that Druid processes are running with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage from a successful deserialization attack.
7. **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Druid cluster from untrusted networks. This reduces the attack surface and makes it more difficult for attackers to reach the Druid services.

## 4. Conclusion

The "Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data" mitigation strategy is a *critical* security control for any application using Apache Druid.  A thorough and ongoing implementation of this strategy, combined with other security best practices, is essential for protecting against potentially devastating deserialization vulnerabilities. The "Currently Implemented" and "Missing Implementation" sections *must* be backed by concrete evidence and a detailed analysis, not just assertions. The recommendations should be prioritized and implemented to ensure the ongoing security of the application.
