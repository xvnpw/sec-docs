# Attack Surface Analysis for alibaba/druid

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection through Druid's SQL Parsing](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_druid's_sql_parsing.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into queries processed by Druid, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even command execution on the database.

**How Druid Contributes:** Druid's core functionality involves parsing and executing SQL queries. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize user inputs before incorporating them into SQL queries handled by Druid, it becomes vulnerable. Methods like `SQLUtils.format()` used for dynamic query construction without care are prime examples.

**Example:** An application allows users to filter data based on a name. The application constructs the SQL query like: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '` + userInput + `'`. If `userInput` is `' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '' OR 1=1 --'`, bypassing the intended filter and potentially returning all user data.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution on the database server depending on database permissions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization.
*   Adopt an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Druid Stat View Servlet](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_druid_stat_view_servlet.md)

**Description:** Druid provides a built-in servlet for monitoring and management (`/druid/index.html`). If this servlet is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, attackers can gain insights into the application's database structure, query execution patterns, and potentially sensitive configuration details.

**How Druid Contributes:** Druid inherently provides this servlet for operational purposes. The lack of proper security configuration on the application side exposes this interface.

**Example:** An application deploys Druid and the `/druid/index.html` endpoint is accessible without any login. An attacker can navigate to this URL and view details about the data sources, executed queries, and potentially infer sensitive information about the application's data model.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further targeted attacks based on the exposed information, potential for denial of service by manipulating Druid settings (if allowed).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Druid Stat View Servlet.
*   Restrict access to the Stat View Servlet to authorized personnel only.
*   Disable the Stat View Servlet if it's not required in the production environment.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Database Credentials in Druid Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_druid_configuration.md)

**Description:** Database credentials required for Druid to connect to data sources might be stored insecurely, making them accessible to attackers.

**How Druid Contributes:** Druid requires configuration to connect to databases. The way this configuration is handled by the application developers introduces the risk.

**Example:** Database credentials are stored in plain text within a configuration file that is accessible to unauthorized users or is committed to a public repository. An attacker gaining access to the application's codebase or server can easily retrieve these credentials.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the underlying database, leading to data breach, data manipulation, and potential denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never store database credentials in plain text.
*   Implement proper access controls for configuration files.
*   Avoid committing sensitive configuration files to version control systems.

## Attack Surface: [JMX Exposure without Proper Authentication (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/jmx_exposure_without_proper_authentication__if_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If JMX (Java Management Extensions) is enabled for Druid, and the JMX interface is not properly secured, attackers can potentially access sensitive information, modify Druid's configuration, or even execute arbitrary code on the server.

**How Druid Contributes:** Druid, being a Java application, can expose management information and control through JMX. The security of this interface is dependent on the application's configuration.

**Example:** JMX is enabled with default or weak credentials. An attacker can connect to the JMX port and access MBeans related to Druid, potentially revealing configuration details or allowing them to invoke management operations.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, configuration manipulation, potential for remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the JMX interface.
*   Restrict access to the JMX port.
*   Disable JMX if it's not required.
