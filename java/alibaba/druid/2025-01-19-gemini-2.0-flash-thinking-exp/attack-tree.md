## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities via Druid [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_via_druid__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities where the application constructs SQL queries using unsanitized user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Critical Node:** Inject Malicious SQL through Unsanitized Inputs
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker crafts malicious SQL within data they provide to the application.
        *   **Critical Node:** Application directly uses user input in SQL queries managed by Druid
            *   **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious SQL within user-provided data that is passed to Druid for query execution.
            *   **Druid Involvement:** Druid executes the crafted SQL against the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Druid's Monitoring and Management Features [CRITICAL NODE - Access to Dashboard]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_druid's_monitoring_and_management_features__critical_node_-_access_to_dashboard_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Gaining unauthorized access to Druid's monitoring dashboard and leveraging its features for malicious purposes, including information disclosure.
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Access Unsecured Druid Monitoring Dashboard (OR) [CRITICAL NODE - Access to Dashboard]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the monitoring dashboard due to weak or default credentials or a lack of authentication.
        *   **Critical Node:** Default or Weak Credentials
            *   **Description:** Druid's monitoring dashboard is accessible with default or easily guessable credentials.
            *   **Druid Involvement:** Druid exposes a web interface for monitoring.
        *   **Critical Node:** Lack of Authentication or Authorization
            *   **Description:** The Druid monitoring dashboard is accessible without any authentication or authorization checks.
            *   **Druid Involvement:** Druid's configuration allows for unauthenticated access to the monitoring interface.
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Information Disclosure via Monitoring Dashboard [CRITICAL NODE - Information Leak]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Once access to the dashboard is gained, the attacker extracts sensitive information exposed through the monitoring interface.
        *   **Critical Node:** Information Disclosure via Monitoring Dashboard
            *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the monitoring dashboard and extracts sensitive information such as database connection strings, usernames, or query patterns.
            *   **Druid Involvement:** Druid exposes this information through its monitoring interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in Druid [CRITICAL NODE - Configuration Access]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_in_druid__critical_node_-_configuration_access_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Manipulating Druid's configuration to alter its behavior or gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Inject Malicious Configuration (OR)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious configuration values through environment variables or configuration files.
        *   **Critical Node:** Environment Variable Manipulation
            *   **Description:** If Druid reads configuration from environment variables, an attacker might be able to manipulate these variables to alter Druid's behavior.
            *   **Druid Involvement:** Druid relies on environment variables for configuration.
        *   **Critical Node:** Configuration File Manipulation
            *   **Description:** If Druid reads configuration from files, an attacker gaining access to the server could modify these files.
            *   **Druid Involvement:** Druid reads configuration from specific files.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Druid's Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE - Dependency Vulnerability]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_druid's_dependencies__critical_node_-_dependency_vulnerabilit_55ad84cc.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Druid depends on.
    *   **Critical Node:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Druid's Dependencies
        *   **Description:** Druid relies on other libraries, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the application.
        *   **Druid Involvement:** Druid indirectly introduces the vulnerability through its dependencies.
