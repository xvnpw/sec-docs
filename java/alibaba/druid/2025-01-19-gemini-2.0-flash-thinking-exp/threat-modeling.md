# Threat Model Analysis for alibaba/druid

## Threat: [Connection Pool Exhaustion leading to Denial of Service](./threats/connection_pool_exhaustion_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally or unintentionally cause the application to acquire and hold onto database connections without releasing them. This could be achieved by exploiting application logic flaws in how connections are managed *within the context of using the Druid pool*, leading to the pool becoming depleted.
*   **Impact:** The Druid connection pool becomes fully utilized, preventing legitimate requests from obtaining database connections, leading to application downtime and inability to process database operations.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** Connection Pool Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust error handling and resource management in the application code to ensure connections are always closed in `finally` blocks or using try-with-resources.
    *   Configure appropriate connection pool settings in Druid, such as `maxActive`, `minIdle`, and `timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis`, to limit the maximum number of connections and reclaim idle connections.
    *   Implement connection timeout mechanisms in the application to prevent connections from being held indefinitely.
    *   Monitor connection pool metrics to detect and respond to potential exhaustion issues.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials through Druid Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_through_druid_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to the Druid configuration file (e.g., `druid.properties`, YAML configuration) which might contain sensitive database credentials (username, password, JDBC URL). This directly involves how Druid is configured and how it stores or references these credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, and unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** Configuration Loading and Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Druid configuration files with appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to only necessary users and processes.
    *   Avoid storing plain-text database credentials directly in Druid configuration files. Consider using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration that Druid can access.
    *   Implement proper access control mechanisms for accessing and managing Druid configuration files.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Druid's Monitoring Features (StatView)](./threats/information_disclosure_through_druid's_monitoring_features__statview_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could directly access Druid's built-in monitoring features, such as the StatView servlet, if it's enabled and not properly secured. This is a direct risk introduced by the Druid library's functionality.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive database information, including schema details, query patterns, and potentially sensitive data values. This information can be used to further attack the application or the database.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** StatView Servlet
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable the StatView servlet in production environments if it's not strictly necessary.
    *   If the StatView servlet is required, secure it with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms directly at the application or web server level, preventing unauthorized access to the Druid endpoint.
    *   Ensure that the endpoint for the StatView servlet is not publicly accessible.

## Threat: [Bypassing SQL Injection Prevention Mechanisms in Druid](./threats/bypassing_sql_injection_prevention_mechanisms_in_druid.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might find ways to craft malicious SQL queries that bypass Druid's built-in SQL injection prevention mechanisms (like `StatFilter`). This is a vulnerability within Druid's own security features.
*   **Impact:** Successful execution of arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or even remote code execution on the database server.
*   **Affected Druid Component:** `StatFilter` (SQL monitoring and analysis)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Do not rely solely on Druid's SQL injection prevention mechanisms. Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, regardless of Druid's filters.
    *   Keep Druid updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements to the `StatFilter`.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of defense against SQL injection attacks.
