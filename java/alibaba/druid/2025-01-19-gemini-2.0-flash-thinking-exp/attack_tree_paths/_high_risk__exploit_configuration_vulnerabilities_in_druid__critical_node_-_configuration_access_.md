### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### [HIGH RISK] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in Druid [CRITICAL NODE - Configuration Access]

**Description:** This high-risk objective highlights the inherent danger of insecure configuration management in Druid. Gaining control over Druid's configuration allows an attacker to fundamentally alter its behavior, potentially leading to severe security breaches. The "Configuration Access" critical node signifies that the attacker's primary goal is to gain the ability to modify or influence Druid's configuration.

**Potential Impacts:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Modifying configuration to redirect data streams to attacker-controlled locations.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Altering user roles or permissions within Druid to gain administrative access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Injecting configurations that cause resource exhaustion or system instability.
*   **Code Execution:**  In some cases, configuration settings might indirectly lead to code execution vulnerabilities if they control paths or parameters used in sensitive operations.
*   **Circumvention of Security Controls:** Disabling authentication, authorization, or logging mechanisms.

**Moving to Sub-Paths:** The attacker can achieve this objective through various means, as indicated by the "OR" gate, meaning any of the following sub-paths can lead to successful exploitation.

#### Inject Malicious Configuration

**Description:** This attack vector focuses on the methods an attacker can use to introduce harmful configuration settings into the Druid environment. This could involve directly modifying configuration files or manipulating the environment in which Druid operates.

**Potential Impacts:**  The impacts are similar to the high-level objective, as successfully injecting malicious configuration directly leads to the ability to control Druid's behavior.

##### Critical Node: Environment Variable Manipulation

**Description:**  Druid, like many applications, can read configuration values from environment variables. This allows for flexible deployment and configuration management. However, if the environment where Druid runs is not properly secured, an attacker might be able to manipulate these variables.

**Druid Involvement:** Druid utilizes environment variables for various configuration settings. Examples include:

*   **Database Connection Details:**  Credentials for connecting to metadata stores or external systems.
*   **Network Bindings:**  Ports and interfaces Druid listens on.
*   **Security Settings:**  While less common for direct security settings, environment variables could influence the loading of security extensions or configurations.
*   **Java Options:**  Settings passed to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running Druid, which could potentially be exploited for malicious purposes.

**Attack Scenarios:**

*   An attacker gaining access to the server or container running Druid could modify environment variables directly.
*   In containerized environments (like Docker or Kubernetes), misconfigurations in the container orchestration system could allow unauthorized modification of environment variables.
*   Supply chain attacks could involve injecting malicious environment variable settings during the deployment process.

**Impacts Specific to Environment Variable Manipulation:**

*   **Credential Theft:**  Manipulating environment variables to expose database credentials or API keys.
*   **Network Hijacking:**  Changing network bindings to intercept traffic or redirect connections.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Setting JVM options to consume excessive resources.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Environment:**  Restrict access to the environment where Druid runs, including the server and container orchestration platform. Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary permissions to users and processes interacting with the Druid environment.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Prefer immutable infrastructure where environment variables are set during deployment and are not easily modifiable at runtime.
*   **Secret Management:**  Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables. Utilize dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and inject secrets securely.
*   **Regular Auditing:**  Monitor and audit changes to environment variables in the Druid environment.
*   **Configuration as Code:**  Manage environment variable configurations through version control systems to track changes and facilitate rollback.

##### Critical Node: Configuration File Manipulation

**Description:** Druid relies on configuration files (typically `.properties` or `.yaml` files) to define its behavior. If an attacker gains access to the file system where these files are stored, they can directly modify them to inject malicious settings.

**Druid Involvement:** Druid reads configuration from various files, including but not limited to:

*   **`common.runtime.properties`:**  Core runtime settings for all Druid processes.
*   **`broker/runtime.properties`:**  Configuration specific to the Broker process.
*   **`coordinator/runtime.properties`:** Configuration specific to the Coordinator process.
*   **`historical/runtime.properties`:** Configuration specific to the Historical process.
*   **Security Extension Configurations:** Files defining authentication and authorization rules.

**Attack Scenarios:**

*   An attacker gaining unauthorized access to the server hosting Druid could directly edit configuration files.
*   Vulnerabilities in the operating system or other applications on the same server could be exploited to gain access to Druid's configuration files.
*   Misconfigured access controls on the file system could allow unauthorized modification.

**Impacts Specific to Configuration File Manipulation:**

*   **Complete System Takeover:** Modifying core runtime properties to execute arbitrary code or disable security features.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Altering configurations related to data ingestion, processing, or storage.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Disabling or weakening authentication mechanisms.
*   **Authorization Bypass:**  Granting unauthorized access to data or administrative functions.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong File System Permissions:**  Implement strict access controls on Druid's configuration files, ensuring only authorized users and processes have read and write access.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary file system permissions to the Druid process user.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM solutions to detect unauthorized modifications to configuration files. Alert on any changes and potentially revert to known good configurations.
*   **Secure Deployment Practices:**  Ensure configuration files are deployed securely and are not accessible through public web servers or insecure network shares.
*   **Configuration Management Tools:**  Utilize configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage and deploy configuration files consistently and securely.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Periodically review file system permissions and access logs related to Druid's configuration files.
*   **Consider Read-Only File Systems:**  Where feasible, consider mounting configuration directories as read-only after initial setup to prevent runtime modifications.

### 5. Conclusion

The analysis of this attack path highlights the critical importance of securing Druid's configuration. Both environment variable and configuration file manipulation represent significant threats that could lead to severe security breaches. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks and strengthen the overall security posture of the application. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and adherence to security best practices are crucial for maintaining a secure Druid deployment.
