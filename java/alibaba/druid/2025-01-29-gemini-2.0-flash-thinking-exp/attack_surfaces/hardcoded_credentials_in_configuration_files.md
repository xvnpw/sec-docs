### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files

#### 4.1 Detailed Description

The attack surface "Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files" arises from the insecure practice of embedding sensitive authentication credentials directly within application configuration files. In the context of Druid, this typically involves storing database usernames and passwords required for Druid to connect to its metadata store (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), deep storage (e.g., S3, HDFS), or external data sources within files like `druid.properties` or other configuration files used by Druid extensions.

These configuration files are often stored on the file system of the servers running Druid processes (e.g., Broker, Coordinator, Historical, Overlord). If an attacker gains unauthorized access to these servers or the file system, they can potentially read these configuration files and extract the hardcoded credentials.

The core vulnerability lies in the **lack of separation between configuration data and sensitive secrets**.  Configuration files are designed to be readable by the application and often by system administrators for management purposes.  Embedding secrets directly within them violates the principle of least privilege and significantly increases the risk of exposure.

#### 4.2 Vulnerability Analysis

**4.2.1 Access Control Weaknesses:**

*   **Default File Permissions:**  Default file system permissions on configuration files might be overly permissive, allowing read access to users or groups beyond those strictly necessary for Druid to function.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  If an attacker compromises a less privileged account on the server (e.g., through a web application vulnerability), they might be able to escalate privileges or move laterally to access configuration files readable by the Druid process user.
*   **Misconfigurations:**  Accidental misconfigurations in file permissions or access control lists (ACLs) can inadvertently expose configuration files to unauthorized users or processes.

**4.2.2 Attack Vectors Leading to Configuration File Access:**

*   **Web Application Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in web applications running on the same server or network as Druid (e.g., LFI, RFI, SSRF) can be exploited to read arbitrary files, including Druid configuration files.
*   **Operating System Vulnerabilities:**  Exploits targeting vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system can grant attackers shell access to the server, allowing them to browse the file system and access configuration files.
*   **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent insiders with access to the server file system can intentionally or unintentionally expose configuration files.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised dependencies or tools used in the deployment process could be used to inject malicious code that exfiltrates configuration files.
*   **Physical Access:**  In certain scenarios, physical access to the server could allow an attacker to directly access the file system and configuration files.
*   **Backup and Log Exposure:**  Configuration files might be inadvertently included in backups or logs that are stored insecurely, leading to credential exposure.

**4.2.3 Druid-Specific Considerations:**

*   **Configuration Flexibility:** Druid's flexible configuration system, while powerful, can sometimes lead to developers choosing the simplest (but less secure) option of directly embedding credentials in properties files.
*   **Extension Configurations:**  Druid extensions might have their own configuration files, potentially increasing the number of locations where credentials could be hardcoded.
*   **Metadata Store Credentials:**  Compromising the metadata store credentials is particularly critical as it can grant an attacker significant control over the Druid cluster and its data.

#### 4.3 Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Web Application Vulnerability Exploitation**

1.  A web application running on the same server as a Druid Broker has a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
2.  An attacker exploits the LFI vulnerability to read the `druid.properties` file located at a known path on the server.
3.  The `druid.properties` file contains hardcoded database credentials for the Druid metadata store.
4.  The attacker extracts the database username and password from the file.
5.  Using these credentials, the attacker connects directly to the metadata database, bypassing Druid's security mechanisms.
6.  The attacker gains full access to the metadata database, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Read sensitive metadata about Druid data sources and segments.
    *   Modify metadata to disrupt Druid operations or inject malicious data.
    *   Potentially gain further access to deep storage based on metadata information.

**Scenario 2: Insider Threat**

1.  A disgruntled employee with system administrator access to the Druid servers decides to exfiltrate sensitive data.
2.  The employee accesses the Druid servers and reads the `druid.properties` file.
3.  The employee finds hardcoded credentials for the deep storage system (e.g., AWS S3 access keys).
4.  The employee uses these credentials to directly access the deep storage and download sensitive data stored by Druid.

**Scenario 3: Supply Chain Compromise**

1.  A dependency used in the Druid deployment process is compromised by an attacker.
2.  The compromised dependency is used to build and deploy the Druid application.
3.  During the deployment process, the malicious dependency injects code that reads Druid configuration files and exfiltrates them to an attacker-controlled server.
4.  The attacker analyzes the exfiltrated configuration files and extracts hardcoded credentials.
5.  The attacker uses these credentials to gain unauthorized access to Druid's backend systems.

#### 4.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of successfully exploiting hardcoded credentials in Druid configuration files is **Critical**, as indicated in the initial attack surface description.  The potential consequences are severe and can include:

*   **Full Database Compromise:**  Access to database credentials grants an attacker complete control over the underlying database system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Read all data stored in the database, leading to a **Data Breach** and potential violation of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
    *   Modify or delete data, causing **Data Integrity Issues** and **Service Disruption**.
    *   Create new users or escalate privileges, establishing **Persistent Unauthorized Access**.
*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data stored in the database or deep storage can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  Attackers can use compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to Druid clusters, data sources, and backend systems, potentially leading to further malicious activities.
*   **Service Disruption:**  Attackers can disrupt Druid operations by modifying metadata, deleting data, or overloading backend systems with malicious queries.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised credentials can be used as a stepping stone to gain access to other systems and resources within the organization's network.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Storing credentials in plain text in configuration files is a direct violation of many security compliance standards and regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, SOC 2).

#### 4.5 Risk Severity: Critical

The risk severity is classified as **Critical** due to the high likelihood of exploitation (given common attack vectors and potential misconfigurations) and the catastrophic impact of successful exploitation (full database compromise, data breach, and significant operational disruption).  The ease of exploitation, combined with the severity of the consequences, makes this attack surface a top priority for mitigation.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk associated with hardcoded credentials in Druid configuration files, the following strategies are recommended:

**5.1 Externalize Configuration: Secrets Management Best Practices**

*   **Environment Variables:**  Utilize environment variables to inject sensitive credentials into Druid processes at runtime. This prevents credentials from being stored directly in configuration files on disk. Druid supports referencing environment variables in configuration files using `${ENV_VAR_NAME}` syntax.
    *   **Example:** Instead of `druid.metadata.storage.connector.password=hardcoded_password` in `druid.properties`, use `druid.metadata.storage.connector.password=${DRUID_METADATA_PASSWORD}` and set the `DRUID_METADATA_PASSWORD` environment variable when starting Druid processes.
*   **System Properties:**  Similar to environment variables, system properties can be used to pass credentials. Druid supports referencing system properties using `${property.name}` syntax.
    *   **Example:**  Use `-Ddruid.metadata.storage.connector.password=$DRUID_METADATA_PASSWORD` when starting the Druid process.
*   **Dedicated Secrets Management Systems:**  Integrate Druid with dedicated secrets management systems like:
    *   **HashiCorp Vault:** Vault provides a centralized platform for storing, accessing, and distributing secrets. Druid can be configured to retrieve credentials from Vault at runtime.
    *   **AWS Secrets Manager:**  For deployments on AWS, Secrets Manager offers a secure way to manage secrets. Druid applications running on AWS can be configured to retrieve secrets from Secrets Manager using IAM roles.
    *   **Azure Key Vault:**  For deployments on Azure, Key Vault provides similar functionality to AWS Secrets Manager.
    *   **CyberArk, Thycotic, etc.:**  Other enterprise-grade secrets management solutions can also be integrated.
    *   **Benefits of Secrets Management Systems:**
        *   **Centralized Secret Storage:**  Secrets are stored in a secure, dedicated vault, not scattered across configuration files.
        *   **Access Control and Auditing:**  Fine-grained access control policies and audit logs ensure only authorized applications and users can access secrets.
        *   **Secret Rotation:**  Secrets management systems facilitate automated secret rotation, reducing the risk of long-term credential compromise.
        *   **Dynamic Secret Generation:**  Some systems can generate dynamic, short-lived credentials, further enhancing security.

**5.2 Restrict File System Permissions: Principle of Least Privilege**

*   **Minimize File Permissions:**  Implement the principle of least privilege by restricting file system permissions on Druid configuration files to only the necessary users and processes.
    *   **Owner and Group Permissions:**  Ensure that configuration files are owned by the user running the Druid process and that group permissions are restricted to the necessary group.
    *   **Read-Only Permissions:**  Ideally, configuration files should be read-only for the Druid process user after initial setup.
    *   **Remove World-Readable Permissions:**  Eliminate any world-readable permissions on configuration files.
*   **Secure File System:**  Ensure the underlying file system is securely configured and hardened according to security best practices.
*   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically audit file system permissions to ensure they remain appropriately restricted and that no unintended changes have been made.

**5.3 Secure Deployment Practices:**

*   **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Consider using immutable infrastructure principles where configuration files are baked into immutable images and not modified in place on running servers. This reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to modify configuration files.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Use secure configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate the deployment and configuration of Druid, ensuring consistent and secure configurations.
*   **Regular Security Scanning:**  Implement regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses in the Druid deployment environment, including file system security and access controls.

**5.4 Monitoring and Alerting:**

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Implement FIM tools to monitor Druid configuration files for unauthorized changes. Alerts should be triggered if any modifications are detected.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Integrate Druid logs and security events with a SIEM system to detect and respond to suspicious activity, including attempts to access configuration files or use compromised credentials.

**5.5 Developer Training and Awareness:**

*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers and operations teams about the risks of hardcoded credentials and secure configuration practices.
*   **Code Review and Security Checks:**  Incorporate code reviews and automated security checks into the development lifecycle to identify and prevent the introduction of hardcoded credentials.

**Conclusion:**

Storing hardcoded credentials in Druid configuration files presents a critical security risk that must be addressed proactively. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, particularly externalizing configuration using secrets management systems and enforcing strict file system permissions, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this vulnerability, ensuring a more secure Druid deployment. Prioritizing these mitigations is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity and availability of Druid-powered applications.
