# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for alibaba/druid

## Mitigation Strategy: [Druid Configuration Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/druid_configuration_hardening.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Druid Configuration:** Examine your Druid configuration file (e.g., `druid.properties`, `application.yml`) and identify all configurable settings.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Druid Features:**  Disable Druid features not essential for your application's core functionality.  Examples include:
        *   `StatFilter` and `ResetStatFilter` if not actively used for production monitoring.
        *   Potentially less used SQL parser extensions if your application uses a limited SQL subset.
    3.  **Restrict Druid Monitoring Access:** Secure access to Druid's monitoring pages (e.g., `/druid/index.html`) by implementing strong authentication and authorization. Limit access to authorized administrators/developers. Configure web server or application server to protect these endpoints.
    4.  **Carefully Configure `stat` and `reset-stat` Interceptors:** If `StatFilter` and `ResetStatFilter` are enabled, ensure they are configured with strict access controls. Consider disabling them in production if not actively needed.
    5.  **Limit SQL Parser Capabilities (If Possible):** Explore Druid's configuration options to restrict the SQL parser's capabilities if your application uses a limited subset of SQL features. This reduces the risk from complex SQL syntax vulnerabilities.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Low Severity, Cumulative Impact):** Disabling features reduces potential entry points.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Restricting monitoring access prevents unauthorized viewing of sensitive database/application info.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Low Severity):** Limiting exposed information indirectly reduces potential for escalation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Low Risk Reduction - Each disabled feature contributes to a smaller attack surface.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces risk of unauthorized monitoring data access.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Low Risk Reduction - Indirectly reduces escalation risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** `ResetStatFilter` is disabled in production (`druid.properties`). HTTP Basic Authentication is on `/druid/*` endpoints in production (Nginx).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:** `StatFilter` is still enabled in all environments. SQL parser capabilities are not restricted. Role-based authorization for Druid monitoring is missing (currently only basic auth).

## Mitigation Strategy: [SQL Firewall (Wall Filter) Configuration and Customization](./mitigation_strategies/sql_firewall__wall_filter__configuration_and_customization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Druid Wall Filter:** Ensure `WallFilter` is enabled in Druid configuration (e.g., in `filters` section).
    2.  **Review Default Wall Filter Rules:** Understand the default rules of `WallFilter` and what SQL syntax/operations are blocked.
    3.  **Customize Wall Filter Rules:** Tailor `WallFilter` to your application's SQL usage:
        *   **Add Custom Rules:** Block specific SQL keywords, functions, or patterns not needed by your application.
        *   **Modify Existing Rules:** Adjust severity/behavior of default rules if needed.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed SQL:** Whitelist legitimate SQL syntax used by your application that might be flagged by default rules.
    4.  **Test Wall Filter Effectiveness:** Test to ensure it blocks malicious SQL but allows legitimate application queries.
    5.  **Regularly Update Wall Filter Rules:** Review and update rules as application evolves and new SQL injection techniques emerge.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Medium to High Severity):** Provides a secondary defense layer against SQL injection by blocking malicious SQL queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - `WallFilter` can block many SQL injection attempts, especially when customized. Impact depends on rule comprehensiveness and attack sophistication.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Druid `WallFilter` is enabled in global configuration (`druid.properties`) for all environments with default rules.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:** Customization of `WallFilter` rules is missing. Default rules are used without application-specific tailoring. Consider reviewing and customizing rules for enhanced protection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Druid Version Management and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/druid_version_management_and_patching.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track Druid Releases:** Monitor official Druid project website, GitHub, or mailing lists for new releases and security announcements.
    2.  **Review Release Notes:** Review release notes for security fixes, vulnerability patches, and security changes.
    3.  **Plan Upgrades:** Plan regular upgrades to the latest stable Druid version as part of application maintenance.
    4.  **Test Upgrades Thoroughly:** Test upgrades in staging/testing before production to ensure compatibility and identify issues.
    5.  **Automate Dependency Updates (If Possible):** Use dependency management tools to streamline Druid and dependency updates.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces risk of exploiting patched vulnerabilities in older Druid versions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction - Staying up-to-date is crucial for mitigating known vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Location:** Druid version managed via Maven (currently `1.2.8`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Location:** No formal process for regularly checking for new Druid releases and planning upgrades. Dependency updates are reactive. Implement a process for regular Druid release reviews and proactive upgrade planning.
