### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Read Sensitive Configuration Data (Database Credentials, etc.)

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Analyzing Exposed Configuration Files

**Detailed Breakdown:**

The core attack vector revolves around gaining unauthorized access to configuration files that contain sensitive information. In the context of Druid and typical application deployments, configuration files can be exposed through various means:

*   **Misconfigured Web Servers/Application Servers:**
    *   **Directory Listing Enabled:** Web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or application servers (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) hosting Druid components might be misconfigured to allow directory listing. This could inadvertently expose configuration directories to unauthorized access via web browsers.
    *   **Incorrect File Permissions:**  Configuration files might be placed in web-accessible directories with overly permissive file permissions, allowing anyone with web access to read them directly.
    *   **Publicly Accessible Version Control Systems (.git, .svn):** If configuration files are accidentally committed to publicly accessible version control repositories (e.g., exposed `.git` or `.svn` directories on a web server), attackers can download these repositories and extract the files.
    *   **Backup Files Left in Web-Accessible Directories:**  Backup copies of configuration files (e.g., `config.bak`, `config.old`) might be unintentionally left in web-accessible directories after updates or maintenance.
*   **Insecure Deployment Practices:**
    *   **Default Configurations:** Using default configurations without proper hardening often leaves sensitive information exposed or easily guessable.
    *   **Configuration Files Stored in Publicly Accessible Locations:**  Storing configuration files in locations accessible to the public internet or untrusted networks increases the risk of exposure.
    *   **Lack of Access Control on File Systems:**  Insufficient access control on the file system where Druid components are deployed can allow unauthorized users or processes to read configuration files directly from the server.
    *   **Log Files with Sensitive Data:** While not strictly configuration files, log files might inadvertently contain sensitive configuration data, including database connection strings or API keys, if logging is not properly configured and sanitized.
*   **Exploitation of Application Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in the Druid application or related components could allow attackers to read arbitrary files from the server, including configuration files.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerabilities:**  In some scenarios, SSRF vulnerabilities could be exploited to access configuration files located on internal servers or within the application's file system.

**Druid Specific Considerations:**

*   Druid components (Broker, Coordinator, Historical, Overlord, MiddleManager) rely on configuration files for various settings, including database connection details for metadata storage, data storage locations, and security configurations.
*   Configuration files for Druid are typically located in specific directories within the Druid installation or deployment directory. Understanding the default and recommended locations is crucial for securing them.
*   Druid extensions and plugins might also have their own configuration files, which need to be considered in the security assessment.

#### 4.2. Threat: Obtaining Database Credentials and Database Compromise

**Detailed Threat Assessment:**

The threat associated with reading sensitive configuration data, particularly database credentials, is **severe and critical**.  Successful exploitation of this attack path can lead to:

*   **Direct Database Compromise:** Database credentials (usernames, passwords, connection strings) provide a direct pathway to access the underlying databases used by Druid. This includes:
    *   **Metadata Database:** Druid relies on a metadata database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store cluster metadata, segment information, and other critical operational data. Compromising this database can lead to:
        *   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive metadata, potentially including user information, system configurations, and operational details.
        *   **Data Manipulation:**  Modification of metadata can disrupt Druid operations, lead to data corruption, or enable further attacks.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Deleting or corrupting metadata can render the Druid cluster unusable.
    *   **Data Storage Databases (if applicable):**  Depending on the Druid deployment and data ingestion methods, database credentials might also provide access to databases where Druid stores or stages data before ingestion. This could lead to:
        *   **Data Breach:** Exposure of raw or pre-processed data intended for Druid ingestion.
        *   **Data Manipulation:**  Tampering with data before it is ingested into Druid.
*   **Broader System Compromise:** Database access can often be leveraged to escalate privileges and compromise other systems within the network. Attackers might use compromised database servers as pivot points to access other internal resources.
*   **Data Breaches and Data Exfiltration:** Access to databases allows attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data stored within, leading to regulatory compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), financial losses, and reputational damage.
*   **Data Manipulation and Integrity Issues:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the databases, leading to inaccurate analytics, corrupted dashboards, and unreliable decision-making based on Druid data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Beyond metadata database DoS, attackers could overload or disrupt the databases, impacting Druid's performance and availability.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A data breach or security incident resulting from compromised database credentials can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to protect sensitive data, including database credentials, can lead to significant fines and penalties under various data privacy regulations.

**Severity Justification (HIGH-RISK & CRITICAL NODE):**

This attack path is classified as **HIGH-RISK** and a **CRITICAL NODE** because:

*   **Direct Path to Critical Assets:**  Database credentials are keys to highly sensitive and critical assets – the databases themselves.
*   **High Impact Potential:**  Database compromise has a wide range of severe consequences, including data breaches, data manipulation, and DoS.
*   **Relatively Easy to Exploit (in case of misconfiguration):**  Exposed configuration files are often easily accessible if basic security measures are not in place.
*   **Cascading Effects:**  Database compromise can be a stepping stone to further attacks and broader system compromise.

#### 4.3. Actionable Insight: Secure Configuration File Storage (Critical)

**Expanded Actionable Insights and Implementation Strategies:**

**Actionable Insight 1: Secure Configuration File Storage (Critical)**

**Detailed Recommendations:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **File System Permissions:** Implement strict file system permissions on configuration files and directories. Ensure that only the Druid processes and authorized administrators have read access.  Restrict write access to only necessary processes and administrators.
    *   **Web Server/Application Server Configuration:**  Configure web servers and application servers to explicitly deny access to configuration directories and files. Use directives like `deny from all` in Apache or location blocks in Nginx to restrict access.
*   **Secure Deployment Practices:**
    *   **Non-Web-Accessible Locations:** Store configuration files outside of the web server's document root and any publicly accessible directories. Ideally, place them in a dedicated configuration directory with restricted access.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:** Utilize secure configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate the deployment and management of configurations, ensuring consistent security settings across environments.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Druid deployment and infrastructure to identify and remediate any misconfigurations that could lead to configuration file exposure.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Employ IaC principles to define and manage infrastructure and configurations in a version-controlled and auditable manner, promoting consistency and security.
*   **Disable Directory Listing:**  Ensure that directory listing is disabled on all web servers and application servers hosting Druid components. This prevents attackers from browsing directories and discovering configuration files.
*   **Remove Unnecessary Files:**  Remove any unnecessary files from web-accessible directories, including backup files, temporary files, and development artifacts that might contain sensitive information.
*   **Input Validation and Output Encoding (Defense in Depth):** While primarily for application vulnerabilities, implementing robust input validation and output encoding can help prevent LFI and SSRF vulnerabilities that could be exploited to access configuration files.

**Prioritization:** **CRITICAL**. Secure configuration file storage is the **most fundamental and critical defense** against this attack path. Implementing these measures should be the **highest priority**.

#### 4.4. Actionable Insight: Credential Management

**Expanded Actionable Insights and Implementation Strategies:**

**Actionable Insight 2: Credential Management**

**Detailed Recommendations:**

*   **Avoid Storing Credentials in Plain Text:**  Never store database credentials or other sensitive secrets directly in plain text within configuration files. This is the most vulnerable practice.
*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   Store credentials as environment variables. Druid and many applications can be configured to read credentials from environment variables. This separates credentials from the configuration files themselves and reduces the risk of accidental exposure through file access.
    *   Ensure environment variables are securely managed and not exposed through other means (e.g., process listing, insecure logging).
*   **Secrets Management Systems (Recommended):**
    *   Utilize dedicated secrets management systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager. These systems provide secure storage, access control, rotation, and auditing of secrets.
    *   Druid applications can be configured to retrieve credentials dynamically from these systems at runtime, eliminating the need to store them directly in configuration files or environment variables on the application server itself.
*   **Configuration Encryption (Less Ideal, but better than plain text):**
    *   Encrypt sensitive sections of configuration files. While better than plain text, this approach still requires managing encryption keys securely. Key management can become complex and if keys are compromised, the encryption is ineffective.
    *   Consider using tools and libraries specifically designed for configuration encryption.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Secrets:**  Implement RBAC within secrets management systems to control which applications and users can access specific credentials.
*   **Credential Rotation:**  Regularly rotate database credentials and other sensitive secrets to limit the window of opportunity if credentials are compromised.
*   **Auditing and Monitoring:**  Implement auditing and monitoring of access to secrets management systems and configuration files to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

**Druid Specific Credential Management Considerations:**

*   **Druid Configuration Options:**  Review Druid documentation for specific configuration options related to credential management. Druid might support mechanisms for retrieving credentials from environment variables or external systems.
*   **JDBC Connection Strings:**  Pay close attention to JDBC connection strings used for connecting to the metadata database and any other databases Druid interacts with. Ensure that passwords are not embedded directly in the connection string in plain text. Utilize environment variables or secrets management for these credentials.
*   **Extension Configurations:**  If using Druid extensions, review their configuration requirements and ensure that any credentials they require are managed securely.

**Prioritization:** **HIGH**.  Effective credential management is crucial for mitigating the impact of configuration file exposure. Implementing secrets management systems is highly recommended for production environments. Environment variables are a good intermediate step if secrets management is not immediately feasible. Plain text credentials should be **completely avoided**.
