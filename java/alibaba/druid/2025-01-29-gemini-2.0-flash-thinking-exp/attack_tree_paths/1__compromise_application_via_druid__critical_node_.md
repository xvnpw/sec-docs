### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Application via Druid

**4.1. Deconstructing the Attack Vector: Compromise Application via Druid**

The high-level "Attack Vector: Compromise Application via Druid" encompasses a range of potential attack vectors. We need to break this down into more specific and actionable attack paths.  Considering Druid's architecture and functionalities, potential attack vectors include:

* **4.1.1. Exploiting Druid SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Druid supports a SQL-like query language. If the application constructs Druid SQL queries based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or parameterization, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code into input fields that are used to build Druid queries. This injected code could be designed to:
        * **Extract sensitive data:**  Bypass intended data access controls and retrieve data the attacker is not authorized to see.
        * **Modify data:**  Alter or delete data within Druid, potentially corrupting application data or causing denial of service.
        * **Execute arbitrary Druid functions:**  Leverage Druid SQL functions to perform actions beyond intended data retrieval, potentially leading to further exploitation.
    * **Example Scenario:** An application allows users to filter data based on a user-provided string. If this string is directly incorporated into a Druid SQL `WHERE` clause without proper escaping, an attacker could inject SQL to bypass the filter or execute other malicious queries.
    * **Relevance to Druid:** Druid's SQL capabilities, while powerful, introduce the risk of SQL injection if not handled securely in the application layer.

* **4.1.2. Exploiting Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Druid Components:**
    * **Description:** Druid, being a Java-based application, might utilize deserialization for various functionalities (e.g., communication between components, handling serialized data). Deserialization vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is deserialized, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Mechanism:** An attacker could provide maliciously crafted serialized data to Druid. If Druid deserializes this data without proper validation, it could trigger the execution of arbitrary code on the Druid server.
    * **Example Scenario:**  If Druid uses Java serialization for inter-component communication and a vulnerable library is used for deserialization, an attacker could send a malicious serialized object to a Druid endpoint, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    * **Relevance to Druid:** Java deserialization vulnerabilities are a common class of vulnerabilities in Java applications.  Druid's internal architecture and dependencies need to be assessed for potential deserialization risks.

* **4.1.3. Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Druid Access Control:**
    * **Description:** Druid implements access control mechanisms to protect data and functionalities. Vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in these mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass authentication or authorization checks.
    * **Mechanism:**
        * **Authentication Bypass:** Exploiting flaws in the authentication process to gain access without valid credentials (e.g., default credentials, weak authentication schemes, vulnerabilities in authentication logic).
        * **Authorization Bypass:** Circumventing authorization checks to access resources or perform actions that the attacker is not permitted to (e.g., flaws in role-based access control, privilege escalation vulnerabilities).
    * **Example Scenario:**  If Druid is deployed with default administrative credentials that are not changed, an attacker could use these credentials to gain full administrative access. Or, if there's a vulnerability in Druid's authorization logic, an attacker might be able to manipulate requests to bypass access controls and access sensitive data or administrative functions.
    * **Relevance to Druid:** Secure configuration and robust implementation of Druid's authentication and authorization features are crucial to prevent unauthorized access.

* **4.1.4. Exploiting Druid Extension Points and Plugins:**
    * **Description:** Druid allows for extensions and plugins to extend its functionality. If these extensions are not properly vetted or secured, they could introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Mechanism:**
        * **Vulnerable Extensions:**  Using or installing third-party Druid extensions that contain security vulnerabilities.
        * **Malicious Extensions:**  Installing intentionally malicious extensions designed to compromise the Druid instance.
        * **Exploiting Extension APIs:**  Finding vulnerabilities in the APIs exposed by extensions that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
    * **Example Scenario:**  An application uses a third-party Druid extension for data enrichment. If this extension has a vulnerability, an attacker could exploit it to compromise the Druid instance.
    * **Relevance to Druid:**  Careful selection and security assessment of Druid extensions are necessary to avoid introducing vulnerabilities through these components.

* **4.1.5. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Druid:**
    * **Description:**  Attackers could attempt to disrupt the availability of the application by launching Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against the Druid instance.
    * **Mechanism:**
        * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Overwhelming Druid with excessive requests, consuming resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and causing performance degradation or crashes.
        * **Exploiting Processing Inefficiencies:**  Crafting specific queries or requests that exploit inefficiencies in Druid's processing logic, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
        * **Vulnerability-based DoS:**  Exploiting specific vulnerabilities in Druid that can be triggered to cause crashes or service disruptions.
    * **Example Scenario:**  An attacker could send a large volume of complex Druid SQL queries designed to consume excessive CPU and memory, causing Druid to become unresponsive and impacting the application's availability.
    * **Relevance to Druid:**  Druid, like any data processing system, is susceptible to DoS attacks.  Proper resource management, rate limiting, and security hardening are needed to mitigate DoS risks.

**4.2. Threat: Successful Compromise and its Impacts**

A successful compromise of the application via Druid can have severe consequences:

* **4.2.1. Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss:**
    * **Impact:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in Druid, including personal information, financial data, business secrets, and other confidential information.
    * **Consequences:**  Reputational damage, legal liabilities (data breach regulations), financial losses, loss of customer trust.

* **4.2.2. Data Manipulation and Integrity Loss:**
    * **Impact:** Attackers could modify or delete data within Druid, leading to data corruption, inaccurate application behavior, and potentially financial losses or operational disruptions.
    * **Consequences:**  Loss of data integrity, unreliable application functionality, incorrect business decisions based on manipulated data.

* **4.2.3. Denial of Service and Availability Loss:**
    * **Impact:** Attackers could render the application unavailable by disrupting the Druid service, preventing users from accessing the application and its functionalities.
    * **Consequences:**  Business disruption, loss of revenue, damage to reputation, inability to serve users.

* **4.2.4. Complete Control over Application and Underlying Systems (Potential):**
    * **Impact:** In severe cases, exploiting vulnerabilities in Druid could allow attackers to gain control not only over the Druid instance but also potentially the underlying systems where Druid is running. This could lead to further attacks on the application's infrastructure, lateral movement within the network, and complete system compromise.
    * **Consequences:**  Full system compromise, exfiltration of sensitive data, installation of malware, long-term persistence within the system.
