### High and Critical Joda-Time Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical security threats that directly involve the Joda-Time library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Date/Time String Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted date/time string to a Joda-Time parsing function (e.g., `DateTime.parse()`, `LocalDate.parse()`). This could cause the parsing logic to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to a denial-of-service (DoS). Alternatively, it might trigger unexpected exceptions that disrupt application functionality or reveal error details.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, information disclosure through error messages.
    *   **Affected Joda-Time Component:** Parsing functions within the `org.joda.time.format` package (e.g., `DateTimeFormatter`, `ISODateTimeFormat`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation using regular expressions or predefined formats before passing data to Joda-Time parsing functions.
        *   Set timeouts for parsing operations to prevent excessive resource consumption.
        *   Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions during parsing and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

*   **Threat:** Time Zone Data Corruption/Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially influence the time zone data used by Joda-Time (TZDB). This could involve replacing the TZDB files with malicious versions or exploiting vulnerabilities in how Joda-Time loads or uses this data. This could lead to incorrect date/time calculations, especially for time-sensitive operations.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect application logic, security vulnerabilities in time-based access control or scheduling, financial miscalculations.
    *   **Affected Joda-Time Component:** Time zone handling classes within the `org.joda.time.tz` package (e.g., `DateTimeZone`, `ZoneInfoProvider`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the application uses a trusted and up-to-date source for time zone data.
        *   Implement integrity checks on the time zone data files.
        *   Restrict access to the time zone data files to prevent unauthorized modification.
