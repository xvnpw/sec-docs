# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Threat: [Malicious Animation File Injection](./threats/malicious_animation_file_injection.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Animation File Injection

* **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted Lottie JSON file that, when rendered by the application, exploits vulnerabilities in the `lottie-android` library or the underlying rendering engine. This could be done by tricking a user into loading a malicious file or by compromising a server hosting animation files. The attacker aims to leverage flaws in how Lottie parses or renders the animation data.

* **Impact:**
    * Denial of Service (DoS): The application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to excessive resource consumption or unexpected behavior triggered by the malicious animation.
    * Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE): A critical vulnerability in the library or the rendering pipeline could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the user's device.

* **Affected Component:**
    * `LottieCompositionFactory` (for loading and parsing the JSON)
    * `LottieAnimationView` (for rendering the animation)
    * Underlying rendering engine (e.g., Android's Canvas API)
    * `JsonReader` (for parsing the JSON structure)

* **Risk Severity:** High (potential for significant DoS), Critical (potential for RCE)

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Source Validation:** Only load animation files from trusted and verified sources. Avoid loading animations from user-provided URLs or untrusted third-party sources without thorough vetting.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Animations (if applicable):** If animations are fetched from a web server, implement a CSP to restrict the sources from which animation files can be loaded.
    * **Resource Limits:** Implement safeguards to limit the resources consumed by animation rendering, such as timeouts or limits on the number of layers or shapes.
    * **Regularly Update Lottie Library:** Keep the `lottie-android` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Threat: [Lottie Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/lottie_library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Threat:**  Lottie Library Vulnerability Exploitation

* **Description:** An attacker leverages a known or zero-day vulnerability within the `lottie-android` library itself. This could be triggered by a specific animation structure, a particular API call within the Lottie library, or a flaw in the library's internal code logic. The attacker directly targets weaknesses in the `lottie-android` codebase.

* **Impact:**
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE): A critical vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device.
    * Denial of Service (DoS): A vulnerability could be triggered, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

* **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the `lottie-android` library depending on the specific vulnerability. This could include:
    * Parsing logic within `LottieCompositionFactory` and related classes.
    * Rendering logic within `LottieAnimationView` and its internal components.
    * Network handling within Lottie (if the vulnerability is related to remote asset loading).

* **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE), High (for DoS)

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regularly Update Lottie Library:** This is the most crucial mitigation. Staying up-to-date ensures you have the latest security patches.
    * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Keep track of security advisories and vulnerability reports specifically related to the `lottie-android` library.
    * **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools to scan the application code and identify potential vulnerabilities related to Lottie usage.
