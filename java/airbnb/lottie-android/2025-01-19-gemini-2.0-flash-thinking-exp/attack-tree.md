## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Code Execution via Malicious Animation Data -> Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities -> Overflow Buffer during JSON Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_code_execution_via_malicious_animation_data_-_exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_overflow_buf_4d4d744f.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON animation file with excessively long or deeply nested structures designed to overflow buffers in Lottie's JSON parsing logic.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Successful buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution on the device running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Code Execution via Malicious Animation Data -> Exploit Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities -> Cause Denial of Service (DoS) -> Create infinitely looping animations](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_code_execution_via_malicious_animation_data_-_exploit_rendering_engine_vulnerabilities_-_cau_027ed50d.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a seemingly normal animation file that contains logic causing the Lottie rendering engine to enter an infinite loop.
    *   **Potential Impact:** This can freeze the application, making it unresponsive and potentially leading to crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Lottie-Android -> Leverage Publicly Disclosed CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_lottie-android_-_leverage_publicly_disclosed_cves.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies the specific version of Lottie used by the application and exploits publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) for which exploits may already exist.
    *   **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Lottie-Android -> Compromise Distribution Channels -> Perform dependency confusion attack](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_lottie-android_-_compromise_distribution_channels_-_perform_dependenc_53e367a6.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a malicious library with the same name as Lottie-Android and a higher version number in a public repository. If the application's build system is not configured correctly, it might download the malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
    *   **Potential Impact:** This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misuse or Misconfiguration of Lottie-Android by the Application -> Load Untrusted Animation Data -> Inject malicious animation data from external, untrusted sources](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misuse_or_misconfiguration_of_lottie-android_by_the_application_-_load_untrusted_animation_d_4379954d.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker controls an external source from which the application loads animation data and serves a malicious animation file.
    *   **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the malicious data, potentially leading to code execution, DoS, or other malicious behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misuse or Misconfiguration of Lottie-Android by the Application -> Load Untrusted Animation Data -> Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misuse_or_misconfiguration_of_lottie-android_by_the_application_-_load_untrusted_animation_d_1d222e67.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application loads animation data without properly validating its contents, allowing malicious code or instructions embedded within the data to be processed by Lottie.
    *   **Potential Impact:** This can lead to various exploits, including code execution, DoS, or unexpected application behavior.
