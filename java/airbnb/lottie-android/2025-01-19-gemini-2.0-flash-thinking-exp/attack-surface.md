# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JSON Animation Data](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_json_animation_data.md)

*   **Description:** The Lottie library parses JSON data to render animations. A specially crafted JSON file can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
    *   **How Lottie-Android Contributes:** Lottie-Android's core functionality relies on parsing and interpreting JSON animation data. If this parsing is flawed, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A JSON file with extremely deep nesting or excessively large numerical values could cause a stack overflow or integer overflow during parsing.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) through application crashes or unresponsiveness due to excessive resource consumption. Potentially unexpected behavior or even, in rare cases, remote code execution if vulnerabilities in the underlying JSON parsing libraries are severe.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If the animation data source is untrusted (e.g., user-provided URLs), implement server-side validation and sanitization of the JSON data before it reaches the Lottie library.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Animations:** If loading animations from web sources, implement CSP to restrict the sources from which animations can be loaded.
        *   **Regularly Update Lottie Library:** Keep the Lottie library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address known parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Implement timeouts or resource limits on the parsing process to prevent excessive resource consumption.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Assets within Animations](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_assets_within_animations.md)

*   **Description:** Lottie animations can reference external image assets. If these assets are loaded from untrusted sources or are maliciously crafted, they can exploit vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries.
    *   **How Lottie-Android Contributes:** Lottie-Android handles the loading and rendering of these image assets as part of the animation process.
    *   **Example:** An animation referencing a specially crafted PNG or JPEG file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Android's image decoding libraries.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) through application crashes. Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the underlying image decoding vulnerability allows it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Asset Loading:** Only load image assets from trusted sources. Avoid loading assets from user-provided URLs without thorough validation.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Assets:** If loading assets from web sources, implement CSP to restrict the sources from which images can be loaded.
        *   **Regularly Update Lottie Library and Dependencies:** Ensure the Lottie library and the underlying Android system libraries are up-to-date to patch known image decoding vulnerabilities.
        *   **Image Validation:** Implement checks to validate the integrity and format of image assets before they are loaded by Lottie.
