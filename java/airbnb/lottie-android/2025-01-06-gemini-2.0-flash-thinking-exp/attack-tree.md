## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application Using Lottie-Android
* **Exploit Malicious Animation Data** (Critical Node)
    * ***Achieve Code Execution via Malicious Animation*** (High-Risk Path)
        * **Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities** (Critical Node)
            * Craft JSON with malicious payloads to trigger buffer overflows or other parsing errors leading to code execution.
        * ***Exploit Rendering Vulnerabilities*** (High-Risk Path)
            * Craft animation with specific features or property values that trigger vulnerabilities in the rendering engine, leading to code execution.
* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie-Android Library** (Critical Node)
    * ***Utilize Known Vulnerabilities*** (High-Risk Path if application is outdated)
        * Exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of the Lottie-Android library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Code Execution via Malicious Animation](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_code_execution_via_malicious_animation.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary code within the application's context by crafting a malicious animation. This is a high-impact scenario.

    *   **1.1.1. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   The attacker crafts a specially designed JSON animation file containing payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in Lottie-Android's JSON parsing logic.
            *   This could involve:
                *   Creating excessively long strings to trigger buffer overflows.
                *   Using malformed JSON structures that cause the parser to behave unexpectedly.
                *   Injecting escape sequences or control characters that are mishandled by the parser.
            *   Successful exploitation can overwrite memory and redirect program execution to attacker-controlled code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:**
            *   The attacker crafts an animation that utilizes specific features or property values in a way that exposes bugs within Lottie-Android's rendering engine.
            *   This could involve:
                *   Using specific combinations of animation properties that trigger unexpected behavior.
                *   Providing extreme or invalid values for certain properties.
                *   Exploiting race conditions or memory management issues within the rendering process.
            *   Successful exploitation can lead to code execution by corrupting memory or hijacking control flow during the rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:**
            *   The attacker identifies publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific version of Lottie-Android used by the application.
            *   Resources like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or Lottie-Android's issue tracker can be used to find these vulnerabilities.
            *   Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available or can be developed relatively easily.
            *   The attacker then crafts an attack that leverages these known weaknesses. This could involve sending a specific malicious animation or triggering a vulnerable code path in the library through other means.
            *   The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Remote Animation Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_remote_animation_server.md)

**Attack Vector:**
            *   The attacker targets the server hosting the animation files used by the application.
            *   This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the server software, using stolen credentials, or leveraging misconfigurations.
            *   Once the server is compromised, the attacker can replace legitimate animation files with malicious ones.
            *   When the application fetches these malicious animations, it unknowingly loads and processes the attacker's payload, potentially leading to code execution or other forms of compromise.
