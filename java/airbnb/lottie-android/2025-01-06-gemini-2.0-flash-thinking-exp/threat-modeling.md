# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Threat: [Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**
* An attacker crafts a malformed Lottie animation file that exploits a vulnerability in the `lottie-android` library's parsing logic.
* When the application attempts to load this malformed file using `lottie-android`, the parser encounters an error that can be exploited.

**Impact:**
* The application might crash or exhibit unexpected behavior due to the parsing error within the `lottie-android` library.
* In more severe cases, a carefully crafted malformed file could potentially lead to remote code execution *within the context of the application*, by exploiting vulnerabilities in the `lottie-android` parsing logic.

**Affected Component:**
* `lottie-android`'s Parser Module (the part of the library responsible for interpreting the JSON or other animation file formats).

**Risk Severity:** High (if potential for crashes and unexpected behavior), Critical (if remote code execution is possible)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `lottie-android` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the parsing module.
* Implement robust error handling around animation loading and parsing within your application to gracefully handle malformed files processed by `lottie-android`.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Complex Animations](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_animations.md)

**Description:**
* An attacker provides or substitutes a Lottie animation file with excessive complexity (e.g., a very large number of layers, intricate vector paths, or high frame rates).
* The `lottie-android` library's rendering engine attempts to process and render this complex animation.

**Impact:**
* The `lottie-android` rendering process consumes excessive device resources (CPU, memory), leading to application slowdowns, freezes, or even crashes (Denial of Service) directly caused by the library's resource consumption.

**Affected Component:**
* `lottie-android`'s Rendering Engine (specifically the parts responsible for processing and drawing animation frames).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the complexity of loaded animations *before* passing them to `lottie-android` (e.g., maximum number of layers, file size limits).
* Test animations on low-end devices to ensure acceptable performance of `lottie-android`.
* Consider using asynchronous loading and rendering of animations with `lottie-android` to avoid blocking the main thread.
* Implement timeouts for animation rendering within your application when using `lottie-android`.
