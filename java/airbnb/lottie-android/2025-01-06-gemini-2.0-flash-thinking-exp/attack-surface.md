# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JSON/DotLottie Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_jsondotlottie_files.md)

*   **Description:**  The library parses animation data from JSON or DotLottie files. Maliciously crafted files can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
    *   **How Lottie-Android Contributes:** The library's core functionality relies on parsing these file formats. Any weakness in its parsing implementation becomes a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** A deeply nested JSON structure within an animation file could cause excessive memory allocation during parsing, leading to an OutOfMemoryError and application crash (DoS). This directly involves Lottie's parsing engine.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash), potential for exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on animation files before passing them to Lottie. Limit file sizes and complexity.
        *   Use the latest version of the Lottie library, which includes bug fixes and security patches for its parsing logic.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or separate process for parsing potentially untrusted animation files specifically to isolate Lottie's parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Processing of Untrusted Animation Data](./attack_surfaces/processing_of_untrusted_animation_data.md)

*   **Description:** If the application loads animation data from untrusted sources (e.g., user uploads, external websites), there's a risk of Lottie processing malicious content that exploits its vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Lottie-Android Contributes:** The library's function is to process and render the provided animation data, regardless of its origin. If this data is malicious, Lottie's processing is the direct mechanism by which the exploit occurs.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted animation file designed to exploit a parsing vulnerability within Lottie's code.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service, potential for exploitation of parsing vulnerabilities leading to unexpected behavior or crashes within the application due to Lottie's actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid loading animation data from untrusted sources if possible.
        *   Implement server-side validation and sanitization of animation files *before* they are used by the application and processed by Lottie.
        *   Inform users about the risks of loading animations from unknown sources that Lottie will then process.
