# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Threat: [Malicious JSON File - Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_json_file_-_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Lottie JSON file that exploits a vulnerability in `lottie-android`'s JSON parsing or rendering engine (e.g., a buffer overflow in native code, a deserialization vulnerability in Java/Kotlin) to execute arbitrary code on the device. This leverages a flaw *within* the library.
*   **Impact:** Complete device compromise. The attacker could steal data, install malware, or take full control of the device.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `JsonCompositionLoader`: The JSON parsing component is the most likely entry point.
    *   Native rendering engine (if used by `lottie-android`). Vulnerabilities in C/C++ code are often more exploitable.
    *   Any component handling data derived from the JSON (e.g., if custom properties are used to influence application logic *within the library's context*).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer (Library-Level - Airbnb's Responsibility):**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** `lottie-android` *must* be developed with rigorous secure coding practices, especially in any native code components. This includes:
            *   Strict bounds checking.
            *   Avoiding unsafe functions.
            *   Using memory-safe languages where possible.
            *   Regular security audits and code reviews.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensive fuzz testing of the JSON parser and rendering engine is crucial to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Deep):** `lottie-android` must thoroughly sanitize *all* data extracted from the JSON, even seemingly harmless values. This goes beyond basic JSON validation.
        *   **Sandboxing (Process Isolation):** If feasible, consider running the Lottie rendering engine in a separate, isolated process with limited permissions. This can contain the damage if a vulnerability is exploited.  This is a more advanced mitigation.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Carefully manage dependencies of `lottie-android` to ensure they are also secure and up-to-date.
    *   **Developer (Application-Level):**
        *   **Regular Security Updates:** Promptly apply updates to the `lottie-android` library to address any discovered vulnerabilities. This is the *most important* application-level mitigation for a library-level RCE.
        *   **Input Validation (Pre-emptive):** While the core vulnerability is in the library, *pre-emptive* input validation (checking file size, basic structure) *before* passing the JSON to Lottie can reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Malicious JSON File - Resource Exhaustion (DoS) *within Lottie*](./threats/malicious_json_file_-_resource_exhaustion__dos__within_lottie.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Lottie JSON file with an extremely high number of layers, masks, effects, keyframes, or excessively large dimensions, specifically designed to exploit weaknesses in `lottie-android`'s resource handling.  This is *not* just about general resource limits, but about triggering a bug or inefficiency *within the library's code*.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, device unresponsiveness, battery drain, potential for device overheating. User experience is severely degraded.  The key difference from a general DoS is that this exploits a `lottie-android` specific vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `JsonCompositionLoader`: Inefficient parsing of overly complex JSON structures.
    *   `LottieDrawable`: Inefficient handling of complex animations during rendering.
    *   Internal rendering engine (potentially involving native code): Memory leaks or excessive memory allocation within the library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer (Library-Level - Airbnb's Responsibility):**
        *   **Complexity Scoring:** `lottie-android` *should* implement a complexity scoring system. This would assign a "score" to an animation based on its features (layers, masks, etc.) and reject animations exceeding a threshold. This is a *critical* library-level mitigation.
        *   **Memory Allocation Monitoring:** Monitor memory allocation during parsing and rendering *within the library*. If allocation exceeds a predefined limit *within the library's context*, abort the process.
        *   **Optimized Rendering:** Continuously optimize the rendering engine to handle complex animations efficiently.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where resource limits are exceeded *within the library*.
    *   **Developer (Application-Level):**
        *   **Resource Limits (Configuration):** Configure `LottieAnimationView` with limits: `setMaxFrame()`, `setMinFrame()`, `setMaxProgress()`, `setMinProgress()`. Use these to restrict animation duration and complexity, *but this is a secondary defense*. The library should handle this internally.
        *   **Timeout Handling:** Implement a timeout for the entire loading and rendering process. If it exceeds the timeout, terminate it and display a fallback.  Again, this is a secondary defense; the library should have internal timeouts.
        * **Input Validation (Pre-emptive):** Check for obvious red flags in the JSON file *before* passing it to Lottie (e.g., extremely large file size).
