# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Mitigation Strategy: [LottieAnimationView and LottieDrawable Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/lottieanimationview_and_lottiedrawable_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`setSafeMode(true)` (Deprecated, but illustrative):**  Older versions of `lottie-android` had a `setSafeMode(true)` method. While deprecated, it highlights the importance of understanding and controlling Lottie's behavior.  This mode (when available) aimed to disable potentially risky features.  The principle remains: *disable any Lottie feature you don't explicitly need*.
    2.  **`setImageAssetDelegate(...)` (Controlled Image Loading):**  This is *crucial*.  Use `setImageAssetDelegate` to *completely control* how Lottie handles images referenced within the animation.  *Do not* allow Lottie to load images directly.  The delegate should:
        *   Receive the `LottieImageAsset` object.
        *   Validate the `filename` and `url` properties *strictly* (whitelist, HTTPS, etc., as described in the previous "Controlled Image Loading" strategy).
        *   If the image is deemed safe, load it using a *secure image loading library* (Glide, Picasso) with appropriate security configurations (timeouts, size limits, etc.).
        *   Return a `Bitmap` to Lottie *only* if the image is valid and loaded successfully.  Return `null` otherwise.
    3.  **`setAnimation(String filename)` vs. `setAnimationFromJson(String jsonString, String cacheKey)` vs. `setAnimationFromUrl(String url)`:**
        *   Prefer `setAnimation(String filename)` for loading from local assets (most secure).
        *   If using `setAnimationFromJson`, ensure the `jsonString` has undergone *rigorous* schema validation and complexity checks *before* being passed to Lottie.
        *   If using `setAnimationFromUrl`, implement *all* network security best practices (HTTPS, certificate pinning, etc.) *and* still perform schema validation and complexity checks on the downloaded JSON *before* passing it to Lottie.  Treat remote URLs with extreme caution.
    4. **`setRepeatCount(...)` and `setRepeatMode(...)`:** Be mindful of animations that repeat indefinitely or for a very long time.  Consider setting a reasonable `repeatCount` to prevent potential resource exhaustion.
    5. **Hardware Acceleration:** Be aware of the `setRenderMode` method. While hardware acceleration (`RenderMode.HARDWARE`) can improve performance, it might have different security implications than software rendering (`RenderMode.SOFTWARE`). Test thoroughly on various devices and Android versions. If you encounter issues or have security concerns, consider using software rendering, especially for untrusted animations. Automatic mode (`RenderMode.AUTOMATIC`) chooses based on the Android version, so be aware of the implications on older devices.
    6. **Font Handling:** If your animation uses custom fonts, use `setFontAssetDelegate` to control how fonts are loaded, similar to how `setImageAssetDelegate` controls image loading. Validate font file names and ensure they are loaded from a trusted location.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Image Loading (High Severity):** `setImageAssetDelegate` is the *primary* defense against malicious image loading through Lottie.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Controlling `repeatCount` and being mindful of hardware acceleration can help mitigate some resource exhaustion risks.
    *   **Exploiting Lottie Parser Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** By carefully choosing which methods to use for loading animations (and pre-validating the JSON), you reduce the risk of triggering vulnerabilities within Lottie's parsing logic.
    * **Malicious Font Loading (High Severity):** `setFontAssetDelegate` is the primary defense against malicious font loading.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Image Loading:**  `setImageAssetDelegate`, properly implemented, *eliminates* the risk of Lottie directly loading malicious images.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Provides moderate risk reduction.
    *   **Parser Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the risk.
    * **Malicious Font Loading:** `setFontAssetDelegate` eliminates the risk of Lottie directly loading malicious fonts.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
    *   Partially Implemented: The application uses `LottieAnimationView`, but `setImageAssetDelegate` is *not* used. Animations are loaded from URLs without proper validation within the Lottie context. `setRenderMode` is set to `AUTOMATIC`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement `setImageAssetDelegate` with *full* URL validation and secure image loading.
    *   Review and potentially restrict `repeatCount` for animations.
    *   Evaluate the use of `setRenderMode` and consider explicitly setting it to `SOFTWARE` for untrusted animations if necessary.
    *   Implement `setFontAssetDelegate` if custom fonts are used.
    *   Ensure that JSON passed to `setAnimationFromJson` is *always* pre-validated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Animation Cache Management](./mitigation_strategies/animation_cache_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`LottieCache`:** `lottie-android` uses an internal cache (`LottieCache`) to store parsed animation data.  This improves performance but could potentially be a target for attacks if not managed carefully.
    2.  **Cache Key Control:** When loading animations, be aware of the cache key used.  If you are loading animations from different sources, ensure that the cache keys are distinct and do not allow for collisions.  For example, if you are loading animations from both local assets and a remote server, use different prefixes for the cache keys.
    3.  **Cache Size Limits:** While `LottieCache` has a default size limit, consider explicitly setting a maximum cache size using `Lottie.setMaxCacheSize(int maxSize)` to prevent potential memory exhaustion if a large number of animations are loaded.
    4.  **Cache Clearing:** In scenarios where you are loading animations from potentially untrusted sources, consider periodically clearing the Lottie cache using `Lottie.clearCache()`. This can help mitigate the risk of a malicious animation remaining in the cache and being reused later. However, be mindful of the performance impact of clearing the cache frequently.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning (Low Severity):**  While unlikely, a carefully crafted attack could potentially attempt to "poison" the Lottie cache with a malicious animation.  Proper cache key management and periodic clearing can mitigate this.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Low Severity):** Setting a maximum cache size can help prevent excessive memory consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Reduces the risk.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Provides a small reduction in risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not Implemented: The application relies on the default Lottie cache behavior without any explicit management.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement explicit cache key management to prevent collisions.
    *   Consider setting a maximum cache size using `Lottie.setMaxCacheSize()`.
    *   Evaluate the need for periodic cache clearing based on the application's security requirements.
