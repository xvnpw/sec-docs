## Attack Tree Path: [Root Node: [CRITICAL] Execute Arbitrary Code or Cause DoS via Malicious Lottie Animation](./attack_tree_paths/root_node__critical__execute_arbitrary_code_or_cause_dos_via_malicious_lottie_animation.md)

*   **Description:** This is the attacker's ultimate objective. They aim to either run their own code on the user's device (for data theft, installing malware, etc.) or disrupt the application's functionality (denial of service). This is the highest level of impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Branch 1: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/branch_1_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lottie_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on finding and exploiting bugs in how Lottie-Android parses and processes the JSON animation file. Bugs in this process can lead to severe security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sub-Branch 1.1: [CRITICAL] Buffer Overflow**
        *   **Description:** If Lottie-Android doesn't properly handle the size of data within the JSON file (e.g., excessively long strings, large arrays), it could lead to a buffer overflow. An attacker could craft a JSON file with oversized elements to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Sub-Branch 1.2: [CRITICAL] Integer Overflow**
        *   **Description:** Integer overflows can occur if Lottie-Android doesn't properly handle integer values within the JSON (e.g., animation parameters). An attacker could provide extremely large or small integer values that, when processed, lead to unexpected behavior and potentially exploitable conditions, including memory corruption.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Sub-Branch 1.3: [CRITICAL] Type Confusion**
        *   **Description:** If Lottie-Android incorrectly interprets the type of data within the JSON (e.g., treating a string as a number), it could lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities, including memory corruption and potential code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [-> HIGH RISK -> Branch 2: Manipulate Animation Content](./attack_tree_paths/-_high_risk_-_branch_2_manipulate_animation_content.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on how an attacker might abuse legitimate Lottie features or manipulate the animation content itself to achieve their goal, *specifically focusing on the high-risk scenario of script injection*.
    *   **Sub-Branch 2.1: [CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Script (Note: Only if scripting is enabled)**
        *   **Description:** *If* Lottie-Android supports any form of scripting (e.g., JavaScript expressions, custom callbacks), an attacker could try to inject malicious code into the animation file. This allows for direct code execution, making it a very high-risk vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if scripting is enabled)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
