# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Animation JSON (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_animation_json__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Maliciously Crafted Animation JSON (Denial of Service)

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a Lottie JSON file designed to consume excessive resources during parsing or rendering.
    *   **How `lottie-android` Contributes:** The library is responsible for parsing and rendering the JSON, making it the direct target of this attack.
    *   **Example:** A JSON file with millions of nested layers, extremely large numeric values for dimensions, or an excessive number of keyframes.  A "billion laughs" style attack adapted for Lottie's structure.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash (out-of-memory, stack overflow), device freeze, excessive battery drain.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict size limits on the JSON file size, number of layers, number of keyframes, and complexity of shapes/paths.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set reasonable limits on memory allocation and CPU usage during animation processing.  Consider using a timeout for animation loading/rendering.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Validate the JSON structure against a predefined, restrictive schema.
        *   **Progressive Loading (if applicable):** If possible, load and render the animation in stages, checking for resource consumption at each stage.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `lottie-android` or its Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__lottie-android__or_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in `lottie-android` or its Dependencies

    *   **Description:** Exploitable bugs or vulnerabilities in the `lottie-android` library itself or in one of its dependencies.
    *   **How `lottie-android` Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability within the library or its supply chain.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the JSON parsing library used by `lottie-android`, triggered by a specially crafted JSON file.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from crashes to arbitrary code execution (though less likely in a managed environment).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `lottie-android` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Dependency Monitoring:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the application and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        * **Use a Specific Version:** Pin the version of `lottie-android` to a known, secure version, and avoid using "latest" or wildcard versions.
