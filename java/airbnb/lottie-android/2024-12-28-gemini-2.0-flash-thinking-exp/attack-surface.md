Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving `lottie-android` and with high or critical risk severity:

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious JSON/AEP Files
    * **Description:** The library parses JSON or After Effects Project (AEP) files to render animations. A maliciously crafted file can exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing logic or contain excessive data.
    * **How Lottie-Android Contributes:** Lottie-Android's core functionality is to interpret and render these files, making it directly responsible for processing potentially malicious input.
    * **Example:** A JSON file with deeply nested objects or excessively large numerical values could cause a stack overflow or integer overflow during parsing. An AEP file with an extremely high number of layers or complex vector paths could lead to excessive memory allocation.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (application crash or freeze), potential for arbitrary code execution (though less likely), resource exhaustion (memory, CPU).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation on JSON/AEP files before passing them to the Lottie library.
        * Set resource limits for animation rendering (e.g., maximum number of layers, keyframes).
        * Isolate the Lottie rendering process in a separate thread or process to limit the impact of crashes.
        * Keep the Lottie library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

* **Attack Surface:** Loading Animations from Untrusted Remote Sources
    * **Description:** If the application allows loading Lottie animations from remote URLs, these sources could be compromised or malicious.
    * **How Lottie-Android Contributes:** The library provides mechanisms to load animations from network URLs.
    * **Example:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on an insecure HTTP connection to replace a legitimate animation with a malicious one. A compromised server could serve malicious JSON/AEP files.
    * **Impact:** Displaying misleading or harmful content, potential for application compromise if the malicious animation exploits vulnerabilities, data exfiltration if the animation triggers unintended network requests.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce HTTPS:** Only load animations from secure HTTPS URLs.
        * **Verify Server Certificates:** Implement proper certificate pinning or validation to prevent MITM attacks.
        * **Restrict Remote Loading:** If possible, avoid loading animations from arbitrary remote sources. Bundle animations with the application or load them from trusted, controlled servers.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Animations (if applicable in the application context):** Define allowed sources for animation files.
