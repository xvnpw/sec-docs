### High and Critical Lottie-Android Threats

Here's a list of high and critical threats that directly involve the `lottie-android` library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Animation Data - Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Structures
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted animation JSON file with excessively deep nesting or an extremely large number of layers/shapes. The `LottieCompositionFactory` attempts to parse this complex structure, leading to excessive CPU and memory consumption, potentially freezing or crashing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for the user. This can disrupt normal application functionality and negatively impact user experience.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `LottieCompositionFactory` (responsible for parsing JSON).
        *   Potentially the rendering pipeline if parsing completes but rendering is too intensive.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement size limits on animation files.
        *   Set timeouts for the `LottieCompositionFactory.fromInputStream()` or similar methods.
        *   Perform parsing and rendering on a background thread to prevent blocking the main UI thread.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Animation Data - Resource Exhaustion (Memory) via Large Assets
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an animation JSON file that references extremely large embedded images or vector paths with an excessive number of points. When `LottieDrawable` attempts to render these assets, it consumes a significant amount of memory, potentially leading to `OutOfMemoryError` and application crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Application crashes due to memory exhaustion, leading to data loss or user frustration.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `LottieDrawable` (responsible for rendering the animation).
        *   Image loading mechanisms within Lottie.
        *   Vector path rendering components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement checks on the size and complexity of embedded assets before rendering.
        *   Use appropriate image compression techniques for embedded images.
        *   Consider downsampling large vector paths or simplifying complex shapes.
        *   Implement memory management strategies, such as releasing resources when animations are no longer visible.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Animation Data - Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malformed animation JSON file that exploits a vulnerability in the `LottieCompositionFactory`'s JSON parsing logic. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or in more severe cases, even remote code execution (though highly unlikely within the Android sandbox).
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, potential security breaches (though less likely in a sandboxed environment).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `LottieCompositionFactory` (specifically the JSON parsing logic).
        *   Potentially any components that process the parsed data if the vulnerability lies in data interpretation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the `lottie-android` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Report any suspected parsing vulnerabilities to the library maintainers.
