# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Lottie for Android, aims to provide a high-quality, performant, and easy-to-use animation library for Android applications. It enables developers to render Adobe After Effects animations natively on Android, iOS, Web, and Windows. The primary business goal is to enhance user experience in applications by allowing for the seamless integration of complex vector animations, reducing the need for traditional image-based animations or complex custom code.

- Business priorities:
  - High performance animation rendering on Android devices.
  - Broad compatibility with Adobe After Effects animations.
  - Simple integration and usage for Android developers.
  - Stability and reliability of the library.
  - Open-source community support and contributions.

- Business risks:
  - Performance bottlenecks in animation rendering leading to poor user experience.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the animation parsing or rendering engine that could be exploited by malicious animation files.
  - Compatibility issues with different Android versions and devices.
  - Lack of community support and maintenance leading to stagnation and security issues.
  - Legal risks associated with licensing and intellectual property if dependencies or contributions are not properly managed.

# SECURITY POSTURE

The security posture of the Lottie Android project, as an open-source library, is focused on ensuring the library is safe to use within Android applications. Given its nature as a rendering engine for animation data, the primary security concerns revolve around vulnerabilities arising from processing potentially untrusted animation files.

- Security controls:
  - security control: Code review process for contributions, implemented via GitHub Pull Requests. (Location: GitHub repository contribution guidelines and pull request process)
  - security control: Open source nature allows for community security review. (Location: Public GitHub repository)
  - security control: Dependency management using Gradle. (Location: build.gradle files)

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase due to complexity of animation parsing and rendering.
  - accepted risk: Risk of malicious contributions if code review process is insufficient.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify vulnerabilities related to parsing malformed or malicious animation data.
  - security control: Establish a clear security vulnerability reporting and response process.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a rendering library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application integrating the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a rendering library. Authorization is the responsibility of the application integrating the library.
  - Input validation: Critical for animation data parsing. The library must robustly validate animation data to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, injection attacks, or denial-of-service. Validation should cover data types, ranges, and structure.
  - Cryptography: Not a primary requirement for the core rendering functionality. However, if animation data is transmitted over a network, applications using Lottie should ensure secure communication channels (HTTPS). Lottie library itself might benefit from using cryptography for integrity checks if animation data is signed or encrypted, but this is not a current requirement.

# DESIGN

The Lottie Android project is designed as a library that Android developers can integrate into their applications to render animations. The core design revolves around parsing animation data, typically in JSON format, and using Android's graphics APIs to render these animations efficiently.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process: Rendering animations smoothly and reliably within Android applications to enhance user experience. Failure to do so can lead to negative user perception and application abandonment. Security vulnerabilities could also disrupt this process.

- Data we are trying to protect:
  - Animation data (JSON files): Sensitivity depends on the context of the application using Lottie. In most cases, animation data itself is not highly sensitive. However, if animations are used in applications handling sensitive information, the integrity and availability of animation rendering become more important. Malicious animation data could potentially be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the Lottie library or the application itself.
  - Source code of the Lottie library: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the source code is important to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure of potential vulnerabilities.

- Data sensitivity:
  - Animation data: Low to Medium sensitivity in most general use cases. High sensitivity if used in security-critical applications or if animations themselves contain sensitive visual information.
  - Source code: Medium sensitivity. Publicly available open-source, but maintaining integrity is important.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the typical use cases for applications integrating Lottie Android in terms of data sensitivity? Are there specific industries or applications where Lottie is used to display animations related to sensitive user data or critical functionalities?
  - Are there any specific security requirements or compliance standards that applications using Lottie Android need to adhere to?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the Lottie Android library? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
  - Are there any existing security tests or audits performed on the Lottie Android library?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a feature-rich and performant animation library to enhance user experience in Android applications. Security is a secondary but important consideration to ensure the library is safe to use.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are primarily based on standard open-source development practices. There is room for improvement in automated security testing and vulnerability management processes. Input validation on animation data is a critical security requirement.
  - DESIGN: The library is designed as a modular component with clear separation of concerns between parsing, rendering, and API layers. Deployment is within the context of Android applications running on user devices. The build process likely uses standard open-source build tools and practices.
