# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Attack Surface: [1. Untrusted Animation Data Processing](./attack_surfaces/1__untrusted_animation_data_processing.md)

*   **Description:**  Critical vulnerabilities arising from `lottie-android` parsing and processing maliciously crafted animation data from untrusted sources. Exploits target weaknesses in the library's parsing logic.
*   **How lottie-android Contributes:** `lottie-android`'s core functionality is parsing and rendering animation data, typically JSON.  Maliciously crafted JSON can directly exploit vulnerabilities within `lottie-android`'s parsing implementation.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted JSON animation file is loaded by `lottie-android`. This file contains structures designed to trigger a buffer overflow or integer overflow vulnerability during parsing within the `lottie-android` library itself, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if parsing vulnerabilities are severe enough to allow memory corruption and code injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (If RCE is possible) to **High** (If DoS is easily achievable and severely impacts application).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation (Strict Parsing):**  While difficult to fully validate complex JSON structures, implement checks to reject excessively large animation files or files with suspiciously deep nesting *before* passing them to `lottie-android` for parsing.
    *   **Sandboxing (Process Isolation):**  If feasible, isolate the `lottie-android` parsing and rendering process in a separate, sandboxed process with minimal permissions. This limits the impact if a parsing vulnerability is exploited.
    *   **Regular Updates (Lottie Library):**  Immediately update `lottie-android` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the library maintainers that address parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits (of Lottie Usage):** Conduct security audits focusing on how animation data is sourced and loaded into `lottie-android` to identify potential injection points of malicious animations.

## Attack Surface: [2. Resource Loading and Path Traversal within Animations](./attack_surfaces/2__resource_loading_and_path_traversal_within_animations.md)

*   **Description:** High risk of path traversal vulnerabilities due to `lottie-android` handling resource paths specified within animation data. Malicious animations could attempt to access files outside intended asset directories.
*   **How lottie-android Contributes:** `lottie-android` interprets paths to external resources (images, fonts) embedded within animation JSON. If `lottie-android` doesn't properly sanitize or restrict these paths, it becomes the mechanism by which path traversal attacks can be executed.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts an animation file with a resource path like `"images/../../../sensitive_data.png"`. When `lottie-android` attempts to load this resource based on the animation instructions, and if path sanitization is insufficient within `lottie-android` or the application, it could potentially access and load the sensitive file, leading to unauthorized data access.
*   **Impact:** Path Traversal, Unauthorized File Access, potential Information Disclosure of sensitive local files.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (If path traversal is easily exploitable and can lead to access of sensitive application or system files).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Resource Paths (Lottie Configuration):** Configure `lottie-android` (if configuration options are available) to strictly limit resource loading to a predefined, secure directory within the application's assets or resources.
    *   **Path Sanitization (Application-Side):** *Before* passing animation data to `lottie-android`, pre-process the animation JSON to sanitize or validate all resource paths. Ensure paths are relative to the intended asset directory and do not contain path traversal sequences like `../`.
    *   **Content Security Policy (for Resources - if applicable in future Lottie versions):** If future versions of `lottie-android` offer a mechanism to define a Content Security Policy for resources, utilize it to strictly control allowed resource locations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File Permissions):** Ensure the application and `lottie-android` process run with minimal file system permissions, limiting the damage even if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.
