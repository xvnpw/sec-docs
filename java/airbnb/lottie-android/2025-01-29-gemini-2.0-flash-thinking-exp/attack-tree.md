## Attack Tree Path: [1. Attack Goal: Compromise Application via Lottie-Android [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__attack_goal_compromise_application_via_lottie-android__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. Successful exploitation of any of the sub-paths leads to application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service, or manipulation of application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. 1. Exploit Lottie Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__1__exploit_lottie_library_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting vulnerabilities within the Lottie-Android library itself. If successful, this can have widespread impact on all applications using the vulnerable version of the library.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially high impact, ranging from denial of service to more severe vulnerabilities like memory corruption or logic flaws that could be leveraged for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. 1.1. Malicious Animation File Injection [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__1_1__malicious_animation_file_injection__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting a specially crafted Lottie animation file designed to exploit weaknesses in the library's processing of animation data. This is the primary method to target Lottie library vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**  Impact depends on the specific vulnerability exploited. Could range from denial of service (resource exhaustion) to more severe issues like memory corruption or logic errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. 1.1.1. Crafted JSON Payload (Parsing Vulnerabilities) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__1_1_1__crafted_json_payload__parsing_vulnerabilities___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Creating a malicious JSON payload within the animation file to trigger vulnerabilities during the parsing process. This focuses on weaknesses in how Lottie parses and interprets the JSON animation data.
*   **Impact:**  Parsing vulnerabilities can lead to various issues, including denial of service, memory corruption (buffer overflows), or unexpected program behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. 1.1.1.2. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__1_1_1_2__cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting animation files that are excessively complex or resource-intensive to render, leading to CPU or memory exhaustion on the device running the application.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unresponsive or crashing it. This can disrupt application functionality and user experience.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1. 1.1.1.2.1. CPU Exhaustion (Complex Animations) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1__1_1_1_2_1__cpu_exhaustion__complex_animations___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Creating animations with a very high number of layers, keyframes, or complex calculations that overload the CPU during rendering.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or crashes due to CPU overload.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.2. 1.1.1.2.2. Memory Exhaustion (Large Assets/Animations) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5_2__1_1_1_2_2__memory_exhaustion__large_assetsanimations___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Including very large embedded assets (images, fonts) or creating animations with extremely long durations that consume excessive memory.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes due to out-of-memory errors or significant performance degradation due to memory pressure.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. 2. Exploit Application Misuse of Lottie [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__2__exploit_application_misuse_of_lottie__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* the Lottie library, rather than vulnerabilities in Lottie itself. This often involves insecure practices in handling animation files.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to exploiting library vulnerabilities, impact can range from denial of service to potentially more severe issues depending on the application's specific misuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. 2.1. Loading Untrusted Animation Files [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__2_1__loading_untrusted_animation_files__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The application loads Lottie animation files from untrusted sources, such as user uploads, external websites, or dynamically generated URLs based on user input. This directly exposes the application to malicious animation files.
*   **Impact:** High risk of successful exploitation via malicious animation file injection (as described in section 1.1).

## Attack Tree Path: [7.1. 2.1.1. Application Loads Animations from Untrusted Sources (e.g., User Uploads, External Websites) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7_1__2_1_1__application_loads_animations_from_untrusted_sources__e_g___user_uploads__external_websit_7347f81c.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Directly loading animation files from sources not under the application developer's control.
*   **Impact:**  High vulnerability to all types of malicious animation file attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [7.1.1. 2.1.1.1. Attacker Provides Malicious Animation File [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7_1_1__2_1_1_1__attacker_provides_malicious_animation_file__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a crafted malicious animation file to the application through the untrusted source.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation of Lottie vulnerabilities or application DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [7.2. 2.1.2. Lack of Input Validation on Animation Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7_2__2_1_2__lack_of_input_validation_on_animation_files__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application loads animation files without performing adequate validation, such as checking file size, complexity, or origin.
*   **Impact:**  Increased risk of denial of service attacks and potential exploitation of other vulnerabilities if malicious files are not filtered out.

## Attack Tree Path: [7.2.1. 2.1.2.1. Application Loads Animation Without Size/Complexity Limits [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7_2_1__2_1_2_1__application_loads_animation_without_sizecomplexity_limits__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Specifically, the application fails to limit the size or complexity of animation files it loads.
*   **Impact:**  High vulnerability to denial of service attacks via resource exhaustion.
