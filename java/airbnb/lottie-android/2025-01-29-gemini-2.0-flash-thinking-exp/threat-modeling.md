# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/lottie-android

## Threat: [Malicious JSON Parsing Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_json_parsing_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON animation file designed to exploit vulnerabilities within Lottie-Android's JSON parsing logic. When the application attempts to parse this file using `LottieCompositionFactory`, the vulnerability is triggered. This could lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potentially, in severe cases, remote code execution if the parser vulnerability is critical enough. The attacker could deliver this malicious JSON through various means, such as a compromised animation server, a malicious website, or embedded within seemingly legitimate content.
* **Impact:**
    * **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (if parser vulnerability allows).
    * **High:** Denial of Service (DoS) through application crash or hang, significant application instability, memory corruption.
* **Lottie-Android Component Affected:** `LottieCompositionFactory` (JSON parsing module), core parsing logic within the library.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability exploited)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Animation Source Control:** **Critical:** Only load animations from highly trusted and rigorously verified sources. Implement strong validation and security checks on the origin and integrity of animation files.
    * **Regular Lottie-Android Updates:** **Critical:** Immediately update Lottie-Android to the latest version as soon as security patches are released. Monitor Lottie-Android release notes and security advisories for parser-related fixes.
    * **Input Sanitization (Limited Effectiveness for Parser Bugs):** **High:** While less effective against parser vulnerabilities themselves, if your application manipulates animation data before parsing, ensure robust input sanitization to prevent injection of potentially malicious data that could exacerbate parser issues.
    * **Sandboxing/Isolation (Advanced):** **High:** In highly sensitive applications, consider running the animation parsing and rendering process in a sandboxed or isolated environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Exploitation of High/Critical Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_highcritical_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Lottie-Android relies on third-party libraries as dependencies. If a high or critical severity vulnerability is discovered in one of these dependencies, an attacker could exploit it through Lottie-Android. This means crafting a malicious animation or triggering specific Lottie-Android functionality that utilizes the vulnerable dependency in a way that exposes the vulnerability. This could lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or other severe security impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
* **Impact:**
    * **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Breach, Privilege Escalation (depending on the dependency vulnerability).
    * **High:** Significant application compromise, Denial of Service (DoS), data corruption.
* **Lottie-Android Component Affected:** Indirectly affects the entire library, specifically components that utilize the vulnerable dependency. This could be any part of Lottie-Android that interacts with the vulnerable dependency's functions.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Proactive Dependency Monitoring:** **Critical:** Implement a system for continuously monitoring Lottie-Android's dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Use dependency scanning tools and subscribe to security advisories related to Lottie-Android's dependency ecosystem.
    * **Immediate Updates on Dependency Vulnerabilities:** **Critical:** If a high or critical vulnerability is identified in a Lottie-Android dependency, prioritize updating Lottie-Android to a version that includes a fix or mitigation for the vulnerability. If no updated Lottie version is immediately available, consider temporary workarounds or disabling vulnerable features if feasible and necessary.
    * **Regular Lottie-Android Updates:** **High:** Keeping Lottie-Android updated generally ensures you benefit from dependency updates and security patches included in newer releases.
    * **Vulnerability Disclosure and Patching Process:** **High:**  Establish a clear process for responding to vulnerability disclosures related to Lottie-Android and its dependencies, including rapid patching and communication to users.
