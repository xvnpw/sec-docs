# Threat Model Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Threat: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./threats/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to the Android device (physical access, malware, remote access) and exploits insecure storage practices to read sensitive data. This could involve reading plaintext files, decrypting weakly encrypted data, or bypassing file permission restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of user credentials, private files, encryption keys, and other sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Android Component:** Local storage (SharedPreferences, internal storage, external storage, databases), file system access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Encrypt all sensitive data at rest using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256). Utilize Android Keystore System for secure key management.
            *   Avoid storing sensitive data in plaintext.
            *   Implement proper file permissions to restrict access to application data.
            *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored locally.
            *   Use secure storage mechanisms provided by Android (e.g., EncryptedSharedPreferences).
        *   **Users:**
