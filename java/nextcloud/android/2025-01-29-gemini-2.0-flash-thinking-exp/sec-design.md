# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Securely accessing and managing user files stored on Nextcloud servers from Android devices.
 - Reliable synchronization of files between Android devices and Nextcloud servers.
 - Protecting user data privacy and confidentiality.
 - Maintaining user trust and the reputation of Nextcloud.
- Data Sensitivity:
 - User Files: High sensitivity. These files can contain personal, confidential, or business-critical information. Unauthorized access or data loss can have significant consequences.
