# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Local Data Storage with Android Keystore Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/secure_local_data_storage_with_android_keystore_encryption.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Developers must identify all sensitive data stored locally on the Android device (user credentials, cached files, settings).
    2.  **Implement Android Keystore:** Utilize Android Keystore to generate and securely store encryption keys with strong parameters.
    3.  **Encrypt Data at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data using keys from Keystore before writing to local storage, using Android's `EncryptedFile` API or similar. Encrypt Shared Preferences values if needed.
    4.  **Secure Key Management:** Implement secure key lifecycle management, avoiding hardcoding or insecure storage.
    5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit encryption implementation and key management.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Theft from Device (High Severity):** Unencrypted data accessible if device is lost/stolen/compromised.
        *   **Malware Access to Local Data (High Severity):** Malware can access unencrypted local data.
        *   **Physical Access Attacks (Medium Severity):** Attackers with physical access can extract unencrypted data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Theft from Device (High Risk Reduction):** Encryption makes data unreadable without Keystore key.
        *   **Malware Access to Local Data (High Risk Reduction):** Encryption hinders malware access to sensitive data.
        *   **Physical Access Attacks (Medium Risk Reduction):** Encryption adds protection against physical attacks.
