# Attack Surface Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Exported Components (Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers)](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_exported_components__activities__services__broadcast_receivers__content_providers_.md)

*   **Description:** Application components that are intended for internal use are improperly exported, allowing other applications to interact with them.
    *   **How Android Contributes:** Android's component model allows applications to interact with each other through exported components. If these components are not secured with proper permission checks or input validation, they can become attack vectors, a design inherent to the Android platform's inter-process communication.
    *   **Example:** An exported Activity that allows modification of application settings without proper authentication, or an exported Content Provider that grants access to sensitive data without sufficient authorization.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious applications can leverage these exported components to:
        *   **Activities:** Launch activities in unintended states, potentially bypassing security checks or manipulating application flow.
        *   **Services:** Trigger unintended actions or access sensitive data managed by the service.
        *   **Broadcast Receivers:** Send crafted broadcasts to trigger malicious behavior within the application.
        *   **Content Providers:** Access, modify, or delete data managed by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the functionality and data exposed by the exported component).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
        *   Avoid exporting components unless absolutely necessary for inter-application communication.
        *   Implement robust permission checks for exported components to restrict access to authorized applications.
        *   Validate all input received by exported components to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
        *   Use `android:exported="false"` in the manifest for components intended for internal use only.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Users):**
        *   Users have limited control over this. Rely on developers to implement secure component exporting.
        *   Be aware of the risks of installing applications from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored locally on the Android device without proper encryption or protection.
    *   **How Android Contributes:** Android provides various storage options, but developers are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures. If data is stored in publicly accessible locations within the Android file system or without utilizing Android's encryption features, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** Storing authentication tokens, encryption keys, or downloaded files in shared preferences without encryption or in world-readable files on the Android file system.
    *   **Impact:** If the device is compromised (e.g., rooted, malware), or if the application has vulnerabilities allowing access to the Android file system, sensitive data can be easily accessed by attackers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
        *   Encrypt sensitive data before storing it locally using Android's KeyStore system or other robust encryption libraries.
        *   Store data in the application's private storage directory, which is protected by the Android operating system.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily.
        *   Consider using secure storage mechanisms like Encrypted Shared Preferences or the Jetpack Security library provided by Android.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Users):**
        *   Enable device encryption provided by the Android operating system.
        *   Avoid rooting the device, as it weakens Android's security boundaries.
        *   Be cautious about installing applications from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Certificate Pinning](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_certificate_pinning.md)

*   **Description:** The application does not implement certificate pinning for its HTTPS connections.
    *   **How Android Contributes:** While Android provides a system-wide trust store for SSL/TLS certificates, relying solely on this makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if a Certificate Authority trusted by the Android system is compromised.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic by compromising a Certificate Authority trusted by the Android device and issuing a fraudulent certificate for the Nextcloud server. Without certificate pinning, the application might trust this fraudulent certificate validated by the Android system.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can intercept and decrypt network communication between the application and the server, potentially stealing credentials, sensitive data, or manipulating data in transit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
        *   Implement certificate pinning to validate the server's certificate against a known good certificate or its public key.
        *   Use robust pinning libraries and follow best practices for managing pinned certificates within the Android application.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Users):**
        *   Users have limited control over this. Rely on developers to implement certificate pinning within the Android application.
