# Threat Model Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Threat: [Intent Interception/Manipulation](./threats/intent_interceptionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious application installed on the same device could intercept or manipulate intents sent by or intended for the Nextcloud application. This is possible due to how Android's intent system works. An attacker app could register intent filters that match those used by Nextcloud, allowing it to intercept sensitive data being passed between components or to inject malicious data into intents intended for Nextcloud. For example, an attacker app could intercept an intent to share a file and redirect it to their own service or modify the file content before it reaches the intended destination within Nextcloud.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized actions performed within the Nextcloud application on behalf of the user, potential for phishing or malware distribution through manipulated shares initiated by the user through Nextcloud.
    *   **Affected Component:** Activities and Broadcast Receivers within the Nextcloud application that send or receive intents, Android Intent System integration within the app.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize explicit intents whenever possible to target specific components within the Nextcloud application, reducing the chances of interception by other apps.
        *   Implement robust intent verification to ensure the sender of an intent is a trusted source.
        *   Consider using custom permissions for sensitive intents to restrict which applications can interact with them.
        *   Avoid sending sensitive data directly within intents if alternative secure methods of communication are available.

## Threat: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./threats/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** The Nextcloud application might store sensitive data locally on the Android device without proper encryption or using weak encryption methods. An attacker who gains access to the device (either physically or remotely) could then access this data. This could include authentication tokens, encryption keys used for file encryption, or even cached file data. For example, if the application stores the user's session token in plain text in shared preferences, a malicious app with sufficient permissions could read this token and impersonate the user.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, exposure of personal files and data stored within the user's Nextcloud, potential for further attacks using compromised credentials or encryption keys.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data storage mechanisms within the application (e.g., SharedPreferences, internal storage file system, SQLite databases) and the modules responsible for managing local data persistence.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt all sensitive data stored locally using strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES).
        *   Utilize the Android Keystore system for secure storage of cryptographic keys used for encryption.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data in SharedPreferences if more secure alternatives exist.
        *   Implement proper file permissions to restrict access to application data to only the Nextcloud application itself.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Content Provider Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_content_provider_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the Nextcloud application exposes data through a Content Provider, vulnerabilities in its implementation could allow other applications to access this data without proper authorization. This could occur due to insufficient permission checks or flaws in the data retrieval logic. An attacker application could query the Content Provider and potentially retrieve sensitive information such as file metadata, account details, or even file content if access controls are not correctly implemented.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized access to user data managed by the Nextcloud application, potentially allowing other applications to gain insights into the user's Nextcloud activity.
    *   **Affected Component:** Content Providers implemented within the Nextcloud application, specifically the `query`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete` methods and their associated permission checks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully design and implement Content Providers, ensuring robust authorization checks are in place for all data access operations.
        *   Use appropriate permissions to restrict access to the Content Provider to only authorized applications or system components.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive data through Content Providers if alternative, more secure methods of data sharing are feasible.

## Threat: [Lack of Certificate Pinning or Improper Implementation](./threats/lack_of_certificate_pinning_or_improper_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** The Nextcloud Android application might not implement certificate pinning or might have a flawed implementation. This makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker on the network could intercept communication between the app and the Nextcloud server by presenting a fraudulent SSL/TLS certificate. If certificate pinning is not implemented or is done incorrectly, the application might trust this malicious certificate, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on or modify the communication.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between the app and the server (including credentials, file data, and metadata), potential for session hijacking, and the ability for the attacker to inject malicious data into the communication stream.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication layer within the application, specifically the modules responsible for establishing secure connections (HTTPS) with the Nextcloud server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust certificate pinning by validating the server's SSL/TLS certificate against a known, trusted certificate or its public key.
        *   Ensure the certificate pinning implementation is correct and handles certificate rotations and updates properly.
        *   Consider using a library specifically designed for certificate pinning to reduce the risk of implementation errors.

## Threat: [Use of Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries](./threats/use_of_vulnerable_third-party_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** The Nextcloud Android application might include third-party libraries that contain known security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the application or the user's device. For example, a vulnerable image processing library could be exploited to execute arbitrary code when the application processes a malicious image.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, arbitrary code execution within the application's context, data breach, potential for device compromise depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the application that utilizes the vulnerable third-party library. Identifying the specific component requires analyzing the application's dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the vulnerability in the library, but can be Critical or High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date list of all third-party libraries used in the application.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools like dependency-check or similar software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Promptly update vulnerable libraries to the latest secure versions.
        *   Carefully evaluate the security posture of third-party libraries before including them in the project.
