## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Local Data/Functionality Vulnerabilities - Access Insecurely Stored Credentials/Tokens - Exploit Shared Preferences Vulnerabilities - Application Not Using Encryption for Sensitive Data - Attacker Gains Root Access or Uses Backup Extraction Tools:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_local_datafunctionality_vulnerabilities_-_access_insecurely_stored_credentialstokens_-_explo_08f7f3e9.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application stores sensitive information (like API keys, session tokens, or passwords) in Android Shared Preferences without proper encryption. An attacker who has gained root access to the device or can extract application backups (e.g., via ADB backup with user confirmation enabled) can then read this unencrypted data.
* **Why High-Risk:** This path has a critical impact (potential for full account takeover) and a medium likelihood, as gaining root access or extracting backups is achievable by a significant portion of technically inclined attackers or through malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Local Data/Functionality Vulnerabilities - Access Insecurely Stored Credentials/Tokens - Exploit Insecure Local Database Storage - Database Not Encrypted - Attacker Gains Root Access or Uses Backup Extraction Tools:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_local_datafunctionality_vulnerabilities_-_access_insecurely_stored_credentialstokens_-_explo_b62cffc5.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Similar to the Shared Preferences scenario, the application stores sensitive data in a local SQLite database without encryption. An attacker with root access or the ability to extract backups can access and read the database contents.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Similar risk profile to the unencrypted Shared Preferences scenario - critical impact and medium likelihood.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Local Data/Functionality Vulnerabilities - Exploit Insecure Local File Storage - Store Sensitive Data in Publicly Accessible Directories - Malicious Application Reads Sensitive Files:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_local_datafunctionality_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_insecure_local_file_storage_-_store_sensit_01f567a0.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application stores sensitive data in world-readable directories on the Android file system (e.g., the SD card without proper restrictions). A malicious application installed on the same device can then read these files without requiring special permissions.
* **Why High-Risk:** This path has a significant impact (data breach) and a medium likelihood, as users often grant broad storage permissions to applications, and malicious apps exploiting this are common.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - Network-Level MitM - Compromised Wi-Fi Network - Attacker Intercepts Network Traffic:](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_-_network-level_mitm_-_compromised_wi-fi_network_-_attacker_interce_d4069310.md)

* **Attack Vector:** When the user connects to an untrusted or compromised Wi-Fi network, an attacker on the same network can intercept the communication between the Nextcloud app and the server. If the app doesn't use HTTPS properly or lacks certificate pinning, the attacker can potentially steal credentials or other sensitive data.
* **Why High-Risk:** This is a classic and relatively easy attack to execute (low effort, beginner skill level) with a significant impact (data breach, credential theft). The likelihood is medium as users frequently connect to public Wi-Fi.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - Exploiting Lack of Certificate Pinning - Attacker Presents Fraudulent Certificate:](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_-_exploiting_lack_of_certificate_pinning_-_attacker_presents_fraudu_bd702cfc.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the Nextcloud Android application does not implement certificate pinning, it will trust any certificate presented by the server during the TLS handshake. An attacker performing a MitM attack can present a fraudulent certificate, and the application will establish a connection, allowing the attacker to intercept and potentially modify traffic.
* **Why High-Risk:** This has a critical impact (potential for full account takeover) and a medium likelihood if certificate pinning is not implemented, as MitM attacks are a known threat. The effort and skill level for the attacker are relatively low.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries - Attacker Exploits Known Vulnerabilities in Used Libraries:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_-_attacker_exploits_k_b837fa7b.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The Nextcloud Android application relies on third-party libraries. If these libraries have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them to compromise the application. This could range from data breaches to remote code execution.
* **Why High-Risk:** This has a potentially critical impact (depending on the vulnerability) and a medium likelihood, as many applications use third-party libraries, and keeping them updated is a continuous challenge. Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Vulnerabilities - Authentication and Authorization Flaws - Broken Authentication Mechanisms - Attacker Bypasses Login Process:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_vulnerabilities_-_authentication_and_authorization_flaws_-_broken_authentication_842e3b5e.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the application has flaws in its authentication logic (e.g., weak password policies, insecure token generation, or vulnerabilities in the login flow), an attacker might be able to bypass the login process and gain unauthorized access to a user's account.
* **Why High-Risk:** This has a critical impact (full account takeover) and a low to medium likelihood, depending on the security measures implemented. The effort and skill level can vary depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Android Device - Malware Installation - Social Engineering to Trick User into Installing Malware - User Installs Malicious Application:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_android_device_-_malware_installation_-_social_engineering_to_trick_user_into_install_ff353236.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  A common attack vector involves tricking the user into installing a malicious application that can then monitor the Nextcloud app's activity, steal credentials, or perform other malicious actions. This often involves social engineering tactics.
* **Why High-Risk:** This has a critical impact (potential for full device compromise and data theft, including Nextcloud data) and a medium likelihood, as social engineering attacks are prevalent, and users can be tricked into installing malicious apps.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Android Device - Physical Access to the Device - Unlocked Device - Attacker Directly Accesses Application Data:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_android_device_-_physical_access_to_the_device_-_unlocked_device_-_attacker_directly__f6e2a109.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If a user leaves their device unlocked and unattended, an attacker with physical access can directly open the Nextcloud application and access any data that is readily available within the app.
* **Why High-Risk:** This has a critical impact (direct access to all app data) and a low to medium likelihood, depending on user behavior and security awareness. The effort and skill level are very low for this attack.
