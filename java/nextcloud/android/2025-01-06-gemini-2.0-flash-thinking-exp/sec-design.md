* **Authentication and Authorization:** Robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) should be used to verify user identity. Access to server resources must be based on proper authorization checks.
* **Data Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive data stored locally, including file contents and metadata, MUST be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) and securely managed keys via the Android Keystore.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** All user inputs, including file names and metadata, must be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injection).
* **Secure Credential Storage:** User credentials (passwords, tokens) MUST NOT be stored in plain text. Utilize secure storage mechanisms provided by the Android OS (e.g., Keystore, Credential Manager).
* **Permissions Management:** The application should request only the necessary permissions required for its functionality, following the principle of least privilege. Users should be clearly informed about the purpose of each permission.
* **Protection Against Reverse Engineering:** Employ code obfuscation techniques to make it more difficult for attackers to reverse engineer the application and understand its logic.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Periodic security assessments should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Third-Party Library Security:** Regularly update and monitor third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to manage dependencies.
* **Secure Sharing Mechanisms:** When sharing files, ensure appropriate permissions and access controls are enforced on the server and reflected in the application.
* **Protection Against Data Leaks:** Implement measures to prevent unintentional data leaks, such as secure handling of clipboard data and preventing sensitive information from being logged unnecessarily.
* **Handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**  Ensure compliance with privacy regulations when handling PII. Minimize the collection and storage of PII, and implement appropriate security measures to protect it.
