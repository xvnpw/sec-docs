# Attack Surface Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Exported Components (Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers)](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_exported_components__activities__services__broadcast_receivers_.md)

*   **Description:** Android components (Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers) that are incorrectly marked as "exported" can be accessed and interacted with by other applications on the device.
    *   **How Android Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The AndroidManifest.xml file defines which components are exported. Incorrect configuration here directly exposes these components. The Android Intent system allows inter-application communication, which can be abused if exports are misconfigured.
    *   **Example:** A malicious app could send a crafted intent to an exported Activity in the Nextcloud app, potentially triggering unintended actions like initiating a file upload to an attacker-controlled server or leaking sensitive information displayed in the Activity.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized actions within the Nextcloud app, potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Carefully review the `android:exported` attribute in the `AndroidManifest.xml` for each Activity, Service, and Broadcast Receiver. Only export components that absolutely need to be accessible by other apps.
            *   Use explicit intents instead of implicit intents where possible to limit the target of the intent.
            *   Implement robust input validation and permission checks within exported components to prevent malicious intent payloads from causing harm.
            *   Consider using permissions to restrict access to exported components to specific applications.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data (like authentication tokens, encryption keys, downloaded files) is stored insecurely on the device's file system.
    *   **How Android Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Android's file system permissions model dictates access control. If data is stored in world-readable locations (e.g., external storage without proper encryption) or without using Android's secure storage mechanisms, other apps or malware with sufficient permissions can access it.
    *   **Example:**  The Nextcloud app might store the user's authentication token in a plain text file on the SD card. A malicious app with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission could read this token and impersonate the user.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Utilize Android's secure storage options like `EncryptedSharedPreferences` or `EncryptedFile` for sensitive data.
            *   Avoid storing sensitive data on external storage unless absolutely necessary and ensure it's properly encrypted.
            *   Implement proper key management practices for encryption keys.
            *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored locally.

## Attack Surface: [Intent Redirection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/intent_redirectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  A malicious application can intercept or manipulate intents intended for the Nextcloud app, potentially leading to unintended actions or data leakage.
    *   **How Android Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The Android Intent system, while powerful, can be a source of vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. Malicious apps can register intent filters that overlap with the Nextcloud app's filters, allowing them to intercept intents.
    *   **Example:** A malicious app could register an intent filter for a specific file type that the Nextcloud app handles for uploads. When the user tries to share such a file, the malicious app intercepts the intent and uploads the file to an attacker-controlled server instead.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, phishing attacks, unauthorized actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use explicit intents whenever possible to directly target the intended component.
            *   Implement robust intent verification to ensure the intent originated from a trusted source.
            *   Carefully define intent filters to be as specific as possible, reducing the chance of overlap with malicious apps.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** The Nextcloud Android app relies on various third-party libraries and SDKs, which may contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Android Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Android apps are built using a modular approach, often incorporating external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries become part of the app's attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable version of an image processing library used by the Nextcloud app could be exploited by an attacker who uploads a specially crafted image, leading to remote code execution within the app's context.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all third-party libraries used in the app.
            *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency-check or Snyk.
            *   Update libraries to the latest stable versions promptly to patch vulnerabilities.
            *   Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools during development.
