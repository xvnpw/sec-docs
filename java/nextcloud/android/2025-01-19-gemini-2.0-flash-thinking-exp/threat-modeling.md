# Threat Model Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Credentials](./threats/insecure_storage_of_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the Android device (e.g., through malware, physical access, or a rooted device) and retrieves stored credentials (passwords, tokens) from the Nextcloud Android application that are not adequately protected by the application itself. This could involve reading shared preferences or internal storage files where the application has stored credentials insecurely.

**Impact:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to the user's Nextcloud account, potentially viewing, modifying, or deleting files, sharing sensitive information, and potentially compromising other connected services.

**Affected Component:** Account Manager module within the Nextcloud Android application, specifically the functions responsible for storing and retrieving user login credentials.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Utilize the Android Keystore system for storing sensitive credentials within the Nextcloud Android application.
    * Avoid storing credentials in shared preferences or internal storage in plaintext or easily reversible formats within the application.
    * Implement strong encryption for stored credentials using a key securely managed by the Android Keystore within the application.
    * Minimize the duration for which credentials are held in memory by the application.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Application Backups](./threats/data_leakage_through_application_backups.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to device backups (local or cloud) that contain sensitive data from the Nextcloud Android application. This occurs because the application allows sensitive data to be included in backups without proper encryption.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, documents, photos, videos, and potentially account information stored within the Nextcloud Android application's data.

**Affected Component:** Android Backup Service integration within the Nextcloud Android application, specifically how the application configures its backup rules and what data is included.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Exclude sensitive data from automatic backups by using `android:allowBackup="false"` in the application manifest of the Nextcloud Android application or by implementing custom backup/restore logic that encrypts data before backup within the application.
    * If custom backup is implemented, ensure strong encryption is used by the Nextcloud Android application.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Downloaded Files](./threats/insecure_handling_of_downloaded_files.md)

**Description:** Downloaded files from the Nextcloud server are stored by the Nextcloud Android application on the device's file system without proper encryption or with overly permissive access rights set by the application. This allows other malicious applications or users with physical access to view or modify these files.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive documents, photos, videos, and other files downloaded from the user's Nextcloud account due to the Nextcloud Android application's insecure storage practices.

**Affected Component:** File download and storage functionality within the Nextcloud Android application, specifically the code responsible for saving files to the device's storage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Encrypt downloaded files before storing them on the device within the Nextcloud Android application.
    * Store downloaded files in the application's private storage directory, which is protected by Android's sandbox, within the Nextcloud Android application.
    * Avoid storing sensitive files on external storage unless absolutely necessary and with explicit user consent and encryption implemented by the Nextcloud Android application.
    * Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access to the Nextcloud Android application itself.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_third-party_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The Nextcloud Android application relies on third-party libraries that contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities within the Nextcloud Android application to compromise the application or the user's device.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from data breaches and remote code execution within the context of the Nextcloud Android application to denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Any module or function within the Nextcloud Android application that utilizes the vulnerable third-party library. This requires careful dependency management and security scanning of the Nextcloud Android application's dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Regularly update all third-party libraries used by the Nextcloud Android application to their latest versions, which often include security patches.
    * Implement a robust dependency management system to track and manage library versions within the Nextcloud Android application's development process.
    * Perform static and dynamic analysis of the Nextcloud Android application to identify potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    * Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies of the Nextcloud Android application.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Local Network (Bypassing Certificate Pinning)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_local_network__bypassing_certificate_pinning_.md)

**Description:** An attacker on the same local network as the user intercepts network traffic between the Nextcloud Android application and the server. While HTTPS provides encryption, vulnerabilities in the Nextcloud Android application's certificate pinning implementation or failure to enforce it correctly could allow the attacker to present a fraudulent certificate and decrypt the communication.

**Impact:** The attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted by the Nextcloud Android application, including credentials, files, and other personal information. They could also potentially modify data in transit.

**Affected Component:** Network communication layer within the Nextcloud Android application, specifically the code responsible for establishing secure connections and validating server certificates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**
    * Implement robust certificate pinning within the Nextcloud Android application to ensure that the application only trusts the legitimate Nextcloud server certificate.
    * Regularly update the pinned certificates within the Nextcloud Android application.
    * Handle certificate pinning failures gracefully within the Nextcloud Android application and inform the user.
    * Avoid relying solely on the operating system's certificate store within the Nextcloud Android application.
