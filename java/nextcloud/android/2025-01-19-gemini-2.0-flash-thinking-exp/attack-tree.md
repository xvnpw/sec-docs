## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Local Data (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_local_data__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on gaining access to Nextcloud data stored locally on the Android device. Success in this area grants the attacker direct access to potentially sensitive user information without needing to interact with the Nextcloud server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Physical Access & Bypass Device Security (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/physical_access_&_bypass_device_security__high-risk_path_.md)

This sub-path involves the attacker gaining physical possession of the device and then circumventing the device's lock screen security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain physical access to the device (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_physical_access_to_the_device__critical_node_.md)

An attacker obtains the physical device through theft, loss, or by borrowing it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass lock screen (PIN, pattern, biometric) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_lock_screen__pin__pattern__biometric___critical_node_.md)

Once physical access is obtained, the attacker attempts to bypass the lock screen using techniques like exploiting vulnerabilities, using factory reset procedures (if not protected), or through social engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Rooted Device Exploitation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/rooted_device_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

This path targets devices where the user has obtained root privileges, which weakens the Android security sandbox.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit root access to directly access Nextcloud's private data (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_root_access_to_directly_access_nextcloud's_private_data__critical_node_.md)

With root access, an attacker can bypass normal application sandboxing and directly access the Nextcloud app's data directory and files, regardless of standard Android permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Vulnerabilities (Android Specific) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_vulnerabilities__android_specific___high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses within the Nextcloud Android application code itself, specifically those related to Android's features and security model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Intents/Activities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_intentsactivities__high-risk_path_.md)

This sub-path involves exploiting how the Nextcloud app interacts with other Android components through Intents.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit exported activities with insufficient permission checks](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_exported_activities_with_insufficient_permission_checks.md)

If Nextcloud exposes activities (entry points within the app) to other applications without proper authorization, a malicious app can invoke these activities to perform unintended actions or access data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send malicious intents to trigger unintended actions or data leaks](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_intents_to_trigger_unintended_actions_or_data_leaks.md)

Crafting specific Intents with malicious data or targeting specific components to trigger vulnerabilities or logic errors within the Nextcloud app, leading to data leaks or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Libraries/SDKs (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_librariessdks__high-risk_path_.md)

This sub-path involves exploiting known security flaws in third-party libraries or SDKs integrated into the Nextcloud app.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the app](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_the_app.md)

Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in libraries used by Nextcloud. If these libraries are not updated, attackers can exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code within the app's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Data Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_data_handling__high-risk_path_.md)

This sub-path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how the Nextcloud app stores and manages sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting insecurely stored API keys or tokens (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecurely_stored_api_keys_or_tokens__critical_node_.md)

If API keys or authentication tokens used to communicate with the Nextcloud server are stored insecurely (e.g., in plaintext, easily accessible shared preferences), an attacker can retrieve these credentials and impersonate the user, gaining unauthorized access to their account and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Android Platform Features: Accessibility Service Abuse (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_android_platform_features_accessibility_service_abuse__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves misusing Android's accessibility services, which are designed to help users with disabilities interact with their devices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious app uses accessibility service to monitor or control Nextcloud app (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_app_uses_accessibility_service_to_monitor_or_control_nextcloud_app__critical_node_.md)

If a user unknowingly grants accessibility permissions to a malicious application, that application can monitor the user's interactions with the Nextcloud app, retrieve sensitive information displayed on the screen, and even perform actions on the user's behalf without their explicit consent. This can lead to data theft, unauthorized file sharing, or other malicious activities.
