# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Mitigation Strategy: [Application-Level Encryption (Android Keystore Integration)](./mitigation_strategies/application-level_encryption__android_keystore_integration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Application-Level Encryption (Android Keystore Integration)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Key Generation:** Derive a strong encryption key from the user's Nextcloud password *and* a device-specific identifier (e.g., Android ID, a securely generated UUID stored in the Keystore). Use a robust KDF like PBKDF2 with a high iteration count and a random salt.
        2.  **Key Storage:** Store the derived key *exclusively* in the **Android Keystore System** using the `AndroidKeyStore` provider. Configure the Keystore entry to require user authentication (fingerprint, PIN) for key access, if desired.  *Never* store the raw key in SharedPreferences, files, or application memory.
        3.  **Encryption/Decryption:** Before writing *any* file to the Android file system, encrypt it using the key from the Keystore with a strong, authenticated encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-GCM). Decrypt when reading.
        4.  **Key Rotation:** Implement a mechanism to rotate the encryption key periodically (triggered by password changes, time interval, or remote command).
        5.  **Secure Wipe:** On failed login attempts or remote wipe, securely erase all local data *and* the encryption key from the Keystore. Overwrite data multiple times using `SecureRandom`.
        6. **Key Attestation:** Use Key Attestation (if supported) to verify Keystore integrity.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Physical Device Theft/Loss (Severity: High):** Prevents data access even if device encryption is bypassed.
        *   **Malware with Root Access (Severity: High):** Protects data from root-level malware.
        *   **Data Remnants (Severity: Medium):** Ensures secure deletion.
        *   **Unauthorized Access via Backup (Severity: Medium):** Protects data if backups are compromised (if combined with backup exclusion).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Physical Device Theft/Loss:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Malware with Root Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Data Remnants:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Unauthorized Access via Backup:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Likely partial implementation; full Keystore integration and device-specific key strengthening might be missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Full end-to-end encryption *before* data leaves the device.
        *   Robust key rotation.
        *   Secure wipe with Keystore key deletion.
        *   Device-specific key strengthening.
        *   Zero-knowledge mode.
        *   Key Attestation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure IPC - Intents (Android-Specific Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ipc_-_intents__android-specific_handling_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure IPC - Intents (Android-Specific Handling)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Explicit Intents:** Use explicit Intents for *all* internal communication between app components (Activities, Services, BroadcastReceivers). Specify the target component's class name directly.
        2.  **Intent Filters:** For components exposed to other apps, use Intent Filters, but set `android:exported="false"` in the manifest by default. Only set `android:exported="true"` if absolutely necessary.
        3.  **Permission Checks:** For exported components, implement strict permission checks using `android:permission` in the manifest. Define custom Android permissions if needed.
        4.  **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* data in Intent extras (both explicit and implicit). Sanitize input used in file paths, database queries, or UI display. Assume all Intent data is untrusted.
        5.  **PendingIntents:** Use the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag when creating `PendingIntent` objects to prevent modification by other apps.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Intent Spoofing (Severity: Medium):** Prevents malicious apps from sending fake Intents.
        *   **Intent Interception (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of data interception.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Components (Severity: High):** Prevents access to internal components.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Intent Spoofing:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Intent Interception:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Components:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Likely uses explicit Intents for internal communication; Intent Filters for external interactions. Some input validation is probable.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Comprehensive input validation for *all* Intent extras.
        *   Consistent use of custom permissions.
        *   Consistent use of `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` for `PendingIntent` objects.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure IPC - Content Providers (Android-Specific Controls)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ipc_-_content_providers__android-specific_controls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure IPC - Content Providers (Android-Specific Controls)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Export Control:** Set `android:exported="false"` in the manifest for the Content Provider unless absolutely necessary for external access.
        2.  **Permissions:** If exported, use `android:permission`, `android:readPermission`, and `android:writePermission` to enforce strict access control. Define custom Android permissions.
        3.  **URI Permissions:** Use `grantUriPermissions()` sparingly, granting only temporary access to specific URIs. Revoke permissions immediately after use.
        4.  **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate *all* input received through the Content Provider (query parameters, selection arguments, data). Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize data displayed to the user.
        5. **Path Traversal Prevention:** Ensure file paths cannot be manipulated to access files outside the intended directory.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized access via the Content Provider.
        *   **SQL Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents SQL injection through the Content Provider.
        *   **Path Traversal (Severity: High):** Prevents access to arbitrary files.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Likely has some permission checks; input validation probable, but comprehensiveness needs verification.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `android:exported="false"` might not be the default.
        *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization.
        *   Strict URI permission management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [WebView Security (Android WebView Controls)](./mitigation_strategies/webview_security__android_webview_controls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** WebView Security (Android WebView Controls)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Disable JavaScript:** If not essential, disable it: `webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(false)`.
        2.  **Enable JavaScript (Cautiously):** If required, enable it only after careful consideration.  (Server-side sanitization is crucial, but not Android-specific).
        3.  **Restrict File Access:** `webView.getSettings().setAllowFileAccess(false)`. If needed, use `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(false)` and `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(false)`.
        4.  **Trusted Sources Only:** Load content *only* from the trusted Nextcloud server.
        5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP using `WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest()`.
        6.  **WebViewAssetLoader:** Use `WebViewAssetLoader` for local assets.
        7.  **Update WebView:** Ensure regular WebView updates (system-handled).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Prevents malicious JavaScript injection.
        *   **Local File Access (Severity: High):** Prevents WebView access to sensitive files.
        *   **Loading Malicious Content (Severity: High):** Prevents loading from untrusted sources.

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Obtain Certificate/Public Key:** Get the Nextcloud server's certificate or public key.
        2.  **Implement Pinning:** Use `NetworkSecurityConfig` (recommended) or a custom `TrustManager`. With `NetworkSecurityConfig`, create `network_security_config.xml` and specify the pin. Reference this in the manifest with `android:networkSecurityConfig`.
        3.  **Handle Pinning Failures:** Implement error handling for pinning failures. Do *not* allow the connection.
        4.  **Update Pins:** Plan for pin updates. Consider dynamic updates (with extreme caution).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents interception with forged certificates.
        *   **Certificate Authority Compromise (Severity: High):** Protects against compromised CAs.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Certificate Authority Compromise:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Requires explicit implementation; not a default Android behavior.  Possible, but not certain.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Likely missing if not explicitly implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Obfuscation and Anti-Tampering (Android-Specific Tools)](./mitigation_strategies/code_obfuscation_and_anti-tampering__android-specific_tools_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Code Obfuscation and Anti-Tampering (Android-Specific Tools)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Code Obfuscation:** Use ProGuard or R8 (enabled by default in release builds) to obfuscate code.
        2.  **Root Detection:** Implement root detection (check for su binary, build tags). Warn the user or disable features on rooted devices.
        3.  **Integrity Checks:** Calculate checksums (SHA-256) of critical files (APK, native libraries) and compare to known good values at runtime.
        4.  **SafetyNet Attestation:** Use the SafetyNet Attestation API to verify device integrity and compatibility.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**

        *   **Code Modification/Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Running on Compromised Devices:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Code obfuscation likely enabled for release builds. Root detection and integrity checks less common. SafetyNet Attestation is more advanced.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Robust integrity checks and SafetyNet Attestation often missing.
        *   Root detection might be easily bypassed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Biometric Authentication (Android BiometricPrompt API)](./mitigation_strategies/biometric_authentication__android_biometricprompt_api_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Biometric Authentication (Android BiometricPrompt API)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **BiometricPrompt API:** Use the `BiometricPrompt` API for *all* biometric authentication.
        2.  **Fallback Mechanism:** Always provide a fallback (PIN, password).
        3.  **User Education:** Inform users about biometric security implications.
        4.  **Strong Authentication for Sensitive Operations:** Require a second factor (password) for sensitive actions.
        5.  **Cryptography best practices:** Use `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` to ensure that cryptographic keys are only accessible after the user has authenticated.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Biometric Spoofing (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of bypass.
        *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Medium):** Adds a layer of security.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Two-factor authentication for sensitive operations might be inconsistent.
        *   User education might be insufficient.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Backup and Restore (Android Backup Controls)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_backup_and_restore__android_backup_controls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Backup and Restore (Android Backup Controls)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Backup Control:** Use `android:allowBackup="false"` to disable backups entirely, or use `android:allowBackup="true"` and `android:fullBackupContent="@xml/backup_rules"` to specify what to back up.
        2.  **Exclude Sensitive Data:** Use the `<exclude>` tag in `backup_rules.xml` to exclude sensitive files/directories.
        3.  **Encrypt Backup Data:** If sensitive data *must* be backed up, encrypt it first.
