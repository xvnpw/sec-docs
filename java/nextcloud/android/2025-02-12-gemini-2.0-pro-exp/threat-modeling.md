# Threat Model Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Threat: [Malicious App Impersonation](./threats/malicious_app_impersonation.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious App Impersonation

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates a fake app mimicking the Nextcloud client's UI. The attacker distributes this app through third-party app stores or via sideloading (exploiting Android's ability to install apps from outside the Play Store), tricking users into entering their credentials. The fake app may use a similar name, icon, and UI elements, leveraging Android's UI framework.
    *   **Impact:** User credentials (username, password, potentially 2FA tokens) are stolen. The attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's Nextcloud account and data.
    *   **Affected Android Component:**  `LoginActivity` (or equivalent authentication UI components), potentially deep linking handlers (`<intent-filter>` in `AndroidManifest.xml`).  The attack leverages Android's app installation mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User Education:**  Instruct users to only install the official app from the Google Play Store or F-Droid (verified builds). This leverages the security features of these official app stores.
        *   **Package Name Verification:**  Internally check the app's own package name at runtime to ensure it matches the expected value (using `Context.getPackageName()`).  This is a basic Android API check.
        *   **Code Obfuscation:** Use ProGuard/R8 to make reverse engineering and modification more difficult (Android-specific build tools).
        *   **Unique URL Scheme:** Use a custom, complex URL scheme for deep linking that is hard to replicate, leveraging Android's intent system securely.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on HTTPS (Leveraging Android's Trust Store)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_https__leveraging_android's_trust_store_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on HTTPS (Leveraging Android's Trust Store)

    *   **Description:** An attacker on the same network intercepts the connection.  The attacker presents a fake TLS certificate.  This attack is successful if the user has installed a malicious CA certificate into their Android device's trust store (either intentionally or through malware), or if a system-level CA is compromised. This directly exploits Android's certificate trust mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of all data transmitted, including credentials, files, and metadata.  The attacker could also inject malicious data.
    *   **Affected Android Component:**  Network communication stack (`HttpURLConnection`, `OkHttp`, or any other networking library used), Android's TLS/SSL implementation, and *specifically* the Android system's trust store (where CA certificates are managed).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict HTTPS Enforcement:**  Ensure *all* communication is over HTTPS, with no fallback to HTTP.
        *   **Certificate Pinning (with caveats):** Pin the server's certificate (or an intermediate CA) in the app.  Use `NetworkSecurityConfig` (an Android-specific feature) to manage pinning.  Be aware of the limitations on user-installed CAs, which can override pins on Android.
        *   **Network Security Configuration:**  Use `NetworkSecurityConfig` to enforce strict HTTPS policies, disable cleartext traffic, and control certificate trust (all Android-specific configuration).
        * **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Ensure the Nextcloud server uses HSTS.

## Threat: [APK Tampering and Redistribution (Exploiting Android's App Installation)](./threats/apk_tampering_and_redistribution__exploiting_android's_app_installation_.md)

*   **Threat:**  APK Tampering and Redistribution (Exploiting Android's App Installation)

    *   **Description:** An attacker decompiles the official Nextcloud APK (using Android-specific tools like `apktool`), modifies the code, recompiles it (again, using Android build tools), and redistributes the modified app, bypassing the Play Store's security checks. This directly targets the Android application package format and installation process.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the app's security.  The attacker could steal data, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Android Component:**  Entire APK; specifically, any modified code (e.g., `smali` code after decompilation). The attack targets the integrity of the Android application package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code Obfuscation:**  Use ProGuard/R8 (Android build tools) to make reverse engineering significantly harder.
        *   **Runtime Integrity Checks:**  Implement checks to detect if the app's code has been modified (e.g., comparing checksums of DEX files).  These checks can be bypassed, but they raise the bar.
        *   **SafetyNet Attestation/Play Integrity API:** Use these Android-specific APIs (with awareness of their limitations) to verify device and app integrity.
        * **Root Detection:** Detect rooted devices (using Android APIs) and warn the user or limit functionality.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Storage (Internal Storage - Exploiting Root Access)](./threats/insecure_data_storage__internal_storage_-_exploiting_root_access_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Insecure Data Storage (Internal Storage - Exploiting Root Access)

    *   **Description:**  The app stores sensitive data in internal storage *without encryption*. While internal storage is generally protected, an attacker with *root access* on the Android device (or a device with a compromised OS) can directly access these files. This exploits the elevated privileges available on a rooted Android device.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data stored on the device.
    *   **Affected Android Component:**  File I/O operations (`FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`, `SharedPreferences`, SQLite database), specifically targeting the app's private data directory within the Android file system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`EncryptedSharedPreferences`:**  Use `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (an Android-specific API) for storing sensitive key-value pairs.
        *   **`EncryptedFile`:**  Use `EncryptedFile` (an Android-specific API) for encrypting files stored in internal storage.
        *   **SQLCipher:**  Use SQLCipher to encrypt the app's SQLite database (integrating with Android's database framework).
        *   **Android Keystore System:**  Use the Android Keystore system to securely store cryptographic keys (a core Android security feature).

## Threat: [Insecure Data Storage (External Storage - Exploiting Permissions)](./threats/insecure_data_storage__external_storage_-_exploiting_permissions_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Insecure Data Storage (External Storage - Exploiting Permissions)

    *   **Description:** The app stores sensitive data in *external storage* without adequate protection.  Other apps with the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions (which are broad and often granted) can access this data. This directly exploits Android's permission model.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to other apps.
    *   **Affected Android Component:** File I/O operations targeting external storage (`getExternalFilesDir`, etc.), relying on Android's storage permission model.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prefer Internal Storage:**  Store sensitive data in internal storage whenever possible.
        *   **Scoped Storage:**  Use scoped storage (introduced in Android 10) to limit access to specific directories, a key Android storage management feature.
        *   **Encryption:**  If external storage *must* be used, encrypt the data using `EncryptedFile` or a similar mechanism, combined with Android's file access controls.
        *   **Minimal Permissions:** Request only the necessary storage permissions, adhering to the principle of least privilege within the Android permission system.

## Threat: [Insecure Logging (to Logcat)](./threats/insecure_logging__to_logcat_.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Logging (to Logcat)
    * **Description:** The application logs sensitive information, such as user credentials, session tokens, or personal data, to the system logs (Logcat). Other applications on the device with the `READ_LOGS` permission (although deprecated, still a potential risk on older devices or with legacy apps) can access this information. This directly leverages (or misuses) Android's logging system.
    * **Impact:** Sensitive information is exposed to other applications.
    * **Affected Android Component:** `android.util.Log` (Logcat), Android's system logging mechanism.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:** Never log credentials, tokens, or PII to Logcat.
        * **Use ProGuard/R8:** Configure ProGuard/R8 to remove `Log` calls in release builds (an Android build tool feature).
        * **Conditional Logging:** Use conditional compilation or build flags to disable logging in release builds.
        * **Custom Log Levels:** Create custom log levels that are less verbose than `DEBUG` and `VERBOSE` for production.
