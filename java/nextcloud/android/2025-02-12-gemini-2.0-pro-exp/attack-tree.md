## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Local Application Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_local_application_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1.1.1 Unencrypted Storage of Sensitive Data (API Keys, Session Tokens, User Credentials) on Device [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The application stores sensitive data like API keys, session tokens, or even user credentials in plain text on the device's storage (e.g., SharedPreferences, SQLite database, files).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if best practices are followed) / Medium (if not)
    *   **Impact:** High (direct access to user accounts)
    *   **Effort:** Low (if unencrypted) / Medium (if poorly encrypted)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (if unencrypted) / Intermediate (if poorly encrypted)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (unless specific monitoring is in place)
    *   **Mitigation:** Use Android Keystore, EncryptedSharedPreferences, and strong encryption for all sensitive data.

*   **1.1.1.3 Data Leakage via Logs (Logcat) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** The application inadvertently logs sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens, personal data) to the system log (Logcat), which can be accessed by other applications or through debugging tools.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common mistake)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depending on what's logged)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires log analysis)
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid logging sensitive data; use different log levels and disable sensitive logging in production.

*   **1.1.3.1 WebView-based JavaScript Interface Exploits (if applicable) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** If the application uses WebViews with JavaScript interfaces, vulnerabilities in the interface or improper handling of user input can allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to arbitrary code execution within the app's context.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if WebViews are avoided or properly secured) / High (if poorly implemented)
    *   **Impact:** High (arbitrary code execution)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires dynamic analysis and code review)
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid WebViews if possible; if necessary, disable JavaScript by default, carefully sanitize input, and use `addJavascriptInterface` with extreme caution.

*   **1.1.3.2 Native Code Injection (via JNI vulnerabilities, if native code is used) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** If the application uses native code (C/C++), vulnerabilities in the native code or the Java Native Interface (JNI) can allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary native code, potentially bypassing all Java-level security mechanisms.
    *   **Likelihood:** Very Low (requires a significant vulnerability in native code)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (arbitrary code execution at native level)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (requires advanced debugging and reverse engineering)
    *   **Mitigation:** Use memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust) if possible; follow secure coding practices for C/C++; perform thorough code reviews and penetration testing.

*   **1.1.5.2 Repackaging with Malicious Code (Trojanized App) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker decompiles the application, adds malicious code, and then repackages and resigns the app.  They then distribute this trojanized app through unofficial channels (e.g., third-party app stores, phishing websites).
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (requires distribution of modified app)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete control of the app)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires comparing app signature with official version)
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement code signing verification; use tamper-detection techniques; educate users to download only from trusted sources.

*   **1.1.5.3 Runtime Manipulation (e.g., using Frida, Xposed) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker uses tools like Frida or Xposed Framework on a rooted device to hook into the application's runtime, modify its behavior, bypass security checks, and access or modify data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (requires rooted device)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (can bypass security checks, modify data)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires anti-tampering mechanisms)
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement root detection; use SafetyNet Attestation API; implement anti-debugging and anti-tampering techniques.

*   **1.2.1 Unlocked Device Access [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains physical access to an unlocked device.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on user behavior)
    *   **Impact:** High (full access to device and apps)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (if observed)
    *   **Mitigation:** Encourage users to use strong device lock screen security; implement data wiping after multiple failed unlock attempts (if appropriate).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Network Communication [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_network_communication__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack [HIGH RISK]** (General description, as sub-nodes are not all high-risk)
    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between the Nextcloud Android app and the Nextcloud server. This can be done through various techniques like ARP spoofing, rogue access points, or DNS spoofing.
    * **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS; implement certificate pinning.

*   **2.1.4 Certificate Pinning Bypass (if pinning is implemented, but flawed) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** If the application implements certificate pinning (a security measure to prevent MitM attacks), but the implementation is flawed, an attacker can bypass the pinning and successfully perform a MitM attack.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a flaw in the pinning implementation)
    *   **Impact:** High (allows MitM attacks)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires analyzing the pinning implementation)
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly test and review the certificate pinning implementation; use well-vetted libraries for pinning.

*   **2.2.1 Unencrypted HTTP Traffic (if HTTPS fails or is misconfigured) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The application communicates with the server using unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS, or HTTPS is misconfigured (e.g., weak ciphers, expired certificates), allowing an attacker to intercept and read the traffic.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be caught by basic testing)
    *   **Impact:** High (can intercept all traffic)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (visible in network traffic)
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication; use strong TLS configurations; regularly check for certificate validity.
