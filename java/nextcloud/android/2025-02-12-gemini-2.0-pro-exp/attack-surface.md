# Attack Surface Analysis for nextcloud/android

## Attack Surface: [Intent Spoofing/Injection](./attack_surfaces/intent_spoofinginjection.md)

*Description:* Malicious apps craft and send Intents to the Nextcloud app to trigger unintended actions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.
*Android Contribution:* Android's Intent system, designed for inter-app communication, is inherently open. Any app can send an Intent to any other app (unless explicitly restricted). This is a core Android feature.
*Example:* A malicious app sends an Intent mimicking a legitimate file-sharing Intent, causing the Nextcloud app to upload a sensitive file to the attacker's server instead of the intended recipient.
*Impact:* Data leakage, unauthorized file access, modification of app settings, denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Use explicit Intents (specifying the target component) whenever possible. Rigorously validate *all* incoming Intent data (extras, data URIs, actions). Implement strong permission checks for sensitive actions triggered by Intents. Use `PendingIntent` with `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` and `FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT`.
    *   *Users:* Be cautious about installing apps from untrusted sources. Review app permissions carefully.

## Attack Surface: [Content Provider Leaks](./attack_surfaces/content_provider_leaks.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in the Nextcloud app's Content Provider implementation allow other apps to access sensitive data without authorization.
*Android Contribution:* Android's Content Provider mechanism is a core Android component specifically designed for data sharing *between applications*. Incorrectly configured permissions or input validation flaws directly leverage this Android feature to expose data.
*Example:* A malicious app queries a vulnerable Content Provider in the Nextcloud app to retrieve a list of all files and their metadata, including sensitive documents.
*Impact:* Data leakage (files, metadata, account information).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Minimize Content Provider usage. If necessary, enforce *strict* permissions (`android:permission`, `android:readPermission`, `android:writePermission`). Thoroughly validate *all* input to Content Provider methods (query, insert, update, delete). Use `FileProvider` for secure file sharing.
    *   *Users:* Review app permissions. Be wary of apps requesting broad access to data.

## Attack Surface: [WebView Vulnerabilities (if used)](./attack_surfaces/webview_vulnerabilities__if_used_.md)

*Description:* If WebViews are used, vulnerabilities like XSS or insecure configurations can lead to data leakage or code execution.
*Android Contribution:* Android's `WebView` component is a built-in Android feature that acts as an embedded browser.  Its security is directly tied to Android's implementation and configuration.
*Example:* The Nextcloud app uses a WebView to display a help page. A vulnerability in the help page's HTML/JavaScript allows an attacker to inject malicious code that steals the user's Nextcloud session cookie.
*Impact:* Data leakage, session hijacking, potentially arbitrary code execution.
*Risk Severity:* High (if JavaScript is enabled and untrusted content is loaded)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Enable JavaScript *only* if absolutely necessary. Use `setAllowFileAccess(false)`. Load content *only* from trusted sources. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP). Use `WebViewClient` and `WebChromeClient` securely. Keep WebView updated (via Android System WebView updates).
    *   *Users:* Keep the Android System WebView component updated via Google Play.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Biometric Authentication (if used)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_biometric_authentication__if_used_.md)

*Description:* Weak biometric implementation can be bypassed, leading to unauthorized access.
*Android Contribution:* Android provides a Biometric API, but the security depends on the *correct implementation* of this Android-provided API and the underlying hardware/software.  This is a direct use of an Android security feature.
*Example:* The Nextcloud app uses fingerprint authentication, but a poorly implemented check allows an attacker to bypass it using a spoofed fingerprint.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to the app and its data.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   *Developers:* Use the AndroidX Biometric library for a consistent and secure implementation. Follow best practices for biometric authentication. Require a strong fallback authentication method (PIN, password, etc.).
    *   *Users:* Use strong biometric settings (if available). Be aware of the limitations of biometric authentication.
