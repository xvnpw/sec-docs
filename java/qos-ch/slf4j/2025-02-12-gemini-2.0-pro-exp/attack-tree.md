## Attack Tree Path: [1. Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/1__information_disclosure.md)

*   **1.1.2. Sensitive data logged unintentionally [HIGH-RISK]:**

    *   **Description:** Developers inadvertently include sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal data) in log messages due to poor coding practices or lack of awareness.
    *   **1.1.2.1. Attacker gains access to log files [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker obtains access to the log files where the sensitive data is stored. This could be through various means:
            *   Direct file system access (if the application or server is compromised).
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow reading arbitrary files.
            *   Accessing exposed log files (e.g., misconfigured web server exposing log directories).
            *   Intercepting unencrypted log data sent over the network.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low to Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Vulnerable Logging Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__vulnerable_logging_implementation.md)

    *   **1.2.1. Exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4Shell) [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker leverages a known vulnerability in the specific logging implementation used by the application (e.g., Log4j2, Logback).  Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) is a prime example.
        *   **1.2.1.1. Attacker crafts malicious input leading to information disclosure [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker sends specially crafted input to the application, which is then processed by the vulnerable logging library. This input triggers the vulnerability, causing the application to leak sensitive information.  For example, in Log4Shell, a malicious JNDI lookup string could be used to retrieve and execute code from a remote server, potentially leaking environment variables or other data.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** High to Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
    *   **1.2.2. Exploit configuration vulnerabilities:**
        *   **1.2.2.1 Attacker manipulates configuration files [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker gains write access to the logging configuration file (e.g., `log4j2.xml`, `logback.xml`). They modify the configuration to redirect log output to a location they control (e.g., a remote server, a different file).
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **3.1. Vulnerable Logging Implementation [HIGH-RISK]:**

    *   **3.1.1. Exploit known RCE vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4Shell) [HIGH-RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Similar to 1.2.1, but the exploited vulnerability allows for *code execution* rather than just information disclosure.
        *   **3.1.1.1. Attacker crafts malicious input leading to code execution [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker sends crafted input that triggers the RCE vulnerability.  In the case of Log4Shell, this was a JNDI lookup string that caused the vulnerable Log4j2 library to fetch and execute code from a remote server controlled by the attacker. This gives the attacker full control over the application and potentially the underlying server.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Low to High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
    *   **3.1.2. Exploit deserialization vulnerabilities:**
        *   **3.1.2.1. Attacker sends malicious serialized objects [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** If the logging implementation or a component it uses is vulnerable to insecure deserialization, an attacker can send a specially crafted serialized object. When this object is deserialized, it executes malicious code. This is a less common attack vector than exploiting vulnerabilities like Log4Shell, but it can be equally devastating.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High
            *   **Skill Level:** High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

*   **3.2. Configuration File Manipulation:**

    *   **3.2.1. Attacker modifies logging configuration:**
        *   **3.2.1.1. Attacker gains write access and injects malicious configuration [CRITICAL]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker gains write access to the logging configuration file. They modify the configuration to load a malicious logging appender or layout. This malicious component would then execute arbitrary code when log messages are processed. This requires a significant prior compromise (gaining write access to the configuration file).
            *   **Likelihood:** Low
            *   **Impact:** Very High
            *   **Effort:** High
            *   **Skill Level:** High
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
