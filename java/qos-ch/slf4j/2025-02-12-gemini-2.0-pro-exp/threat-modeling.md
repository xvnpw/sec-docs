## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to log files. The attacker then scans the logs for sensitive information that was inadvertently included by developers *through their use of SLF4J logging calls*. This is the core issue: developers are using SLF4J to log sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of PII, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, or reputational damage.
        *   Compromise of authentication credentials.
        *   Disclosure of internal system details.
        *   Violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **SLF4J Component Affected:**
        *   The application code that uses SLF4J's API (e.g., `Logger.info()`, `Logger.error()`, etc.). The vulnerability exists because developers are passing sensitive data as arguments to these methods. The underlying logging implementation's appenders then write this data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Masking/Sanitization:** Implement robust data masking *before* data is passed to SLF4J methods. This could involve custom wrapper classes around SLF4J or pre-processing of data.  Configuration-based masking in the logging implementation is a *secondary* defense, as it relies on correct configuration. The *primary* defense is to never pass sensitive data to SLF4J in the first place.
        *   **Strict Logging Policies and Developer Training:** Enforce strict guidelines and provide training on what *cannot* be logged.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews to specifically check for logging of sensitive data *before* it reaches SLF4J calls.
        *   **Automated Scanning:** Use static analysis tools to detect potential logging of sensitive data during development, focusing on calls to SLF4J methods.
        *   **Parameterized Logging:** Strictly enforce parameterized logging. This makes it easier to identify and potentially mask sensitive data *before* it's passed to the logging framework.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Log Flooding (Indirect, but related to SLF4J usage)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_log_flooding__indirect__but_related_to_slf4j_usage_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Log Flooding (Indirect, but related to SLF4J usage)

    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers a large volume of log messages *through the application's use of SLF4J*. While the underlying implementation handles the writing, the application's code, using SLF4J, is the source of the flood. This could be due to a bug exploited by the attacker or intentional malicious requests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Disk space exhaustion.
        *   I/O bottlenecks.
        *   Potential CPU overhead.
        *   Increased costs (cloud logging).
    *   **SLF4J Component Affected:**
        *   The application code that uses SLF4J's API. The vulnerability is that the application, *through its use of SLF4J*, generates an excessive volume of log messages. The underlying implementation is the *target* of the flood, but the *source* is the application's SLF4J usage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Appropriate Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels in production. Avoid DEBUG/TRACE.
        *   **Asynchronous Logging:** Use asynchronous appenders (in the underlying implementation). This doesn't prevent the flood *generation*, but it mitigates the impact on the application's main thread.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Advanced):** If the underlying logging implementation supports it, configure rate limiting. This is a mitigation at the *implementation* level, but it addresses the flood *caused by* the application's SLF4J usage.
        *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all user input to prevent malicious data from triggering excessive logging *through SLF4J calls*.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor disk space, I/O, and log volume.
