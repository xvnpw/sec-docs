# Threat Model Analysis for qos-ch/logback

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via JNDI Lookup (CVE-2021-44228 and similar)](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_jndi_lookup__cve-2021-44228_and_similar_.md)

*   **Description:** If Logback's configuration allows for JNDI lookups and an attacker can control the lookup string, they could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a critical vulnerability similar to the Log4Shell vulnerability in Log4j.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, steal data, install malware, or pivot to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `XMLConfigurator` or programmatic configuration - where JNDI lookups might be defined.
        *   Potentially `Appenders` that utilize JNDI for resource lookups (e.g., database connections).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately update Logback to the latest version that mitigates this vulnerability.**
        *   Disable or restrict JNDI lookups in Logback configuration.
        *   If JNDI lookups are necessary, ensure that the lookup strings are not influenced by user input or untrusted sources.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Logback Configuration](./threats/manipulation_of_logback_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the Logback configuration file (e.g., `logback.xml`) could modify it to redirect logs to a malicious server, disable logging, or introduce other malicious configurations. This directly leverages Logback's configuration mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of audit trails, information disclosure to an attacker-controlled destination, or disruption of logging functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `XMLConfigurator` or programmatic configuration mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to Logback configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Store configuration files in secure locations.
        *   Implement integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications to the configuration file.
        *   Avoid loading configuration files from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_logs.md)

*   **Description:** Logback might be configured to log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) directly into log files or other destinations. This is a direct consequence of how Logback is used and configured.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential for identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory non-compliance.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `Appenders` (e.g., `FileAppender`, `JDBCAppender`, `SocketAppender`) - responsible for writing log events to various destinations.
        *   `Layouts` (e.g., `PatternLayout`) - responsible for formatting log messages, potentially including sensitive data.
        *   `Logger` - the component through which sensitive data might be logged.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict logging policies to avoid logging sensitive data.
        *   Sanitize log messages to remove or mask sensitive information before logging.
        *   Encrypt log data at rest and in transit.
        *   Secure log storage locations with appropriate access controls and permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit log configurations and content.
