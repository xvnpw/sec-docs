# Attack Surface Analysis for qos-ch/logback

## Attack Surface: [External Entity Injection (XXE) via Logback Configuration](./attack_surfaces/external_entity_injection__xxe__via_logback_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious external entities into Logback's XML configuration files (e.g., `logback.xml`). When Logback parses this configuration, it might fetch and process these external entities.
    *   **How Logback Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Logback uses an XML parser to read its configuration files. If this parser is not configured to prevent external entity resolution, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `logback.xml` file (if accessible) or provides a malicious configuration through a vulnerable endpoint, including an entity like `<!DOCTYPE logback [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]> <configuration><appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender"><file>&xxe;</file><encoder><pattern>%msg%n</pattern></encoder></appender><root level="INFO"><appender-ref ref="FILE"/></root></configuration>`. This could lead to reading the `/etc/passwd` file.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files), denial of service, and potentially remote code execution depending on the system's setup and available libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable external entity resolution in the XML parser: Configure the XML parser used by Logback to disallow processing of external entities. This is often done by setting specific parser features.
        *   Restrict access to Logback configuration files: Ensure that only authorized users can modify the `logback.xml` or related configuration files.
        *   Validate and sanitize configuration input: If the configuration is loaded from external sources, rigorously validate and sanitize the input to prevent malicious entities.

## Attack Surface: [File Appender Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/file_appender_path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** If the filename or directory specified for a `FileAppender` is derived from user input or an untrusted source without proper sanitization, an attacker can manipulate the path to write log files to arbitrary locations.
    *   **How Logback Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `FileAppender` allows specifying the output file path. If this path is dynamically constructed based on external input, it becomes a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An application logs user actions, and the log filename includes the username. If the username is not sanitized, an attacker could provide a username like `../../../../tmp/malicious.log`, causing the application to write logs to the `/tmp` directory.
    *   **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, writing malicious scripts to accessible locations, denial of service (filling up disk space).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user input directly in file paths:  Do not directly incorporate user-provided data into the filename or directory path for `FileAppenders`.
        *   Sanitize and validate file paths: If user input must be used, rigorously sanitize and validate the input to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
        *   Use absolute paths or relative paths within a controlled directory: Configure `FileAppenders` to write to specific, controlled directories using absolute paths or relative paths within a designated log directory.

## Attack Surface: [SMTP Appender Information Disclosure](./attack_surfaces/smtp_appender_information_disclosure.md)

*   **Description:** If the connection between the application and the SMTP server used by the `SMTPAppender` is not encrypted (e.g., using TLS/SSL), attackers on the network can intercept log emails containing sensitive information.
    *   **How Logback Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `SMTPAppender` sends log messages via email. If the connection is not secured, the content is transmitted in plaintext.
    *   **Example:** An application logs error details, including potentially sensitive data, and sends these logs via email using an `SMTPAppender` without TLS enabled. An attacker on the network can capture these emails and read the sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data or user information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/SSL for SMTP connections: Configure the `SMTPAppender` to use a secure connection (TLS/SSL) to the SMTP server.
        *   Review the content being logged: Ensure that sensitive information is not being logged unnecessarily or is properly redacted before being sent via email.
        *   Secure the SMTP server: Ensure the SMTP server itself is properly secured and only allows authorized connections.

## Attack Surface: [Database Appender SQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/database_appender_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the SQL statements used by a `DBAppender` are constructed using string concatenation with data from log events without proper parameterization, the application can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
    *   **How Logback Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `DBAppender` allows writing log data to a database. If the SQL queries are not constructed securely, it introduces a risk.
    *   **Example:** A `DBAppender` inserts log messages into a database table. If the log message contains malicious SQL code and is directly inserted into the query without parameterization, it could execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive database information), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for privilege escalation or remote code execution depending on database permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries: Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database from the `DBAppender`. This prevents malicious SQL code from being interpreted as part of the query structure.
        *   Sanitize log input (as a secondary measure): While parameterization is the primary defense, consider sanitizing log input to remove potentially harmful characters before logging to the database.
        *   Principle of least privilege for database user: Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions for logging and not broader administrative rights.

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage through Logged Data](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage_through_logged_data.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) in log messages, making it accessible in log files or through remote logging destinations.
    *   **How Logback Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Logback faithfully records the data it is instructed to log. It's the responsibility of the developers to ensure sensitive data is not logged.
    *   **Example:** An application logs the request body, which contains a user's password in plaintext, to a file appender. This password is now stored in the log file.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive user or application data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review logging statements: Regularly review logging statements to identify and remove any instances where sensitive information is being logged.
        *   Redact or mask sensitive data: Implement mechanisms to redact or mask sensitive data before it is logged. This could involve replacing sensitive parts of strings with placeholders or using one-way hashing.
        *   Control access to log files: Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access log files.
        *   Consider structured logging:** Using structured logging formats can make it easier to selectively exclude or mask sensitive fields.
