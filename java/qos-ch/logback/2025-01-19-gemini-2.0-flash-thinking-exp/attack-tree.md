## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Logback [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_logback__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successfully exploiting vulnerabilities within Logback allows the attacker to compromise the application's security, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or complete system control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Logging Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_logging_configuration__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on manipulating Logback's configuration to introduce malicious elements or alter its behavior for the attacker's benefit. Gaining control over the logging configuration is a critical step as it can enable various high-impact attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Configuration Elements](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_configuration_elements.md)

This step involves inserting harmful content into the Logback configuration. This could be done by directly modifying the configuration file (if access is gained) or by exploiting mechanisms that dynamically load or process configuration data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject JNDI Lookup Strings (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_jndi_lookup_strings__or_.md)

Logback allows the use of JNDI lookups within its configuration. Attackers can inject malicious JNDI URIs that, when resolved by the application, can lead to the download and execution of arbitrary code from a remote server. This is a critical vulnerability similar to the infamous Log4Shell.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Remote Code Execution via JNDI](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__trigger_remote_code_execution_via_jndi.md)

This is the direct consequence of successfully injecting a malicious JNDI lookup string. When Logback attempts to resolve this string, it connects to the attacker's server, downloads malicious code, and executes it within the application's context, granting the attacker full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Configure File Appender with Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__configure_file_appender_with_path_traversal.md)

By manipulating the configuration of file appenders, an attacker can specify arbitrary file paths for log output. This allows them to write log data to locations outside the intended log directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Overwrite Sensitive Files](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__overwrite_sensitive_files.md)

A successful path traversal attack on a file appender can be used to overwrite critical system files, configuration files, or even web application files. This can lead to complete system compromise, denial of service, or the injection of malicious code into the application's webroot.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Command Injection via Logged Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_command_injection_via_logged_data.md)

This path involves injecting malicious commands into log messages and then exploiting a vulnerability where this logged data is subsequently used in a system call or executed as a command.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Log Data Used in System Calls or Executables](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__log_data_used_in_system_calls_or_executables.md)

This critical node highlights the dangerous practice of directly using data from log messages in system commands or when executing external programs. If an attacker can control the content of the log message, they can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed by the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit SQL Injection via Logged Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_sql_injection_via_logged_data.md)

Similar to command injection, this path focuses on injecting malicious SQL code into log messages and then exploiting a vulnerability where this logged data is used to construct database queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Log Data Used in Database Queries](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__log_data_used_in_database_queries.md)

This critical node highlights the risky practice of using log data directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization. An attacker who can inject malicious SQL code into the logs can then manipulate or extract data from the application's database.
