## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Logging (SLF4J Style)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_logging__slf4j_style_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterized Logging (SLF4J Style)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize SLF4J API with Logback:** Ensure your application uses the SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) API for logging, which Logback natively implements.
    2.  **Employ Placeholders in Log Messages:**  Instead of constructing log messages using string concatenation or `String.format()` when including variable data, use placeholders (`{}`) within the log message string.
    3.  **Pass Variables as Arguments to Logging Methods:**  Provide the variable data as separate arguments to the logging methods (e.g., `logger.info("User {} logged in", username);`). Logback, through SLF4J, handles the substitution safely, preventing interpretation of variables as part of the log message structure.
    4.  **Enforce Parameterized Logging in Code Reviews:**  Establish parameterized logging as a mandatory practice during code reviews to ensure consistent and secure logging across the project.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection (High Severity):**  Significantly reduces the risk of log injection by treating variable data as data, not code, within log messages. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious commands or manipulating log structure through user-controlled input.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection:** High reduction in risk. Parameterized logging is a highly effective defense against common log injection vulnerabilities exploitable through log messages.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Parameterized logging is used in **newly developed modules** and by developers aware of the best practice. However, older modules and some developers still occasionally use string concatenation in logging statements.
    *   **Location:** New modules and services developed in the last year generally adhere to parameterized logging.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refactor legacy modules and older services to consistently use parameterized logging.
    *   Create and enforce a project-wide coding standard mandating parameterized logging for all log messages.
    *   Integrate automated code analysis tools to detect and flag instances of string concatenation or `String.format()` used in logging statements, encouraging migration to parameterized logging.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Level Management (Logback Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/log_level_management__logback_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Log Level Management (Logback Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Root Logger Level in `logback.xml`:**  Set the root logger level in your `logback.xml` (or `logback-spring.xml` for Spring Boot) configuration file to control the verbosity of logging output.
    2.  **Choose Appropriate Production Log Level:**  Select a suitable log level for production environments. `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` are generally recommended to minimize log volume and performance overhead in production. Avoid overly verbose levels like `DEBUG` or `TRACE` in production unless strictly necessary for temporary debugging.
    3.  **Utilize Environment-Specific Logback Configurations:** Employ environment profiles or configuration management to deploy different `logback.xml` configurations for development, staging, and production environments. Development and staging can use more verbose levels (DEBUG, TRACE) for detailed debugging, while production remains at a less verbose level.
    4.  **Dynamically Adjust Log Levels (JMX or Spring Boot Actuator):**  Leverage Logback's JMX support or Spring Boot Actuator's log level management endpoints to dynamically adjust log levels at runtime for troubleshooting purposes without requiring application restarts. Ensure these management interfaces are securely accessed and controlled.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Optimize Log Levels:** Periodically review the configured log levels in `logback.xml` to ensure they remain appropriate for operational needs and security considerations. Optimize log levels to balance sufficient logging for monitoring and troubleshooting with minimizing log volume and potential information disclosure.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Logging (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks by controlling the volume of logs generated, especially in production, preventing resource exhaustion due to excessive logging output.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Logs (Low Severity):**  Indirectly minimizes the risk of accidental information disclosure by limiting the amount of potentially sensitive data logged, particularly at verbose levels like `DEBUG` or `TRACE` in production.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Excessive Logging:** Medium reduction in risk.  Effectively manages log volume, mitigating DoS potential from uncontrolled logging.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low reduction in risk. Reduces the likelihood of unintentionally logging sensitive debug information in production environments.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Production environment `logback.xml` is configured to `INFO` level. However, **development and staging environments often retain `DEBUG` or `TRACE` levels even when not actively debugging**, and dynamic log level adjustment mechanisms are **not consistently used or secured**.
    *   **Location:** Production `logback.xml` configuration sets root level to `INFO`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement environment-specific `logback.xml` configurations to ensure appropriate log levels are automatically applied in each environment (development, staging, production).
    *   Establish guidelines and training for developers on the appropriate use of log levels in different environments and the importance of reverting to production levels after debugging in non-production environments.
    *   Explore and implement secure dynamic log level adjustment mechanisms (e.g., JMX with authentication, secured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints) for controlled runtime log level management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Log Rotation and Archiving (Logback Appenders)](./mitigation_strategies/log_rotation_and_archiving__logback_appenders_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Log Rotation and Archiving (Logback Appenders)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rolling File Appenders in `logback.xml`:** Utilize Logback's `RollingFileAppender` in `logback.xml` to enable automatic log rotation.
    2.  **Define Rotation Policies:** Configure rotation policies within the `RollingFileAppender` using `<rollingPolicy>` elements. Common policies include:
        *   **TimeBasedRollingPolicy:** Rotate logs based on time intervals (e.g., daily, monthly). Configure file naming patterns with date/time components for rotated files.
        *   **SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy:** Rotate logs when they reach a specified size limit.
        *   **Composite Policies:** Combine time and size-based policies for more granular control.
    3.  **Implement Archiving with `<timeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy>`:** Within `TimeBasedRollingPolicy`, configure archiving behavior. Specify an archive directory and file compression settings (e.g., zip, gzip) to compress and move rotated log files to the archive location.
    4.  **Define Retention Policies with `<maxHistory>`:** Use the `<maxHistory>` element within the rolling policy to specify the maximum number of archived log files to retain. Logback will automatically delete older archived files when this limit is reached, enforcing a log retention policy.
    5.  **Monitor Log Rotation and Disk Usage:** Regularly monitor log rotation processes and disk space usage for log partitions to ensure rotation and archiving are functioning correctly and preventing disk exhaustion. Set up alerts for potential issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Logging (Medium Severity):** Prevents disk space exhaustion caused by uncontrolled log file growth, mitigating DoS risks associated with logging.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Logs (Low Severity):**  Indirectly aids in managing information disclosure by controlling the lifecycle of readily accessible logs and moving older logs to archives, potentially with different security considerations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Excessive Logging:** Medium reduction in risk. Log rotation and archiving are crucial for preventing disk exhaustion and maintaining system stability in the face of continuous logging.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Low reduction in risk. Helps manage the lifespan and accessibility of log data over time.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. **Basic time-based log rotation is configured using `RollingFileAppender`**, but **archiving to a separate directory and compression are not implemented**. Log retention is implicitly managed by disk space limits rather than a defined `<maxHistory>` policy. Disk usage monitoring is **manual and infrequent**.
    *   **Location:** `logback.xml` configuration uses `RollingFileAppender` with time-based rotation, but lacks archiving and explicit retention policies.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enhance `RollingFileAppender` configuration in `logback.xml` to include archiving of rotated logs to a dedicated archive directory.
    *   Implement compression for archived log files (e.g., using gzip) to save storage space.
    *   Define and configure a `<maxHistory>` policy within the `RollingFileAppender`'s rolling policy to enforce a clear log retention policy and automate the deletion of older archived logs.
    *   Automate disk usage monitoring for log partitions and configure alerts to proactively detect potential disk space issues related to log files.
