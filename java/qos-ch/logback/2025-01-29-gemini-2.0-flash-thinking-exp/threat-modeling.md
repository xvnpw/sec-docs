# Threat Model Analysis for qos-ch/logback

## Threat: [Accidental Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/accidental_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain access to log files and discover sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.) that was unintentionally logged by the application. This occurs when developers are not careful about what data they log and how they format log messages.
**Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach, Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
**Logback Component Affected:** Logging patterns, Encoders, Layouts, Application Code using Logback API.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and refine logging patterns to prevent logging sensitive data.
* Implement data masking or redaction techniques before logging sensitive information.
* Store log files in secure locations with restricted access controls.
* Conduct regular log reviews to identify and rectify instances of sensitive data logging.
* Adhere to the principle of least privilege logging, logging only necessary information.

## Threat: [Log Injection/Flooding leading to Resource Exhaustion](./threats/log_injectionflooding_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit an application vulnerability or directly inject a large volume of malicious log messages. This can flood log files, consume excessive disk space, overload the system with logging operations, and potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
**Impact:** Denial of Service, System instability, Performance degradation, Disk space exhaustion.
**Logback Component Affected:** Appenders (especially File Appenders), Logging Levels, Application Code accepting user input logged by Logback.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any user inputs included in log messages.
* Implement rate limiting for logging, especially for specific loggers or events.
* Configure log rotation and archiving to prevent disk space exhaustion.
* Monitor system resources (CPU, disk I/O, disk space) related to logging.
* Secure network appenders with authentication and encryption if used.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Logback Configuration Parsing](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_logback_configuration_parsing.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Logback's configuration parsing (e.g., XML parsing) could potentially be exploited by an attacker who can modify or control the logback configuration file. This could lead to code injection or other malicious actions.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), System compromise, Privilege escalation.
**Logback Component Affected:** Logback Configuration Files (logback.xml, logback-spring.xml), XML Parsing Libraries.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Logback updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Securely store logback configuration files and restrict write access to authorized users only.
* Prefer static configuration files over dynamic or user-provided configurations.
* Regularly scan dependencies, including Logback, for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Appenders or Layouts](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_appenders_or_layouts.md)

**Description:** If developers create custom Logback appenders or layouts, vulnerabilities in this custom code could be introduced. An attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities could potentially achieve code injection, information disclosure, or other malicious outcomes.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, System compromise, Denial of Service.
**Logback Component Affected:** Custom Appenders, Custom Layouts.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom appenders and layouts.
* Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of custom components.
* Minimize the use of custom components and prefer built-in Logback features whenever possible.
