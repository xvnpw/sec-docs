# Attack Surface Analysis for qos-ch/logback

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration via External Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_via_external_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious configurations into Logback's configuration files (e.g., `logback.xml`, `logback-test.xml`) if they gain write access to these files or if the application loads configuration from an untrusted source.

**How Logback Contributes:** Logback parses these XML files to define logging behavior, including appenders and their configurations. This allows for defining actions beyond simple logging.

**Example:** An attacker modifies `logback.xml` to include a `ch.qos.logback.core.net.server.ServerSocketReceiver` appender configured with a vulnerable deserialization gadget, leading to remote code execution when Logback initializes.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict write access to Logback configuration files to only necessary users/processes.
*   Ensure the application loads configuration files from trusted locations only.
*   Implement integrity checks for configuration files.
*   Consider using programmatic configuration instead of relying solely on external files if feasible.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration via System Properties/Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_via_system_propertiesenvironment_variables.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate system properties or environment variables that Logback uses for configuration, potentially overriding intended settings.

**How Logback Contributes:** Logback allows configuration values to be set or overridden through system properties and environment variables.

**Example:** An attacker sets a system property to change the file path of a `FileAppender` to overwrite a critical system file.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Limit the application's exposure to external system properties and environment variables.
*   Document which system properties and environment variables influence Logback configuration.
*   Sanitize or validate values obtained from system properties and environment variables before using them in Logback configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution via JNDI Lookups](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution_via_jndi_lookups.md)

**Description:** Attackers can exploit Logback's JNDI lookup feature to perform remote code execution by injecting malicious JNDI lookup strings into log messages or configuration.

**How Logback Contributes:** Logback supports JNDI lookups within log messages and configuration through features like `${jndi:}`. This allows retrieving and potentially instantiating objects from remote servers.

**Example:** An attacker sends a crafted input that gets logged, containing a JNDI lookup string pointing to a malicious server that serves up an exploit payload, leading to remote code execution on the application server. (Similar to the Log4Shell vulnerability).

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Disable JNDI lookups entirely if not needed.** This is the most effective mitigation.
*   If JNDI lookups are necessary, restrict the protocols allowed (e.g., only allow `ldap://` or `ldaps://`).
*   Carefully control and validate any input that could influence JNDI lookup strings.
*   Monitor for and block outbound connections to suspicious JNDI servers.
*   Update Logback to the latest version, which may contain mitigations for known JNDI vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [File System Manipulation via File Appenders](./attack_surfaces/file_system_manipulation_via_file_appenders.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate the file system if the application allows untrusted input to control the file paths used by `FileAppender` or `RollingFileAppender`.

**How Logback Contributes:** These appenders write log messages to files, and their configuration includes the file path. If this path is controllable, it can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker provides input that, when used to configure a `FileAppender`'s file path, allows overwriting critical system files or creating files in sensitive directories.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using user-provided or external data directly to construct file paths for log appenders.
*   Use parameterized configuration or predefined, validated paths.
*   Enforce strict path validation and sanitization if dynamic path configuration is unavoidable.
*   Run the application with the least privileges necessary to write to the log directory.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Insecure Network Appender Configuration](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_insecure_network_appender_configuration.md)

**Description:** Attackers can potentially intercept sensitive log data if network appenders (e.g., `SocketAppender`, `SMTPAppender`) are configured to use insecure protocols or communicate with untrusted destinations.

**How Logback Contributes:** These appenders send log data over the network to specified destinations. If the communication is not encrypted or the destination is compromised, the data is at risk.

**Example:** Sensitive data is logged and sent via a `SocketAppender` over plain TCP to a logging server that is also accessible to the attacker.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) for network communication with logging servers.
*   Authenticate and authorize connections to logging servers.
*   Ensure logging servers are properly secured and hardened.
*   Validate the configuration of network appenders and ensure they point to trusted destinations.
