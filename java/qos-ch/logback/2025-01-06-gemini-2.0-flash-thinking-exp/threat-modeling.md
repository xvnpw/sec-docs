# Threat Model Analysis for qos-ch/logback

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Appender Vulnerabilities](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_appender_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within specific Logback Appenders (e.g., database appenders, SMTP appenders, or custom appenders) to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could involve injecting malicious payloads through logged data or exploiting flaws in how the appender processes data or interacts with external systems.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breach, malware installation, denial of service, lateral movement within the network.

**Affected Logback Component:** Specific Appenders (e.g., JDBCAppender, SMTPAppender, custom appenders).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Logback and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Carefully review and restrict the usage of appenders that interact with external systems, especially if they involve processing potentially untrusted data.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom appenders.
* Implement strong input validation and sanitization even within appender logic.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Configuration Exploitation](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_configuration_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the Logback configuration (e.g., through file injection or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how configuration files are loaded or parsed) to introduce malicious settings that lead to remote code execution. This could involve leveraging features like JNDI lookups (similar to Log4Shell, though less directly applicable to standard Logback configurations without specific extensions or custom appenders) or other mechanisms for external resource loading.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breach, malware installation, denial of service.

**Affected Logback Component:** Configuration loading mechanism (e.g., `JoranConfigurator`), potentially custom appenders or extensions that rely on external configurations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Logback configuration files are stored securely and are not writable by untrusted users.
* Restrict the ability to load configuration files from external or untrusted sources.
* Carefully review Logback configuration for any potentially dangerous settings or external resource lookups.
* Keep Logback updated to patch any vulnerabilities in the configuration parsing logic.

## Threat: [Log Injection](./threats/log_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates user input or other data that is subsequently logged without proper sanitization. This allows them to inject arbitrary content into log files, potentially misleading administrators, injecting malicious scripts that could be executed by log analysis tools, or even exploiting vulnerabilities in the logging framework itself or downstream systems that process the logs.

**Impact:** Misleading audit trails, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks if logs are displayed in web interfaces, denial of service if injected data causes errors in log processing, or even remote code execution in vulnerable log analysis tools.

**Affected Logback Component:** Core logging mechanism, Layouts (PatternLayout), potentially Appenders if they process the log message in a vulnerable way.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in log messages.
* Use parameterized logging or prepared statements where applicable.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into log messages using string concatenation.
* Carefully review and restrict the use of complex layout patterns that might be susceptible to injection.
