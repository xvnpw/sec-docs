## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Log Injection (Log Forging / CRLF Injection) within Logback](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_log_injection__log_forging__crlf_injection__within_logback.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Logback Encoder:** Select and configure a Logback `Encoder` implementation (e.g., `PatternLayoutEncoder`, `LogstashEncoder`).  `PatternLayoutEncoder` is the most common and allows you to define the log message format.  `LogstashEncoder` is for structured logging (JSON).
    2.  **Configure Encoding (PatternLayoutEncoder):** If using `PatternLayoutEncoder`, use the `%replace` conversion word in your pattern to escape special characters.  For example:
        ```xml
        <pattern>%d %-5level [%thread] %logger{36} - %replace(%msg){'[\r\n]', ''}%n</pattern>
        ```
        This replaces carriage returns and newlines with empty strings.  You can customize the regular expression and replacement string to handle other characters as needed.  Consider using `%.-1msg` to limit the message length and prevent extremely long injected strings.
    3.  **Structured Logging (LogstashEncoder):** If using `LogstashEncoder`, pass data as key-value pairs using Logback's `StructuredArguments` (e.g., `kv("key", value)`):
        ```java
        logger.info("User action", kv("userInput", userInput), kv("action", "submit"));
        ```
        Logback's `LogstashEncoder` will automatically handle the proper escaping and formatting for JSON.
    4.  **Avoid Direct Concatenation:** *Never* directly concatenate user-supplied data into the log message string *before* passing it to Logback.  Always use parameterized logging or structured arguments.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Forging:** Attackers inject fake log entries. (Severity: Medium to High)
    *   **CRLF Injection:** Attackers inject newline characters. (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Log-Based Code Execution (Indirect):** If the log viewer/processor is vulnerable. (Severity: High - depends on viewer/processor)
    *   **Data Corruption:** Maliciously injected data corrupts log files. (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Forging:** Risk significantly reduced. Encoding prevents injection of fake entries.
    *   **CRLF Injection:** Risk significantly reduced. Encoding neutralizes newline characters.
    *   **Log-Based Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (indirectly).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Describe the current Logback configuration related to encoding (e.g., "Using `PatternLayoutEncoder` with `%msg` but without `%replace`").  State whether structured logging is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Describe any missing encoding configuration (e.g., "No `%replace` used in `PatternLayoutEncoder`").  If direct string concatenation is used, point it out.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigate JNDI Lookup Vulnerabilities in Logback](./mitigation_strategies/mitigate_jndi_lookup_vulnerabilities_in_logback.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Logback Version:** Check your project's dependency management (e.g., `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`) for the exact Logback version.
    2.  **Upgrade Logback (Essential):** If the version is older than 1.2.10 (for 1.2.x) or 1.3.0-alpha11 (for 1.3.x), *upgrade* to a patched version. Update the dependency in your build file and rebuild. This removes the vulnerable JNDI lookup functionality from Logback.
    3.  **Disable JNDI Lookups (Last Resort - *Only* if Upgrade is Impossible):** If, and *only if*, upgrading is completely impossible, set the Logback system property `logback.logjndi.JndiLookup.enable` to `false`.  This is a *mitigation*, not a fix, and upgrading is *always* the preferred solution.  This property can be set:
        *   Via command-line argument: `-Dlogback.logjndi.JndiLookup.enable=false`
        *   Programmatically (less recommended): `System.setProperty("logback.logjndi.JndiLookup.enable", "false");`

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via JNDI Lookup (CVE-2021-42550 and similar):** Attackers trigger JNDI lookups to malicious servers. (Severity: Critical)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE via JNDI Lookup:**
        *   **Upgrade:** Risk eliminated.
        *   **Disable JNDI Lookups (if upgrade impossible):** Risk reduced, but not eliminated.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   State the current Logback version.  Indicate whether the upgrade has been done.  If the `logback.logjndi.JndiLookup.enable` property is used, mention it.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If the Logback version is vulnerable and not upgraded, state this clearly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent XXE Attacks via Logback Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_xxe_attacks_via_logback_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable External Entities (System Properties):** Configure the XML parser used by Logback (via Joran and SAX) to disable external entity resolution.  This is done through system properties, which must be set *before* Logback initializes (typically as JVM arguments):
        *   `-Djavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory=com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl` (or another *non-vulnerable* SAXParserFactory)
        *   `-Djavax.xml.accessExternalDTD=""`
        *   `-Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=""`
    2.  **Schema Validation (If configuration is loaded externally):** If the configuration file is loaded from an external source, use a validating XML parser and an XML Schema (XSD) to validate the configuration file *before* Logback processes it. This is a general XML security best practice, but it's relevant here because Logback uses XML for configuration. This validation should happen *outside* of Logback's processing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Read arbitrary files. (Severity: High)
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Consume excessive resources. (Severity: Medium)
        *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Make requests to internal/external systems. (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XXE Attacks:**
        *   **Disable External Entities:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Risk further reduced (if applicable).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   State whether the system properties to disable external entities are set. Describe any XSD validation if configuration files are loaded externally.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   If the system properties are not set, state this. If external configuration files are loaded without XSD validation, describe the vulnerability.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logback Appenders](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logback_appenders.md)

*   **Description:** Focus on Logback-specific appender configurations.
    *   **DBAppender:**
        1.  **Parameterized Queries (Logback Configuration):** Ensure that Logback's `DBAppender` is configured to use parameterized queries.  This is usually the default behavior, but verify it in your Logback configuration file.  Look for any custom SQL queries within the `DBAppender` configuration and ensure they are parameterized.  Logback handles the parameterization; you just need to ensure custom SQL (if any) is written correctly.
    *   **SocketAppender / SyslogAppender:**
        1.  **Encrypt Communication (Logback Configuration):** Configure the appender to use a secure protocol. For `SyslogAppender`, use the `ssl://` prefix in the `syslogHost` property.  For `SocketAppender`, use a secure socket factory.  This configuration is done *within* the Logback configuration file.
        2.  **Authenticate Connections (Logback Configuration):** If supported by the appender and the receiving server, configure authentication within the Logback configuration. This might involve setting properties for client certificates or other credentials.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DBAppender:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code. (Severity: Critical)
    *   **SocketAppender / SyslogAppender:**
        *   **Eavesdropping:** Attackers intercept log messages. (Severity: Medium to High)
        *   **Log Spoofing:** Attackers send fake log messages. (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   The impact varies depending on the appender and mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Describe the current configuration of each *Logback* appender used.  Specify whether parameterized queries are used (for `DBAppender`), and whether encryption and authentication are configured (for network appenders).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Identify any missing security measures within the *Logback configuration* for each appender. For example, "DBAppender configuration does not explicitly verify parameterized query usage." or "SyslogAppender uses `udp://` and does not encrypt communication."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Masking/Redaction *within* Logback](./mitigation_strategies/maskingredaction_within_logback.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Custom Converters (Logback Configuration):** Create custom Logback converters that extend `ClassicConverter`.  Override the `convert()` method to mask or redact sensitive parts of the log message before it's written.  Register your custom converter in the Logback configuration file:
        ```xml
        <conversionRule conversionWord="maskedMsg" converterClass="com.example.MyMaskingConverter" />
        <pattern>%d %-5level [%thread] %logger{36} - %maskedMsg%n</pattern>
        ```
    2.  **Filters (Logback Configuration):** Use Logback filters (e.g., `ch.qos.logback.core.filter.Filter`) to selectively remove or modify log events containing sensitive data.  You can create custom filters or use existing ones (like `EvaluatorFilter` with a custom evaluator) to match specific patterns and take action (e.g., deny the event, modify the message).  Configure filters within the Logback configuration file, attaching them to specific appenders.
    3.  **Pattern Layout Modification (Logback Configuration):** Carefully design your `PatternLayout` patterns to *exclude* sensitive fields. If you're logging objects, use specific conversion words to extract only the non-sensitive parts. Avoid using `%message` or `%msg` directly if it might contain sensitive data without proper masking.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive data in log files. (Severity: High to Critical)
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Violating privacy regulations. (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Masking/Redaction:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Describe any custom converters, filters, or pattern layout modifications used for masking/redaction *within Logback*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Identify any areas where sensitive data is logged without masking/redaction, and where Logback's features could be used to address this.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit Logback Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_logback_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Audits:** Establish a schedule for reviewing Logback configuration files.
    2.  **Configuration Review:** Periodically review Logback configuration files (XML, Groovy) to ensure they are:
        *   Up-to-date with the latest security best practices for Logback.
        *   Free of any known vulnerabilities (e.g., XXE vulnerabilities, insecure appender settings).
        *   Using secure appender configurations as described above.
        *   Properly configured for encoding, masking, and filtering.
    3.  **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with security advisories and best practices specifically for *Logback*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   This strategy mitigates *all* Logback-specific threats by proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the *Logback configuration*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Significantly reduces the risk of all Logback-related vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Describe any existing auditing processes specifically for the *Logback configuration*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Identify any gaps in the auditing process related to the *Logback configuration*. For example, "Logback configuration files are not regularly reviewed for security best practices."
