## Attack Tree Path: [Log Injection (Data Leakage) via Sensitive Data in Log Message](./attack_tree_paths/log_injection__data_leakage__via_sensitive_data_in_log_message.md)

*   **Description:** The application inadvertently logs sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII, etc.) without proper redaction or masking. This is not a Logback vulnerability *per se*, but Logback becomes the storage mechanism for this sensitive data, making it a target.
*   **[HIGH RISK] and [CRITICAL]:** High risk due to the commonality of this error and the direct impact of data exposure. Critical because the presence of sensitive data in logs *is* the compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (common developer mistake)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (depending on the sensitivity of the data)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (simply reading logs)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (depends on log monitoring and access controls)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strict coding guidelines to prevent logging of sensitive data.
    *   Use data redaction/masking techniques before logging.
    *   Conduct regular code reviews to identify and correct logging of sensitive information.
    *   Employ static analysis tools to detect potential sensitive data leaks.

## Attack Tree Path: [JNDI Lookup (RCE) via Unsafe Deserialization of JNDI References](./attack_tree_paths/jndi_lookup__rce__via_unsafe_deserialization_of_jndi_references.md)

*   **Description:** Logback is configured to use JNDI (e.g., via `JNDIConfiguration` or a vulnerable appender). An attacker controls the JNDI lookup string, pointing it to a malicious LDAP or RMI server. This server returns a serialized Java object that, upon deserialization by Logback, executes arbitrary code.
*   **[HIGH RISK] and [CRITICAL]:** High risk due to the potential for RCE, especially with older Logback/JRE versions or misconfigurations. Critical because successful exploitation leads directly to RCE. The "Unsafe Deserialization" node is critical as the point of vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (with modern Logback and JRE), Medium to High (with older versions or misconfigurations)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Remote Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires setting up a malicious server and crafting the JNDI string)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires network monitoring and understanding of JNDI exploitation)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Avoid JNDI:** Do not use JNDI features in Logback unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Update Logback:** Use the latest stable version of Logback.
    *   **Update JRE:** Use a modern JRE with JNDI restrictions enabled (often the default).
    *   **Explicitly Disable JNDI:** If JNDI is unavoidable, configure Logback and the JRE to explicitly disable remote code loading via JNDI (e.g., `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase=false`, `com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase=false`).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the application server to limit the impact of a successful JNDI exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Logback Version (CVEs) via Exploit Specific CVE](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_logback_version__cves__via_exploit_specific_cve.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses a version of Logback with a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability (CVE). An attacker exploits this specific CVE to achieve their goal (which could range from DoS to RCE, depending on the CVE).
*   **[CRITICAL]:** Critical because it represents a direct and known path to exploitation. The "Exploit Specific CVE" node is the actual execution of the exploit.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated), Medium to High (if using vulnerable versions)
*   **Impact:** Varies (depends on the specific CVE)
*   **Effort:** Varies (depends on the CVE)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (depends on the CVE)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies (depends on the CVE and available detection mechanisms)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Logback and all other dependencies up to date. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities in Logback and other libraries.
    *   **Patch Management:** Implement a robust patch management process to quickly apply security updates.
