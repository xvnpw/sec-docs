Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving HikariCP, with high and critical severity:

**Attack Surface: Exposed Database Credentials in Configuration**

*   **Description:** Database usernames and passwords required by HikariCP are stored insecurely, making them accessible to unauthorized individuals.
*   **How HikariCP Contributes:** HikariCP requires configuration of database credentials (`username`, `password`) to establish connections. If these are stored in plain text in configuration files, environment variables, or other easily accessible locations, they become a prime target.
*   **Example:**  Database credentials are hardcoded directly in the `application.properties` file or stored as plain text environment variables without proper encryption or access controls.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials.
    *   Use secure credential storage mechanisms.
    *   Implement proper access controls for configuration files.
    *   Utilize environment variables securely.

**Attack Surface: Malicious JDBC Driver via `dataSourceClassName`**

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the `dataSourceClassName` configuration to load a malicious or compromised JDBC driver.
*   **How HikariCP Contributes:** HikariCP uses the `dataSourceClassName` property to dynamically load the specified JDBC driver. If an attacker can control this property, they can point it to a malicious driver.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies the application's configuration to set `dataSourceClassName` to a driver containing malicious code. Upon application startup or connection establishment, this malicious driver is loaded and executed.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server. The attacker gains full control over the server and can perform arbitrary actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict configuration changes.
    *   Implement input validation for `dataSourceClassName`.
    *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege for the application.
    *   Manage dependencies and ensure only trusted JDBC drivers are used.

**Attack Surface: Exploiting `connectionInitSql` for Malicious Actions**

*   **Description:** The `connectionInitSql` configuration option, intended for initializing database connections, can be abused to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **How HikariCP Contributes:** HikariCP executes the SQL specified in `connectionInitSql` every time a new connection is established. If an attacker can control this value, they can inject malicious SQL.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `connectionInitSql` configuration to include commands that create new administrative users in the database, grant excessive privileges, or drop tables.
*   **Impact:** Database compromise, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict configuration changes.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when using `connectionInitSql`.
    *   Regularly review and audit the SQL configured in `connectionInitSql`.
    *   Consider alternative connection initialization methods.
