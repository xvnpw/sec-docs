# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection (Primarily via Filters)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection__primarily_via_filters_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Logstash's processing pipeline, typically through input data that is then interpreted by filters, especially the `ruby` filter. This is the most direct and dangerous attack vector.
*   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's flexible filtering capabilities, particularly the `ruby` filter, provide a direct mechanism for code execution. Grok patterns, if dynamically generated or influenced by user input, also present a significant risk (ReDoS).
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a log message containing a specially crafted string that, when processed by a `ruby` filter with string interpolation or `eval`, executes arbitrary Ruby code on the Logstash server.  A crafted Grok pattern that causes excessive backtracking (ReDoS), leading to DoS.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `ruby` filter if possible:**  Prioritize alternative filters (e.g., `mutate`, `dissect`) that achieve the same goal without arbitrary code execution. This is the most effective mitigation.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization (if `ruby` is unavoidable):**  If the `ruby` filter *must* be used, implement extremely rigorous input sanitization *before* the data reaches the filter.  Validate data types, lengths, and allowed characters.  Never use `eval` or string interpolation with untrusted input. Consider sandboxing if available.
    *   **Secure Grok Patterns:**  Use pre-defined, well-tested Grok patterns.  Avoid dynamically generating Grok patterns based on user input.  Use tools to test for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Logstash as a non-root user with limited permissions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular code reviews and security audits of Logstash configurations, focusing on filter logic.

## Attack Surface: [Input Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in specific Logstash input plugins (e.g., `beats`, `tcp`, `udp`, `http`, `syslog`) can be exploited to cause crashes, DoS, or potentially other exploits, *directly* impacting the Logstash process.
*   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's reliance on a wide range of input plugins to receive data from various sources expands the attack surface.  These plugins are part of the Logstash codebase or tightly integrated.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `http` input plugin allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request that crashes the Logstash process. A vulnerability in the `beats` input plugin allows an attacker to bypass authentication and inject malicious data.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability), unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Logstash Updated:**  Regularly update Logstash and *all* its plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. This is paramount.
    *   **Disable Unused Plugins:**  Disable any input plugins that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Input Validation (Plugin-Specific):** Implement input validation specific to each input plugin, if possible, *within* the Logstash configuration or plugin settings. For example, for the `http` input, validate HTTP headers and request bodies *as part of the Logstash pipeline*.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  If Logstash uses any input plugins or codecs that deserialize data (e.g., Java deserialization, Python pickle), attackers could exploit known deserialization vulnerabilities to achieve RCE *directly* within the Logstash process.
*   **How Logstash Contributes:**  Logstash's use of codecs and plugins that might perform deserialization introduces this risk *as part of its core functionality*.
*   **Example:**  An attacker sends a malicious serialized Java object to a Logstash input that uses Java deserialization, triggering arbitrary code execution within the Logstash JVM.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Deserialization if Possible:**  If possible, avoid using input plugins or codecs that rely on potentially unsafe deserialization mechanisms. Choose safer alternatives.
    *   **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:**  If deserialization is necessary, use well-vetted and secure deserialization libraries that are known to be resistant to common attacks.
    *   **Input Validation (Before Deserialization):**  Implement strict input validation *before* any deserialization takes place within the Logstash pipeline. This can help prevent malicious objects from being processed.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Ensure that any libraries used for deserialization (part of Logstash or its plugins) are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration via Output Plugins (Post-Compromise)](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration_via_output_plugins__post-compromise_.md)

* **Description:** *After* an attacker gains control of Logstash (e.g., via code injection), they could reconfigure output plugins to send log data to an attacker-controlled destination. This is a direct consequence of compromising Logstash itself.
* **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's core function is to send data to outputs, making it the *tool* for exfiltration once compromised.
* **Example:** An attacker, having achieved RCE via a `ruby` filter, modifies the `elasticsearch` output plugin configuration to send data to a rogue Elasticsearch instance.
* **Impact:** Data breach, loss of sensitive information.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Management and Integrity Checks:** Use configuration management tools to ensure that output plugin configurations are not tampered with. Implement integrity checks (e.g., file checksums, version control) to detect unauthorized modifications to Logstash configuration files. This is crucial to prevent attackers from changing output destinations.
    *   **Output Filtering:** If possible, use output filters to restrict the types of data that can be sent to specific destinations. This can limit the impact of a compromised output plugin, even if the destination is changed.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Logstash User):** Ensure the Logstash process runs with minimal necessary permissions, limiting its ability to modify configurations or access sensitive data.
