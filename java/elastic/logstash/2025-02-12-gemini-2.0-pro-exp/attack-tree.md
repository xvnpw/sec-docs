## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_exfiltration.md)

*   **High-Risk Path 1 [HR]: Misconfigured Input Plugin -> Data Exfiltration**
    *   **Critical Node [CN]: Misconfigured Input Plugin**
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration in an input plugin, such as overly permissive file access in a `file` input plugin, allowing access to sensitive files outside the intended scope.  Or, an attacker could exploit a misconfiguration in a network-based input plugin (e.g., `beats`, `syslog`) to receive data from unauthorized sources or with insufficient authentication.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
            *   Ensure input plugins are configured to access only the necessary files and resources.
            *   Regularly review and audit input plugin configurations.
            *   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure configurations.
            *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for network-based input plugins.

*   **High-Risk Path 2 [HR]: Vulnerable Input Plugin -> Data Exfiltration**
    *   **Critical Node [CN]: Vulnerable Input Plugin**
        *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in a specific input plugin.  This could allow reading arbitrary files, injecting malicious data, or even achieving remote code execution (though RCE is categorized separately).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly audit and update all input plugins.
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization within the application *before* data reaches Logstash.
            *   Use a vulnerability scanner to identify known issues in plugins.
            *   Consider using minimal, well-vetted plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service.md)

*   **High-Risk Path 3 [HR]: Input Plugin Resource Exhaustion -> Denial of Service**
    *   **Critical Node [CN]: Input Plugin Resource Exhaustion**
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends a flood of data to an input plugin, exceeding Logstash's capacity to process it. This could be a large volume of legitimate-looking data or specially crafted data designed to consume excessive resources.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement rate limiting and throttling on input sources.
            *   Configure Logstash with sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space).
            *   Use a queuing mechanism (e.g., Kafka, Redis) to buffer data.

*   **High-Risk Path 4 [HR]: Slow or Unresponsive Output -> Denial of Service**
    *   **Critical Node [CN]: Slow or Unresponsive Output**
        *   **Description:** If the output destination (e.g., Elasticsearch) is slow or unresponsive, Logstash's output queue can fill up, leading to backpressure and potentially causing Logstash to crash or become unresponsive.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Ensure the output destination has sufficient resources and is properly configured.
            *   Implement monitoring for the output destination's health and performance.
            *   Configure Logstash with appropriate backpressure handling mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/3__code_execution.md)

*   **Critical Node [CN]: Vulnerable Input Plugin (RCE)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an input plugin that allows for remote code execution (RCE). This is the most direct path to gaining full control.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Prioritize auditing and updating input plugins.
        *   Focus on plugins that handle complex data formats or network protocols.
        *   Use a vulnerability scanner.

*   **Critical Node [CN]: Vulnerable Filter Plugin (RCE)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a filter plugin that allows for RCE (e.g., a vulnerability in a `ruby` filter).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly audit and update all filter plugins.
        *   Avoid using the `ruby` filter unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any user-supplied code if using `ruby` filter.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for executing Ruby code.

*   **Critical Node [CN]: Vulnerable Output Plugin (RCE)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an output plugin that allows for RCE.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High to Very High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Regularly audit and update all output plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Configuration Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/4__configuration_abuse.md)

*   **High-Risk Path 5 [HR]: Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files -> Configuration Abuse**
    *   **Critical Node [CN]: Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files**
        *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Logstash's configuration files (e.g., `logstash.yml`, pipeline configuration files) through weak file permissions, exposed network shares, or other vulnerabilities.  They can then modify the configuration to redirect data, disable logging, or cause other disruptions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strict access controls on Logstash configuration files.
            *   Use a secure configuration management system.
            *   Regularly audit file permissions.

*   **High-Risk Path 6 [HR]: Input/Filter/Output Plugin Misconfiguration -> Configuration Abuse**
    *   **Critical Node [CN]: Input/Filter/Output Plugin Misconfiguration**
        *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a misconfiguration in any of the plugins (input, filter, or output) to achieve a malicious goal. This is a broad category encompassing various misconfigurations beyond just those leading to data exfiltration (covered in High-Risk Path 1). Examples include disabling security features, routing data to incorrect destinations, or causing instability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly audit configurations.
            *   Use configuration as code.
            *   Implement change management processes.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
