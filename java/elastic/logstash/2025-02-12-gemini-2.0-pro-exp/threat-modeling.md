# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Threat: [Spoofed Log Source Injection](./threats/spoofed_log_source_injection.md)

*   **Threat:**  Spoofed Log Source Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts and sends log events to Logstash, masquerading as a legitimate source. They might spoof IP addresses or manipulate network traffic at the Logstash input level.
    *   **Impact:**  Ingestion of fabricated log data, leading to incorrect analysis, false alerts, and potentially masking real attacks. Could trigger unintended actions based on log patterns.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:** Input plugins (e.g., `beats`, `tcp`, `udp`, `syslog`) â€“ any input lacking strong authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation using allowlists for source identifiers (IPs, hostnames).
        *   Use secure transport protocols with mutual authentication (e.g., TLS with client certificates) where supported by the input plugin.
        *   Use authenticated logging agents (e.g., Filebeat with TLS) that integrate with Logstash input plugins.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering](./threats/configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:**  Configuration File Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Logstash configuration files (e.g., `logstash.yml`, pipeline `.conf` files) and modifies them *directly*.
    *   **Impact:**  Disabling of logging, redirection of logs to a malicious destination, modification of filters to drop/allow specific events, introduction of vulnerabilities via malicious plugin configurations, or data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:**  Core Logstash configuration, pipeline configuration files, any plugin configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access to configuration files using OS permissions and ACLs.
        *   Implement configuration management and version control (e.g., Git).
        *   Regularly audit configuration files for unauthorized changes.
        *   Use secure deployment methods (e.g., SSH with key-based authentication, configuration management tools).
        *   Monitor file integrity of configuration files.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation/Modification](./threats/malicious_plugin_installationmodification.md)

*   **Threat:**  Malicious Plugin Installation/Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker installs a malicious Logstash plugin or modifies an existing one *directly on the Logstash server*.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, or other malicious behavior, depending on the plugin. Could lead to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:**  Plugin management system, any installed plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Download plugins *only* from trusted sources (official Elastic repository).
        *   Verify plugin integrity using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   Regularly update plugins.
        *   Implement file integrity monitoring on the plugin directory.

## Threat: [Credential Exposure in Configuration](./threats/credential_exposure_in_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:**  Credential Exposure in Configuration

    *   **Description:**  Logstash configuration files contain hardcoded credentials (e.g., for Elasticsearch, databases). An attacker accessing these files *directly on the Logstash server* steals the credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of connected systems, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:**  Configuration files (`logstash.yml`, pipeline `.conf` files), specifically input/output plugin configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use environment variables.
        *   Use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
        *   Utilize Logstash's Keystore feature.
        *   *Never* hardcode credentials in configuration files.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Targeting Logstash)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__targeting_logstash_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Targeting Logstash)

    *   **Description:** An attacker floods Logstash *directly* with a high volume of log data, or sends complex events, aiming to overwhelm Logstash's processing capabilities (CPU, memory, disk I/O within Logstash).
    *   **Impact:**  Logstash becomes unresponsive, unable to process logs, leading to data loss.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:**  Input plugins, filter plugins, output plugins, and the core Logstash engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Logstash with appropriate resource limits (JVM heap size, worker threads).
        *   Monitor Logstash resource usage and set up alerts.
        *   Scale Logstash horizontally (add more instances).
        *   Use dead-letter queues for unprocessable messages.
        * Implement rate-limiting *within* Logstash input plugins if supported.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Malicious Log Events (Exploiting Logstash Vulnerabilities)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_malicious_log_events__exploiting_logstash_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via Malicious Log Events (Exploiting Logstash Vulnerabilities)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted log events designed to exploit vulnerabilities *within* Logstash plugins or the core engine, causing crashes or excessive resource consumption.
    *   **Impact:**  Logstash becomes unavailable, leading to data loss.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:**  Potentially any plugin (especially those with complex parsing), and the core Logstash engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Logstash and *all* plugins.
        *   Implement input validation and filtering *within Logstash* to reject malformed or suspicious events.
        *   Thoroughly test Logstash configurations with a variety of input, including fuzzing.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege via Logstash (Direct Execution Context)](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_via_logstash__direct_execution_context_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Elevation of Privilege via Logstash (Direct Execution Context)

    *   **Description:** Logstash itself is run with excessive privileges (e.g., root). If a vulnerability *within Logstash* is exploited, the attacker gains those privileges.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:**  The entire Logstash instance and its operating environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run Logstash as a dedicated, *non-privileged* user.

## Threat: [Code Execution via Vulnerable Plugin (Direct Logstash Impact)](./threats/code_execution_via_vulnerable_plugin__direct_logstash_impact_.md)

*  **Threat:**  Code Execution via Vulnerable Plugin (Direct Logstash Impact)

    *   **Description:** A vulnerability in a Logstash plugin (input, filter, or output) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code *within the Logstash process*.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution with the privileges of the Logstash process. Could lead to data exfiltration or further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Logstash Component:** Any vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all plugins updated.
        *   Carefully vet and audit any custom plugins.
        *   Run Logstash with least privilege.
        *   Implement robust input validation within custom plugins.
