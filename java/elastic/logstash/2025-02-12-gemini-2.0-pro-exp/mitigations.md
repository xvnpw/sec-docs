# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS and Client Authentication for Beats Input (Logstash Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_and_client_authentication_for_beats_input__logstash_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Logstash Configuration:**  Within the Logstash configuration file (e.g., `beats.conf` in `/etc/logstash/conf.d/`), configure the `beats` input plugin as follows:
        *   `ssl => true`:  Enable SSL/TLS encryption.
        *   `ssl_certificate => "/path/to/logstash_server.crt"`:  Specify the path to the Logstash server's certificate file.
        *   `ssl_key => "/path/to/logstash_server.key"`:  Specify the path to the Logstash server's private key file.
        *   `ssl_certificate_authorities => ["/path/to/ca.crt"]`:  Specify the path to the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file used to sign the client certificates.
        *   `ssl_verify_mode => "force_peer"`:  *Require* client certificate authentication.  This is crucial.  Do *not* use `peer` or `none`.
    2.  **Restart Logstash:** After making these changes, restart the Logstash service to apply the new configuration.
    3. **Verify in Logs:** Check the Logstash logs for any SSL-related errors during startup or when Beats agents connect.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Injection (Severity: High):**  Ensures only authorized Beats agents with valid, CA-signed certificates can send data.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High):**  TLS encryption prevents interception and modification of data.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (Severity: High):**  TLS encryption prevents unauthorized reading of data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Risk eliminated (100%).
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** Risk eliminated (100%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Fully implemented with all required settings in the `beats` input configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Vetting and Regular Updates (Logstash Plugin Management)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_vetting_and_regular_updates__logstash_plugin_management_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize Official Plugins:**  Use the `logstash-plugin list` command to review installed plugins.  Prioritize those from Elastic.
    2.  **Community Plugin Review (Before Installation):**  *Before* installing a community plugin using `logstash-plugin install <plugin_name>`, thoroughly review its source code (available on GitHub or other repositories) for security vulnerabilities.  Look for:
        *   Insecure deserialization.
        *   Command injection.
        *   Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities.
        *   Insecure use of external libraries.
    3.  **Regular Updates:**  Use the `logstash-plugin update` command regularly (ideally automated with a script) to update *all* installed plugins to their latest versions.  This command updates all plugins unless a specific plugin is specified.
    4. **Check for updates:** Use command `logstash-plugin list --verbose | grep -i update` to check if there are any updates available.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Logstash Plugins (Severity: High):**  Reduces the risk of exploiting known and unknown vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Execution (Severity: Critical):**  Mitigates the risk of arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):**  Reduces DoS risks from plugin vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Logstash Plugins:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).
    *   **Code Execution:** Risk reduced significantly (60-70%).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A script runs weekly to execute `logstash-plugin update`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal code review process for community plugins *before* installation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Expression Security (ReDoS Prevention within Filters)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_expression_security__redos_prevention_within_filters_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit Existing Filters:**  Examine all Logstash filter configurations (e.g., `grok.conf`, `mutate.conf`) that use regular expressions.  Identify any potentially vulnerable patterns.
    2.  **`grok` Timeout:**  Within the `grok` filter configuration, *always* set the `timeout_millis` option to a reasonable value (e.g., 1000 milliseconds).  This prevents a single malicious input from consuming excessive CPU time due to a poorly designed regex.  Example:
        ```
        grok {
          match => { "message" => "%{MY_PATTERN}" }
          timeout_millis => 1000
        }
        ```
    3.  **Simplify and Test:**  Rewrite any complex or potentially vulnerable regular expressions to be simpler and less prone to backtracking.  Test thoroughly with various inputs, including edge cases.
    4. **Consider `dissect`:** If a regular expression is too complex to secure, consider using the `dissect` filter instead, which is generally more performant and less vulnerable to ReDoS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Severity: High):**  Prevents DoS attacks caused by crafted input strings.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `timeout_millis` is set for all `grok` filters.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive audit of all regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities has not been performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logstash Configuration Files (Environment Variables)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logstash_configuration_files__environment_variables_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Secrets:**  Review all Logstash configuration files and identify any sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, or other credentials.
    2.  **Replace with Environment Variables:**  Replace the hardcoded secrets with environment variable references using the `${VAR_NAME}` syntax within the Logstash configuration files.  For example, replace `password => "mysecretpassword"` with `password => "${LOGSTASH_PASSWORD}"`.
    3.  **Set Environment Variables:**  Set the corresponding environment variables *before* starting Logstash.  This can be done in the systemd service file (using `Environment=`), in a shell script that starts Logstash, or through other system-level mechanisms.  *Do not* store the secrets in the Logstash configuration files themselves.
    4. **Restart Logstash:** Restart Logstash to apply the changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: Critical):**  Prevents attackers from obtaining credentials if they gain access to the configuration files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Risk reduced significantly.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented; some secrets are still hardcoded.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A complete migration of all secrets to environment variables is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS for Output Connections (Logstash Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_for_output_connections__logstash_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Output Configurations:**  Examine all Logstash output configurations (e.g., `elasticsearch.conf`, `kafka.conf`).
    2.  **Enable TLS:**  For each output plugin that supports TLS, enable it by setting the appropriate options (usually `ssl` or `tls`) to `true`.  Consult the specific plugin documentation for the exact syntax.  For example, for Elasticsearch:
        ```
        output {
          elasticsearch {
            hosts => ["https://my-es-cluster:9200"]
            ssl => true
            cacert => "/path/to/ca.crt"
            # ... other settings ...
          }
        }
        ```
    3.  **Provide Certificates:**  Specify the paths to the necessary certificate files (CA certificate, client certificate, client key) as required by the output plugin.
    4.  **Restart Logstash:** Restart Logstash to apply the changes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High):**  Prevents interception and modification of data sent to outputs.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping (Severity: High):**  Prevents unauthorized reading of data sent to outputs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Risk eliminated (100%).
    *   **Data Eavesdropping:** Risk eliminated (100%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS is enabled for the Elasticsearch output.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   TLS needs to be enabled for all other output plugins that support it.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure and Use Persistent Queues (Logstash Queuing)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_and_use_persistent_queues__logstash_queuing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Queue Type:** In your Logstash configuration, configure a persistent queue. The `persisted` queue type is recommended for production environments. The `file` queue type is also an option. Avoid the `memory` queue type for production if data loss is unacceptable.
    2.  **Configure Queue Settings:** Within the Logstash configuration file (typically in the main `logstash.yml` or a separate configuration file), set the following:
        ```yaml
        queue.type: persisted  # Or 'file'
        queue.max_bytes: 4gb   # Adjust as needed based on available disk space and expected volume
        path.queue: "/path/to/queue/data" # Specify a directory for queue data (persisted queue only)
        queue.checkpoint.writes: 1024 # Adjust as needed
        ```
        *   `queue.type`: Specifies the queue type (`persisted`, `file`, or `memory`).
        *   `queue.max_bytes`: Limits the maximum size of the queue.  This is crucial to prevent disk space exhaustion.
        *   `path.queue`: (For `persisted` queue) Specifies the directory where the queue data will be stored.  Ensure this directory has sufficient disk space and is accessible by the Logstash user.
        * `queue.checkpoint.writes`: Defines how often to force a checkpoint.
    3.  **Restart Logstash:** Restart Logstash to apply the new queue configuration.
    4. **Monitor Queue:** Use monitoring tools to track the queue size and ensure it's not growing unbounded.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss During Outages (Severity: High):** Persistent queues prevent data loss if Logstash restarts or crashes.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Provides some buffering against sudden spikes in input data, although it's not a primary DoS mitigation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss During Outages:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced slightly (20-30%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The `persisted` queue is configured with a `max_bytes` limit.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None.
