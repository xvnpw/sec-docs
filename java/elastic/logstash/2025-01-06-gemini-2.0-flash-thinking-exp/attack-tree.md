## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Logstash Itself (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_logstash_itself__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the overarching threat of exploiting weaknesses within the Logstash core or its extensions. Success here can grant significant control over the Logstash instance and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Logstash Core Vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_logstash_core_vulnerabilities__e_g___rce___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers research publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting the specific Logstash version in use. They then attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities, often leveraging readily available exploit code.
    *   **Action:** Research and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific Logstash version.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on how quickly the application is updated to patch known vulnerabilities).
    *   **Impact:** Critical (successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution, granting the attacker complete control over the Logstash server).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Logstash Plugins (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_logstash_plugins__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers identify the Logstash plugins being used by the application. They then research known vulnerabilities within these plugins, such as command injection or path traversal flaws. Crafted malicious input is then sent through Logstash to trigger these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Action:** Identify used plugins and research their known vulnerabilities. Craft malicious input that triggers the plugin vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (due to the large number of plugins and varying levels of security among them).
    *   **Impact:** Significant to Critical (depending on the functionality of the vulnerable plugin and the attacker's ability to leverage the vulnerability).

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Logstash Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_logstash_configuration__critical_node_.md)

This node signifies the danger of attackers gaining the ability to alter Logstash's configuration. Successful manipulation can lead to data redirection, code execution, and other severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Logstash Configuration Files (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_logstash_configuration_files__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to access the `logstash.yml` or pipeline configuration files directly. This could be achieved through exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, misconfigurations in file permissions, or by leveraging stolen credentials.
    *   **Action:** Exploit OS-level vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to access configuration files. Leverage stolen credentials or insider access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the hardening of the operating system and the effectiveness of access controls).
    *   **Impact:** Critical (gaining access to configuration files allows the attacker to completely control Logstash's behavior).

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Logstash Configuration via API (if enabled and insecure) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_logstash_configuration_via_api__if_enabled_and_insecure___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Logstash API is enabled for management purposes and lacks proper authentication or authorization, attackers can directly interact with the API to modify configurations.
    *   **Action:** Identify if the Logstash API is enabled. Attempt to access the API without proper authentication. Use the API to inject malicious configurations.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on whether the API is enabled and the strength of its security measures).
    *   **Impact:** Critical (successful API manipulation allows attackers to inject arbitrary configurations, potentially leading to data breaches or code execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data via Input Plugins (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_via_input_plugins__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject crafted malicious data through the input sources that Logstash is configured to monitor (e.g., application logs, network traffic). This data is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in downstream processing or the application itself.
    *   **Action:** Attack the input source directly by injecting crafted data. Exploit vulnerabilities within the input plugins themselves.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on the security of the systems generating the input data).
    *   **Impact:** Moderate to Significant (depends on how the malicious data is handled by subsequent stages of the pipeline and the receiving application).

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Weaknesses in Log Data Sanitization/Filtering (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_weaknesses_in_log_data_sanitizationfiltering__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify insufficient or poorly implemented sanitization and filtering rules within the Logstash configuration. They then craft malicious data designed to bypass these filters and reach the output stage, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in the output destination.
    *   **Action:** Identify insufficient sanitization or filtering rules. Craft malicious data that bypasses filters.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (imperfect sanitization and filtering are common).
    *   **Impact:** Moderate to Significant (depends on the vulnerabilities present in the output destination and the attacker's ability to exploit them).

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect Output to Attacker-Controlled Sink (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_output_to_attacker-controlled_sink__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers who have gained access to Logstash's configuration modify the output settings to redirect processed log data to a server or service under their control. This allows for the exfiltration of sensitive information.
    *   **Action:** Modify Logstash configuration to send output to an attacker-controlled sink.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (requires prior access to the configuration).
    *   **Impact:** Significant (successful redirection allows for the exfiltration of potentially sensitive data processed by Logstash).
