*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Logstash, data corruption within Logstash's processing pipeline, denial of service on Logstash.
*   **Affected Component:** Input plugins (Beats, TCP, UDP, etc.), Filter plugins (Grok, Mutate, etc.), Output plugins (Elasticsearch, Kafka, etc.), Logstash Core.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization at the source application level before logs are sent to Logstash.
    *   Use secure and trusted input plugins.
    *   Apply filtering and processing carefully, avoiding dynamic code execution or unsafe string manipulations within filters.
    *   Regularly update Logstash and its plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Filter Configuration](./threats/code_injection_through_filter_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** In certain scenarios, dynamic filter configurations or the use of scripting languages within filters (e.g., the Ruby filter) could be vulnerable to code injection attacks if not properly sanitized, leading to code execution within Logstash.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Logstash server, data breaches within Logstash's processing, compromise of the Logstash instance.
*   **Affected Component:** Filter plugins (especially scripting-based filters like the Ruby filter), Logstash Core's configuration processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using dynamic filter configurations where possible.
    *   If dynamic configurations are necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   Exercise extreme caution when using scripting languages within filters and ensure proper input sanitization.
    *   Enforce strict access controls to Logstash configuration files.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration through Output Destinations](./threats/data_exfiltration_through_output_destinations.md)

*   **Description:** If output destinations are compromised or insecure, attackers could gain access to sensitive log data being sent by Logstash.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized parties through Logstash's output.
*   **Affected Component:** Output plugins (Elasticsearch output, Kafka output, HTTP output, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure output destinations with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Use encrypted communication channels (e.g., TLS) for sending data to output destinations.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Output Destinations](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_output_destinations.md)

*   **Description:** Logstash configurations might inadvertently grant unauthorized access to output destinations, allowing malicious actors to interact with those destinations via Logstash.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, modification or deletion of log data in output destinations, potential compromise of the output destination.
*   **Affected Component:** Output plugins, Logstash Core's configuration management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Logstash's access to output destinations.
    *   Store credentials securely (e.g., using the Logstash keystore).
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring access to output destinations.

## Threat: [Exploiting Output Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_output_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)
