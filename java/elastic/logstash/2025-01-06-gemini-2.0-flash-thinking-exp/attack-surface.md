# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Attack Surface: [Input Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws within Logstash input plugins that process incoming data.

**How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's architecture relies on a modular plugin system for data ingestion. Vulnerabilities in these plugins directly expose Logstash to attacks.

**Example:** A vulnerable HTTP input plugin could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted request that triggers remote code execution on the Logstash server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep all Logstash input plugins updated to the latest versions.
*   Only use official and well-maintained plugins.
*   Regularly review the release notes and security advisories for input plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Output Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_output_configurations.md)

**Description:** Misconfigurations in Logstash output plugins that handle sending processed data to external systems.

**How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash connects to various external systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, databases, APIs) using output plugins. Insecure configurations in these plugins expose those downstream systems *through Logstash's actions*.

**Example:** An output plugin configured to send data to an Elasticsearch cluster using default or weak credentials could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Elasticsearch data *via the Logstash connection*.

**Impact:** Data Breach, Unauthorized Access to Downstream Systems, Data Modification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Use strong and unique credentials for all output destinations.
*   Securely manage and store credentials (e.g., using secrets management).
*   Enforce encryption for connections to output destinations (e.g., TLS/SSL).

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via Scripting Filters](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via_scripting_filters.md)

**Description:** The ability to execute arbitrary code within Logstash filter plugins, particularly using scripting languages like Ruby.

**How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash allows embedding script code within filter configurations for complex data transformations. This feature, if not carefully managed, can be exploited for malicious purposes *directly within Logstash*.

**Example:** An attacker who gains access to Logstash configuration files could inject malicious Ruby code into a `ruby` filter, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the Logstash server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, System Compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using scripting filters unless absolutely necessary.
*   Thoroughly vet and sanitize any external input that influences scripting filter logic.
*   Implement strict access controls on Logstash configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Plugins](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_plugins.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how Logstash plugins handle the deserialization of data, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**How Logstash Contributes:** Some plugins might deserialize data (e.g., Java serialization) received as input or during processing. If not handled securely, this can be a significant vulnerability *within the Logstash process*.

**Example:** A vulnerable input plugin might deserialize a malicious Java object, leading to arbitrary code execution when the object is processed by Logstash.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), System Compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using plugins that rely on insecure deserialization methods if possible.
*   Keep plugins updated to versions that address known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Input Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_input_endpoints.md)

**Description:** Logstash instances configured to receive data over network protocols without proper authentication or authorization.

**How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash can listen on various network ports for incoming logs. If these endpoints are not secured, attackers can send malicious data *directly to Logstash*.

**Example:** A Logstash instance configured to accept logs via the Beats input plugin without TLS and authentication could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary log data into the system.

**Impact:** Log Injection, Data Tampering, Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enable authentication and authorization for all network-based input plugins.
*   Use strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, certificates).
*   Enforce encryption for network communication (e.g., TLS/SSL).

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configurations](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configurations.md)

**Description:** Storing sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or database credentials directly within Logstash configuration files.

**How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's configuration files often contain credentials needed to connect to input and output sources. If these files are not properly secured, this information can be exposed *from the Logstash configuration*.

**Example:** Database credentials for an output plugin being stored in plain text within the `logstash.conf` file.

**Impact:** Data Breach, Unauthorized Access to External Systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
*   Use secure credential storage mechanisms (e.g., the Logstash keystore, environment variables, secrets management tools).
