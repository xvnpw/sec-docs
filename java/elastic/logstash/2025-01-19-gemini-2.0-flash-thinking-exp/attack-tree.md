## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Input Stage for Code Execution](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_input_stage_for_code_execution.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious log events containing payloads designed to execute commands on the Logstash host or arbitrary code within the Logstash process. This leverages vulnerabilities in how Logstash processes input data, potentially through scripting languages like Grok or Ruby, or by exploiting command injection flaws.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Attacker identifies a vulnerable input plugin or a weakness in Logstash's processing of log data.
        *   Attacker crafts a malicious log event containing a command injection payload or a script designed for execution.
        *   Logstash ingests the malicious log event.
        *   The payload is processed, leading to command execution on the host or code execution within Logstash.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Logstash host, access to sensitive data processed by Logstash, potential for further lateral movement within the application infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulating Configuration for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulating_configuration_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Logstash's configuration and modifies it to inject malicious filters or redirect output to attacker-controlled systems. This often involves exploiting weak permissions or default credentials.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Attacker exploits weak file permissions or default credentials to gain access to Logstash's configuration files or APIs.
        *   Attacker modifies filter definitions to inject malicious logic or code that will be executed during log processing.
        *   Alternatively, the attacker modifies output configurations to redirect logs containing sensitive information to a destination controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Impact:**  Control over log processing, allowing for data manipulation or injection of false information. Exfiltration of sensitive data through redirected logs. Potential for further compromise by injecting malicious code through filters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leveraging Default Credentials for Control](./attack_tree_paths/leveraging_default_credentials_for_control.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker uses default credentials (if not changed) to access Logstash's APIs or configuration interfaces, allowing them to modify settings and inject malicious configurations.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Attacker attempts to log in to Logstash's management interface or API using default credentials.
        *   If successful, the attacker gains administrative access.
        *   Attacker modifies Logstash settings, potentially injecting malicious filters, outputs, or other configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over Logstash's behavior, enabling data manipulation, exfiltration, or further system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Insecure File Permissions for Configuration Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_insecure_file_permissions_for_configuration_manipulation.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits overly permissive file permissions on Logstash's configuration files to directly access and modify them, injecting malicious configurations or stealing sensitive information.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Attacker identifies that Logstash configuration files have weak permissions.
        *   Attacker accesses the configuration files directly.
        *   Attacker modifies the configuration to inject malicious settings or extracts sensitive information like credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Control over Logstash's behavior, enabling data manipulation, exfiltration, or further system compromise. Exposure of sensitive credentials stored in configuration files.
