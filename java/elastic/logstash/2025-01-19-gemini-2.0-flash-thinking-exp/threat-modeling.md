# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Threat: [Malicious Log Injection leading to Command Execution](./threats/malicious_log_injection_leading_to_command_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects specially crafted log entries that, when processed by Logstash filters (especially those using `%{}` syntax or executing shell commands), result in the execution of arbitrary commands on the Logstash server. This is a direct consequence of how Logstash processes and transforms data.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Logstash server, potentially leading to data breaches, further attacks on internal networks, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:**
- Filter plugins (e.g., `grok`, `mutate` with `gsub`, `ruby` filter)
- Logstash core processing logic if not handling escape sequences properly.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all incoming log data before processing within Logstash.
- **Avoid Dynamic Command Execution:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of filter configurations that dynamically execute shell commands based on log content within Logstash. If necessary, use highly restricted and controlled environments.
- **Secure Input Sources:** While securing input sources is important, the focus here is on preventing exploitation *within* Logstash.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Logstash process with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Insecure Input Plugin Exploitation](./threats/insecure_input_plugin_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in a Logstash input plugin. This could allow for remote code execution on the Logstash server, information disclosure from the Logstash process, or denial of service of the Logstash instance. The vulnerability resides within the plugin's code executed by Logstash.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the Logstash server, potential access to sensitive data processed by Logstash, or disruption of log processing.

**Affected Component:** Specific input plugin (e.g., `tcp`, `udp`, `kafka`, `beats`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update all Logstash plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Use Trusted Plugin Sources:** Only install plugins from trusted and verified sources (e.g., the official Logstash plugin repository).
- **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Periodically scan the Logstash installation and its plugins for known vulnerabilities.
- **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only use necessary input plugins and disable or remove unused ones.

## Threat: [Malicious Filter Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_filter_configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Logstash configuration files and injects malicious filter configurations. These configurations are then interpreted and executed by Logstash, potentially leading to data exfiltration, log manipulation, or command execution on the Logstash server.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, compromise of the Logstash server, or disruption of log processing.

**Affected Component:**
- Logstash configuration files (`logstash.conf` and included files).
- Filter plugins.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Secure Configuration Files:**  Restrict access to Logstash configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
- **Configuration Management:** Use secure configuration management practices and tools to track and control changes to Logstash configurations.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the accounts that have write access to Logstash configuration files.
- **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly audit Logstash configurations for unauthorized or malicious changes.

## Threat: [Insecure Output Plugin Leading to Data Exposure (through plugin vulnerability)](./threats/insecure_output_plugin_leading_to_data_exposure__through_plugin_vulnerability_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within a Logstash output plugin itself. This could allow the attacker to manipulate how the plugin sends data, potentially redirecting it to an unintended destination or exposing sensitive information through insecure handling within the plugin's code.

**Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized parties, compliance violations.

**Affected Component:** Specific output plugin (e.g., `elasticsearch`, `kafka`, `file`, `http`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Secure Output Destinations:** While important, the focus here is on the plugin itself.
- **Secure Output Plugin Configuration:** Configure output plugins securely, but also rely on plugin developers to provide secure code.
- **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update output plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only use necessary output plugins and disable or remove unused ones.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Insecure Configuration Storage](./threats/information_disclosure_through_insecure_configuration_storage.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or internal network details required for Logstash to function, is stored insecurely in Logstash configuration files. An attacker who gains access to these files can directly obtain this sensitive information.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Logstash configuration files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Avoid Storing Secrets in Plaintext:** Do not store sensitive information directly in Logstash configuration files.
- **Use Secrets Management Solutions:** Utilize dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, CyberArk) to securely store and manage sensitive credentials and integrate them with Logstash.
- **Encrypt Configuration Files:** Encrypt Logstash configuration files at rest.
- **Restrict Access:** Limit access to Logstash configuration files to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Logstash Core](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_logstash_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the core Logstash application itself. This could allow for remote code execution on the Logstash server, information disclosure from the Logstash process memory, or denial of service of the Logstash instance.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Logstash server, potential access to sensitive data, or disruption of log processing.

**Affected Component:** Logstash core application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Keep Logstash Updated:** Regularly update Logstash to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Periodically scan the Logstash installation for known vulnerabilities.
- **Follow Security Best Practices:** Implement general security best practices for the server hosting Logstash, such as strong passwords, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
