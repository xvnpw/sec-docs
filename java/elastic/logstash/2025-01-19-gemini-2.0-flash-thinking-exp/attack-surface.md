# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Input Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_input_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Input plugins are responsible for ingesting data into Logstash. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can be exploited to inject malicious data or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's architecture relies on a plugin system, and the security of the overall system is dependent on the security of individual plugins. Logstash itself doesn't inherently validate the security of all available plugins.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the `http` input plugin could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request that triggers remote code execution on the Logstash server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data injection, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Logstash and all its plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Only use input plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Carefully review the documentation and security advisories for each input plugin.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization where possible, even before data reaches Logstash.
        *   Consider using a security scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Inputs](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_inputs.md)

*   **Description:** If input plugins don't require or enforce strong authentication, attackers can inject arbitrary logs into the system.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash can be configured to accept data from various sources, and if these sources are not properly secured, they become attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could send forged log messages to a Logstash instance listening on an open port without authentication, potentially poisoning logs or overwhelming the system.
    *   **Impact:** Log poisoning, resource exhaustion, injection of misleading data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization for input plugins that support it (e.g., Beats input with secret token).
        *   Restrict network access to Logstash input ports using firewalls or network segmentation.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) for input sources.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Input Plugins](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_input_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Some input plugins deserialize data (e.g., JSON, YAML). If not handled securely, this can lead to remote code execution.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's flexibility in handling various data formats necessitates deserialization, which can be a source of vulnerabilities if not implemented carefully in plugins.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable input plugin parsing YAML could be exploited by sending a malicious YAML payload that executes arbitrary code upon deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using input plugins known to have deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   If possible, configure plugins to avoid deserializing untrusted data.
        *   Implement security measures at the application level to sanitize data before it reaches Logstash.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Vulnerabilities in Filter Plugins (e.g., Ruby Filter)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_vulnerabilities_in_filter_plugins__e_g___ruby_filter_.md)

*   **Description:** Using scripting filters like the Ruby filter allows for complex data manipulation but introduces the risk of code injection if the script logic is not carefully controlled.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash provides powerful filter plugins, including scripting capabilities, which, if misused, can create security holes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious code into a log message that is then processed by a Ruby filter, leading to arbitrary command execution on the Logstash server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using scripting filters unless absolutely necessary.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate any data used within scripting filters.
        *   Restrict the permissions of the Logstash process to minimize the impact of potential code execution.
        *   Regularly review and audit the code within scripting filters.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Output Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_output_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Output plugins send processed data to various destinations. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can compromise downstream systems.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's role as a central log processing pipeline means that vulnerabilities in output plugins can have a wide-reaching impact on connected systems.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a database output plugin could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries, potentially compromising the database.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of downstream systems, data breaches, denial of service on downstream systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Logstash and all its output plugins updated.
        *   Only use output plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Carefully review the documentation and security advisories for each output plugin.
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization for connections to output destinations.
        *   Sanitize data before sending it to output destinations to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Logstash API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/logstash_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The Logstash API (typically on port 9600) allows for monitoring and management. Vulnerabilities in this API can grant unauthorized access and control.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash exposes an API for management and monitoring, which, if not properly secured, becomes a direct attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An unpatched vulnerability in the Logstash API could allow an attacker to remotely modify the Logstash configuration or even execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, configuration changes, remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Logstash API using firewalls or network segmentation.
        *   Enable authentication and authorization for the Logstash API.
        *   Keep Logstash updated to patch known API vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid exposing the Logstash API to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Security](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_security.md)

*   **Description:** Logstash configuration files contain sensitive information like credentials and connection details. Unauthorized access can lead to significant breaches.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash relies on configuration files to define its behavior, and these files often contain sensitive information necessary for its operation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to Logstash configuration files could retrieve database credentials used by an output plugin, allowing them to compromise the database directly.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, compromise of downstream systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to Logstash configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in configuration files. Consider using secrets management solutions or environment variables.
        *   Regularly review and audit Logstash configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/java_virtual_machine__jvm__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Logstash runs on the JVM. Vulnerabilities in the underlying JVM can be exploited to compromise the Logstash instance.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's dependency on the JVM means it inherits any security vulnerabilities present in the JVM.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in the JVM to gain control of the Logstash process or the underlying server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the JVM updated to the latest security patches.
        *   Follow security best practices for JVM configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The process of installing and managing Logstash plugins could be vulnerable if not handled securely.
    *   **How Logstash Contributes:** Logstash's plugin architecture requires a mechanism for installing and managing plugins, which can be a point of vulnerability if not secured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could potentially inject a malicious plugin into a Logstash instance if the plugin installation process is not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malicious code, remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources (e.g., the official Logstash plugin repository).
        *   Verify the integrity of plugin packages before installation.
        *   Restrict access to the Logstash server and the plugin management interface.
