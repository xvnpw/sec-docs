# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization within Logstash Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_within_logstash_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Logstash Filter Plugins:** Implement input validation and sanitization directly within Logstash pipelines using filter plugins like `grok`, `dissect`, `csv` for parsing and `mutate` for sanitization and data type conversion.
    2.  **Define Data Schemas in Filters:**  Within filter configurations, define expected data formats and schemas. Use conditional logic (`if` statements) to check for adherence to these schemas.
    3.  **Sanitize with `mutate` Filter:** Employ the `mutate` filter with functions like `gsub`, `strip`, `downcase`, `urldecode` to sanitize input fields. Remove or escape potentially harmful characters or patterns directly within the pipeline.
    4.  **Validate Data Types and Ranges in Filters:** Use `mutate` filter with `convert` to enforce data types. Implement conditional checks within filters to validate data ranges and allowed values.
    5.  **Drop or Quarantine Invalid Events:** Use the `drop` filter within conditional logic to discard events that fail validation. Alternatively, route invalid events to a dedicated output (e.g., a "quarantine" index in Elasticsearch) for review and debugging.
    6.  **Test Pipeline Validation Rules:** Thoroughly test Logstash pipeline configurations with valid and invalid input data to ensure validation rules are effective and do not cause unintended data loss or processing errors.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Log Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or commands into logs processed by Logstash, mitigating risks of code execution and downstream system compromise.
        *   **Pipeline Instability (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of malformed input data causing Logstash pipeline failures, ensuring consistent and reliable log processing.
        *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid or malicious data from corrupting the overall log dataset, maintaining data integrity for analysis.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Log Injection:** High impact - significantly reduces the risk of log injection attacks by sanitizing and validating data at the input stage.
        *   **Pipeline Instability:** Medium impact - improves the robustness and stability of Logstash pipelines by handling unexpected input gracefully.
        *   **Data Corruption:** Medium impact - enhances the quality and reliability of log data by filtering out invalid entries.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the `web-access-logs` pipeline using `grok` and basic `mutate` filters in `logstash.conf`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Input validation and sanitization are not comprehensively applied across all Logstash pipelines, especially for `application-logs` and `system-logs`. More advanced sanitization techniques and schema validation are needed within filter configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Input Sources Configuration in Logstash](./mitigation_strategies/secure_input_sources_configuration_in_logstash.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication in Input Plugins:** For network-based input plugins like `beats`, `http`, `tcp`, configure authentication options provided by the plugin (e.g., TLS client authentication for `beats`, basic/digest authentication for `http`).
    2.  **Implement Authorization in Input Plugins:** Utilize authorization features offered by input plugins (e.g., `allowed_hosts` in `beats`) to restrict connections to authorized sources based on IP addresses or other identifiers.
    3.  **Secure Credential Management for Inputs:** When configuring authentication, manage credentials securely. Utilize Logstash's keystore feature or environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials in configuration files.
    4.  **Configure TLS Encryption for Network Inputs:** For network-based inputs, always enable TLS encryption to protect log data in transit and prevent eavesdropping. Configure TLS settings within the input plugin configuration.
    5.  **Regularly Review Input Configurations:** Periodically review Logstash input configurations to ensure authentication and authorization settings are correctly configured and up-to-date.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Log Injection (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized systems from sending logs to Logstash, mitigating the risk of malicious log injection and data manipulation.
        *   **Data Confidentiality Breach (Medium Severity):** Protects the confidentiality of log data during transmission from input sources to Logstash by enforcing encryption and authorized access.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks by limiting log ingestion to authorized sources, preventing attackers from overwhelming Logstash with excessive traffic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Log Injection:** High impact - significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized log injection by controlling access at the input source level.
        *   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** Medium impact - enhances data confidentiality during log ingestion by securing communication channels and access.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium impact - improves resilience against input-based DoS attacks by limiting accepted sources.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for Beats input using TLS encryption in `logstash.conf` for `beats` pipeline.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Authentication and authorization are not fully configured for HTTP input.  Authorization based on source IP or API keys should be implemented for HTTP input. TCP/UDP inputs are currently open without authentication and need to be secured using plugin-level configurations if available, or by restricting network access externally.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Throttling within Logstash Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_throttling_within_logstash_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Logstash Filter Plugins for Rate Limiting:** Explore and implement filter plugins (if available and vetted) that provide rate limiting or throttling capabilities within Logstash pipelines.
    2.  **Implement Conditional Logic for Throttling:** Use conditional logic (`if` statements) within filter configurations to implement custom throttling mechanisms based on event counts or timestamps.
    3.  **Leverage Logstash Queue and Backpressure Settings:** Configure Logstash's internal queue settings and backpressure mechanisms to manage input rates and prevent pipeline overload. Adjust queue size and backpressure thresholds in `logstash.yml`.
    4.  **Monitor Pipeline Performance:** Monitor Logstash pipeline performance metrics (e.g., event rates, queue sizes, processing times) to identify potential bottlenecks and adjust rate limiting or throttling configurations as needed.
    5.  **Implement Alerting for High Input Rates:** Set up alerts based on monitoring data to notify administrators of unusually high input rates, which could indicate a DoS attack or system overload.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming Logstash with excessive log data, ensuring continued log processing and system availability.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of Logstash consuming excessive system resources due to uncontrolled input rates, maintaining system stability and performance.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** High impact - significantly reduces the impact of input-based DoS attacks by controlling the rate of log processing within Logstash.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium impact - improves resource management and system stability under high log volume conditions.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic rate limiting is configured at the network firewall level, but not within Logstash itself.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting and throttling are not implemented directly within Logstash pipelines using plugins or configuration settings.  Logstash's queue and backpressure settings are at default values and should be reviewed and potentially adjusted for better DoS protection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Masking and Redaction using Logstash Filters](./mitigation_strategies/data_masking_and_redaction_using_logstash_filters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize `mutate` Filter for Masking:** Employ the `mutate` filter with functions like `gsub` (regular expression substitution) to mask or redact sensitive data within log fields.
    2.  **Define Regular Expressions for Sensitive Data Patterns:** Create regular expressions within `gsub` functions to identify and mask patterns of sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, email addresses, API keys).
    3.  **Implement Conditional Masking:** Use conditional logic (`if` statements) within filter configurations to apply masking rules only to specific fields or event types that are known to contain sensitive data.
    4.  **Test Masking Rules Thoroughly:** Test masking rules with sample log data containing sensitive information to ensure that masking is effective and does not inadvertently redact non-sensitive data or break log usability.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Masking Rules:** Periodically review and update masking rules to account for new types of sensitive data or changes in log formats.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Confidentiality Breach (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive information from being exposed in logs processed and stored by Logstash, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) found in logs to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** High impact - significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure in logs by masking sensitive information before storage and analysis.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium impact - mitigates the risk of privilege escalation by removing or obfuscating credentials and other sensitive data from logs.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic masking is implemented for password fields in `application-logs` pipeline using `mutate` and `gsub` in `logstash.conf`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Data masking is not comprehensive and doesn't cover all types of sensitive data. Masking rules need to be expanded to cover API keys, PII, and other sensitive information across all relevant log pipelines using more robust regular expressions and potentially dedicated masking plugins if suitable ones are vetted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Output Destinations Configuration in Logstash](./mitigation_strategies/secure_output_destinations_configuration_in_logstash.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS Encryption in Output Plugins:** For network-based output plugins like `elasticsearch`, `kafka`, `http`, configure TLS encryption to secure communication with output destinations. Configure TLS settings within the output plugin configuration.
    2.  **Implement Authentication in Output Plugins:** Configure authentication options provided by output plugins (e.g., username/password for `elasticsearch`, SASL/PLAIN for `kafka`, API keys for `http`) to authenticate Logstash with output destinations.
    3.  **Secure Credential Management for Outputs:** Manage credentials for output destinations securely using Logstash's keystore or environment variables, avoiding hardcoding sensitive credentials in configuration files.
    4.  **Verify Server Certificates for TLS Outputs:** For TLS connections, configure Logstash to verify the server certificates of output destinations to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Configure certificate verification settings in the output plugin.
    5.  **Restrict Output Plugin Access:** Configure output plugin settings to limit access to specific indices, topics, or endpoints within the output destination, adhering to the principle of least privilege for Logstash's output operations.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Confidentiality Breach (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive log data during transmission to output destinations and at rest in the destination system by ensuring secure communication and authenticated access.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** Mitigates man-in-the-middle attacks during log data transmission by encrypting communication channels using TLS.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of unauthorized modification of log data in transit or at the output destination by ensuring secure and authenticated communication.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** High impact - significantly enhances the confidentiality of log data during output and at rest by securing communication and access to output destinations.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium impact - reduces the risk of eavesdropping and data manipulation during log data transmission to output destinations.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Medium impact - improves data integrity and authenticity during output by ensuring secure and authenticated communication.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Elasticsearch output is configured to use HTTPS for communication with Elasticsearch cluster in `logstash.conf`.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** Authentication is not fully enforced for Elasticsearch output. Username/password authentication should be configured for Elasticsearch output. Other output destinations (e.g., file output for archival) are not currently encrypted or authenticated and need to be secured based on their specific requirements using plugin configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Logstash and Plugins Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_logstash_and_plugins_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Patching Schedule:** Implement a regular schedule for patching Logstash core and all installed plugins. Define a process for testing and deploying updates.
    2.  **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor official Logstash security advisories and release notes for announcements of security vulnerabilities and updates.
    3.  **Automate Update Process (Where Possible):** Explore automation tools and techniques for streamlining the update process for Logstash and plugins, reducing manual effort and ensuring timely patching.
    4.  **Test Updates in Non-Production Environment:** Before applying updates to production Logstash instances, thoroughly test them in a non-production environment to identify and resolve any compatibility issues or unexpected behavior.
    5.  **Maintain Plugin Inventory:** Keep an inventory of all installed Logstash plugins and their versions to facilitate update management and vulnerability tracking.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting known security vulnerabilities in Logstash core and plugins that have been patched in newer versions.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity - Reduced Risk):** While updates cannot directly prevent zero-day exploits, staying up-to-date reduces the overall attack surface and ensures that patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities are applied promptly.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High impact - significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities by applying security patches.
        *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Medium impact - indirectly reduces risk by maintaining a more secure and up-to-date system.
    *   **Currently Implemented:**  Manual updates are performed on an ad-hoc basis when major Logstash versions are released.
    *   **Missing Implementation:** A regular patching schedule and automated update process for Logstash and plugins are missing. Monitoring of security advisories and a formal plugin inventory are not currently in place. A proactive and systematic approach to patching is needed.
