# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elastic/logstash

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Logstash-Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__logstash-focused_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Expected Input Format within Logstash:** For each input pipeline in Logstash, clearly define the expected log format (e.g., JSON, CSV, plain text) and data types for each field *within the Logstash configuration*.
    2.  **Implement Validation Filters in Logstash:** In Logstash pipeline configuration files, add `if` conditions and `mutate` filters *within the pipeline* to perform validation.
        *   Use `grok` or `json` filters *in Logstash* to parse the input and check format conformance.
        *   Use `mutate` filter with `convert` *in Logstash* to enforce data types (e.g., `convert => { "timestamp" => "date" }`).
        *   Use `if` conditions *in Logstash* to drop events that fail validation.
    3.  **Implement Sanitization Filters in Logstash:** Use `mutate` filter with `gsub` *in Logstash* to sanitize input fields.
        *   Escape special characters using `gsub` *within Logstash filters*.
        *   Remove or replace malicious patterns using `gsub` *within Logstash filters*.
    4.  **Test and Monitor Logstash Validation:** Test validation and sanitization filters *within the Logstash pipeline* with various inputs. Monitor Logstash logs *for dropped events and filter errors*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Log Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents malicious log entries from being processed by Logstash, mitigating downstream exploits.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Logs (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of storing and displaying malicious scripts embedded in logs processed by Logstash.
    *   **SQL Injection via Logs (Medium Severity):** Mitigates the risk of logs containing SQL injection payloads being processed by Logstash and potentially reaching vulnerable systems.
    *   **Data Corruption (Low Severity):** Prevents malformed input data from causing errors within Logstash processing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Log Injection Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **XSS in Logs:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **SQL Injection via Logs:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Corruption:** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `application-logs.conf` pipeline for Beats inputs. Basic sanitization using `gsub` for Elasticsearch indexing is present.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Validation and sanitization are missing for TCP and system logs ingested directly by Logstash. More comprehensive sanitization rules are needed across all pipelines.

Define thresholds and actions (e.g., drop, tag) *within the filter configuration*.
    2.  **Configure Logstash Resource Limits:**
        *   **JVM Heap Size (Logstash Configuration):** Adjust the JVM heap size for Logstash *in `jvm.options` or `logstash.yml`* based on expected load.

    3.  **Monitor Logstash Resource Usage:** Monitor Logstash resource usage (CPU, memory, JVM heap) and input queue sizes *using Logstash monitoring APIs or plugins*. Set up alerts for resource exhaustion or queue buildup *based on Logstash metrics*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents overwhelming Logstash itself with excessive log data, maintaining Logstash service availability.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Protects Logstash from resource exhaustion due to legitimate log spikes, ensuring Logstash stability.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):** Prevents performance degradation of Logstash due to uncontrolled log ingestion rates, ensuring efficient log processing.
*   **Impact:**
