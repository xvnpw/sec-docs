# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Elasticsearch Security Features (Authentication and Authorization)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_elasticsearch_security_features__authentication_and_authorization_.md)

### Description:
1.  **Install the Security Plugin:** Verify the Elasticsearch Security plugin is installed. For recent versions of the Elastic Stack, this is included by default.
2.  **Enable Security:** Set `xpack.security.enabled: true` in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file on each node in your Elasticsearch cluster. Restart nodes for the change to take effect.
3.  **Configure Authentication Realms:** Choose and configure an authentication realm. Options include the native realm (using Elasticsearch's internal user store), LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, or OIDC. Configure the chosen realm in `elasticsearch.yml` or using the Security API. For example, for the native realm, you would use the `elasticsearch-users` command-line tool or the Security API to create and manage users and their passwords.
4.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles using the `elasticsearch-roles` command-line tool or the Security API. Roles specify permissions for cluster actions, index access, and document-level security. Assign these roles to users using the `elasticsearch-users` tool or Security API.
5.  **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure Elasticsearch to use HTTPS for all communication. This involves generating or obtaining SSL/TLS certificates and configuring `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true` in `elasticsearch.yml`, along with specifying certificate paths.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Unauthenticated Access to Elasticsearch APIs (High Severity):** Prevents anyone without credentials from accessing Elasticsearch data and cluster management functions.
*   **Information Disclosure through Elasticsearch APIs (Medium Severity):** Restricts access to sensitive data and metadata to authenticated and authorized users only.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification or Deletion (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from altering or deleting data within Elasticsearch.

### Impact:
*   **Unauthenticated Access to Elasticsearch APIs (High Risk Reduction):**  Effectively eliminates the risk of unauthenticated access.
*   **Information Disclosure through Elasticsearch APIs (Medium Risk Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing access control.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification or Deletion (High Risk Reduction):** Prevents unauthorized data manipulation.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. Authentication is enabled for Kibana access using basic authentication against the native realm. HTTPS is enabled for Kibana access.

### Missing Implementation:
Authentication and RBAC are not fully enforced for application-to-Elasticsearch API interactions. Application currently uses a single, overly permissive user for all Elasticsearch operations. Granular RBAC based on application user roles is missing for Elasticsearch APIs used by the application. HTTPS is not enforced for application-to-Elasticsearch communication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Sensitive Elasticsearch APIs](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_sensitive_elasticsearch_apis.md)

### Description:
1.  **Identify Sensitive APIs:** Determine which Elasticsearch APIs expose sensitive information or administrative functions. Examples include `_cat` APIs (like `_cat/indices`, `_cat/nodes`), `_cluster/stats`, `_nodes`, `_cluster/settings`, and APIs for managing users and roles.
2.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Use Elasticsearch roles to restrict access to these sensitive APIs. Create roles that explicitly deny access to these APIs for users who do not require them.
3.  **Apply Roles to Users:** Assign these restrictive roles to users and application roles that should not have access to sensitive APIs. Ensure that only administrative users or specific service accounts with a legitimate need have access.
4.  **Test API Access Controls:** Verify that access to sensitive APIs is correctly restricted by testing with different user roles and API keys.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Information Disclosure through Elasticsearch APIs (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from gaining insights into cluster configuration, data structure, and potentially sensitive metadata through APIs.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of lower-privileged users exploiting sensitive APIs to gain higher privileges or access to restricted resources.

### Impact:
*   **Information Disclosure through Elasticsearch APIs (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of accidental or intentional information leakage through APIs.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Makes privilege escalation attempts more difficult by limiting access to administrative functions.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. Basic RBAC is in place for Kibana, but granular API access control for application users is not fully configured.

### Missing Implementation:
Need to define and implement roles that specifically restrict access to sensitive Elasticsearch APIs for application users and service accounts.  Currently, the application's Elasticsearch user likely has overly broad permissions, including access to sensitive APIs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Resource Limits for Elasticsearch Queries](./mitigation_strategies/set_resource_limits_for_elasticsearch_queries.md)

### Description:
1.  **Configure Query Limits in `elasticsearch.yml`:**  Modify Elasticsearch configuration file (`elasticsearch.yml`) to set limits on query resources. Key settings include:
    *   `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`: Limits the maximum number of clauses in a boolean query, preventing overly complex queries.
    *   `indices.query.query_string.max_determinized_states`: Limits the complexity of query string queries.
    *   `search.max_buckets`: Limits the maximum number of buckets allowed in aggregations.
    *   `search.max_concurrent_searches`: Limits the maximum number of concurrent searches executed on a node.
    *   `search.idle.after`: Sets a timeout for idle searches.
2.  **Implement Query Timeouts in Application:** Configure timeouts in your Elasticsearch client library when executing queries from the application. This prevents queries from running indefinitely and consuming resources.
3.  **Monitor Query Performance:** Regularly monitor Elasticsearch query performance and resource usage. Identify and optimize slow or resource-intensive queries. Adjust resource limits as needed based on monitoring data and performance testing.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion caused by excessively complex or resource-intensive queries, whether accidental or malicious.
*   **Performance Degradation (Medium Severity):** Protects cluster performance and stability by limiting the impact of poorly performing queries.

### Impact:
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by query overload.
*   **Performance Degradation (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Improves cluster stability and responsiveness under heavy load.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. Some default Elasticsearch resource limits are in place, but they may not be specifically tuned for the application's needs. Application-level query timeouts might not be consistently implemented.

### Missing Implementation:
Need to review and tune Elasticsearch query resource limits in `elasticsearch.yml` based on application requirements and performance testing. Implement consistent query timeouts in the application's Elasticsearch client interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Follow Elasticsearch Security Best Practices and Hardening Guides](./mitigation_strategies/follow_elasticsearch_security_best_practices_and_hardening_guides.md)

1.  **Review Official Documentation:** Consult the official Elasticsearch security documentation and hardening guides provided by Elastic. These documents contain comprehensive recommendations for securing Elasticsearch deployments.
2.  **Implement Recommended Configurations:** Systematically implement the security configurations recommended in the official documentation. This includes settings in `elasticsearch.yml`, security roles, and general deployment practices.
3.  **Regularly Review Security Settings:** Periodically review Elasticsearch security configurations to ensure they remain aligned with best practices and address any newly identified security recommendations.
4.  **Stay Updated on Security Advisories:** Keep up-to-date with Elasticsearch security advisories and announcements from Elastic to be aware of new vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **All Potential Threats (Severity Varies):** Addresses a broad range of potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations by adhering to established security best practices.

### Impact:
*   **All Potential Threats (Risk Reduction Varies - Overall Medium to High):**  Significantly improves the overall security posture by implementing a comprehensive set of security measures.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. Some basic security measures are in place, but a systematic review and implementation of all Elasticsearch security best practices has not been performed.

### Missing Implementation:
Need to conduct a thorough review of Elasticsearch security best practices and hardening guides and systematically implement the recommended configurations and practices across the Elasticsearch deployment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit within Elasticsearch](./mitigation_strategies/implement_data_encryption_at_rest_and_in_transit_within_elasticsearch.md)

### Description:
1.  **Enable Encryption at Rest:** Configure Elasticsearch to encrypt data at rest. This typically involves enabling encryption in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file and configuring an encryption key.  Elasticsearch offers features for encryption at rest, often requiring configuration of a keystore and enabling encryption settings.
2.  **Enforce HTTPS for All Communication:** Ensure HTTPS is enabled for all communication with Elasticsearch, both for client-to-cluster communication and inter-node communication within the cluster. This involves configuring `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true` in `elasticsearch.yml` and providing SSL/TLS certificates.
3.  **Rotate Encryption Keys Regularly:** Implement a process for regularly rotating encryption keys used for encryption at rest to limit the impact of key compromise.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Data Breaches due to Physical Media Theft or Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Encryption at rest protects data if storage media is physically stolen or accessed without authorization.
*   **Data Interception in Transit (Medium Severity):** HTTPS encryption prevents eavesdropping and data interception during network communication with Elasticsearch.

### Impact:
*   **Data Breaches due to Physical Media Theft or Unauthorized Access (High Risk Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches in case of physical security breaches.
*   **Data Interception in Transit (Medium Risk Reduction):**  Protects data confidentiality during network transmission.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. HTTPS is enabled for Kibana access, but might not be fully enforced for all Elasticsearch communication. Encryption at rest is likely not enabled.

### Missing Implementation:
Need to fully enable and enforce HTTPS for all Elasticsearch communication (including application-to-Elasticsearch and inter-node). Implement encryption at rest for Elasticsearch indices to protect data stored on disk.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Patching and Updates for Elasticsearch](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_patching_and_updates_for_elasticsearch.md)

### Description:
1.  **Monitor Security Advisories:** Regularly monitor Elasticsearch security advisories and release notes from Elastic for information on security vulnerabilities and patches.
2.  **Establish Patching Schedule:** Create a schedule for applying security patches and updates to Elasticsearch components, including Elasticsearch server, client libraries, and plugins.
3.  **Test Patches in Staging:** Before applying patches to production, thoroughly test them in a staging or non-production environment to ensure compatibility and avoid regressions.
4.  **Apply Patches Promptly:** Apply security patches promptly after testing to address known vulnerabilities and maintain a secure Elasticsearch environment.
5.  **Automate Patching Process:** Automate the patching process where possible using configuration management tools or orchestration platforms to ensure timely and consistent patching across all Elasticsearch nodes.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Exploitation of Known Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities (Severity Varies):** Addresses known security flaws in Elasticsearch software that could be exploited by attackers.

### Impact:
*   **Exploitation of Known Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities (Risk Reduction Varies - Overall Medium to High):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities by eliminating them through patching.

### Currently Implemented:
Partially implemented. OS and system-level patches are applied, but Elasticsearch-specific patching is less consistent and may be reactive rather than proactive.

### Missing Implementation:
Need to establish a proactive and automated patch management process specifically for Elasticsearch components. This includes regular monitoring for updates, testing in staging, and automated deployment of patches to production.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing of Elasticsearch](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_and_penetration_testing_of_elasticsearch.md)

### Description:

2.  **Engage Security Experts with Elasticsearch Knowledge:** Engage security experts who have specific knowledge and experience in Elasticsearch security to conduct audits and penetration testing.
3.  **Scope of Elasticsearch Audits:** Audits should cover Elasticsearch configuration reviews, access control assessments (RBAC), API security testing, and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities specific to Elasticsearch.
4.  **Remediate Identified Vulnerabilities:** Develop and implement a remediation plan to address any vulnerabilities or weaknesses identified during audits and penetration testing.
5.  **Track Remediation and Re-test:** Track the progress of remediation efforts and conduct re-testing to verify that vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed.

### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **All Potential Elasticsearch-Specific Threats (Severity Varies):** Proactively identifies a wide range of potential security threats and vulnerabilities specific to the Elasticsearch deployment that may not be apparent through other means.

### Impact:
*   **All Potential Elasticsearch-Specific Threats (Risk Reduction Varies - Overall Medium to High):**  Significantly reduces overall Elasticsearch security risk by proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

### Currently Implemented:
Not implemented. No regular security audits or penetration testing specifically focused on Elasticsearch security are currently conducted.

### Missing Implementation:
Need to establish a schedule for regular security audits and penetration testing specifically for the Elasticsearch environment. This should be incorporated into the overall security program and involve experts with Elasticsearch security expertise.
