## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Manipulation in Elasticsearch (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_manipulation_in_elasticsearch__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to alter the data stored within Elasticsearch to compromise the application's logic, display misleading information, or inject malicious content that the application might process or present to users. This can have severe consequences for data integrity and application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data During Indexing](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_during_indexing.md)

**Attack Vector:**  If the application fails to properly sanitize data before sending it to Elasticsearch for indexing, an attacker can inject malicious payloads. These payloads could include scripts that are later executed by the application when retrieving the data, or misleading data designed to alter the application's behavior or provide false information to users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., scripts, misleading data) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads__e_g___scripts__misleading_data___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the specific action of embedding harmful content within the data being indexed. This could involve cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, or data crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's data processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing Data in Elasticsearch](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_data_in_elasticsearch.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Attackers attempt to directly alter data already stored within Elasticsearch. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's API endpoints used to interact with Elasticsearch or by compromising the authentication credentials used to access the Elasticsearch API.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure API Endpoints for Data Modification (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_api_endpoints_for_data_modification__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The application exposes API endpoints that allow for data modification in Elasticsearch, but these endpoints lack proper security measures. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in these endpoints to bypass authentication or authorization checks and directly modify data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization Checks (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_checks__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers successfully circumvent the security mechanisms designed to verify their identity and permissions, allowing them to access and modify data without proper authorization. This can be due to flaws in the application's authentication logic or misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Elasticsearch Credentials (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_elasticsearch_credentials__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers obtain valid credentials for accessing the Elasticsearch API. This could be through various means, including exploiting credential leakage in application configuration files or infrastructure, or through social engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Credential Leakage in Application or Infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_credential_leakage_in_application_or_infrastructure.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Sensitive Elasticsearch credentials are inadvertently stored in insecure locations, such as application configuration files committed to version control, environment variables without proper protection, or other accessible locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Elasticsearch Functionality/API (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_elasticsearch_functionalityapi__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the features and API of Elasticsearch in unintended or malicious ways to compromise the application or its data. This can involve crafting specific queries or exploiting weaknesses in the API itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Search Query Language Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_search_query_language_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** The Elasticsearch Query DSL, while powerful, can be exploited if not handled carefully. Attackers can craft malicious queries to extract sensitive information they should not have access to, or to cause excessive resource consumption, leading to denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Query DSL Features for Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_query_dsl_features_for_information_disclosure.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific queries using the Elasticsearch Query DSL to bypass intended access controls and retrieve sensitive data that the application is not designed to expose. This might involve querying specific fields or indices that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization to Elasticsearch API (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_to_elasticsearch_api__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers circumvent the security measures protecting the Elasticsearch API, gaining unauthorized access to its functionalities and data. This allows them to perform actions they are not permitted to, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Insufficient Authorization Controls](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_insufficient_authorization_controls.md)

**Attack Vector:**  The authorization controls in place for the Elasticsearch API are not granular enough, or roles are assigned with overly broad permissions. This allows attackers, even with legitimate but limited access, to perform actions or access data beyond their intended scope.
