# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured HTTP Interface](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_http_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The Elasticsearch HTTP API is exposed without proper authentication or encryption.
    *   **How Elasticsearch Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elasticsearch, by default, provides an HTTP API for interaction. Without explicit configuration, this API can be accessible without authentication or over unencrypted connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker directly accesses the Elasticsearch API endpoint (e.g., `http://<elasticsearch_host>:9200/_cat/indices`) and can retrieve sensitive information about the indices and data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, cluster takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Elasticsearch security features (authentication and authorization).
        *   Configure TLS/SSL for the HTTP interface.
        *   Use a firewall to restrict access to the HTTP port (9200) to authorized IPs or networks.
        *   Avoid exposing the Elasticsearch HTTP interface directly to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default usernames and passwords for built-in Elasticsearch users (e.g., `elastic`).
    *   **How Elasticsearch Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elasticsearch provides default administrative users. If these are not changed, they become easy targets for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default `elastic` username and password to log in and gain full control over the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data breaches, data deletion, malicious configuration changes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the passwords for all default Elasticsearch users upon installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all Elasticsearch users.
        *   Consider disabling default users if not required and create specific roles with limited privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Elasticsearch Query DSL Injection](./attack_surfaces/elasticsearch_query_dsl_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Constructing Elasticsearch queries based on unsanitized user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious query clauses.
    *   **How Elasticsearch Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elasticsearch's powerful Query DSL can be manipulated if user input is directly incorporated into queries without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to search for products. An attacker inputs a malicious string that, when incorporated into the Elasticsearch query, allows them to delete all indices or retrieve data they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data deletion, bypassing security controls, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into Elasticsearch queries.
        *   Use parameterized queries or the Elasticsearch client's query builder to construct queries safely.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the application side before passing data to Elasticsearch.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when defining roles and permissions in Elasticsearch.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Vulnerabilities (Painless, etc.)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_vulnerabilities__painless__etc__.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch's scripting engine or writing insecure scripts that allow for remote code execution or sandbox escapes.
    *   **How Elasticsearch Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elasticsearch allows the execution of scripts (e.g., using Painless) for tasks like dynamic field calculation or custom analysis. If not handled carefully, this can introduce security risks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Painless scripting engine to execute arbitrary commands on the Elasticsearch server, potentially gaining full control.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable scripting if it's not absolutely necessary.
        *   If scripting is required, carefully review and test all scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Keep Elasticsearch and its scripting engine up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   Restrict the use of scripting to trusted users and applications.
        *   Utilize the scripting sandbox and its security features effectively.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Using outdated or vulnerable Elasticsearch plugins that contain security flaws.
    *   **How Elasticsearch Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Elasticsearch's plugin architecture allows extending its functionality, but these plugins can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly maintained or developed.
    *   **Example:** An outdated version of a popular Elasticsearch plugin has a known remote code execution vulnerability, which an attacker exploits to compromise the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, introduction of backdoors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install necessary plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all installed plugins up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly audit installed plugins for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to plugins.
