# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Indices](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_indices.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigured Elasticsearch security settings or a lack of authentication to gain unauthorized access to Elasticsearch indices. They might leverage tools or scripts to bypass security measures and directly access the Elasticsearch API. Once inside, they can read, modify, or delete sensitive data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach (sensitive data is exposed), data integrity compromise (data is modified or corrupted), data loss (data is deleted), potential compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

**Affected Component:** Security features (Roles, Users, Realms), Index API, REST API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable Elasticsearch Security features.
* Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege.
* Configure strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., native realm, LDAP, Active Directory).
* Regularly review and audit user permissions and roles.
* Secure the network by using firewalls to restrict access to Elasticsearch ports (9200, 9300).

## Threat: [Scripting Vulnerabilities (Painless)](./threats/scripting_vulnerabilities__painless_.md)

**Description:** If dynamic scripting is enabled (using the Painless scripting language), an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom scripts or the Painless engine itself to execute arbitrary code on the Elasticsearch server. This could be achieved by injecting malicious scripts through APIs that allow script execution (e.g., update by query, scripted fields).

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Elasticsearch server, leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, or installation of malware.

**Affected Component:** Painless scripting engine, Update By Query API, Scripted Fields, Ingest Pipelines with scripting.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable dynamic scripting if it's not absolutely necessary.
* If scripting is required, carefully review and sanitize all custom scripts.
* Keep Elasticsearch and its components updated to patch known vulnerabilities in the Painless engine.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any API endpoints that accept script input.
* Consider using allow-lists for scripting functionality instead of relying solely on blacklists.

## Threat: [Ingestion Pipeline Vulnerabilities](./threats/ingestion_pipeline_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in ingestion pipelines to inject malicious data or scripts that could compromise the Elasticsearch cluster or the data being indexed. This might involve crafting malicious data that exploits parsing vulnerabilities or injecting scripts that execute during the ingestion process.

**Impact:** Data corruption, remote code execution on ingestion nodes, denial of service, potential compromise of systems feeding data into Elasticsearch.

**Affected Component:** Ingest Pipelines, Grok processor, Script processor, other ingest processors.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully validate and sanitize data before it enters the ingestion pipeline.
* Avoid using untrusted or unverified custom ingest processors.
* Keep Elasticsearch and its ingest processors updated.
* Implement strict input validation for data entering the pipeline.
* Monitor ingestion pipeline performance and logs for anomalies.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Elasticsearch](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_targeting_elasticsearch.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Elasticsearch cluster with a large number of requests or malicious data, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash. This could involve exploiting specific API endpoints or vulnerabilities in the request handling process.

**Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of search and analytics functionality, potential data loss if the cluster crashes unexpectedly.

**Affected Component:** REST API, Transport Layer, Query execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting and request throttling at the application or network level.
* Configure resource limits within Elasticsearch (e.g., circuit breakers).
* Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
* Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the Elasticsearch cluster to handle expected loads.
* Monitor cluster performance and resource usage for anomalies.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party Elasticsearch plugins that are installed in the cluster. These vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Depends on the plugin and the vulnerability, but could range from data breaches and system compromise to service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Installed Elasticsearch plugins.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the plugin and vulnerability, potentially Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install necessary and trusted plugins.
* Regularly update all installed plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories for installed plugins.
* Consider implementing a plugin vetting process before installation.

## Threat: [Insecure Cluster Configuration](./threats/insecure_cluster_configuration.md)

**Description:** The Elasticsearch cluster is configured with insecure settings, such as default credentials, disabled security features, or overly permissive network access. Attackers can exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or compromise the cluster.

**Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data breach, data loss, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch configuration files (elasticsearch.yml), Security settings.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never use default credentials for built-in users.
* Enable and properly configure Elasticsearch Security features.
* Restrict network access to the cluster using firewalls.
* Regularly review and audit Elasticsearch configuration settings.
* Follow security hardening guidelines provided by Elastic.
