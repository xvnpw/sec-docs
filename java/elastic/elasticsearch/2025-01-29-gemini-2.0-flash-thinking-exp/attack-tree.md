## Attack Tree Path: [1. [1.1.1.1] Elasticsearch Exposed Without Authentication [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1___1_1_1_1__elasticsearch_exposed_without_authentication__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Network Scanning:** Attacker uses network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap, Masscan) to identify open ports, specifically Elasticsearch's default ports (9200, 9300).
    *   **Direct Access via Browser/API Client:** Once an open port is found, the attacker directly accesses Elasticsearch via a web browser or API client (like `curl` or Postman) using the Elasticsearch HTTP API endpoint (e.g., `http://<elasticsearch-ip>:9200`).
    *   **API Exploration:**  Without authentication, the attacker has full access to Elasticsearch APIs and can explore indices, data, cluster settings, and perform administrative actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [1.1.2.1] Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2___1_1_2_1__default_credentials__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Credential Guessing:** Attacker attempts to log in to Elasticsearch using default usernames and passwords. Common default credentials for Elasticsearch (though often disabled now in newer versions) might include `elastic`/`changeme`, `kibana`/`changeme`, or similar.
    *   **Brute-Force with Default Lists:**  Attackers may use automated tools that try lists of common default credentials against the Elasticsearch login interface.
    *   **API Authentication Bypass (if applicable):** In older versions or misconfigurations, default credentials might grant access to administrative APIs or bypass intended authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [1.2.1.1] Unpatched Elasticsearch Version [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3___1_2_1_1__unpatched_elasticsearch_version__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Version Detection:** Attacker identifies the Elasticsearch version running (e.g., by accessing the `/` endpoint which often reveals version information, or through banner grabbing).
    *   **CVE Database Lookup:** Attacker searches public CVE databases (like NIST NVD, Mitre CVE) for known vulnerabilities associated with the identified Elasticsearch version.
    *   **Exploit Acquisition:** If vulnerabilities are found, the attacker searches for publicly available exploits (e.g., on Exploit-DB, GitHub, security blogs).
    *   **Exploit Execution:** Attacker executes the exploit against the unpatched Elasticsearch instance to gain unauthorized access, achieve remote code execution, or cause denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [1.2.1.2] Publicly Available Exploits [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4___1_2_1_2__publicly_available_exploits__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Attacker uses vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) that include checks for known Elasticsearch vulnerabilities.
    *   **Manual Vulnerability Testing:** Attacker manually tests for known vulnerabilities using techniques described in public vulnerability reports or proof-of-concept exploits.
    *   **Exploit Execution:** Once a vulnerability is confirmed, the attacker uses publicly available exploits to compromise the Elasticsearch instance. This could involve remote code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [1.3.1.2] Disabled Security Features [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/5___1_3_1_2__disabled_security_features__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Configuration Analysis:** Attacker analyzes the Elasticsearch configuration (e.g., `elasticsearch.yml`) if accessible (through misconfiguration or access to the server).
    *   **API Exploration (Security API):** Attacker uses Elasticsearch's Security API (if accessible without authentication due to disabled security features) to confirm that security features like authentication, authorization, or TLS/SSL are disabled.
    *   **Exploitation of Unprotected Services:** With security features disabled, the attacker can leverage any of the direct exploitation methods described in points 1 and 2 (unauthenticated access, default credentials if they happen to work, etc.) and potentially other vulnerabilities that are normally mitigated by security features.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [2.2.1.1] Exploiting Lack of Input Sanitization in Application Queries [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6___2_2_1_1__exploiting_lack_of_input_sanitization_in_application_queries__critical_node___high_risk_72dd94cc.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Input Point Identification:** Attacker identifies application input points that are used to construct Elasticsearch queries (e.g., search forms, API parameters).
    *   **Query Injection Payload Crafting:** Attacker crafts malicious input payloads designed to manipulate the Elasticsearch query structure. This might involve injecting Elasticsearch query DSL syntax (JSON) into input fields.
    *   **Query Injection Execution:** Attacker submits the crafted input to the application. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize the input, the malicious payload is incorporated into the Elasticsearch query.
    *   **Exploitation of Query Injection:** The injected query can be used to:
        *   **Bypass Access Controls:** Retrieve data that the user should not have access to.
        *   **Exfiltrate Data:** Extract sensitive data from Elasticsearch indices.
        *   **Modify Data (if write access is possible):**  Inject or modify data in Elasticsearch.
        *   **Cause Denial of Service:** Craft resource-intensive queries to overload Elasticsearch.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [2.3.1.1] Sensitive Data Exposed in Elasticsearch Indices [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/7___2_3_1_1__sensitive_data_exposed_in_elasticsearch_indices__critical_node___high_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (via any of the direct exploitation methods above):** Attacker first gains unauthorized access to Elasticsearch through methods like exploiting unauthenticated access, default credentials, or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Index and Data Exploration:** Once inside Elasticsearch, the attacker explores indices and data to identify indices that contain sensitive information. This might involve looking at index names, field names, or sampling data.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attacker extracts the sensitive data from the identified indices. This can be done using Elasticsearch's API to query and download data, or by using tools to dump entire indices.
    *   **Data Breach:** The exfiltrated sensitive data can then be used for malicious purposes, leading to a data breach.
