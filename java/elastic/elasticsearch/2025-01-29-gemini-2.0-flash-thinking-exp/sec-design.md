Build Process Description:

The build process for Elasticsearch is likely automated using a CI/CD system like GitHub Actions, based on the GitHub repository.

Build Process Steps:
1. Developer makes code changes and pushes them to the Git repository (GitHub).
2. GitHub Actions CI pipeline is triggered by code push.
3. CI pipeline performs the following steps:
    - Code Checkout: Checks out the latest code from the Git repository.
    - Build: Compiles the code and builds the Elasticsearch project.
    - Automated Tests: Runs automated unit tests, integration tests, and other tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - SAST Scanner (Static Application Security Testing): Performs static code analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
    - Dependency Scanner: Scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - Container Image Scanner: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities if containerization is used for distribution.
    - Publish Artifacts: Builds and publishes build artifacts, such as Docker images and packages, to an artifact registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, cloud provider container registry).
4. Artifact Registry stores the build artifacts securely.
5. Deployment process retrieves build artifacts from the artifact registry and deploys them to the deployment environment (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).

Security Controls in Build Process:
- security control: Secure code repository (GitHub) with access controls and audit logging.
- security control: CI/CD pipeline automation to ensure consistent and repeatable builds.
- security control: Automated testing to catch bugs and vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
