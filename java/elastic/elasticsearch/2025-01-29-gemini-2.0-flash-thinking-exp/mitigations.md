    1.  **Verify Security Plugin Installation:** Ensure the Elasticsearch Security plugin is installed and enabled.
    2.  **Enable Security in Configuration:** Set `xpack.security.enabled: true` in `elasticsearch.yml` on each node.
    3.  **Set Initial Passwords:** Use `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` to set strong passwords for built-in users (`elastic`, `kibana_system`, etc.).
    4.  **Restart Elasticsearch Nodes:** Restart nodes for changes to apply.
    5.  **Configure Authentication Realms (Optional but Recommended):** Integrate with LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, or OIDC in `elasticsearch.yml` for external authentication.
    6.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** Use Security API or Kibana UI to create roles with granular permissions for indices, documents, and cluster actions.
    7.  **Assign Users to Roles:** Assign roles to users or API keys.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity)
        *   Data Breaches (High Severity)
        *   Data Manipulation (Medium Severity)
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity - related to unauthorized actions)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access: High reduction
        *   Data Breaches: High reduction
        *   Data Manipulation: Medium reduction

    *   **Missing Implementation:** LDAP integration, MFA, and more granular roles based on application features are missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Elasticsearch](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__within_elasticsearch.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Elasticsearch Roles:** Define roles based on required access to Elasticsearch resources (e.g., `read-only-logs`, `index-metrics`, `admin`).
    2.  **Define Roles in Elasticsearch:** Create roles using Security API or Kibana UI.
    3.  **Grant Granular Elasticsearch Permissions:** Assign permissions to roles, including:
        *   **Indices Permissions:** Control access to specific indices (`read`, `write`, `create_index`).
        *   **Document Permissions (Field & Document Level Security):** Restrict access to fields or documents within indices (advanced).
        *   **Cluster Permissions:** Grant cluster-level permissions sparingly (e.g., `monitor`, `manage_index_templates`).
    4.  **Assign Roles to Elasticsearch Users/API Keys:** Assign roles to users or API keys for controlled access.
    5.  **Regularly Review Elasticsearch Roles:** Periodically review and update roles and permissions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** More granular roles for application modules, field-level and document-level security for sensitive indices, and a formal role review process are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Bind Elasticsearch to Specific Interfaces](./mitigation_strategies/bind_elasticsearch_to_specific_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Internal Network Interface:** Determine the network interface intended for internal Elasticsearch communication (e.g., private network IP).
    2.  **Configure `network.host` in `elasticsearch.yml`:** On each Elasticsearch node, set `network.host` to the specific internal network interface IP address instead of `0.0.0.0` or a public IP.
    3.  **Verify Binding:** After restarting Elasticsearch, verify that it is only listening on the configured interface using `netstat` or similar tools.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized External Access (Medium Severity): Reduces the attack surface by limiting network interfaces Elasticsearch listens on, making it less directly accessible from external networks.
        *   Accidental Public Exposure (Medium Severity): Prevents accidental exposure of Elasticsearch services to the public internet if misconfigured.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized External Access: Medium reduction
        *   Accidental Public Exposure: Medium reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, Elasticsearch is configured to bind to internal network interfaces in production and staging. Configured in `elasticsearch.yml`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** No specific missing implementation for this strategy. Regularly verify the configuration remains correct.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use TLS/HTTPS for Elasticsearch Communication](./mitigation_strategies/use_tlshttps_for_elasticsearch_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate/Obtain TLS Certificates:** Get TLS certificates for Elasticsearch nodes (CA signed or self-signed for non-production).
    2.  **Configure TLS in `elasticsearch.yml`:** In `elasticsearch.yml` on each node, configure `xpack.security.transport.ssl` and `xpack.security.http.ssl` sections with certificate paths, key, and CA certificate (if applicable).
    3.  **Enable TLS for Transport Layer:** Set `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true`.
    4.  **Enable TLS for HTTP Layer:** Set `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true`.
    5.  **Enforce HTTPS (Optional):** Configure `xpack.security.http.ssl.client_authentication: required` (or `optional`) for client certificate authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Restrict Elasticsearch Scripting](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_restrict_elasticsearch_scripting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Scripting Needs:** Determine if scripting (Painless, etc.) is necessary for application functionality.
    2.  **Disable Scripting (If Not Needed):** If scripting is not required, disable it entirely by setting `script.allowed_types: none` and `script.allowed_contexts: []` in `elasticsearch.yml`.
    3.  **Restrict Scripting (If Needed):** If scripting is necessary:
        *   **Limit Allowed Languages:** Only allow Painless (`script.painless.enabled: true`) and disable other scripting languages.
        *   **Disable Inline Scripting:**  Disable inline scripting (`script.inline: false`) to prevent execution of arbitrary scripts directly in queries.
        *   **Use Stored Scripts:**  Use stored scripts and carefully control who can create and modify them.
    4.  **Restart Elasticsearch Nodes:** Restart nodes for scripting changes to take effect.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity): Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary code on Elasticsearch servers through scripting vulnerabilities.

        *   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Scripting is restricted to Painless only and inline scripting is disabled in production and staging. Configured in `elasticsearch.yml`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Stored scripts are not yet fully utilized. Review and hardening of existing stored scripts (if any) is needed. Consider disabling scripting entirely if application functionality allows.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Elasticsearch Query Size and Complexity Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_elasticsearch_query_size_and_complexity_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`:** Set a reasonable limit for the maximum number of clauses in boolean queries in `elasticsearch.yml` to prevent overly complex queries.
    2.  **Configure Circuit Breakers:** Elasticsearch has circuit breakers to prevent out-of-memory errors. Review and adjust circuit breaker settings (e.g., `indices.breaker.query.limit`, `indices.breaker.request.limit`) in `elasticsearch.yml` to protect against resource exhaustion from large queries.
    3.  **Application-Level Query Limits (Optional):** Implement query size and complexity limits in the application code as an additional layer of defense.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity): Prevents DoS attacks caused by sending excessively large or complex queries that overload Elasticsearch resources.
        *   Resource Exhaustion (High Severity): Protects Elasticsearch nodes from crashing due to memory exhaustion or CPU overload from resource-intensive queries.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): High reduction
        *   Resource Exhaustion: High reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Default circuit breaker settings are in place. `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` is set to a non-default value in production and staging. Configured in `elasticsearch.yml`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Elasticsearch Data Security Features (Field & Document Level Security, Encryption at Rest)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_elasticsearch_data_security_features__field_&_document_level_security__encryption_at_rest_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Determine which data indexed in Elasticsearch is considered sensitive and requires extra protection.
    2.  **Implement Field-Level Security (If Needed):** For sensitive fields, configure field-level security using Elasticsearch roles to restrict read access to authorized roles only. Define field permissions in role definitions.
    3.  **Implement Document-Level Security (If Needed):** For sensitive documents, configure document-level security using Elasticsearch queries within role definitions to control access based on document content or attributes.
    4.  **Enable Encryption at Rest:** Enable encryption at rest in `elasticsearch.yml` by configuring `xpack.security.encryption.encrypt: true` and setting up encryption keys. This encrypts data stored on disk.
    5.  **Restart Elasticsearch Nodes:** Restart nodes for data security feature changes to apply.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity): Further restricts access to sensitive data beyond index-level security.
        *   Data Breaches (High Severity): Reduces the impact of a storage compromise by encrypting data at rest.
        *   Data Exposure (Medium Severity): Prevents unauthorized viewing of sensitive fields or documents by users with broader index access.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Data Access: High reduction (for targeted data)
        *   Data Breaches: Medium reduction (at-rest encryption)
        *   Data Exposure: Medium reduction (field/document level security)

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Encryption at rest is enabled in production and staging. Configured in `elasticsearch.yml`. Field-level and document-level security are not yet implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Field-level and document-level security need to be implemented for indices containing sensitive data. Key management for encryption at rest needs to be reviewed and potentially improved.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Elasticsearch Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_elasticsearch_audit_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging in `elasticsearch.yml`:** Set `xpack.security.audit.enabled: true` in `elasticsearch.yml` on each node.
    2.  **Configure Audit Log Output:** Configure audit log output settings in `elasticsearch.yml` (e.g., log file path, format). Consider logging to a dedicated security index in Elasticsearch or an external SIEM system.
    3.  **Define Audit Event Categories (Optional):** Customize audit event categories to log specific types of events (e.g., authentication, authorization, index operations) in `elasticsearch.yml` under `xpack.security.audit.logfile.events.include`.
    4.  **Restart Elasticsearch Nodes:** Restart nodes for audit logging to be enabled.
    5.  **Regularly Review Audit Logs:** Implement a process for regularly reviewing and analyzing Elasticsearch audit logs for security monitoring and incident response.
