# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured REST API Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_rest_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Elasticsearch exposes a powerful REST API for data interaction and cluster management. If not properly secured, it becomes a direct entry point for attackers.
*   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch's core functionality relies on the REST API for all operations. Default configurations might not enforce authentication.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet, finds an Elasticsearch instance on port 9200 without authentication, and uses the API to delete all indices, causing data loss and service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, data loss, denial of service, cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Elasticsearch Security Features:** Utilize Elasticsearch's built-in security features (like Security plugin in Elastic Stack) to enforce authentication and authorization.
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication:** Use strong passwords or preferably API keys and consider multi-factor authentication where applicable.
    *   **Restrict Network Access:** Use firewalls to limit access to the Elasticsearch REST API only from trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
    *   **Disable Public Access:** Ensure Elasticsearch is not directly exposed to the public internet if not absolutely necessary. Use a reverse proxy or VPN for access.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Vulnerabilities (Painless)](./attack_surfaces/scripting_vulnerabilities__painless_.md)

*   **Description:** Elasticsearch allows scripting languages like Painless for dynamic queries and data manipulation. Vulnerabilities in the scripting engine or insecure scripting practices can lead to remote code execution.
*   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch's query DSL and ingest pipelines support scripting for advanced data processing.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious query with embedded Painless script that exploits a vulnerability in the scripting engine to execute arbitrary commands on the Elasticsearch server, gaining full control.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Elasticsearch Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Elasticsearch to the latest version to patch known scripting engine vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable Dynamic Scripting (If Not Needed):** If dynamic scripting is not essential, disable it to eliminate this attack vector.
    *   **Restrict Scripting Usage:** Limit the use of scripting to only necessary operations and carefully review and sanitize any user-provided input used in scripts.
    *   **Implement Script Security Context:** Utilize Elasticsearch's script security context to restrict the capabilities of scripts and limit potential damage.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection Attacks (NoSQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_attacks__nosql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly sanitized user input used in Elasticsearch queries can lead to NoSQL injection attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate query logic or extract unauthorized data.
*   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch queries are constructed using JSON and can be vulnerable if user input is directly embedded without proper validation and sanitization.
*   **Example:** An application takes user input to filter search results. An attacker injects malicious JSON into the input field that modifies the query to bypass access controls and retrieve data they are not authorized to see.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into Elasticsearch queries.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Use Query DSL Properly):** Utilize Elasticsearch's Query DSL in a way that separates query structure from user-provided data, preventing direct injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to access and query data, limiting the impact of potential injection attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of query construction logic to identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cluster Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cluster_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured Elasticsearch cluster settings, such as disabling security features or using insecure defaults, can significantly weaken the overall security posture.
*   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch offers numerous configuration options, and incorrect settings can inadvertently expose vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An administrator disables TLS for inter-node communication for performance reasons, exposing sensitive data transmitted between nodes to eavesdropping.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, cluster compromise, denial of service, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to Elasticsearch's official security best practices and hardening guides.
    *   **Enable TLS/SSL:** Enforce TLS/SSL for all communication, including REST API, transport layer, and inter-node communication.
    *   **Regularly Review Configuration:** Periodically review Elasticsearch cluster configuration to ensure security settings are correctly applied and up-to-date.
    *   **Use Security Templates/Policies:** Implement configuration management tools and security templates to enforce consistent and secure configurations across the cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Elasticsearch Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_elasticsearch_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Elasticsearch plugins extend functionality but can introduce vulnerabilities if they are not well-maintained, contain bugs, or are misconfigured.
*   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch's plugin architecture allows for extensibility, but plugins are third-party code and can have their own security flaws.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable version of a popular Elasticsearch plugin is installed. An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the plugin to gain remote code execution on the Elasticsearch server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the plugin vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be critical depending on plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Install only necessary plugins and avoid unnecessary extensions to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Use Reputable Plugins:** Choose plugins from trusted sources and with active community support and security updates.
    *   **Keep Plugins Up-to-Date:** Regularly update installed plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Plugins:** If possible, conduct security audits or penetration testing of installed plugins, especially those handling sensitive data or exposed to external networks.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Elasticsearch Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_elasticsearch_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of Elasticsearch exposes the system to known vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions.
*   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Like any software, Elasticsearch has vulnerabilities that are discovered and fixed over time. Older versions lack these fixes.
*   **Example:** A known remote code execution vulnerability exists in an older version of Elasticsearch. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise a system running the outdated version.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be critical depending on the age and vulnerabilities in the outdated version)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Elasticsearch:** Establish a process for regularly updating Elasticsearch to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Periodically scan the Elasticsearch instance for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Patch Management:** Implement a robust patch management process to ensure timely application of security updates.
