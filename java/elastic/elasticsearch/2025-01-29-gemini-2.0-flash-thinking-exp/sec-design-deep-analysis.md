### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

#### 2.1 API Gateway (RESTful API)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Exposure to External Threats:** As the entry point for users, applications, and other systems, the API Gateway is directly exposed to external networks and potential threats like unauthorized access attempts, DDoS attacks, and API-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, broken authentication).
*   **Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses:**  If authentication and authorization mechanisms are not robustly implemented or misconfigured, unauthorized users or applications could gain access to sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper input validation on API endpoints can lead to injection attacks (e.g., query injection, script injection) that could compromise data integrity or system availability.
*   **Data Leakage:** Insufficient output encoding or overly verbose error messages could inadvertently leak sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
