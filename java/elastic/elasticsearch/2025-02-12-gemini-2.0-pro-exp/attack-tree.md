## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration (Goal 1) - High-Risk Paths](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration__goal_1__-_high-risk_paths.md)

*   **[MA] Missing Authentication/Authorization:**
    *   **Description:** The Elasticsearch cluster is deployed without any authentication mechanisms enabled.  This allows anyone with network access to the cluster to freely access and modify data.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Directly accessing the Elasticsearch API (default port 9200) without providing any credentials.
        *   Using default credentials (if they haven't been changed).
    *  Likelihood: Medium
    *  Impact: Very High
    *  Effort: Very Low
    *  Skill Level: Very Low
    *  Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   **[LA] Weak Authentication:**
    *   **Description:** The Elasticsearch cluster uses weak or easily guessable passwords, or relies solely on basic authentication without multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Dictionary attacks using lists of common passwords.
        *   Brute-force attacks trying various password combinations.
    *  Likelihood: High
    *  Impact: Very High
    *  Effort: Low
    *  Skill Level: Low
    *  Detection Difficulty: Medium

*   **[EA] Misconfigured Network Security (Public Exposure):**
    *   **Description:** The Elasticsearch API port (default 9200) is exposed to the public internet without proper firewall rules or network segmentation.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Port scanning to identify exposed Elasticsearch instances.
        *   Directly accessing the API from anywhere on the internet.
    *  Likelihood: Medium
    *  Impact: Very High
    *  Effort: Very Low
    *  Skill Level: Very Low
    *  Detection Difficulty: Low

*   **[IA] Leaked Credentials:**
    *   **Description:** Elasticsearch credentials (usernames and passwords) are exposed in insecure locations.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Credentials hardcoded in application code.
        *   Credentials exposed in Git repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
        *   Credentials stored in unencrypted configuration files.
        *   Credentials shared via insecure channels (e.g., email, chat).
    *  Likelihood: Medium
    *  Impact: Very High
    *  Effort: Varies
    *  Skill Level: Varies
    *  Detection Difficulty: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Availability (Goal 2) - High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_availability__goal_2__-_high-risk_path.md)

*   **[RA] Resource Exhaustion (DoS/DDoS):**
    *   **Description:**  Overwhelming the Elasticsearch cluster with requests, consuming excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Sending a large number of complex search queries.
        *   Sending a large number of indexing requests.
        *   Exploiting any feature that can consume significant resources.
        *   Using botnets to amplify the attack (DDoS).
    *  Likelihood: Medium
    *  Impact: High
    *  Effort: Low to Medium
    *  Skill Level: Low to Medium
    *  Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Control (Goal 3) - High-Risk Path](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_control__goal_3__-_high-risk_path.md)

* **[GA] Dictionary/Brute-Force Attacks:**
    *   **Description:**  Systematically trying different username and password combinations to gain access to the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Using lists of common usernames and passwords (dictionary attacks).
        *   Trying all possible combinations of characters (brute-force attacks).
        *   Using leaked credentials from other breaches.
    *  Likelihood: Medium
    *  Impact: Very High
    *  Effort: Low to Medium
    *  Skill Level: Low
    *  Detection Difficulty: Medium
