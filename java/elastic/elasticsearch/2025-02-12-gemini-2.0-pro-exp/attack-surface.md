# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Attack Surface: [1. Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/1__network_exposure.md)

*   *Description:* Unauthorized access to Elasticsearch's network ports (typically 9200 for HTTP and 9300 for transport).
    *   *Elasticsearch Contribution:* Elasticsearch, by default, listens on network ports for communication. Misconfiguration or lack of network security can expose these ports directly to attackers.
    *   *Example:* An attacker scans for open port 9200 on public IP addresses and finds an exposed Elasticsearch instance without authentication.
    *   *Impact:* Complete data compromise (read, write, delete), cluster takeover, potential for remote code execution.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Firewall:** Configure firewalls (host-based and network-based) to *strictly* limit access to ports 9200 and 9300 to only authorized IP addresses/networks.
        *   **Network Binding:** Configure Elasticsearch to bind to a specific, internal network interface (e.g., `network.host: 192.168.1.10`) instead of `0.0.0.0`.
        *   **Reverse Proxy:** Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) with TLS encryption and authentication *in front* of Elasticsearch. This adds a layer of security and allows for more complex access control.
        *   **Elasticsearch Security:** Enable and *enforce* Elasticsearch's built-in security features (X-Pack/Security). This is mandatory for production.

## Attack Surface: [2. Authentication Bypass/Weak Authentication](./attack_surfaces/2__authentication_bypassweak_authentication.md)

*   *Description:* Accessing Elasticsearch without proper authentication or using weak/default credentials.
    *   *Elasticsearch Contribution:* Older versions of Elasticsearch did not enable security by default. Even with security enabled, weak or default passwords can be exploited directly against the Elasticsearch API.
    *   *Example:* An attacker uses the default `elastic` user with a well-known default password (or no password) to gain administrative access.
    *   *Impact:* Complete data compromise, cluster takeover, potential for remote code execution.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Enable Security:** *Always* enable Elasticsearch Security (X-Pack/Security).
        *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong, unique passwords for *all* users, including built-in accounts. Use a password manager.
        *   **Centralized Authentication:** Integrate with external identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory, SAML, OpenID Connect) for centralized user management and stronger authentication policies, which then control access to Elasticsearch.
        *   **API Key Management:** If using API keys, store them securely, rotate them regularly, and use restricted keys with limited privileges, all managed *within Elasticsearch*.

## Attack Surface: [3. Authorization Failures (RBAC Issues)](./attack_surfaces/3__authorization_failures__rbac_issues_.md)

*   *Description:* Users having excessive privileges within Elasticsearch, allowing them to access or modify data they shouldn't.
    *   *Elasticsearch Contribution:* Elasticsearch provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), but it must be configured correctly *within Elasticsearch*. Misconfigured roles or overly permissive defaults can lead to privilege escalation.
    *   *Example:* A user with read-only access to a specific index is able to delete documents or access other indices due to a misconfigured role *within Elasticsearch*.
    *   *Impact:* Data breaches, data modification, potential for denial of service.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Implement RBAC *within Elasticsearch* with the *least privilege* necessary. Grant only the specific permissions required.
        *   **Granular Roles:** Define granular roles *within Elasticsearch* with specific index, document, and field-level permissions.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit user roles and permissions *within Elasticsearch* to ensure they are still appropriate.

## Attack Surface: [4. Scripting Vulnerabilities (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/4__scripting_vulnerabilities__rce_.md)

*   *Description:* Exploitation of Elasticsearch's scripting capabilities to execute arbitrary code on the Elasticsearch server.
    *   *Elasticsearch Contribution:* Elasticsearch allows scripting (Painless, etc.) for advanced functionality. If user-supplied input is used in scripts *within Elasticsearch* without proper sanitization, it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) *on the Elasticsearch nodes*.
    *   *Example:* An attacker injects malicious code into a search query parameter that is used directly in a Painless script *within Elasticsearch*, allowing them to execute commands on the Elasticsearch server.
    *   *Impact:* Complete server compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement within the network.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Disable Dynamic Scripting (If Possible):** If dynamic scripting is not *absolutely* required, disable it entirely (`script.allowed_types: none` *in `elasticsearch.yml`*).
        *   **Use Painless (and Sanitize):** If dynamic scripting is needed, use Painless. *Crucially*, sanitize and validate *all* user-supplied input before using it in *any* script *within Elasticsearch*. Never directly embed user input.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries and avoid string concatenation when building queries that include user input, specifically within the context of Elasticsearch queries.
        *   **Context Restrictions:** Restrict the contexts in which scripts can be used (e.g., only allow scripts in specific Elasticsearch APIs).
        *   **Regex Limits:** Use `script.painless.regex.enabled: false` *in `elasticsearch.yml`* or carefully control regex complexity in Painless scripts.

## Attack Surface: [5. Search Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/5__search_query_injection.md)

*   *Description:* Manipulating Elasticsearch search queries to bypass security controls or access unauthorized data.
    *   *Elasticsearch Contribution:* Elasticsearch uses a query language (Query DSL) that can be vulnerable to injection if user input is not handled correctly *when constructing queries to Elasticsearch*.
    *   *Example:* An attacker crafts a search query *sent to Elasticsearch* that bypasses a filter intended to restrict access to certain documents.
    *   *Impact:* Data breaches, unauthorized data access, potential for denial of service.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Query DSL:** Use the Elasticsearch Query DSL (structured JSON) instead of raw string queries whenever possible.
        *   **Input Validation:** *Thoroughly* validate and sanitize all user-supplied input used in search queries *before sending them to Elasticsearch*. Escape special characters appropriately.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries where available to prevent injection, specifically within the context of Elasticsearch queries.

## Attack Surface: [6. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/6__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   *Description:* Overwhelming Elasticsearch with requests that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk), making it unavailable.
    *   *Elasticsearch Contribution:* Elasticsearch is a distributed system, but it can be vulnerable to DoS attacks if not configured properly *within Elasticsearch itself*. Complex queries, large result sets, and excessive indexing can all contribute.
    *   *Example:* An attacker sends a large number of complex aggregation queries *to Elasticsearch* with deeply nested structures, causing the Elasticsearch cluster to become unresponsive.
    *   *Impact:* Service unavailability, data loss (if writes are blocked), potential for cascading failures.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Circuit Breakers:** Configure Elasticsearch's circuit breakers (`indices.breaker.*` settings *in `elasticsearch.yml`*) to limit resources.
        *   **Query Limits:** Limit the `size` parameter in search requests and the complexity of aggregations (e.g., `search.max_buckets` *in `elasticsearch.yml`*).
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor cluster resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set alerts for unusual activity *within Elasticsearch*.
        *   **Dedicated Nodes:** Consider using dedicated coordinating-only nodes to handle search requests and offload processing from data nodes *within the Elasticsearch cluster*.
        *   **Avoid Leading Wildcards:** Minimize or avoid leading wildcard queries (`*value`) *in Elasticsearch queries*, as they are very expensive.

## Attack Surface: [7. Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/7__unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

*   *Description:* Failure to apply security patches for known vulnerabilities in the Elasticsearch software itself.
    *   *Elasticsearch Contribution:* Like all software, Elasticsearch has vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time. The vulnerability exists *within Elasticsearch*.
    *   *Example:* An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of *the Elasticsearch software* to gain access to the cluster.
    *   *Impact:* Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from data breaches to complete system compromise.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Regular Updates:** Update *the Elasticsearch software* to the latest stable version *promptly* after releases. Subscribe to security announcements from Elastic.
        *   **Patching Process:** Implement a robust and timely patching process *for Elasticsearch*.
