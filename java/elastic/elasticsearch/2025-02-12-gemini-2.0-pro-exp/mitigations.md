# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Configure Security Features](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_configure_security_features.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and fully configure Elasticsearch's built-in security features (authentication, authorization, TLS).

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Security:** Modify the `elasticsearch.yml` file on *every* node in the cluster. Set `xpack.security.enabled: true`. Restart each node.
2.  **Initial Setup:** Use the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` utility (or manual API calls) to set passwords for built-in users (elastic, kibana, logstash_system, etc.). *Immediately* change the default `elastic` password.
3.  **Create Application User:** Create a dedicated user for your application with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  *Never* use the `elastic` user for application access.  Use the Elasticsearch API or Kibana to manage users.
4.  **Define Roles:** Create roles that map to specific application functions (e.g., "data_reader," "data_writer," "index_admin"). Assign granular permissions to each role using the Elasticsearch API or Kibana. Permissions include cluster-level, index-level, and potentially field/document-level access control.
5.  **Assign Roles to Users:** Assign the appropriate roles to the application user and any other users who need access to Elasticsearch via the API or Kibana.
6.  **Enable TLS:** Configure TLS for both the transport layer (node-to-node communication) and the HTTP layer (client-to-node communication). Generate certificates, configure `elasticsearch.yml` with the certificate paths (`xpack.security.transport.ssl.*` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.*` settings).
7.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly (e.g., monthly) review user accounts, roles, and permissions using the Elasticsearch API or Kibana. Remove inactive users and refine permissions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents access without valid credentials managed *within* Elasticsearch.
*   **Data Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Limits data access based on roles defined *within* Elasticsearch.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents users from gaining more privileges than assigned through Elasticsearch's role management.
*   **Data Tampering (Severity: High):** Limits data modification based on roles defined *within* Elasticsearch.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Severity: High):** TLS encryption, configured *within* Elasticsearch, prevents eavesdropping.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (with proper role configuration).
*   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (with proper role and FLS/DLS configuration).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Security is enabled in `elasticsearch.yml` on all nodes.
*   Basic roles ("reader," "writer") are defined.
*   TLS is enabled for the HTTP layer.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   TLS is *not* enabled for the transport layer (inter-node communication).
*   Roles are not granular enough; "writer" role has too many permissions.
*   No regular audit process for user accounts and roles.
*   Application still uses a user with excessive privileges.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits (Circuit Breakers & Query Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits__circuit_breakers_&_query_settings_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Elasticsearch's built-in resource limits to prevent denial-of-service.

**Description:**
1.  **Circuit Breakers:** Modify `elasticsearch.yml` to set appropriate limits for circuit breakers.  Key settings include:
    *   `indices.breaker.total.limit`: Overall memory limit.
    *   `indices.breaker.request.limit`: Per-request memory limit.
    *   `indices.breaker.fielddata.limit`: Field data memory limit.
    *   Start with conservative values and adjust based on monitoring data from Elasticsearch itself.
2.  **Query Complexity:** Limit the complexity of boolean queries using `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` in `elasticsearch.yml`.
3.  **Concurrent Searches:** Control concurrent searches and shards per search using settings like `search.max_concurrent_shard_requests` in `elasticsearch.yml`.
4.  **Dynamic Updates:** Use the Cluster Update Settings API to adjust these limits dynamically *without* restarting, based on real-time monitoring data from Elasticsearch.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents resource-intensive queries from overwhelming the *Elasticsearch cluster itself*.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents legitimate users from accidentally consuming all resources *within Elasticsearch*.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Default circuit breaker settings are in place.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Circuit breaker settings have not been tuned.
*   `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` is not explicitly set.
*   No dynamic adjustment of limits based on monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Scripting Controls (Disable Dynamic or Use Painless Securely)](./mitigation_strategies/scripting_controls__disable_dynamic_or_use_painless_securely_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Disable dynamic scripting if possible; if required, use *only* Painless and sanitize all inputs *within the context of Elasticsearch*.

**Description:**
1.  **Disable Dynamic Scripting (Preferred):** In `elasticsearch.yml`, set `script.allowed_types: none`. This is the most secure option.
2.  **Use Painless (If Necessary):** If scripting is required, use *only* Painless.
3.  **Parameterized Scripts:** Use the `params` object to pass values to Painless scripts, rather than embedding them directly in the script code. This is handled *within* the Elasticsearch query/script context.
4.  **Contextual Input Validation:** While general input validation is important, focus on validating inputs *within the context of the Painless script* to ensure they are safe for use within Elasticsearch's scripting engine. This might involve checking data types or lengths *before* they are used in script logic.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents arbitrary code execution *on the Elasticsearch nodes*.
*   **Script Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents malicious code injection *into Elasticsearch scripts*.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Tampering (Severity: High):** Limits the ability to use scripts for unauthorized data access or modification *within Elasticsearch*.

**Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (disabled) or Low (Painless, secure use).
*   **Script Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The application does not use dynamic scripting.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `script.allowed_types` is not explicitly set to `none`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Field and Document Level Security (FLS/DLS)](./mitigation_strategies/field_and_document_level_security__flsdls_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Field Level Security (FLS) and Document Level Security (DLS) to restrict access to specific data *within* indices.

**Description:**
1.  **Field Level Security (FLS):** Define roles (using the Elasticsearch API or Kibana) that restrict access to specific *fields* within documents.  For example, hide sensitive fields like PII from certain roles. This is configured *entirely within Elasticsearch*.
2.  **Document Level Security (DLS):** Define roles that restrict access to entire *documents* based on queries. For example, only allow users to see documents related to their department. This is also configured *entirely within Elasticsearch*.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** FLS and DLS are implemented as part of Elasticsearch's RBAC system. Carefully design your roles and permissions to enforce the principle of least privilege.
4. **Data Modeling:** Consider how your data is structured and indexed to best support FLS and DLS.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Even if an attacker gains access to an index, FLS/DLS limits the data they can see *within that index*.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):** Prevents users from accessing sensitive fields or documents they shouldn't see, even if they have access to the index.
*   **Data Tampering (Severity: High):** While FLS/DLS primarily control read access, they indirectly limit tampering by restricting what data is visible for modification.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Breaches:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (in conjunction with other security measures).
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (requires additional write access controls).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   FLS and DLS are not implemented. All users with read access to an index can see all fields and documents.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and configure Elasticsearch's built-in audit logging.

**Description:**
1. **Enable Audit Logging:** In `elasticsearch.yml`, set `xpack.security.audit.enabled: true`.
2. **Configure Output:** Choose where audit logs are stored (e.g., file, index). Configure settings like `xpack.security.audit.outputs`.
3. **Log Retention:** Configure audit log retention policies to meet compliance requirements and manage storage space.
4. **Index Audit Logs (Optional):** If storing audit logs in an index, use Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) to manage the lifecycle of the audit log indices (rollover, deletion, etc.).

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Non-Repudiation (Severity: Medium):** Provides a record of actions performed on the cluster, making it difficult to deny actions.
* **Intrusion Detection (Severity: Medium):** Audit logs can be used to detect suspicious activity and potential security breaches.
* **Compliance (Severity: Varies):** Helps meet compliance requirements that mandate audit logging.

**Impact:**
* **Non-Repudiation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
* **Intrusion Detection:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (when combined with active monitoring of logs).
* **Compliance:** Risk reduced to meet specific compliance requirements.

**Currently Implemented:**
* None.

**Missing Implementation:**
* Audit logging is not enabled. There is no record of actions performed on the cluster.
