    *   Support multiple authentication mechanisms, including native realm, LDAP, Active Directory, and API keys.
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Provide options for multi-factor authentication.

## BUILD

The Elasticsearch build process is complex and involves multiple tools and stages. It uses Gradle as the build system.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer")
    GitHubRepository("GitHub Repository (elastic/elasticsearch)")
    Jenkins("Jenkins CI")
    ArtifactRepository("Artifact Repository (e.g., Artifactory)")
    ReleaseArtifacts("Release Artifacts (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz, Docker images)")

    Developer -- "Commits code" --> GitHubRepository
    GitHubRepository -- "Triggers build" --> Jenkins
    Jenkins -- "Runs build tasks (compile, test, package)" --> GitHubRepository
    Jenkins -- "Publishes artifacts" --> ArtifactRepository
    ArtifactRepository -- "Provides artifacts" --> ReleaseArtifacts

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code changes to the Elasticsearch repository on GitHub.
2.  The GitHub repository is configured to trigger builds in Jenkins CI upon new commits.
3.  Jenkins clones the repository and executes the build tasks defined in the Gradle build scripts.
4.  Build tasks include:
    *   Compiling the Java code.
    *   Running unit tests, integration tests, and other types of tests.
    *   Performing static code analysis (SAST) using tools like SpotBugs and Error Prone.
    *   Checking for license compliance.
    *   Packaging the software into various formats (e.g., .zip, .tar.gz, Docker images).
    *   Generating documentation.
5.  Jenkins publishes the build artifacts to an artifact repository (e.g., Artifactory).
6.  Release artifacts are made available for download and deployment.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Source Code Management (SCM) with access control and audit trails (GitHub).
*   security control: Continuous Integration (CI) system (Jenkins) to automate builds and testing.
*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools integrated into the build process.
*   security control: Dependency management to track and manage third-party libraries.
*   security control: License compliance checks.
*   security control: Artifact signing and verification (not explicitly mentioned in the provided information, but a common practice).
*   security control: Build environment security (e.g., securing Jenkins servers, restricting access to build agents).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data ingestion: Ensuring data can be reliably ingested into Elasticsearch from various sources.
*   Data storage: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data stored in Elasticsearch.
*   Search and analytics: Providing fast and accurate search and analytics capabilities.
*   Data visualization: Enabling users to effectively visualize and understand their data.
*   System availability: Maintaining high availability and uptime of the Elasticsearch cluster.

Data Sensitivity:

Elasticsearch can store a wide variety of data, ranging from publicly available information to highly sensitive data, including:

*   Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
*   Financial data
*   Healthcare data
*   Security logs
*   Application logs
*   Business intelligence data

The sensitivity of the data stored in Elasticsearch depends on the specific use case and the organization's data classification policies. It is crucial to identify the sensitivity of the data stored in each Elasticsearch cluster and implement appropriate security controls to protect it.
