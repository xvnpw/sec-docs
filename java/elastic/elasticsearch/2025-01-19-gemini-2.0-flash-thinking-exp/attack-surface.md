# Attack Surface Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Elasticsearch HTTP/HTTPS Ports](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_elasticsearch_httphttps_ports.md)

*   **Description:** Elasticsearch exposes a REST API over HTTP (default port 9200) and potentially HTTPS. If these ports are accessible without proper authentication and authorization, anyone can interact with the Elasticsearch instance.
    *   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch's core functionality relies on this API for data indexing, searching, and cluster management. Exposing it without security directly opens the door to unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans open ports and finds an Elasticsearch instance on port 9200 without authentication. They can then use the API to view all indexed data, delete indices, or even shut down the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation or deletion, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Authentication and Authorization: Configure Elasticsearch Security features (formerly Shield) or a similar plugin to require authentication for API access.
        *   Use HTTPS: Enforce HTTPS for all communication with the Elasticsearch API to encrypt data in transit.
        *   Network Segmentation and Firewalls: Restrict access to Elasticsearch ports (9200, 9300) to only trusted networks and applications using firewalls.
        *   Disable Public Access: Ensure Elasticsearch is not directly exposed to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Query Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/query_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to SQL injection, if user-provided input is directly incorporated into Elasticsearch queries without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious query clauses.
    *   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch's query DSL (Domain Specific Language) is powerful but can be vulnerable if not used carefully with external input.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to search for products. An attacker crafts a search query like `{"query": {"match_all": {}}, "script_fields": {"pwned": {"script": "System.exit(1)"}}}` which, if not properly handled, could lead to remote code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, potentially remote code execution if scripting is enabled and not properly sandboxed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Parameterize Queries: Use Elasticsearch's parameterized queries or client libraries that handle input sanitization.
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization:  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into Elasticsearch queries.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege:  Ensure the application user connecting to Elasticsearch has only the necessary permissions.
        *   Disable or Restrict Scripting: If scripting is not required, disable it. If necessary, carefully control and sandbox scripting capabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cluster Inter-Node Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cluster_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Elasticsearch nodes within a cluster (default port 9300) can be intercepted or manipulated if not properly secured.
    *   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch relies on this communication for cluster coordination, data replication, and shard allocation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the Elasticsearch cluster intercepts inter-node communication and gains insights into cluster topology or potentially injects malicious messages to disrupt the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS for Transport Layer: Configure TLS encryption for inter-node communication using Elasticsearch Security features.
        *   Network Segmentation: Isolate the Elasticsearch cluster on a private network segment.
        *   Authentication for Inter-Node Communication: Use Elasticsearch Security features to authenticate communication between nodes.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_elasticsearch_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party or custom plugins installed in Elasticsearch can contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but this also introduces potential security risks if plugins are not properly maintained or vetted.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Elasticsearch server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only Install Necessary Plugins: Avoid installing unnecessary plugins.
        *   Source from Trusted Repositories: Obtain plugins from official or reputable sources.
        *   Keep Plugins Updated: Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Security Audits of Custom Plugins: If using custom plugins, conduct thorough security audits.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Failing to change default credentials for built-in Elasticsearch users (like `elastic`) is a critical security flaw.
    *   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch provides default credentials for initial setup, which must be changed immediately.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default `elastic` username and password to gain administrative access to the Elasticsearch cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Elasticsearch cluster, leading to data breach, manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately Change Default Passwords: Change the passwords for all default Elasticsearch users during initial setup.
        *   Enforce Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for all Elasticsearch users.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If the scripting engine (e.g., Painless) is enabled and not properly sandboxed or controlled, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Elasticsearch Contribution:** Elasticsearch allows for dynamic scripting for advanced queries and data manipulation.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious script within a search request that executes system commands on the Elasticsearch server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable Scripting if Not Needed: If scripting is not required, disable it entirely.
        *   Restrict Scripting Permissions:  Use Elasticsearch Security features to restrict which users or roles can execute scripts.
        *   Use Script Whitelisting:  If possible, configure a whitelist of allowed scripts.
        *   Monitor Script Execution:  Monitor script execution for suspicious activity.
