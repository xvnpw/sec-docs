## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_elasticsearch_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves directly exploiting known vulnerabilities within the Elasticsearch software itself. This is a critical node because successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the Elasticsearch instance.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Elasticsearch server. This is a highly critical node as it grants full control.
        *   **Impact:** Critical (Full control of Elasticsearch server, potential for lateral movement).
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Information Disclosure:**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that leak sensitive information stored within Elasticsearch.
        *   **Impact:** Significant (Exposure of sensitive data, potential for further attacks).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Manipulate Data in Elasticsearch to Affect Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__manipulate_data_in_elasticsearch_to_affect_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to Elasticsearch and then manipulating the data stored within to negatively impact the application. This is a critical node because it directly targets the integrity and reliability of the data the application relies on.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Gain Unauthorized Access to Elasticsearch [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Description:** Achieving access to the Elasticsearch instance without proper authorization. This is a critical node as it enables subsequent data manipulation attacks.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **[HIGH RISK] Exploit Insecure API Access:** Leveraging misconfigurations in the Elasticsearch API that lack proper authentication or authorization.
            *   **[HIGH RISK] Exploit Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords that haven't been changed.
            *   **[HIGH RISK] Exploit Misconfigured Security Settings:** Bypassing security measures due to incorrect configuration.
        *   **Impact:** N/A (Enables further actions).
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Inject Malicious Data:**
        *   **Description:** Inserting harmful data into Elasticsearch that can compromise the application when it retrieves and processes this data.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **[HIGH RISK] Inject Malicious Search Queries:** Crafting search queries that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's search logic.
            *   **[HIGH RISK] Inject Malicious Data into Indices:** Inserting data directly into Elasticsearch indices that can trigger vulnerabilities in the application.
        *   **Impact:** Moderate to Significant (Depending on the nature of the injected data and application logic).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Elasticsearch Misconfigurations [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_elasticsearch_misconfigurations__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves leveraging common misconfigurations in Elasticsearch to gain unauthorized access or control. This is a critical node because misconfigurations are often easier to find and exploit than software vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Insecure API Access:**  Lack of proper authentication and authorization on the Elasticsearch API.
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** Elasticsearch instances without any authentication mechanisms.
    *   **[HIGH RISK] Excessive Permissions:** Granting overly broad permissions to users or roles.
*   **Impact:** Significant (Direct access to Elasticsearch, ability to perform unauthorized actions).
