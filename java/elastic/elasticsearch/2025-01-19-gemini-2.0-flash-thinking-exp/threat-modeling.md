# Threat Model Analysis for elastic/elasticsearch

## Threat: [Lack of Authentication on Elasticsearch API](./threats/lack_of_authentication_on_elasticsearch_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker might directly access the Elasticsearch API endpoints (e.g., `/_cat/indices`, `/my_index/_search`) without providing any credentials. This allows them to view, modify, or delete data and cluster configurations.

**Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation or deletion, cluster disruption, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Security Module (specifically the authentication mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable Elasticsearch Security features.
* Configure authentication realms (e.g., native, file, LDAP, Active Directory).
* Require authentication for all API requests.
* Restrict network access to the Elasticsearch cluster.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication Credentials](./threats/weak_authentication_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker might attempt to brute-force default or weak passwords for Elasticsearch users (e.g., `elastic`/`changeme`). Successful login grants them access to perform actions based on the user's assigned roles.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential data modification or deletion, cluster disruption depending on the compromised user's privileges.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Security Module (user authentication).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies.
* Disable or change default credentials immediately after installation.
* Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
* Consider multi-factor authentication.

## Threat: [Inadequate Authorization and Privilege Escalation](./threats/inadequate_authorization_and_privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited access might exploit misconfigured roles or vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch's authorization system to gain higher privileges. They could then perform actions beyond their intended scope, such as accessing sensitive indices or modifying cluster settings.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation or deletion, cluster disruption, potential for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Security Module (role-based access control).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement granular role-based access control (RBAC).
* Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles.
* Regularly review and audit role assignments.
* Stay updated on Elasticsearch security advisories and patch vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise and Abuse](./threats/api_key_compromise_and_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker might obtain valid Elasticsearch API keys (e.g., through code leaks, network interception, or insider threats). They can then use these keys to authenticate and perform actions as if they were the legitimate application or user associated with the key.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential resource exhaustion; reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Security Module (API key management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store API keys securely (e.g., using secrets management tools).
* Rotate API keys regularly.
* Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious API key usage.
* Restrict the privileges associated with API keys to the minimum required.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Insecure Configuration](./threats/data_exposure_through_insecure_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit misconfigured settings, such as allowing anonymous access to specific indices or enabling features that leak information (e.g., overly verbose error messages). This allows them to access sensitive data without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Configuration settings (e.g., `elasticsearch.yml`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow Elasticsearch security best practices during configuration.
* Disable unnecessary features and APIs.
* Regularly audit Elasticsearch configuration for security vulnerabilities.
* Implement network segmentation to limit access to the Elasticsearch cluster.

## Threat: [Insecure Data at Rest](./threats/insecure_data_at_rest.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the underlying storage of the Elasticsearch cluster (e.g., through a server compromise) can access sensitive data if it is not encrypted at rest.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Data storage layer.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable encryption at rest using Elasticsearch's built-in features (requires a license) or operating system-level encryption.
* Implement strong access controls on the underlying storage.

## Threat: [Insecure Data in Transit](./threats/insecure_data_in_transit.md)

**Description:** An attacker might intercept network traffic between the application and Elasticsearch or between nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster if communication is not encrypted. This allows them to eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted.

**Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Network communication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce HTTPS/TLS for all communication with the Elasticsearch API.
* Enable TLS for inter-node communication within the Elasticsearch cluster.

## Threat: [Unsecured Elasticsearch Management APIs](./threats/unsecured_elasticsearch_management_apis.md)

**Description:** An attacker might gain access to Elasticsearch's management APIs (e.g., `/_cluster/settings`, `/_nodes`) if they are not properly secured. This allows them to reconfigure the cluster, potentially leading to instability, data loss, or security breaches.

**Impact:** Cluster disruption, data loss, security compromise.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Core - Cluster and Node APIs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Restrict access to management APIs to authorized administrators only.
* Use strong authentication for management API access.
* Disable or restrict access to potentially dangerous management endpoints.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_elasticsearch_software.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit known security vulnerabilities in the Elasticsearch software itself (e.g., through unpatched versions).

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Various components of Elasticsearch depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Elasticsearch updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
* Subscribe to security advisories from Elastic.
* Implement a vulnerability management program.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in third-party Elasticsearch plugins installed in the cluster.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability, but could include remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Elasticsearch Plugins.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install necessary plugins from trusted sources.
* Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
* Evaluate the security posture of plugins before installation.
* Regularly review installed plugins and remove unnecessary ones.
