**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

1. **Bypass Authentication:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Brute-force Authentication:** Attacker attempts numerous username/password combinations to guess valid credentials. High-risk if rate limiting is not implemented.
        * **Credential Stuffing:** Attacker uses lists of known username/password pairs obtained from previous data breaches on other services. High-risk due to widespread password reuse.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Successful bypass grants immediate access to the application, potentially with elevated privileges. Likelihood is medium due to common attack techniques, and impact is high.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full account takeover, access to sensitive data, ability to perform unauthorized actions.

2. **Bypass Authorization:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Exploit Role/Authority Misconfiguration:** Attacker leverages incorrectly defined access rules to access resources or functionalities they shouldn't.
        * **Incorrectly Defined Access Rules:**  Developers may create overly permissive rules or fail to restrict access appropriately.
        * **Privilege Escalation via Parameter Tampering:** Attacker manipulates request parameters (e.g., user ID, role) to gain access to resources or functionalities intended for higher-privileged users.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Allows attackers to perform actions beyond their intended permissions, potentially leading to data manipulation or system compromise. Likelihood is medium due to common misconfigurations, and impact is high.
    * **Potential Impact:** Access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, execution of privileged operations.

3. **Exploit Session Management Weaknesses leading to Session Hijacking:**
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Steal Session Cookie:** Attacker obtains a valid session cookie through various means.
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Session Cookie:** Attacker injects malicious scripts into the application that steal session cookies and send them to the attacker.
    * **Why High-Risk:** Allows the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user, gaining full access to their session and associated privileges. Likelihood is medium due to the prevalence of XSS vulnerabilities, and impact is high.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full account takeover, ability to perform any action the legitimate user can perform.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **`Default/Weak Credentials`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attacker uses default or easily guessable credentials for administrative or privileged accounts.
    * **Why Critical:** Provides immediate and easy access to the application with potentially high privileges.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.

* **`Client Secret Exposure`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attacker gains access to the OAuth2/OIDC client secret through insecure storage or transmission.
    * **Why Critical:** Allows the attacker to impersonate the legitimate client application, potentially gaining access to user data or resources.
    * **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to APIs, account takeover.

* **`@PreAuthorize/@PostAuthorize Logic Errors`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Flaws in the logic within these Spring Security annotations can lead to unintended access control bypasses.
    * **Why Critical:**  Directly controls authorization at the method level; errors can have significant security implications.
    * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to specific functionalities or data.

* **`Missing Authorization Annotations`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Sensitive endpoints or methods lack proper authorization checks, making them accessible to unauthorized users.
    * **Why Critical:**  Leaves critical parts of the application unprotected.
    * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

* **`Steal Session Cookie`:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Various methods like network sniffing (if not using HTTPS), XSS, or malware can be used to steal session cookies.
    * **Why Critical:**  The primary method for session hijacking.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full account takeover.

* **`Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Steal Session Cookie`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities to execute malicious JavaScript that steals session cookies.
    * **Why Critical:** A common and effective way to steal session cookies, leading to widespread account compromise.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full account takeover for multiple users.

* **`Session Invalidation Issues` / `Failure to Invalidate on Logout`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Sessions are not properly invalidated upon logout, allowing an attacker to reuse a session cookie or token.
    * **Why Critical:** Can lead to unauthorized access even after a user has logged out.
    * **Potential Impact:** Account reuse, unauthorized access to data.

* **`Insecure Defaults`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Relying on default Spring Security configurations that may not be secure or appropriate for the application's needs.
    * **Why Critical:**  A common oversight that can leave applications vulnerable to known weaknesses.
    * **Potential Impact:** Varies depending on the specific insecure default, but can range from information disclosure to more severe vulnerabilities.

* **`Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets are exposed in configuration files or environment variables.
    * **Why Critical:** Provides attackers with direct access to critical resources or systems.
    * **Potential Impact:** Full database compromise, access to external services, further system compromise.

* **`Misconfigured Security Headers`:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Absence or incorrect configuration of security headers like CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options.
    * **Why Critical:**  Weakens the application's defenses against various attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and MIME sniffing.
    * **Potential Impact:** Increased vulnerability to XSS, clickjacking, and other client-side attacks.

* **`Missing or Incorrect Content Security Policy (CSP)`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Lack of or a weak CSP allows attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.
    * **Why Critical:** A primary defense against XSS attacks.
    * **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, defacement.

* **`Missing or Incorrect HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)`:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Failure to enforce HTTPS can leave users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    * **Why Critical:**  Essential for ensuring secure communication.
    * **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, data interception.

* **`Missing or Incorrect X-Frame-Options`:**
    * **Attack Vector:**  Allows the application to be embedded in a frame on a malicious website, leading to clickjacking attacks.
    * **Why Critical:** Protects against clickjacking.
    * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed by tricking users.

* **`Missing or Incorrect X-Content-Type-Options`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Allows browsers to perform MIME sniffing, potentially executing malicious content as a different type.
    * **Why Critical:** Helps prevent MIME sniffing attacks.
    * **Potential Impact:** Execution of malicious code.

* **`Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of the Spring Security library.
    * **Why Critical:**  Exploits are often readily available, making unpatched systems vulnerable.
    * **Potential Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

* **`Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities`:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in the Spring Security library.
    * **Why Critical:**  No immediate patch available, making exploitation highly impactful.
    * **Potential Impact:** Can be severe, potentially leading to full system compromise.

This focused view of the threat model allows development teams to prioritize their security efforts on the most critical areas and high-risk attack paths, leading to a more secure application.
