- **Attack Surface: Authentication Bypass due to Misconfiguration**
    - **Description:**  Incorrectly configured authentication mechanisms allow attackers to bypass the intended login process.
    - **Spring Security Contribution:** Spring Security's flexibility allows for various authentication providers (e.g., LDAP, OAuth 2.0). Misconfiguring these providers or custom authentication logic can create vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** An OAuth 2.0 client is configured with an overly permissive redirect URI, allowing an attacker to intercept the authorization code. Or, a custom authentication filter has a logic flaw that allows bypassing checks under certain conditions.
    - **Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to the application.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Thoroughly review and test all authentication configurations.
        - Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring authentication providers.
        - Implement robust input validation and sanitization for authentication parameters.
        - Regularly audit authentication configurations.

- **Attack Surface: Authorization Bypass due to Misconfiguration**
    - **Description:** Incorrectly configured access control rules allow users to access resources or functionalities they are not authorized for.
    - **Spring Security Contribution:** Spring Security's authorization mechanisms (e.g., `HttpSecurity` configurations, `@PreAuthorize` annotations, `AccessDecisionVoter`) rely on correct configuration. Mistakes can lead to bypasses.
    - **Example:**  A developer uses `permitAll()` on an endpoint that should be restricted to administrators. Or, a SpEL expression in `@PreAuthorize` has a logical error, granting unintended access.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform privileged actions.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Follow the principle of least privilege when defining authorization rules.
        - Use specific roles and authorities instead of broad permissions.
        - Thoroughly test authorization rules for different user roles.
        - Regularly review and audit authorization configurations.
        - Utilize method security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`) for fine-grained control.

- **Attack Surface: Session Fixation Attacks**
    - **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into using a session ID that the attacker controls, allowing them to hijack the user's session after they log in.
    - **Spring Security Contribution:** If not configured properly, Spring Security might not invalidate the session ID upon successful login, making the application vulnerable.
    - **Example:** An attacker sends a user a link with a specific session ID. If the user logs in using that link, the attacker can then use the same session ID to access the user's account.
    - **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure Spring Security is configured to create a new session ID upon successful authentication. This is the default behavior but should be verified.
        - Regenerate the session ID after authentication.
        - Use HTTPS to protect session cookies from interception.

- **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to Missing or Disabled Protection**
    - **Description:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into making unintended requests on the application, potentially performing actions without the user's knowledge.
    - **Spring Security Contribution:** Spring Security provides built-in CSRF protection. However, if it's explicitly disabled or not correctly implemented for all relevant endpoints, the application is vulnerable.
    - **Example:** An attacker embeds a malicious form on their website that, when visited by an authenticated user of the target application, submits a request to change the user's password or perform other sensitive actions.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, data manipulation.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Ensure CSRF protection is enabled globally in Spring Security.
        - Include the CSRF token in all state-changing requests (e.g., using Thymeleaf's integration or manually adding the token).
        - Properly handle CSRF token validation on the server-side.
        - Be cautious when disabling CSRF protection for specific endpoints and understand the implications.

- **Attack Surface: Insecure Remember-Me Functionality**
    - **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the "Remember-Me" feature allow attackers to gain persistent access to user accounts.
    - **Spring Security Contribution:** Spring Security provides Remember-Me functionality. If the tokens are not generated or stored securely, or if they are not invalidated properly, it can be exploited.
    - **Example:** An attacker steals a Remember-Me token from a user's browser or intercepts it during transmission. They can then use this token to log in as the user without providing credentials.
    - **Impact:** Persistent unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Use secure, randomly generated, and unpredictable Remember-Me tokens.
        - Consider using persistent token repositories (e.g., database-backed) instead of cookie-based storage.
        - Invalidate Remember-Me tokens upon password change or logout.
        - Implement measures to prevent token theft (e.g., HTTPS).

- **Attack Surface: OAuth 2.0/OIDC Misconfiguration**
    - **Description:** Incorrectly configured OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect integrations can lead to various vulnerabilities.
    - **Spring Security Contribution:** Spring Security provides excellent support for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. However, misconfigurations in client registration, redirect URIs, scopes, or token handling can create attack vectors.
    - **Example:** An overly permissive redirect URI allows an attacker to intercept authorization codes. Or, a client secret is exposed in client-side code.
    - **Impact:** Account takeover, data breaches, impersonation.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Strictly validate redirect URIs.
        - Securely store client secrets.
        - Follow the principle of least privilege when defining scopes.
        - Implement proper token validation and revocation mechanisms.
        - Regularly review and audit OAuth 2.0/OIDC configurations.
