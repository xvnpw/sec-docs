## High and Critical Spring Security Threats

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Authentication Bypass due to Misconfiguration** | Attacker exploits misconfigured authentication settings within Spring Security (e.g., allowing anonymous access when it shouldn't, misconfigured providers) to gain unauthorized access without providing valid credentials. | Unauthorized access to protected resources and functionalities. Potential data breach or system compromise. | `HttpSecurity` configuration, `AuthenticationManager`, `AuthenticationProvider` implementations | **Critical** | Thoroughly review and test authentication configurations defined in `HttpSecurity`. Enforce strong password policies where applicable. Implement proper access control rules using Spring Security's authorization mechanisms. Regularly audit authentication configurations. |
| **Brute-Force Attacks on Login Endpoint** | Attacker uses automated tools to repeatedly try different username/password combinations against the login endpoint managed by Spring Security. | Account lockout for legitimate users. Potential for successful login and account takeover if weak credentials are used. | Login processing logic within Spring Security's `AuthenticationFilter` (e.g., `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`) | **High** | Implement rate limiting on login attempts using Spring Security's features or external libraries. Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed login attempts. Consider using CAPTCHA or MFA. |
| **Authorization Bypass due to Misconfiguration** | Attacker exploits incorrectly configured authorization rules within Spring Security (e.g., allowing access based on incorrect roles/permissions, insecure expression language) to access resources they are not authorized for. | Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities. Potential for data manipulation or system compromise. | `HttpSecurity` configuration, `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, `AccessDecisionManager`, `AccessDecisionVoter` | **Critical** | Thoroughly review and test authorization configurations defined in `HttpSecurity` and using annotations. Use fine-grained authorization rules based on roles and permissions. Avoid overly permissive rules. Be cautious when using complex expression language in authorization annotations and ensure proper escaping and validation. Regularly audit authorization configurations. |
| **Session Fixation** | Attacker tricks a user into using a session ID that Spring Security has not properly regenerated after successful authentication, then uses that ID to impersonate the user after they log in. | Account takeover and unauthorized access to user data and functionalities. | `HttpSession`, `SessionManagementFilter` | **High** | Ensure Spring Security is configured to regenerate the session ID after successful authentication using `http.sessionManagement().sessionFixation().migrateSession()`. |
| **Session Hijacking** | Attacker obtains a valid session ID managed by Spring Security (e.g., through XSS if not mitigated elsewhere, network sniffing) and uses it to impersonate the legitimate user. | Account takeover and unauthorized access to user data and functionalities. | `HttpSession`, `Cookie`, `SessionManagementFilter` | **High** | Use HTTPS to protect session cookies managed by Spring Security. Set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies using Spring Security's configuration. Consider short session timeouts. Implement mechanisms to detect and invalidate suspicious session activity. |
| **CSRF Protection Bypass due to Misconfiguration** | CSRF protection provided by Spring Security is disabled or incorrectly configured, allowing attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions. | Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, potentially leading to data modification, financial loss, or other harmful consequences. | `CsrfFilter`, `CsrfTokenRepository` | **High** | Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in Spring Security using `http.csrf().enable()`. Understand and correctly configure CSRF token handling for different request types. Be aware of scenarios where CSRF protection might need to be explicitly disabled (e.g., for specific API endpoints) and ensure this is done with careful consideration and alternative security measures. |
| **Insufficient CSRF Token Handling** | The application does not properly include or validate CSRF tokens provided by Spring Security in requests. | CSRF attacks are possible, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users. | `CsrfFilter`, template engines integration (e.g., Thymeleaf's `th:csrf`) | **High** | Ensure CSRF tokens are included in all state-changing requests, typically using template engine integration provided by Spring Security. Verify that the server-side validation of CSRF tokens is correctly implemented by Spring Security. |
| **Misconfiguration of OAuth 2.0/OIDC Flows** | Incorrectly configured authorization grants, redirect URIs, client authentication methods, or scope management within Spring Security's OAuth 2.0/OIDC support. | Unauthorized access token issuance, impersonation of legitimate clients, or access to resources beyond granted scopes. | `OAuth2LoginConfigurer`, `AuthorizationServerConfigurer`, `ClientRegistrationRepository` | **High** | Thoroughly understand and correctly implement OAuth 2.0/OIDC specifications using Spring Security's provided components. Carefully configure redirect URIs and ensure they are validated. Use secure client authentication methods. Implement proper scope management to limit access to resources. Regularly review and audit OAuth 2.0/OIDC configurations. |
| **Token Theft and Reuse (OAuth 2.0/OIDC)** | Access tokens or refresh tokens managed by Spring Security's OAuth 2.0/OIDC support are stolen and used by unauthorized parties. | Unauthorized access to protected resources using stolen tokens. | `OAuth2AccessToken`, `OAuth2RefreshToken` storage and handling | **High** | Use HTTPS to protect token transmission. Implement secure storage for refresh tokens (if used). Consider using short-lived access tokens. Implement token revocation mechanisms. |
| **Security Filter Bypass** | Incorrectly configured filter chains managed by Spring Security or custom filters allow requests to bypass Spring Security's intended security checks. | Access to protected resources without proper authentication or authorization. | `FilterChainProxy`, `SecurityFilterChain`, custom `Filter` implementations | **Critical** | Carefully configure filter chains in `HttpSecurity` and ensure they cover all necessary request patterns. Thoroughly test custom security filters and their interaction with Spring Security's filters. Avoid overly complex filter chain configurations. |
