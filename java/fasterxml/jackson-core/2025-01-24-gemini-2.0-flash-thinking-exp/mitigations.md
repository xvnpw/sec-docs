# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Default Typing for Polymorphic Deserialization](./mitigation_strategies/disable_default_typing_for_polymorphic_deserialization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Default Typing
*   **Description:**
    1.  Locate the `ObjectMapper` instance(s) used in your application. This is typically initialized in a configuration class or where JSON processing is set up.
    2.  For each `ObjectMapper` instance, explicitly set the default typing to `null`. This prevents Jackson from automatically inferring type information from JSON payloads.
    3.  **Code Example (Java):**
        ```java
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        mapper.setDefaultTyping(null);
        ```
    4.  Redeploy your application with this configuration change.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Polymorphic Deserialization (High Severity):** Attackers can craft malicious JSON payloads containing type hints that instruct Jackson to deserialize arbitrary classes, potentially leading to code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE via Polymorphic Deserialization:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Disabling default typing effectively eliminates this critical vulnerability vector when handling untrusted JSON.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** API Gateway Service - `com.example.api.config.JacksonConfig` - where the main `ObjectMapper` for API requests is configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:** Internal microservices that might be using default `ObjectMapper` instances without explicit configuration. Need to audit and apply the configuration consistently across all services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Whitelisting for Polymorphic Types (If Polymorphism is Necessary)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_whitelisting_for_polymorphic_types__if_polymorphism_is_necessary_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Whitelist Polymorphic Types
*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify code sections where polymorphic deserialization is genuinely required using Jackson.
    2.  Define a closed set of allowed classes that are expected for polymorphic handling within Jackson's deserialization process.
    3.  Implement whitelisting using one of the following Jackson-specific methods:
        *   **Using `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes`:** Annotate the base class or interface with `@JsonTypeInfo` and use `@JsonSubTypes` to explicitly list allowed concrete classes that Jackson will deserialize.
        *   **Custom TypeResolver with Whitelist:** Create a custom `TypeResolverBuilder` that checks if the incoming type is within the allowed whitelist before Jackson resolves the type. Register this custom resolver with your `ObjectMapper`.
    4.  Thoroughly test the whitelisting implementation to ensure it correctly handles valid polymorphic types and rejects invalid ones during Jackson deserialization.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Polymorphic Deserialization (High Severity):** Even with default typing disabled, if polymorphism is enabled through Jackson annotations, vulnerabilities can still exist if not properly restricted. Whitelisting mitigates this within Jackson's type handling.
    *   **Deserialization of Unintended Classes (Medium Severity):** Prevents Jackson from processing unexpected object types during deserialization, which could lead to unexpected application behavior.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE via Polymorphic Deserialization:** **High Risk Reduction (if default typing is still used with annotations).**  Significantly reduces the attack surface by limiting allowed types that Jackson will deserialize.
    *   **Deserialization of Unintended Classes:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** Prevents Jackson from creating unexpected objects.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:**  Payment Processing Service - `com.example.payment.model` package - where polymorphic handling of payment methods is required, using `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` with a defined list of payment classes for Jackson to use.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:** Reporting Service - where some legacy code might be using `@JsonTypeInfo` without explicit `@JsonSubTypes` or a custom resolver in Jackson configuration. Needs review and whitelisting implementation within Jackson's polymorphic handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Input Size and Nesting Depth in Jackson](./mitigation_strategies/limit_input_size_and_nesting_depth_in_jackson.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Input Size and Nesting Depth
*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure `JsonFactory`, which is used by `ObjectMapper`, to set limits on maximum string length and nesting depth that Jackson will process.
    2.  Create `ObjectMapper` instances using this configured `JsonFactory`. This ensures Jackson itself enforces these limits during parsing.
    3.  **Code Example (Java):**
        ```java
        JsonFactory jsonFactory = JsonFactory.builder()
                .maxStringLength(1024 * 1024) // 1MB max string length for Jackson
                .maxDepth(100) // Max nesting depth of 100 for Jackson
                .build();
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(jsonFactory);
        ```
    4.  Ensure all `ObjectMapper` instances used for handling external or untrusted data are created using this configured `JsonFactory`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large JSON Payloads (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can send extremely large JSON documents or deeply nested structures that Jackson has to parse, potentially exhausting server resources (CPU, memory) and causing service disruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Large JSON Payloads:** **Significant Risk Reduction.** Limits resource consumption during Jackson's parsing of malicious payloads, preventing or mitigating DoS attacks at the Jackson parsing level.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** API Gateway Service - `com.example.api.config.JacksonConfig` - `ObjectMapper` for API requests is created using a `JsonFactory` with `maxStringLength` configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:** Nesting depth limits (`maxDepth`) are not currently configured in `JsonFactory` for `ObjectMapper` instances within backend services. This needs to be implemented in the base Jackson configuration for all services to ensure Jackson itself enforces these limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Jackson-core Library Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_jackson-core_library_up-to-date.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep Jackson-core Updated
*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly check for new releases of `jackson-core` and related Jackson libraries (databind, annotations).
    2.  Use a dependency management tool (Maven, Gradle) to manage project dependencies, specifically including Jackson libraries.
    3.  Update `jackson-core` and other Jackson libraries to the latest stable versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes within Jackson itself.
    4.  Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for Jackson libraries.
    5.  Integrate security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect outdated Jackson dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Jackson (High to Critical Severity):** Outdated Jackson libraries are susceptible to publicly known vulnerabilities within Jackson's code that attackers can exploit. Updating libraries patches these Jackson-specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Jackson:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Proactively addresses known vulnerabilities within Jackson and reduces the attack surface related to the Jackson library itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** Dependency management is in place using Maven for Jackson libraries. Regular dependency updates are performed as part of maintenance cycles, but not always proactively for Jackson security updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:** Automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to specifically flag vulnerable Jackson dependencies.  Proactive monitoring of Jackson security advisories and immediate patching process for critical vulnerabilities found in Jackson libraries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Review Custom Jackson Deserializers and Serializers](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_review_custom_jackson_deserializers_and_serializers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Review Custom Jackson Deserializers/Serializers
*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all custom deserializers and serializers implemented in the project that are used with Jackson.
    2.  Conduct thorough code reviews of these custom Jackson components, focusing on security aspects within their deserialization/serialization logic.
    3.  Ensure custom Jackson deserializers and serializers handle input data securely and avoid insecure operations within the Jackson context.
    4.  Write comprehensive unit tests specifically for custom Jackson components, including tests for handling malicious or unexpected input during Jackson deserialization/serialization.
    5.  Apply secure coding practices when developing custom Jackson deserializers and serializers to prevent introducing vulnerabilities within the Jackson processing pipeline.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom Jackson Code (High to Critical Severity):** Insecurely written custom Jackson deserializers or serializers can introduce new vulnerabilities specifically within the Jackson processing, including RCE, DoS, or data corruption, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom Jackson code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom Jackson Code:** **Variable Risk Reduction (depends on the quality of review and testing).** Reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through custom Jackson code, but effectiveness depends on the rigor of the review process and testing specifically for Jackson custom components.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Implemented in:** Code reviews are generally performed for all code changes, including custom Jackson deserializers/serializers, but security-focused reviews are not consistently prioritized specifically for these Jackson components.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Missing in:** Dedicated security-focused code reviews specifically for custom Jackson deserializers and serializers.  Lack of specific unit tests designed to test the security aspects of custom Jackson components (e.g., handling of invalid input, edge cases during Jackson processing).
