## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the application unavailable to legitimate users. This is a high-impact goal as it directly affects the application's functionality and can lead to business disruption.

    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Critical Node):** A common method to achieve DoS by consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) on the server.

        *   **Send Extremely Large JSON Payload (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a JSON payload that is significantly larger than expected or reasonable.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Easy to attempt, but many systems have size limits in place.
            *   **Impact:** Moderate - Application slowdown or temporary unavailability.
            *   **Effort:** Trivial - Requires basic scripting or readily available tools.
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - Large payload size is often logged by web servers or application firewalls.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict size limits on incoming JSON payloads at the application level or using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

        *   **Send Deeply Nested JSON Payload (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a JSON payload with an excessive level of nesting.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Easy to craft, but some parsers have default limits.
            *   **Impact:** Moderate - Can lead to stack overflow errors, memory exhaustion, or application crashes.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Requires a basic understanding of JSON structure.
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - May require monitoring resource usage (CPU, memory) or analyzing request patterns.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement limits on the maximum nesting depth allowed for JSON payloads during parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Unexpected Application Behavior (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_unexpected_application_behavior__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to make the application behave in a way that was not intended by the developers. This can range from minor errors to significant security vulnerabilities.

    *   **Exploit Parsing Logic (Critical Node):**  This involves crafting JSON input that exploits how the application processes the parsed data.

        *   **Send JSON with Unexpected Data Types (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends JSON data where the data types do not match what the application expects (e.g., sending a string when an integer is expected).
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common if the application does not perform strict validation of data types after parsing.
            *   **Impact:** Minor to Major - The impact depends heavily on how the application handles unexpected data types. It could lead to logic errors, incorrect calculations, or even security vulnerabilities if the data is used in sensitive operations.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Easy to manipulate data types in JSON payloads.
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - Requires understanding the expected data types and the application's logic for processing them. Implementing logging of validation failures can aid detection.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict schema validation on incoming JSON data to ensure it conforms to the expected data types. Libraries like JSON Schema can be used for this purpose.

        *   **Send JSON with Unexpected Data Structures (High-Risk Path):**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends JSON data with a structure (e.g., missing fields, extra fields, different array arrangements) that the application does not expect.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Common if the application relies on a specific JSON structure without proper validation.
            *   **Impact:** Minor to Major - Similar to unexpected data types, the impact depends on the application's logic. It can lead to errors, unexpected behavior, or even security bypasses if the application relies on the presence or absence of specific fields.
            *   **Effort:** Low - Easy to manipulate the structure of JSON payloads.
            *   **Skill Level:** Beginner.
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate - Requires understanding the expected JSON structure. Implementing logging of validation failures can aid detection.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust validation of the structure of incoming JSON data. Ensure that all required fields are present and that the overall structure matches the expected format.
