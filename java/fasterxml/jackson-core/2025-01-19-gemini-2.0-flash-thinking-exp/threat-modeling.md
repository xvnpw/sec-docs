# Threat Model Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-core

## Threat: [Excessive Memory Consumption due to Large JSON](./threats/excessive_memory_consumption_due_to_large_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a very large JSON document to the application. `jackson-core` attempts to parse this large document, allocating significant memory to represent its structure.

**Impact:** The application's memory usage spikes, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors, application crashes, or performance degradation affecting other users.

**Affected Component:** `JsonFactory` (responsible for creating parser instances), `JsonParser` (responsible for reading and parsing the JSON).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a maximum size limit for incoming JSON requests.
* Configure `JsonFactory` or `JsonParser` (if options are available) to limit the maximum allowed input size.
* Monitor application memory usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Stack Overflow due to Deeply Nested JSON](./threats/stack_overflow_due_to_deeply_nested_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON document with an extremely deep level of nesting. The recursive nature of parsing deeply nested structures can exhaust the application's stack space.

**Impact:** The application crashes due to a `StackOverflowError`, leading to service disruption.

**Affected Component:** `JsonParser` (specifically the logic handling nested objects and arrays).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a limit on the maximum nesting depth allowed for incoming JSON requests.
* Configure `JsonFactory` or `JsonParser` (if options are available) to limit the maximum allowed nesting depth.
* Consider using iterative parsing techniques if feasible, although `jackson-core` is primarily recursive.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion due to Long Strings](./threats/memory_exhaustion_due_to_long_strings.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON document containing extremely long string values. `jackson-core` allocates memory to store these strings.

**Impact:** The application's memory usage increases significantly, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors and application crashes.

**Affected Component:** `JsonParser` (when reading string values).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a maximum length limit for string values within JSON requests.
* Configure `JsonFactory` or `JsonParser` (if options are available) to limit the maximum allowed string length.
* Consider streaming or chunking large string values if they are legitimate and unavoidable.
