# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance and reliable JSON processing library for Java applications.
  - Ensure broad compatibility and adoption within the Java ecosystem.
  - Maintain a stable and well-documented API for developers.
  - Offer efficient JSON parsing and generation capabilities.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Jackson-core could be exploited in applications that depend on it, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other security incidents.
  - Performance issues or bugs could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications using Jackson-core.
  - Lack of maintenance or slow response to security issues could erode trust and adoption.
  - Compatibility issues with different Java versions or other libraries could limit usability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed by maintainers and contributors (Inferred from open-source project practices).
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are in place to ensure functionality and catch regressions (Inferred from standard software development practices).
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting mechanisms are available (e.g., GitHub issues, security advisories) (Inferred from open-source project practices).
  - accepted risk:  Complexity of JSON parsing and handling inherently introduces potential vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk:  Open-source nature implies reliance on community contributions for security fixes.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Integrate Dependency Check tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear Security Response Policy and process for handling vulnerability reports.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially before major releases.
  - security control: Promote and enforce secure coding practices among contributors.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Jackson-core itself does not handle authentication. Applications using Jackson-core are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Jackson-core itself does not handle authorization. Applications using Jackson-core are responsible for their own authorization mechanisms.
  - Input Validation: Jackson-core must robustly handle malformed or unexpected JSON input to prevent parsing errors or vulnerabilities. Input validation should be performed during JSON parsing to ensure data conforms to expected formats and constraints.
  - Cryptography: Jackson-core itself does not implement cryptographic functions. If applications using Jackson-core need cryptography, they should use dedicated cryptographic libraries. Jackson-core should handle encrypted data passed as JSON without introducing vulnerabilities, assuming the encryption/decryption is handled by the application.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - JSON data processing within Java applications that rely on Jackson-core. This includes parsing JSON data received from external sources and generating JSON data for output.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The sensitivity of data processed by Jackson-core depends entirely on the applications using it. JSON data can contain highly sensitive information, including personal data, financial data, and confidential business information. Jackson-core itself does not inherently handle sensitive data, but it is a critical component in applications that do. The library must be robust and secure to prevent vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive data processed by applications using it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are currently used in the Jackson-core build process?
  - Is there a documented Security Response Policy for Jackson-core? If so, where can it be found?
  - Are regular security audits or penetration testing conducted for Jackson-core?
  - What is the process for managing and patching vulnerabilities in Jackson-core dependencies?
  - Are there specific coding standards or secure coding guidelines followed by Jackson-core developers?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a performant and reliable JSON library, with security being a significant but secondary consideration compared to functionality and performance.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security practices like code reviews and testing are in place, but there might be room for improvement in automated security scanning and formal security processes. The project relies on the open-source community for vulnerability reporting and security contributions.
  - DESIGN: The design is relatively straightforward, focusing on providing efficient JSON processing within the Java ecosystem. Deployment is primarily handled by developers integrating Jackson-core into their applications. The build process includes basic CI/CD but could be enhanced with more comprehensive security checks.
