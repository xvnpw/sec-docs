#### 3. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Polymorphic Deserialization (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)

* **Description:** This node represents the core vulnerability: achieving Remote Code Execution by exploiting Jackson's polymorphic deserialization capabilities. This is a critical vulnerability because successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the application server.
* **Attack Vector:** The attack leverages Jackson's feature that allows deserializing JSON into different Java classes based on type information embedded within the JSON itself. This is often enabled through:
    * **Default Typing:** Jackson's `ObjectMapper` can be configured with `enableDefaultTyping()` which automatically adds type information (`@class`, `@type`) to serialized JSON and uses it during deserialization.
    * **Annotations:** Annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` can also enable polymorphic deserialization for specific classes.
    * **Custom Deserializers:**  While less common for this specific vulnerability, custom deserializers could also be implemented in a way that introduces polymorphic behavior and vulnerabilities.

    Attackers craft malicious JSON payloads containing type hints that point to vulnerable "gadget" classes present on the application's classpath. When Jackson deserializes this JSON, it instantiates these classes. If these gadget classes are carefully chosen, their instantiation or subsequent method calls during deserialization can trigger a chain of operations leading to arbitrary code execution.

* **Risk:** **Critical**. RCE is the most severe type of vulnerability. It allows attackers to:
    * Gain complete control of the application server.
    * Access sensitive data, including databases and internal systems.
    * Modify application data and functionality.
    * Use the compromised server as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.
    * Disrupt application availability and operations.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**

    * **Disable Default Typing:**  **Strongly recommended.**  Avoid using `enableDefaultTyping()` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. If required, use it with specific whitelists of allowed base types and carefully consider the security implications.
    * **Whitelist Known Safe Types:** If polymorphic deserialization is required, implement strict whitelisting of allowed classes for deserialization.  This prevents the instantiation of arbitrary classes, including malicious gadgets. Jackson provides mechanisms for custom type resolvers and validators to enforce whitelists.
    * **Update Jackson Library:** Keep the Jackson library updated to the latest version. While not a complete mitigation in itself, updates often include security patches that may address known deserialization vulnerabilities or improve security features.
    * **Classpath Scanning and Dependency Management:** Regularly scan your application's classpath for known vulnerable gadget libraries (e.g., older versions of Commons Collections, Spring libraries with known vulnerabilities).  Employ robust dependency management practices to minimize unnecessary dependencies and keep them updated. Tools like dependency-check can assist in this process.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While deserialization vulnerabilities bypass typical input validation, consider validating the structure and expected data types of incoming JSON payloads to detect anomalies that might indicate malicious intent.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be configured to detect and block suspicious JSON payloads that contain type hints pointing to potentially dangerous classes. This is a defense-in-depth measure and not a primary mitigation.
    * **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** RASP solutions can monitor application behavior at runtime and detect and block attempts to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities by observing suspicious class loading or code execution patterns.

#### 1.1.1.2. Detect Jackson's Polymorphic Type Handling (Critical Node)

* **Description:** This node represents the attacker's initial reconnaissance step: determining if the target application utilizes Jackson's polymorphic deserialization feature. Successful detection is a crucial prerequisite for exploiting the RCE vulnerability.
* **Attack Vector:** Attackers employ various techniques to detect polymorphic type handling:
    * **Observing Request/Response Patterns:**
        * **Trial and Error with Type Hints:** Attackers might send crafted JSON requests with common type hints like `@class` or `@type` and observe the application's response. If the application processes these hints and behaves differently (e.g., throws specific errors related to class loading or deserialization), it indicates potential polymorphic deserialization usage.
        * **Analyzing Error Messages:**  Detailed error messages returned by the application during JSON processing might reveal information about Jackson's configuration and whether it's attempting to deserialize based on type information.
    * **Looking for Type Hints in JSON (e.g., `@class`, `@type`):**
        * **Analyzing Publicly Available APIs or Documentation:** If the application exposes public APIs or documentation, attackers might look for examples of JSON requests or responses that include type hints.
        * **Intercepting Network Traffic:** Attackers can intercept network traffic between the client and server to examine JSON payloads for the presence of type hints.
    * **Code Inspection (If Possible):**
        * **Open Source Applications:** If the application is open source, attackers can directly inspect the code to identify Jackson `ObjectMapper` configurations, annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo`, and custom deserializers to confirm polymorphic deserialization usage.
        * **Reverse Engineering (Less Common):** In some cases, attackers might attempt to reverse engineer the application to understand its internal workings and identify Jackson configurations.

* **Risk:** **Medium**. While not directly exploitable, successful detection of polymorphic type handling is a significant step towards RCE. It confirms the application's vulnerability to this class of attacks and motivates attackers to proceed with further exploitation attempts.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**

    * **Minimize Information Leakage in Error Messages:** Configure Jackson and the application to avoid exposing overly detailed error messages that could reveal internal configurations or library usage. Generic error responses are preferred.
    * **Secure Configuration Practices:**  Ensure that Jackson's configuration, including the use of default typing or annotations, is not inadvertently exposed through configuration files or logs that might be accessible to attackers.
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate unnecessary or insecure uses of polymorphic deserialization. Ensure that if it's used, it's implemented with strict whitelisting and security considerations in mind.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Limit access to application code and configuration files to authorized personnel only, reducing the risk of information leakage through code inspection.
    * **Network Segmentation:**  Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a potential compromise. Even if an attacker detects polymorphic deserialization, network segmentation can restrict their ability to probe internal systems for gadget classes.

#### 1.1.1.3. Identify Gadget Classes on Classpath (Critical Node)

* **Description:** Once polymorphic type handling is confirmed, the attacker's next critical step is to identify vulnerable "gadget" classes present on the application's classpath. These gadget classes are essential for constructing a successful deserialization exploit that leads to RCE.
* **Attack Vector:** Attackers employ various techniques to identify gadget classes:
    * **Dependency Analysis:**
        * **Publicly Known Dependencies:** Attackers often start by assuming common libraries known to contain gadget classes (like older versions of Commons Collections, Spring, etc.) are present. They will then test payloads targeting these known gadgets.
        * **Analyzing Publicly Available Application Information:** If the application is publicly described (e.g., in job postings, documentation, or open-source projects), attackers might glean information about the technologies and libraries used, providing clues about potential dependencies.
        * **Dependency Scanning Tools (If Possible):** In rare cases, if attackers gain access to internal systems or build artifacts, they might use dependency scanning tools to directly analyze the application's dependencies.
    * **Error Message Analysis (More Advanced):**
        * **Crafting Payloads to Trigger ClassNotFoundExceptions:** Attackers might send payloads with type hints pointing to classes they suspect are *not* on the classpath. By analyzing the resulting error messages (e.g., `ClassNotFoundException`), they can infer which classes are *not* present. Conversely, the absence of such errors for certain class names might suggest their presence. This is a more noisy and less reliable method.
    * **Classpath Probing (Less Common, More Risky):**
        * **Exploiting Other Vulnerabilities (If Any):** If other vulnerabilities exist in the application (e.g., path traversal, information disclosure), attackers might try to exploit them to directly probe the classpath or list directory contents. This is less common for deserialization attacks but possible in combination with other weaknesses.
        * **Blind Classpath Probing (Highly Risky and Noisy):** In very rare and desperate scenarios, attackers might attempt to blindly probe the classpath by sending payloads with type hints for a large number of potential gadget classes and observing the application's behavior. This is highly noisy, likely to be detected, and may cause application instability.

* **Risk:** **Medium**.  Identifying gadget classes is crucial for successful exploitation. Without suitable gadgets, the attacker cannot reliably achieve RCE through polymorphic deserialization.  This step significantly increases the likelihood of a successful RCE attack.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**

    * **Minimize Dependencies:**  Adhere to the principle of least privilege for dependencies. Only include libraries that are strictly necessary for the application's functionality. Remove unused or redundant dependencies.
    * **Dependency Management and Security Audits:** Implement robust dependency management practices. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities, including deserialization gadgets. Use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable libraries.
    * **Update Dependencies Regularly:** Keep all dependencies, including transitive dependencies, updated to the latest versions. Security patches often address known vulnerabilities in gadget libraries.
    * **Classpath Isolation (Advanced):** In more complex environments, consider classpath isolation techniques (e.g., using separate classloaders or containerization) to limit the availability of gadget classes to specific application components. This can make it harder for attackers to find exploitable gadgets.
    * **Security Hardening of Application Server Environment:**  Harden the application server environment to prevent attackers from gaining access to the classpath through other vulnerabilities. This includes proper access controls, security configurations, and regular patching of the server operating system and runtime environment.

#### 1.1.1.5. Application Executes Malicious Code (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)

* **Description:** This node represents the successful culmination of the RCE attack. The attacker has successfully crafted a malicious JSON payload, exploited polymorphic deserialization, and leveraged gadget classes to execute arbitrary code on the application server.
* **Attack Vector:**  At this stage, the attacker has already:
    1. **Detected Polymorphic Type Handling:** Confirmed the application uses Jackson's polymorphic deserialization.
    2. **Identified Gadget Classes:** Determined the presence of vulnerable gadget classes on the classpath.

    Now, the attacker crafts a final malicious JSON payload. This payload includes:
    * **Type Hint:**  Specifies a gadget class (or a chain of gadget classes) that, when deserialized, will trigger a sequence of operations leading to code execution.
    * **Malicious Data:**  Provides data that, when processed by the gadget class chain, results in the execution of attacker-controlled code. This often involves techniques like:
        * **Command Injection:**  Using gadget classes to execute system commands directly.
        * **Scripting Engine Execution:**  Using gadget classes to execute scripts (e.g., JavaScript, Groovy) containing malicious code.
        * **Memory Manipulation:** In more advanced scenarios, attackers might use gadget classes to manipulate memory directly to inject and execute code.

    When the application deserializes this malicious JSON using Jackson, the gadget class chain is instantiated and executed, ultimately leading to the execution of the attacker's code within the application's context and with the application's privileges.

* **Risk:** **Critical**. This is the point of full compromise. The attacker has achieved Remote Code Execution, with all the severe consequences outlined in the "3. Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Polymorphic Deserialization" node.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**

    * **Focus on Prevention at Earlier Stages:** The most effective mitigation for this node is to prevent the attack from reaching this stage by implementing the mitigation strategies outlined for the previous nodes (1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3).  Disabling default typing, whitelisting allowed types, and managing dependencies are crucial preventative measures.
    * **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** RASP solutions are particularly effective at this stage. They can monitor application behavior in real-time and detect suspicious code execution patterns, even if the initial deserialization vulnerability is present. RASP can block or alert on attempts to execute system commands, load dynamic code, or perform other malicious actions.
    * **Least Privilege Principle (Application Level):**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. If the application process has limited permissions, the impact of RCE can be somewhat contained, although still highly critical.
    * **Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust security monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity that might indicate a successful RCE attack. This includes monitoring for unusual process execution, network connections, file system access, and other anomalous behaviors.
    * **Incident Response Plan:** Have a well-defined incident response plan in place to handle a confirmed RCE incident. This plan should include steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

By diligently implementing the mitigation strategies outlined for each node in this attack path, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of Remote Code Execution via Polymorphic Deserialization in applications using the Jackson library.  Prioritizing the prevention of polymorphic deserialization vulnerabilities through secure configuration and dependency management is paramount.
