## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Nesting Depth](./mitigation_strategies/control_nesting_depth.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Control Nesting Depth

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Maximum Acceptable Nesting Depth:** Analyze your application's data models to understand the maximum legitimate nesting level for JSON structures you expect to process.  Excessive nesting is often unnecessary and can be a potential attack vector.
    2.  **Configure `JsonFactory` Max Depth:** When creating `JsonFactory` instances, use the builder pattern to set the `maxDepth` limit.  For example:
        ```java
        JsonFactory jsonFactory = JsonFactory.builder().maxDepth(32).build();
        ```
        Choose a reasonable integer value for `maxDepth` based on your analysis.
    3.  **Use Configured `JsonFactory` for Parsing:** Ensure that this configured `JsonFactory` instance is used whenever you create `JsonParser` instances to parse incoming JSON data. For example:
        ```java
        try (JsonParser parser = jsonFactory.createParser(jsonPayload)) {
            // ... parsing logic ...
        } catch (JsonParseException e) {
            // ... error handling ...
        }
        ```
    4.  **Handle `JsonParseException`:** Implement error handling to catch `JsonParseException` that may be thrown when the nesting depth exceeds the configured limit.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Stack Overflow DoS via Deep Nesting (Medium to High Severity):** Parsing extremely deeply nested JSON can cause stack overflow errors in the JVM, leading to application crashes and denial of service.
    *   **Performance Degradation DoS via Deep Nesting (Medium Severity):** Parsing very deep JSON structures can consume significant CPU and memory, causing performance degradation and potential denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Stack Overflow DoS via Deep Nesting (High Reduction):** Effectively prevents stack overflow errors caused by excessive nesting by stopping parsing before the stack overflows.
    *   **Performance Degradation DoS via Deep Nesting (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of performance degradation by limiting the complexity of JSON structures processed by `jackson-core`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs Assessment. Check the codebase for instances where `JsonFactory` is created and used. Verify if `maxDepth` is explicitly set using the builder.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Likely missing in code where `JsonFactory` is instantiated. Developers might be using default `JsonFactory` instances without setting `maxDepth`.
    *   Potentially missing in unit tests to confirm that `maxDepth` is correctly configured and enforced during parsing.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Handle Parsing Errors Gracefully](./mitigation_strategies/handle_parsing_errors_gracefully.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Handle Parsing Errors Gracefully

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Parsing Code:** Locate all code sections where `jackson-core`'s `JsonParser` or related classes are used to parse JSON data.
    2.  **Implement `try-catch` Blocks:** Wrap JSON parsing code within `try-catch` blocks to specifically handle `JsonParseException` and potentially `IOException` that can occur during parsing.
        ```java
        try (JsonParser parser = jsonFactory.createParser(jsonPayload)) {
            // ... parsing logic ...
        } catch (JsonParseException e) {
            // Log error securely (not to user output)
            // Return generic error to user
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle IO errors
        }
        ```
    3.  **Securely Log Error Details:** Inside the `catch (JsonParseException e)` block, log detailed error information (exception type, message, potentially relevant parts of the input if safe) to a secure logging system. Avoid logging to standard output or error streams accessible to users.
    4.  **Return Generic Error Responses:** In the `catch (JsonParseException e)` block, ensure your application returns a generic, non-revealing error response to the user or client. Avoid exposing specific details of the parsing error in the response.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity):** Detailed `JsonParseException` messages might reveal information about the application's internal structure or data format to attackers if exposed directly.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior (Low Severity):** Unhandled `JsonParseException` exceptions can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes if not caught and managed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages (High Reduction):** Prevents leakage of internal details through error messages by providing generic responses and logging details securely.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior (Medium Reduction):** Improves application stability by gracefully handling parsing errors and preventing unhandled exceptions from propagating.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Potentially Partially Implemented. Basic `try-catch` blocks might exist, but error handling might not be consistently applied for `JsonParseException` specifically, or logging and response generation might not be secure.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Inconsistent error handling for `JsonParseException` across all JSON parsing locations in the application.
    *   Potentially missing secure logging practices within `JsonParseException` handlers (logging to insecure locations or including sensitive data in logs).
    *   Potentially exposing detailed error information to users instead of generic responses when `JsonParseException` occurs.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Secure Parsing Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/use_secure_parsing_configurations.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Use Secure Parsing Configurations

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `JsonFactory` Features:** Examine the available `JsonFactory.Feature` and `StreamReadFeature` enums. Understand the purpose of each feature and its potential security implications. Refer to Jackson documentation for details on each feature.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** For each `JsonFactory` instance you create, explicitly disable any `JsonFactory.Feature` or `StreamReadFeature` that are not essential for your application's JSON processing requirements. For example, if you don't need to parse JSON comments, disable `StreamReadFeature.ALLOW_COMMENTS`.
        ```java
        JsonFactory jsonFactory = JsonFactory.builder()
                .disable(StreamReadFeature.ALLOW_COMMENTS)
                .disable(StreamReadFeature.ALLOW_UNQUOTED_FIELD_NAMES) // Example: Disable if not needed
                .build();
        ```
    3.  **Configure Number and String Handling:**  If your application has specific requirements or security concerns related to number or string parsing, explore relevant `JsonFactory.Feature` and `StreamReadFeature` options that control how these data types are handled. Configure them to align with your security needs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Parsing Behavior (Low to Medium Severity):**  Default or overly permissive parsing settings might lead to unexpected behavior when processing unusual or crafted JSON inputs, potentially causing application errors or vulnerabilities in specific scenarios.
    *   **Subtle Parsing Flaws (Low Severity):**  In rare cases, certain combinations of parsing features and specific JSON input might expose subtle parsing flaws that could be exploited.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Parsing Behavior (Low to Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of unexpected parsing behavior by enforcing stricter parsing rules and disabling features that are not strictly required, minimizing potential attack surface.
    *   **Subtle Parsing Flaws (Low Reduction):** Minimally reduces the risk of subtle parsing flaws by simplifying parsing configurations and disabling potentially less secure or less robust features.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Needs Assessment. Check the codebase for `JsonFactory` instantiation. Determine if any `JsonFactory.Feature` or `StreamReadFeature` settings are explicitly configured beyond the defaults.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Likely using default `JsonFactory` configurations without explicitly reviewing and adjusting `JsonFactory.Feature` and `StreamReadFeature` settings for security best practices.
    *   Potentially using more permissive parsing configurations than necessary, increasing the potential attack surface.
