## Deep Dive Analysis: Denial of Service (DoS) through Deeply Nested JSON Structures in Jackson Core

This document provides a detailed analysis of the Denial of Service (DoS) threat involving deeply nested JSON structures when using the `jackson-core` library. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the threat, its implications, and effective mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Overview:**

The core of this threat lies in the inherent recursive nature of JSON structures and how parsers like `jackson-core` handle them. When an attacker crafts a JSON payload with an extremely deep level of nesting (e.g., hundreds or thousands of nested objects or arrays), the parser can consume excessive resources, leading to a DoS.

**2. Technical Deep Dive:**

* **Recursive Parsing Logic:**  `jackson-core`'s `UTF8StreamJsonParser` (and its counterparts for other encodings) uses a recursive approach to traverse the JSON structure. As it encounters opening brackets (`{` or `[`), it effectively makes a function call (or pushes state onto a stack) to handle the nested element. With each level of nesting, the call stack grows.
* **Stack Overflow:**  If the nesting depth is excessive, the call stack can exceed its allocated memory, resulting in a `StackOverflowError`. This is a critical error that will immediately crash the JVM process.
* **Memory Consumption:** Even if the nesting doesn't directly cause a stack overflow, the parser needs to maintain internal data structures to track the current parsing state, the hierarchy of objects/arrays, and potentially store intermediate values. Deeply nested structures can lead to significant memory allocation for these internal structures, potentially leading to `OutOfMemoryError` or severe performance degradation due to excessive garbage collection.
* **Affected Component - `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser`:** This class is responsible for the low-level parsing of UTF-8 encoded JSON input. Its methods like `nextToken()`, which iterates through the JSON tokens, are central to the parsing process and are directly involved in traversing the nested structures. The internal state management within this class is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by deeply nested input.
* **Internal Data Structures:**  While the exact implementation details are internal to `jackson-core`, we can infer that structures like stacks or linked lists are used to keep track of the current parsing context (e.g., which object or array is currently being processed). Deep nesting significantly increases the size of these structures.

**3. Attack Vector and Exploitation:**

* **Crafting the Malicious Payload:** An attacker can easily generate a JSON payload with deep nesting. This can be done programmatically or even manually. A simple example of a deeply nested object:

```json
{"a": {"b": {"c": {"d": { /* ... hundreds of levels ... */ "z": 1 }}}}}
```

* **Delivery Methods:** The attacker can deliver this malicious payload through any endpoint that accepts JSON input, such as:
    * API endpoints accepting POST or PUT requests.
    * Message queues or event streams processing JSON messages.
    * Configuration files or data loaded during application startup.
* **Exploitation Scenario:**
    1. The attacker sends a crafted JSON payload with excessive nesting to the application.
    2. The application uses `jackson-core` to parse this payload.
    3. `UTF8StreamJsonParser` starts processing the nested structure recursively.
    4. With each level of nesting, the call stack grows or internal data structures consume more memory.
    5. Eventually, either a `StackOverflowError` occurs, crashing the application immediately, or memory consumption becomes excessive, leading to performance degradation and potentially an `OutOfMemoryError`.
    6. The application becomes unavailable, resulting in a Denial of Service.

**4. Impact Assessment:**

* **High Risk Severity:** This rating is justified due to the potential for complete application unavailability, which can have significant business consequences.
* **Direct Impact:** Application crashes, leading to immediate service disruption for users.
* **Resource Exhaustion:** Server resources (CPU, memory) are consumed, potentially impacting other applications running on the same infrastructure.
* **Recovery Time:**  Restarting the application might be necessary, leading to downtime. Identifying and blocking the malicious source might require further investigation.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Downtime can damage the organization's reputation and erode user trust.

**5. Detailed Analysis of Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement Limits on Maximum Nesting Depth (Application Level):**
    * **Pros:** This is a highly effective mitigation strategy. By setting a reasonable limit, you prevent the parser from processing excessively deep structures.
    * **Cons:** Requires careful consideration of what constitutes a "reasonable" limit for your application's use cases. Setting the limit too low might reject legitimate, albeit deeply nested, data.
    * **Implementation:** This can be implemented by:
        * **Custom Request Validation:**  Before passing the JSON to `jackson-core`, implement logic to traverse the JSON structure and count the nesting depth.
        * **Middleware or Interceptors:**  Create middleware or interceptors that perform this validation for incoming requests.
        * **Libraries for JSON Schema Validation:**  Some JSON schema validation libraries allow defining constraints on nesting depth.
    * **Example (Conceptual):**

    ```java
    public boolean isDepthValid(String json, int maxDepth) {
        int currentDepth = 0;
        int maxEncounteredDepth = 0;
        for (char c : json.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '{' || c == '[') {
                currentDepth++;
                maxEncounteredDepth = Math.max(maxEncounteredDepth, currentDepth);
            } else if (c == '}' || c == ']') {
                currentDepth--;
            }
            if (maxEncounteredDepth > maxDepth) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

* **Configure Jackson Core Parser (If Available):**
    * **Current Status:**  As of the current version of `jackson-core` (and up to the latest versions of `jackson-databind` which uses `jackson-core`), there is **no direct built-in configuration option within `jackson-core` itself to limit the nesting depth and throw an exception.**
    * **Alternatives and Workarounds:**
        * **Custom `JsonFactory` and `JsonParser`:**  While complex, you could potentially extend or wrap the default `JsonFactory` and `JsonParser` to inject your own logic for tracking and limiting nesting depth. This requires a deep understanding of Jackson's internal architecture.
        * **Using `jackson-databind` Features:**  While `jackson-core` doesn't have this directly, `jackson-databind` (which builds upon `jackson-core`) offers some related features that might indirectly help:
            * **`DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_TRAILING_TOKENS`:** While not directly related to nesting, this can prevent parsing of malformed JSON with extra closing brackets, which could be part of a malicious payload.
            * **Custom Deserializers:** You could potentially implement custom deserializers for complex objects that perform depth checks during deserialization. However, this is more targeted and doesn't prevent the initial parsing overhead.
        * **External Libraries:** Explore external libraries specifically designed for JSON validation and sanitization, which might offer more robust controls over structure and nesting.

**6. Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Prioritize Implementation of Application-Level Nesting Limits:** This is the most effective and readily implementable mitigation. Determine a reasonable maximum nesting depth based on your application's requirements and enforce it rigorously.
* **Investigate and Implement Robust Request Validation:**  Beyond just nesting depth, consider validating other aspects of the JSON payload, such as size, data types, and allowed values.
* **Explore Potential for Custom Parser or Wrappers (with Caution):** If the application has very specific and stringent security requirements, exploring custom parser implementations or wrappers around Jackson's parser might be considered. However, this should be approached with caution due to the complexity and potential for introducing new vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor Resource Usage:** Implement monitoring to track CPU and memory usage of the application. This can help detect potential DoS attacks in progress.
* **Consider a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be configured with rules to detect and block requests with excessively deep JSON structures before they reach the application.
* **Thorough Testing:**  Conduct thorough testing with various JSON payloads, including those with deep nesting, to ensure the implemented mitigation strategies are effective and do not introduce unintended side effects.
* **Stay Updated with Jackson Security Advisories:** Regularly review security advisories for `jackson-core` and `jackson-databind` to be aware of any newly discovered vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations.

**7. Conclusion:**

The Denial of Service threat through deeply nested JSON structures is a significant concern for applications using `jackson-core`. While `jackson-core` itself doesn't offer direct configuration for limiting nesting depth, implementing application-level limits is a crucial and effective mitigation strategy. By understanding the technical details of the threat and implementing appropriate safeguards, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack. Remember that a layered security approach, combining input validation, resource monitoring, and potentially a WAF, provides the best defense against this and other threats.
