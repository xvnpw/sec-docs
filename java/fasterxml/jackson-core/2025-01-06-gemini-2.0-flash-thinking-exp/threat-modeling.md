# Threat Model Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-core

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Large JSON Payloads](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_large_json_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the application. `jackson-core` attempts to parse this large payload, consuming excessive memory and CPU resources, leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable, impacting users and potentially causing financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser` (responsible for parsing UTF-8 encoded JSON streams), `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory` (used to create parser instances).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming JSON payloads at the application level.
* Configure `jackson-core`'s `JsonFactory` to impose limits on the maximum input size if available.
* Implement timeouts for JSON parsing operations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Deeply Nested JSON Structures](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_deeply_nested_json_structures.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with excessively deep nesting of objects or arrays. `jackson-core`'s parsing logic might recursively process these nested structures, potentially leading to stack overflow errors or excessive memory consumption.

**Impact:** Application crashes due to stack overflow or excessive memory usage, leading to unavailability.

**Affected Component:** `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.UTF8StreamJsonParser` (recursive parsing logic), internal data structures used for tracking parsing state.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum nesting depth allowed for incoming JSON payloads at the application level.
* Consider configuring `jackson-core`'s parser to throw an exception if a certain nesting depth is exceeded (if such configuration is available).

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities within `jackson-core` (Known CVEs)](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_within__jackson-core___known_cves_.md)

**Description:** `jackson-core`, like any software library, may contain security vulnerabilities that are discovered and assigned CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated version of the library.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from Denial of Service to other more severe consequences if vulnerabilities in `jackson-core` itself allow for it.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the `jackson-core` library, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific CVE).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `jackson-core` updated to the latest stable version. Regularly monitor for security advisories and update the library promptly when new versions are released that address vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency management tools to track and manage the versions of your dependencies and receive alerts about known vulnerabilities.
