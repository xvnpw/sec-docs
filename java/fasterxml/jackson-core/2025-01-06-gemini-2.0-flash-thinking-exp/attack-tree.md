## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This represents a fundamental weakness in how the application handles incoming JSON data. Successfully exploiting parsing vulnerabilities can lead to various negative outcomes, including DoS and unexpected application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Send Malicious JSON Payload (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_send_malicious_json_payload__critical_node_.md)

This is the direct action attackers take to exploit parsing vulnerabilities. It involves crafting specific JSON payloads designed to trigger flaws in the `jackson-core` library or the application's handling of parsed data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Trigger Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_trigger_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

This path focuses on making the application unavailable by overwhelming it with malicious JSON.
    *   **1.1.1.1 Send Extremely Large JSON Payloads (Critical Node):**
        *   Attackers send exceptionally large JSON payloads to the application.
        *   `jackson-core` attempts to parse this large data, consuming excessive memory and potentially CPU resources.
        *   This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive, crashing, or exhausting server resources, resulting in a denial of service for legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Exploit Potential Bugs in Tokenizer/Parser (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_exploit_potential_bugs_in_tokenizerparser__critical_node_.md)

This focuses on leveraging potential, though less likely, vulnerabilities within the core parsing engine of `jackson-core`.
*   Attackers would need to identify specific edge cases or flaws in how the tokenizer or parser handles certain JSON constructs.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially even more severe vulnerabilities if the parsing error can be leveraged further. While the likelihood is lower due to the maturity of the library, the impact of such a bug can be significant.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Resource Consumption Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_resource_consumption_vulnerabilities.md)

This path aims to exhaust the application's resources, specifically memory, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Cause Excessive Memory Consumption (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_cause_excessive_memory_consumption__critical_node_.md)

This is the direct goal of resource consumption attacks targeting memory. By forcing the application to allocate large amounts of memory, attackers can cause it to slow down, become unresponsive, or crash.
    *   **2.1.1 Send Extremely Large JSON Payloads (Critical Node):**
        *   (Reiteration from 1.1.1.1 for emphasis on its role in resource consumption).
        *   Sending massive JSON data directly forces the `jackson-core` library to allocate significant memory to parse and represent the data.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse of Application Logic Based on Parsed Data](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_of_application_logic_based_on_parsed_data.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the application's business logic by manipulating the data provided in the JSON payload. This is not a direct vulnerability of `jackson-core` itself, but rather a consequence of how the application utilizes the parsed data.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 Manipulate Parsed Data to Cause Logic Errors (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_manipulate_parsed_data_to_cause_logic_errors__critical_node_.md)

Attackers craft JSON payloads with specific values or structures intended to trigger unintended or erroneous behavior in the application's business logic after the JSON has been successfully parsed by `jackson-core`.
    *   **4.1.1 Send JSON with Specific Values to Exploit Application Business Logic (Critical Node):**
        *   Attackers analyze the application's logic and identify input values that can lead to undesirable outcomes.
        *   They then craft JSON payloads containing these specific values.
        *   For example, sending a negative value for a quantity field if the application doesn't properly validate it, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or database updates.
