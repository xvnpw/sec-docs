**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application via Jackson-core Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Description:** The attacker's ultimate goal is to compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses in the Jackson-core library.
* **Mechanism:** This is the root goal, achieved by successfully executing one or more of the attack paths detailed below.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access.
* **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive security measures across all identified high-risk paths and critical nodes.

**2. Exploit JSON Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities in how Jackson-core parses incoming JSON data.
* **Mechanism:** Sending specially crafted JSON payloads designed to trigger errors, resource exhaustion, or exploit known vulnerabilities in the parsing logic.
* **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for information disclosure or remote code execution (depending on the specific vulnerability).
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling, input validation, resource limits, and keep Jackson-core updated.

**3. Provide Malformed JSON Input [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Description:** The attacker provides JSON input that is syntactically incorrect or does not conform to expected data types.
* **Mechanism:** Jackson-core attempts to parse the malformed JSON, potentially leading to exceptions, unexpected behavior, or resource exhaustion.
* **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential for revealing internal error messages.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Implement robust error handling around JSON parsing using try-catch blocks.
    * Log errors securely without exposing sensitive information.
    * Define clear data schemas or contracts for expected JSON structures.
    * Validate data types after parsing.

**4. Trigger Parser Errors [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** The attacker aims to cause errors during the JSON parsing process.
* **Mechanism:** Providing JSON input that violates the JSON syntax or contains unexpected data types.
* **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for logic flaws.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Implement strict JSON schema validation.
    * Perform thorough input sanitization.
    * Implement type checking in application logic after parsing.

**5. Provide Invalid Syntax [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** Input JSON with syntax errors (e.g., missing quotes, commas).
* **Mechanism:** Jackson-core attempts to parse the invalid JSON, potentially leading to exceptions or unexpected behavior.
* **Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service (if not handled properly), potential for revealing internal error messages.
* **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling around JSON parsing, use try-catch blocks, log errors securely without exposing sensitive information.

**6. Trigger Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** The attacker attempts to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) by providing specially crafted JSON.
* **Mechanism:** Sending extremely large or deeply nested JSON payloads that overwhelm Jackson-core's parsing process.
* **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming JSON payloads.
    * Implement limits on the maximum depth of JSON nesting during parsing.
    * Consider using streaming parsing for very large files if applicable.

**7. Provide Extremely Large JSON Payload [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** Send a JSON payload that is excessively large in size.
* **Mechanism:** Jackson-core attempts to parse and store the large payload in memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.
* **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability.
* **Mitigation:** Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming JSON payloads, consider using streaming parsing for very large files if applicable.

**8. Exploit Specific Jackson-core Parsing Vulnerabilities (If Any Exist) [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within Jackson-core's parsing logic.
* **Mechanism:** Sending specially crafted JSON payloads that trigger the identified vulnerability.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, could range from denial of service to remote code execution.
* **Mitigation:**
    * Regularly update Jackson-core to the latest stable version.
    * Monitor security advisories for new vulnerabilities.
    * Implement a vulnerability management process.
    * Employ secure coding practices.
    * Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing.

**9. Leverage Known CVEs in Jackson-core [HIGH RISK PATH]:**

* **Description:** Exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Jackson-core being used.
* **Mechanism:** Sending specially crafted JSON payloads that trigger the identified vulnerability in Jackson-core's parsing logic.
* **Impact:** Varies depending on the CVE, could range from denial of service to remote code execution (though less likely in core).
* **Mitigation:** Regularly update Jackson-core to the latest stable version, monitor security advisories for new vulnerabilities, implement a vulnerability management process.
