Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Known Gadgets" attack tree path, tailored for a development team using `jackson-core`, presented in Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Jackson Deserialization - Known Gadgets (Attack Tree Path 1.1.1)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the "Known Gadgets" attack vector against applications using `jackson-core` for JSON deserialization.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within our application's codebase and configuration that could expose it to this attack.
*   Provide actionable recommendations and mitigation strategies to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk.
*   Educate the development team on the nature of this vulnerability and best practices for secure deserialization.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target Application:**  [**Replace with the actual name/description of your application**]  This includes all components, services, and APIs that utilize `jackson-core` for deserialization of JSON data from *untrusted* sources.  Untrusted sources include, but are not limited to:
    *   User-supplied input via web forms, API requests, etc.
    *   Data received from external systems or third-party APIs.
    *   Data read from message queues or databases where the data origin cannot be fully verified.
*   **Library:** `jackson-core` and related Jackson libraries (e.g., `jackson-databind`).  We will consider the specific versions used in our application.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of "Known Gadgets" â€“ publicly documented classes or class sequences that lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) upon deserialization.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover:
    *   Other deserialization vulnerabilities *not* related to known gadgets (e.g., custom deserializers with flaws).
    *   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application stack (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) unless they directly relate to the deserialization issue.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, unless they are a direct consequence of a gadget chain.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough examination of the application's codebase to identify all instances where `jackson-core` is used for deserialization.  This includes:
    *   Searching for `ObjectMapper` instances and their usage.
    *   Identifying classes annotated with `@JsonTypeInfo` or using `@JsonSubTypes`.
    *   Analyzing configuration files (e.g., Spring configuration) related to Jackson.
    *   Examining how user input or data from external sources is processed and deserialized.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Identify all project dependencies, paying close attention to libraries commonly associated with gadget chains (e.g., Spring, Apache Commons, etc.).  We will use dependency management tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to generate a dependency tree.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Consult public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) and security research publications (e.g., ysoserial project, Black Hat presentations) to identify known gadget chains relevant to our dependencies.
4.  **Risk Assessment:**  Evaluate the likelihood and impact of a successful "Known Gadgets" attack based on the code review, dependency analysis, and vulnerability research.
5.  **Mitigation Planning:**  Develop specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.  This will include code changes, configuration adjustments, and potential architectural modifications.
6.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Document all findings, risks, and recommendations in a clear and concise manner.  This report will serve as a guide for remediation efforts.
7. **Testing:** After the implementation of mitigations, perform penetration testing to verify the effectiveness.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.1 (Known Gadgets)

### 2.1 Threat Model and Attack Scenario

**Threat Actor:**  A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the application.  The attacker may have varying levels of sophistication, from script kiddies using publicly available exploits to advanced attackers crafting custom payloads.

**Attack Scenario:**

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies the application and determines that it uses Java and likely Jackson for JSON processing.  This might be done through:
    *   Observing HTTP headers (e.g., `Server`, `X-Powered-By`).
    *   Analyzing error messages that reveal stack traces.
    *   Examining client-side JavaScript code that interacts with the API.
    *   Using automated vulnerability scanners.
2.  **Endpoint Discovery:** The attacker identifies endpoints that accept JSON input.  This could be done through:
    *   Fuzzing the application with various inputs.
    *   Analyzing API documentation (if available).
    *   Reverse-engineering client-side code.
3.  **Gadget Selection:** The attacker researches known gadget chains compatible with the application's dependencies.  They might use tools like `ysoserial` to generate payloads for common gadgets.
4.  **Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that includes:
    *   A type identifier (`@class` or similar) that points to a vulnerable class or a class that initiates a gadget chain.
    *   Data that triggers the desired behavior within the gadget chain (e.g., executing a specific command).
5.  **Exploitation:** The attacker sends the malicious JSON payload to the vulnerable endpoint.
6.  **RCE:** The application deserializes the payload, triggering the gadget chain and executing arbitrary code on the server.  This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   System compromise.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Lateral movement within the network.

### 2.2 Code Review Findings (Example - Needs to be replaced with your application's specifics)

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable):**

```java
// VulnerableController.java
@RestController
public class VulnerableController {

    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    @PostMapping("/processData")
    public ResponseEntity<String> processData(@RequestBody Object data) throws JsonProcessingException {
        // DANGEROUS: Deserializing directly to Object without type restrictions
        // Enables polymorphic deserialization by default.
        MyData myData = objectMapper.readValue(data.toString(), MyData.class);

        // ... process myData ...

        return ResponseEntity.ok("Data processed");
    }
}

// MyData.java
@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = "@class")
public class MyData {
    private String someField;
    // ... getters and setters ...
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

*   **`@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, ...)`:** This annotation on `MyData` enables polymorphic deserialization.  It tells Jackson to use the `@class` property in the JSON payload to determine the actual class to instantiate.
*   **`objectMapper.readValue(data.toString(), MyData.class)`:**  This line deserializes the incoming data into a `MyData` object.  However, because of the `@JsonTypeInfo` annotation, the attacker can control the actual type being instantiated by providing a malicious `@class` value.
*   **`@RequestBody Object data`:** Accepting `Object` as the request body type is a major red flag.  It indicates that the application is not enforcing any type restrictions on the incoming data, making it highly susceptible to deserialization attacks.

**Example Scenario (Less Vulnerable, but still requires careful review):**

```java
// LessVulnerableController.java
@RestController
public class LessVulnerableController {

    private final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

    // Configure ObjectMapper to use a whitelist (example)
    public LessVulnerableController() {
        objectMapper.activateDefaultTyping(
            BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
                .allowIfSubType("com.example.myapp.safe.") // Only allow types within this package
                .build(),
            ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL
        );
    }

    @PostMapping("/processData")
    public ResponseEntity<String> processData(@RequestBody MySafeData data) {
        // ... process data ...
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Data processed");
    }
}

// MySafeData.java
// No @JsonTypeInfo annotation needed if using activateDefaultTyping with a whitelist
public class MySafeData {
    private String someField;
    // ... getters and setters ...
}
```

**Explanation (Less Vulnerable):**

*   **`activateDefaultTyping(...)` with `BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator`:** This configuration attempts to restrict polymorphic deserialization to a specific package (`com.example.myapp.safe.`).  This is a *much* better approach than allowing arbitrary classes.
*   **`@RequestBody MySafeData data`:**  The controller now expects a specific type (`MySafeData`) instead of `Object`.  This further restricts the attack surface.

**However, even this "less vulnerable" example has potential issues:**

*   **Whitelist Bypass:**  Attackers might find ways to bypass the whitelist if it's not configured correctly or if there are vulnerabilities within the allowed package.
*   **`NON_FINAL`:**  Using `ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL` still allows deserialization of non-final classes, which could potentially include gadgets.  `NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS` or `JAVA_LANG_OBJECT` are even more dangerous.
*   **Complex Object Graphs:**  Even with a whitelist, complex object graphs with nested objects could still be vulnerable if any of the allowed classes have unintended side effects during deserialization.

### 2.3 Dependency Analysis (Example - Needs to be replaced with your application's specifics)

Use your build tool (Maven, Gradle) to generate a dependency tree.  For example, in Maven:

```bash
mvn dependency:tree
```

**Example Output (Partial):**

```
[INFO] com.example:my-application:jar:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
[INFO] +- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:jar:2.13.3:compile
[INFO] |  +- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:jar:2.13.3:compile
[INFO] |  \- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:jar:2.13.3:compile
[INFO] +- org.springframework:spring-webmvc:jar:5.3.20:compile
[INFO] |  +- org.springframework:spring-aop:jar:5.3.20:compile
[INFO] |  +- org.springframework:spring-beans:jar:5.3.20:compile

[INFO] +- org.apache.commons:commons-collections4:jar:4.4:compile
[INFO] +- ... (other dependencies) ...
```

**Key Dependencies to Investigate:**

*   **`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`:**  The core Jackson library for data binding.  The version number is crucial.
*   **`org.springframework:spring-*`:**  Spring Framework components are often involved in gadget chains.
*   **`org.apache.commons:commons-collections4`:**  Apache Commons Collections has had several known gadget vulnerabilities.
*   **Other Libraries:**  Any library that might be used for object serialization/deserialization or that has known vulnerabilities should be investigated.

### 2.4 Vulnerability Research

*   **ysoserial:**  A collection of utilities and property-oriented programming "gadget chains" discovered in common Java libraries that can, under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing unsafe object deserialization. (https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial)
*   **NVD (National Vulnerability Database):**  Search for CVEs related to `jackson-databind` and your other dependencies. (https://nvd.nist.gov/)
*   **Black Hat and DEF CON Presentations:**  Security conferences often feature presentations on new deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Blogs and Articles:**  Stay up-to-date on the latest research in this area.

**Example Known Gadgets (Illustrative - This list is not exhaustive and changes frequently):**

*   **Spring AOP:**  Gadgets related to Spring's Aspect-Oriented Programming framework.
*   **Apache Commons Collections:**  Gadgets involving `Transformer` and `InvokerTransformer` classes.
*   **C3P0:**  A connection pooling library with known gadget vulnerabilities.
*   **Rome:**  A library for working with RSS and Atom feeds.
*   **XBean:** An Apache project.

### 2.5 Risk Assessment

Based on the findings from the previous steps, assess the risk:

*   **Likelihood:**  High.  If the application uses polymorphic deserialization without proper restrictions and has vulnerable dependencies, it's highly likely to be exploitable.
*   **Impact:**  High.  Successful exploitation leads to RCE, which can result in complete system compromise.
*   **Overall Risk:**  High.  This vulnerability requires immediate attention and remediation.

### 2.6 Mitigation Planning

**1. Disable Polymorphic Deserialization (Preferred):**

   *   **Remove `@JsonTypeInfo` annotations:**  If polymorphic deserialization is not *absolutely* necessary, remove these annotations from your data classes.
   *   **Avoid `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`:**  Do not use this method unless you have a very strong reason and a well-configured whitelist.
   *   **Use Specific Types:**  Always deserialize to specific, known types instead of `Object` or generic types.

**2. Use a Strict Whitelist (If Polymorphic Deserialization is Required):**

   *   **`BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator`:**  Use this validator to restrict allowed types to a specific package or set of classes.
     ```java
        objectMapper.activateDefaultTyping(
            BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
                .allowIfSubType("com.example.myapp.safe.") // Only allow types within this package
                // OR
                .allowIfSubType(MySafeClass1.class)
                .allowIfSubType(MySafeClass2.class)
                .build(),
            ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL // Consider using a more restrictive option if possible
        );
     ```
   *   **Custom `PolymorphicTypeValidator`:**  For more complex scenarios, create a custom validator that implements your specific security requirements.
   *   **Regularly Review the Whitelist:**  Ensure that the whitelist only contains classes that are absolutely necessary and that those classes are themselves secure.

**3. Update Dependencies:**

   *   **Update `jackson-databind`:**  Use the latest stable version of Jackson, as it often includes fixes for known vulnerabilities.
   *   **Update Other Dependencies:**  Update all dependencies to their latest stable versions, especially those known to be associated with gadget chains.
   *   **Use Dependency Management Tools:**  Use tools like Maven's `versions:display-dependency-updates` or Gradle's dependency updates plugin to identify outdated dependencies.

**4. Input Validation:**

   *   **Validate JSON Structure:**  Before deserialization, validate the structure of the JSON payload to ensure it conforms to the expected format.  This can help prevent some attacks that rely on malformed JSON.
   *   **Sanitize Input:**  If possible, sanitize any user-supplied data that is included in the JSON payload to remove potentially harmful characters.

**5. Security Hardening:**

   *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the least privilege necessary.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.
   *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the application from other critical systems to prevent lateral movement.
   *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block some deserialization attacks.
   *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  An IDS can monitor for suspicious activity that might indicate an attempted exploit.

**6. Secure Coding Practices:**

   *   **Avoid `Object` as Input Type:** Always use specific types for request bodies.
   *   **Understand Deserialization Risks:**  Educate the development team about the dangers of insecure deserialization.
   *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### 2.7 Documentation and Reporting

*   This document serves as the initial report.
*   Create Jira tickets (or equivalent) for each identified vulnerability and mitigation task.
*   Track the progress of remediation efforts.
*   Update this document with any new findings or changes.

### 2.8 Testing
* After implementing the mitigations, perform penetration testing using tools like ysoserial.
* Create unit and integration tests to verify that deserialization works as expected and that known gadget chains are blocked.
* Test edge cases and boundary conditions to ensure the whitelist (if used) is effective.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Known Gadgets" attack vector against Jackson deserialization is a serious threat that requires careful attention. By following the steps outlined in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and improve the overall security of the application.  Continuous monitoring, regular updates, and a strong security-focused development culture are essential for maintaining a secure application in the face of evolving threats.
