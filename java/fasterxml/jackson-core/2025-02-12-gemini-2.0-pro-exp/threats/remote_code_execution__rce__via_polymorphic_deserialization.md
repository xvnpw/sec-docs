Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the RCE threat via polymorphic deserialization in Jackson.

## Deep Analysis: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Polymorphic Deserialization in Jackson

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:** To thoroughly understand the mechanics of the RCE vulnerability in Jackson related to polymorphic deserialization, identify specific attack vectors, analyze the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and provide actionable recommendations for developers.  We aim to go beyond the surface-level description and delve into the underlying code behavior and security implications.

*   **Scope:**
    *   Focus on `jackson-core` library, specifically versions 2.x.
    *   Analyze the interaction between `ObjectMapper`, type handling configurations (`@JsonTypeInfo`, `enableDefaultTyping()`), and the deserialization process.
    *   Examine known gadget chains and the potential for discovering new ones.
    *   Evaluate the effectiveness of each mitigation strategy, including their limitations and potential bypasses.
    *   Consider the impact of different Java environments (e.g., presence/absence of `SecurityManager`, different JDK versions).
    *   Exclude analysis of other Jackson modules (e.g., `jackson-databind`, `jackson-dataformat-xml`) unless directly relevant to the core deserialization vulnerability.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Code Review:** Examine the source code of `jackson-core` to understand how polymorphic type handling is implemented and how it interacts with the deserialization process.  Specifically, focus on classes like `ObjectMapper`, `BeanDeserializer`, `TypeDeserializer`, and related helper classes.
    2.  **Vulnerability Research:** Review existing CVEs, security advisories, blog posts, and research papers related to Jackson deserialization vulnerabilities.  Identify known gadget chains and attack techniques.
    3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:** Create or adapt existing PoCs to demonstrate the vulnerability in a controlled environment. This will help to verify the understanding of the attack vectors and test the effectiveness of mitigations.
    4.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  For each mitigation strategy, analyze its implementation in Jackson, identify potential weaknesses or bypasses, and assess its overall effectiveness.
    5.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document the findings, including the vulnerability mechanics, attack vectors, mitigation strategies, and recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

#### 2.1. Vulnerability Mechanics

The core of the vulnerability lies in Jackson's ability to deserialize JSON data into objects of arbitrary types, as specified within the JSON itself.  This "polymorphic deserialization" is powerful but inherently dangerous if not carefully controlled.

*   **Polymorphic Type Handling:** Jackson uses type information embedded in the JSON (typically via the `@class` property or similar mechanisms) to determine the concrete class to instantiate during deserialization.  This is often enabled through:
    *   `enableDefaultTyping()`:  This method (and its variants) enables polymorphic deserialization for *all* types, making it extremely dangerous.  It essentially trusts the type information provided in the JSON without any validation.
    *   `@JsonTypeInfo`: This annotation allows more granular control over polymorphic deserialization.  However, using `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS` as the type identifier is risky because it allows specifying arbitrary class names.

*   **Gadget Chains:**  The attacker exploits this by providing a type identifier that points to a "gadget" class.  A gadget class is a class that, during its instantiation, deserialization, or finalization, performs actions that can be leveraged for malicious purposes.  These actions might include:
    *   Executing system commands (e.g., via `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`).
    *   Loading and executing arbitrary bytecode (e.g., via `TemplatesImpl`).
    *   Accessing and manipulating sensitive resources.

    Gadget chains are sequences of these gadget classes, where the output of one gadget becomes the input of the next, ultimately leading to RCE.  Publicly known gadget chains exist for various libraries, and new ones are continuously being discovered.

*   **Deserialization Process:** When Jackson encounters a JSON object with type information, it performs the following steps (simplified):
    1.  Reads the type identifier (e.g., the value of the `@class` property).
    2.  Resolves the type identifier to a `Class<?>` object.  This is where `TypeResolverBuilder` and `TypeIdResolver` come into play.
    3.  Creates an instance of the resolved class using its default constructor (or a configured constructor).
    4.  Populates the object's fields by recursively deserializing the remaining JSON data.
    5.  If the class implements `Serializable` and has a `readObject()` method, that method is invoked. This is a common entry point for gadget chains.

#### 2.2. Attack Vectors

*   **Untrusted JSON Input:** The primary attack vector is through accepting and deserializing JSON input from untrusted sources (e.g., user-supplied data, external APIs).
*   **Misconfigured `ObjectMapper`:**  Using `enableDefaultTyping()` or `@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.CLASS)` without proper whitelisting allows attackers to specify arbitrary classes.
*   **Vulnerable Gadget Classes:** The presence of vulnerable gadget classes in the application's classpath (including dependencies) is a prerequisite for a successful attack.
*   **Bypassing Weak Mitigations:**  Attackers may attempt to bypass weak whitelists or blacklists by:
    *   Finding alternative gadget classes not included in the blacklist.
    *   Using class name obfuscation or variations.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom `TypeResolverBuilder` or `TypeIdResolver` implementations.

#### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies Analysis

Let's analyze each mitigation strategy in detail:

*   **Avoid `enableDefaultTyping()`:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective.  This eliminates the most dangerous configuration option.
    *   **Limitations:**  None, if polymorphic deserialization is not required. If it *is* required, other mitigations must be used.
    *   **Bypass:**  Not applicable.

*   **Strict Whitelisting (using `@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NAME)` with `@JsonSubTypes`):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Very effective when implemented correctly.  By explicitly listing allowed subtypes, it prevents the instantiation of arbitrary classes.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires careful maintenance.  Adding new subtypes requires updating the whitelist.  It can be complex to manage in large applications with many polymorphic types.
    *   **Bypass:**  If the whitelist is incomplete or contains a vulnerable gadget class, the attacker can exploit it.  Also, if a whitelisted class has a vulnerability that can be triggered during deserialization, it can be exploited.

*   **Gadget Class Blacklisting (using `DeserializationProblemHandler`):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Provides a defense-in-depth layer.  It can block known vulnerable gadget chains.
    *   **Limitations:**  Relies on an up-to-date blacklist.  New gadget chains are constantly being discovered, so the blacklist needs to be maintained.  It's a reactive approach, not a proactive one.
    *   **Bypass:**  Attackers can find new gadget chains or use obfuscation techniques to bypass the blacklist.

*   **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Limited.  It can help prevent some attacks by rejecting unexpected data, but it's not a reliable primary mitigation.
    *   **Limitations:**  Difficult to implement comprehensively.  It's hard to anticipate all possible malicious inputs.  It doesn't address the underlying vulnerability.
    *   **Bypass:**  Attackers can craft payloads that bypass input validation rules.

*   **Regular Updates:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Essential.  Updates often include security patches that address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limitations:**  Doesn't guarantee protection against zero-day vulnerabilities.
    *   **Bypass:**  Not applicable.

*   **SecurityManager (Deprecated):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Can limit the damage of a successful exploit by restricting the capabilities of deserialized code.
    *   **Limitations:**  Deprecated in newer Java versions.  Complex to configure and maintain.  Can introduce performance overhead.  May not be effective against all types of attacks.
    *   **Bypass:**  Attackers may find ways to escalate privileges or bypass the `SecurityManager`'s restrictions.

#### 2.4. Recommendations

1.  **Never use `enableDefaultTyping()`**. This is the single most important recommendation.
2.  **Use strict whitelisting with `@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NAME)` and `@JsonSubTypes`**.  Carefully define the allowed subtypes for polymorphic deserialization.  Avoid `Id.CLASS` and `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS` unless absolutely necessary, and then only with a very strict, manually maintained whitelist.
3.  **Implement a `DeserializationProblemHandler` to blacklist known vulnerable gadget classes**.  Maintain an up-to-date blacklist from reputable sources.
4.  **Implement input validation as a defense-in-depth measure**.  Validate the structure and content of JSON input before deserialization.
5.  **Keep Jackson and all related libraries up-to-date**.  Regularly apply security patches.
6.  **Consider using a safer alternative to Jackson if possible**.  If your application doesn't require the full power of Jackson, explore libraries with a smaller attack surface.
7.  **Educate developers about the risks of polymorphic deserialization**.  Ensure that all developers understand the proper use of Jackson's security features.
8.  **Perform regular security audits and penetration testing**.  Identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
9. If using custom `TypeResolverBuilder` or `TypeIdResolver`, audit them for any security issues.

### 3. Conclusion

The RCE vulnerability via polymorphic deserialization in Jackson is a serious threat that requires careful attention. By understanding the vulnerability mechanics, attack vectors, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation.  The most crucial steps are to avoid `enableDefaultTyping()`, use strict whitelisting, and maintain an up-to-date blacklist of known gadget classes.  A layered approach to security, combining multiple mitigation strategies, is essential for protecting applications from this vulnerability.
