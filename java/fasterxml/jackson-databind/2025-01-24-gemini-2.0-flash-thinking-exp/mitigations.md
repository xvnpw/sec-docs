# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-databind

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Default Polymorphic Typing Globally](./mitigation_strategies/disable_default_polymorphic_typing_globally.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Locate all `ObjectMapper` instances in your application.
    2.  For each `ObjectMapper` instance, use the `disableDefaultTyping()` method. For example: `objectMapper.disableDefaultTyping();`. This prevents Jackson from using default typing for deserialization, which is a common source of vulnerabilities.
    3.  Verify that your application still functions correctly after disabling default typing, as some features might rely on it. If necessary, explore alternative approaches to handle polymorphism or implement whitelisting (see next strategy).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) - High Severity
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity
*   **Impact:**
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to RCE: High risk reduction (effectively eliminates the threat if default typing is not required).
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to DoS: High risk reduction (significantly reduces the attack surface).
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Globally across all `ObjectMapper` instances in the `API Layer`, `Data Processing Service`, and `Background Job Handlers`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Whitelisting for Polymorphic Deserialization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_whitelisting_for_polymorphic_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If disabling default typing is not possible, implement a strict whitelist of allowed classes for polymorphic deserialization in Jackson.
    2.  Create a custom `PolymorphicTypeValidator` using `BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()`. 
    3.  Use methods like `allowIfBaseType`, `allowIfSubType`, `allowIfExactClass`, or `allowIfPredicate` on the builder to explicitly whitelist only the necessary classes that Jackson is allowed to deserialize polymorphically. Be as restrictive as possible.
    4.  Configure your `ObjectMapper` to use this validator with `objectMapper.setDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE, PolymorphicTypeValidator)`.  Alternatively, for more control, use `ObjectMapper.setDefaultTyping(PolymorphicTypeValidator)`.
    5.  Ensure that any `@JsonTypeInfo` annotations are used in conjunction with this whitelisting mechanism and are reviewed to prevent unintended polymorphic deserialization.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) - High Severity (Reduced, but not eliminated if whitelist is not perfect)
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity (Reduced, but not eliminated if whitelist is not perfect)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to RCE: Medium to High risk reduction (depending on the strictness and accuracy of the whitelist).
    *   Deserialization of arbitrary classes leading to DoS: Medium to High risk reduction (depending on the strictness and accuracy of the whitelist).
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** In all API endpoints that handle polymorphic JSON input, specifically in the `Order Processing Module` and `Reporting Service` where polymorphic types are currently used without validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Update Jackson-databind to the Latest Stable Version](./mitigation_strategies/update_jackson-databind_to_the_latest_stable_version.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Check the currently used version of `jackson-databind` and related Jackson libraries in your project's dependencies.
    2.  Consult the official Jackson release notes and security advisories to identify the latest stable versions and any security patches.
    3.  Update your project's dependency management configuration (e.g., `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`) to use the latest stable versions of `jackson-databind`, `jackson-core`, `jackson-annotations`, and any Jackson modules you are using.
    4.  Rebuild and thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility and that the update resolves known vulnerabilities without introducing regressions.
    5.  Establish a process for regularly monitoring Jackson releases and updating dependencies to stay protected against newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known deserialization vulnerabilities (RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure) - Severity varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can be High.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Known deserialization vulnerabilities: High risk reduction for known vulnerabilities patched in newer versions. Impact is directly proportional to the number and severity of vulnerabilities fixed in the update.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially
*   **Missing Implementation:**  The project is currently using version 2.9.x.  Needs to be updated to the latest 2.15.x or 2.16.x branch across all services and modules. Automated dependency update process needs to be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Input Structure and Data Types *Before* Jackson Deserialization](./mitigation_strategies/validate_input_structure_and_data_types_before_jackson_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a schema or expected structure for JSON inputs that will be processed by Jackson.
    2.  *Before* passing the JSON string to `ObjectMapper` for deserialization, use a validation library or custom code to check if the input JSON conforms to the defined schema and expected data types.
    3.  Validate essential aspects like required fields, data types of fields, and format constraints (e.g., date formats, numerical ranges).
    4.  If the input JSON fails validation, reject it *before* Jackson attempts to deserialize it. Return an error response to the client or handle the invalid input appropriately. This prevents Jackson from processing potentially malicious or unexpected data.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unexpected deserialization behavior due to malformed or unexpected input - Medium Severity (Potential DoS, Data Integrity issues)
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities through crafted input that bypasses Jackson's default parsing - Medium Severity (Potential for unexpected behavior leading to vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected deserialization behavior: Medium risk reduction (prevents processing of invalid data by Jackson).
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities through crafted input: Low to Medium risk reduction (adds a layer of defense *before* Jackson processing).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input validation is implemented for some API endpoints but not consistently across all data processing components that use Jackson. Specifically, validation *before* Jackson deserialization is missing for JSON payloads processed in the `Reporting Service` and `Background Job Handlers`. Need to implement schema validation for all critical JSON inputs *before* they are handled by Jackson.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `ObjectMapper.setDefaultLeniency(Leniency.STRICT)`](./mitigation_strategies/use__objectmapper_setdefaultleniency_leniency_strict__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Locate all `ObjectMapper` instances in your codebase.
    2.  For each `ObjectMapper` instance, configure the default leniency to `Leniency.STRICT` using `objectMapper.setDefaultLeniency(Leniency.STRICT)`. This configures Jackson to use stricter JSON parsing rules.
    3.  Test your application to ensure that stricter parsing does not break any legitimate functionality. `STRICT` mode enforces stricter JSON syntax and can help prevent unexpected behavior from lenient parsing by Jackson.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unexpected deserialization behavior due to lenient parsing of malformed JSON by Jackson - Low to Medium Severity (Potential for data corruption or unexpected application state)
    *   Potential exploitation of parsing inconsistencies in Jackson - Low Severity (In rare cases, lenient parsing might create subtle vulnerabilities)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected deserialization behavior: Low to Medium risk reduction (reduces the chance of unexpected behavior from malformed JSON parsed by Jackson).
    *   Potential exploitation of parsing inconsistencies: Low risk reduction (minor improvement in Jackson's parsing robustness).
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not implemented globally for `ObjectMapper` instances. Needs to be applied across all services, especially in the `API Layer` and `Data Processing Service` to enforce stricter JSON parsing by Jackson.
