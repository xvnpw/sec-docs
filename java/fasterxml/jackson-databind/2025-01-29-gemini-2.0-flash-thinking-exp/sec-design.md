# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Jackson Databind library is a high-performance JSON processor for Java. It provides functionality to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa (data binding). It is widely used in Java applications for data serialization and deserialization, enabling communication between systems and data persistence.

Business priorities and goals for Jackson Databind are:
- Provide a reliable and efficient JSON processing library for Java developers.
- Maintain compatibility with JSON standards and evolving Java ecosystems.
- Ensure the library is performant and minimizes resource consumption in applications using it.
- Foster a strong community and provide timely support and updates.
- Maintain the library's reputation as a trusted and secure component for Java applications.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could impact a vast number of applications relying on it, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, or reputational damage.
- Performance issues or bugs could negatively affect the performance and stability of applications using Jackson.
- Lack of maintenance or slow response to security issues could erode trust and lead to users migrating to alternative libraries.
- Incompatibility with new Java versions or JSON standards could limit the library's usability and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented: GitHub)
- security control: Open-source project with community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: Open Source Nature)
- security control: Dependency management using Maven Central, which provides some level of artifact integrity checks. (Implemented: Maven Central)
- security control: Regular updates and bug fixes provided by maintainers. (Implemented: Project Maintainers)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be discovered in the library code despite community review.
- accepted risk: Third-party dependencies might introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Misuse of the library by developers can lead to security issues in applications.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Jackson Databind.
- security control: Consider code signing of released artifacts to enhance supply chain security.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using Jackson Databind.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using Jackson Databind.
- Input validation: Jackson Databind must perform robust input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks or denial-of-service attacks due to malformed JSON input. This should be implemented within the library's parsing and data binding logic.
- Cryptography: Jackson Databind itself might not directly implement cryptography, but it should handle cryptographic data securely if applications use it to process encrypted data. It should avoid introducing vulnerabilities when handling byte arrays or sensitive strings.
