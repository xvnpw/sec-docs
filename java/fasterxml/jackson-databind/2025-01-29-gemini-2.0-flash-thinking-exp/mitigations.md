# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-databind

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Jackson-databind Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_jackson-databind_up-to-date.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Current Version:** Determine the version of `jackson-databind` currently used in your project by checking dependency management files (e.g., `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `requirements.txt`).
    2.  **Check for Updates:** Regularly check for newer versions of `jackson-databind` on the official Jackson website, Maven Central, or security advisories.
    3.  **Review Release Notes:** Before updating, review release notes for security patches and potential breaking changes.
    4.  **Update Dependency:** Update `jackson-databind` dependency in your project's dependency management file to the latest stable version.
    5.  **Test Thoroughly:** After updating, perform thorough testing to ensure compatibility and no regressions, including security-focused tests.
    6.  **Automate Updates (where possible):** Use dependency management tools or bots for automated dependency update suggestions, especially for security updates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** Severity: High. Outdated versions are vulnerable to known RCE exploits.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Severity: Medium. Some vulnerabilities can cause DoS through parsing inefficiencies or exceptions.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Severity: Medium. Certain vulnerabilities might lead to information disclosure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** High reduction. Patches directly address RCE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Moderate reduction. Updates often include performance and DoS-related fixes.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderate reduction. Patches can close information disclosure vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Dependency management makes updates *possible*, but *regular* and *proactive* updates are often missing.
    *   Dependency management files define dependencies.
    *   Build processes fetch dependencies.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated dependency checking and update processes.
    *   Regular schedule for dependency updates and security reviews.
    *   Clear process for applying security patches promptly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Default Typing](./mitigation_strategies/disable_default_typing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate ObjectMapper Configuration:** Find where `ObjectMapper` instances are created and configured in your application code.
    2.  **Disable Default Typing:** Explicitly disable default typing using `objectMapper.disableDefaultTyping();` for each `ObjectMapper` instance.
    3.  **Verify Configuration:** Ensure default typing is not enabled through other means (configuration files, annotations).
    4.  **Test Application:** Thoroughly test your application after disabling default typing.
    5.  **Refactor if Necessary:** If relying on default typing, refactor to use explicit type handling like `@JsonTypeInfo`, `@JsonSubTypes`, or custom deserializers.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** Severity: High. Disabling default typing significantly reduces RCE attack surface.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Severity: Medium. Prevents DoS through unexpected class instantiation via default typing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** High reduction. Primary mitigation against many `jackson-databind` RCE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Moderate reduction. Reduces DoS attacks related to uncontrolled deserialization.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Rarely fully implemented. Default typing is often enabled without full security awareness.
    *   Developers might be aware of `ObjectMapper` configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicitly disabling default typing in `ObjectMapper` configurations application-wide.
    *   Code reviews specifically checking for and disabling default typing.
    *   Security guidelines discouraging default typing without strong justification and validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement PolymorphicTypeValidator](./mitigation_strategies/implement_polymorphictypevalidator.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Polymorphic Deserialization Points:** Locate code areas using polymorphic deserialization and default typing (or similar).
    2.  **Create Custom PolymorphicTypeValidator:** Implement a custom `PolymorphicTypeValidator` to whitelist allowed base types and subtypes.
    3.  **Configure ObjectMapper with Validator:** Set the custom validator on `ObjectMapper` using `objectMapper.setDefaultTyping(PolymorphicTypeValidator)`. 
    4.  **Define Whitelist Precisely:** Define a strict whitelist, including only necessary classes. Avoid broad whitelists.
    5.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test all polymorphic deserialization scenarios to ensure the validator works and handles disallowed types correctly.
    6.  **Regularly Review Whitelist:** Periodically review and update the whitelist as application evolves.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** Severity: High.  A well-configured validator prevents arbitrary class deserialization, mitigating RCE.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Severity: Medium. Reduces DoS risk by controlling deserialized types.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** High reduction. Strong control over deserialization, significantly reduces RCE risk when default typing is needed.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Moderate reduction. Limits allowed types, reducing DoS potential.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Rarely implemented, especially custom validators. Default typing is used often without validation.
    *   Some projects might use `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` for controlled polymorphism.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Custom `PolymorphicTypeValidator` implementations across projects.
    *   Standardized validators for common use cases.
    *   Documentation and training on `PolymorphicTypeValidator` implementation and use.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Class Whitelisting with Annotations (`@JsonTypeInfo`, `@JsonSubTypes`)](./mitigation_strategies/class_whitelisting_with_annotations___@jsontypeinfo____@jsonsubtypes__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Polymorphic Classes:** Determine base classes and valid subtypes for polymorphic deserialization.
    2.  **Annotate Base Class with `@JsonTypeInfo`:** Add `@JsonTypeInfo` to the base class, configuring type information inclusion (e.g., `use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME`, `include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY`, `property = "@type"`).
    3.  **Annotate Base Class with `@JsonSubTypes`:** Add `@JsonSubTypes` to the base class, using `@JsonSubTypes.Type` to list allowed subtypes with associated names/IDs.
    4.  **Remove Default Typing (if used):** Remove default typing as annotations provide controlled alternative.
    5.  **Test Polymorphic Deserialization:** Test to ensure only whitelisted subtypes are deserialized and type information is processed correctly.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** Severity: High. Whitelisting with annotations prevents RCE by blocking arbitrary class instantiation.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Severity: Medium. Limits deserialized types, reducing DoS potential.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** High reduction. Strong control over polymorphic deserialization, significantly reduces RCE risk.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (DoS):** Moderate reduction. Limits allowed types, reducing DoS potential.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in projects needing controlled polymorphic deserialization.
    *   Projects using polymorphism might use these annotations for functionality.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` for all polymorphic deserialization.
    *   Security reviews to ensure annotations are correctly and comprehensively applied.
    *   Developer awareness of using annotations for security in polymorphic deserialization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Custom Deserializers with Strict Type Checking](./mitigation_strategies/implement_custom_deserializers_with_strict_type_checking.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Complex Deserialization Logic:** Locate areas with complex deserialization, especially with polymorphism or specific data structures.
    2.  **Create Custom Deserializers:** Implement custom `JsonDeserializer` classes for these scenarios.
    3.  **Implement Strict Type Checking in Deserializers:** In custom deserializers, perform rigorous type checking and validation. Instantiate only explicitly expected classes.
    4.  **Register Custom Deserializers:** Register custom deserializers with `ObjectMapper` using `SimpleModule` or other mechanisms.
    5.  **Test Custom Deserializers:** Thoroughly test with valid and invalid inputs, including malicious payloads, to ensure correct type checking and prevent unexpected object instantiation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities (RCE):** Severity: High. Custom deserializers with strict type checking prevent RCE by ensuring only safe classes are instantiated.
