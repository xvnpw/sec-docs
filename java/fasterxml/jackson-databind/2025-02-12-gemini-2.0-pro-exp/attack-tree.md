## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1.md)

**Untrusted Data Input:** The attack begins with the attacker providing malicious input to the application.
**Network Input (HTTP Request):** The most common method; the attacker sends a crafted HTTP request (e.g., a POST request with a malicious JSON payload) to the application.
**Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) Abuse:** The core vulnerability. The application uses `jackson-databind` to deserialize the JSON payload. Because PTH is enabled (either explicitly or due to a lack of proper configuration), Jackson is tricked into instantiating classes specified by the attacker.
**JNDI:** The attacker leverages a JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) gadget chain. This typically involves using a class like `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` to connect to a malicious JNDI server controlled by the attacker.
**CVE-XXX:** The attacker exploits a known vulnerability (identified by a CVE number) in `jackson-databind` or a related library. This CVE often provides a specific gadget chain or bypasses existing mitigations.
**No Type Validation:** The application lacks proper type validation, allowing the attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes. This is a critical failure in security.
**System.exec:** The ultimate goal. The attacker crafts the gadget chain to eventually execute `System.exec` (or a similar method like `ProcessBuilder`), allowing them to run arbitrary commands on the server. This achieves Remote Code Execution (RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2.md)

**Untrusted Data Input:** The attack starts with the attacker providing malicious input.
**File Upload:** The attacker uploads a file containing a malicious JSON payload to the application. This assumes the application has a file upload feature and processes the uploaded file's content.
**Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) Abuse:** Similar to Path 1, the application deserializes the content of the uploaded file using `jackson-databind` with PTH enabled or insufficiently restricted.
**... (Gadget Chain):** The attacker uses a suitable gadget chain (which could be JNDI-based, Spring-based, or another type) to achieve their objective. The specific gadget chain might differ from Path 1, but the principle is the same.
**System.exec:** The final step is to execute `System.exec` (or similar) to gain RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3.md)

**Untrusted Data Input:** The attack begins with malicious input.
**Network Input:** The attacker sends the malicious data via a network request (e.g., HTTP).
**Misconfigured ObjectMapper:** The `ObjectMapper` in `jackson-databind` is configured insecurely.
**Enable Default Typing:** The most dangerous misconfiguration.  The application uses the deprecated `enableDefaultTyping()` method (or equivalent). This effectively disables most security checks related to type handling.
**... (Gadget Chain):**  Because `enableDefaultTyping()` is used, the attacker has a much easier time finding and exploiting a gadget chain.  They might not even need a complex or specific gadget.
**System.exec:** The attacker achieves RCE by executing `System.exec`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes (Detailed Explanation)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes__detailed_explanation_.md)

**Attacker's Goal: RCE or Data Exfiltration via jackson-databind:** The attacker's ultimate objective is to either execute arbitrary code on the server (RCE) or steal sensitive data. RCE is generally the more impactful and common goal.

**Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** This is the overarching attack vector.  `jackson-databind`'s core functionality of deserializing data is inherently risky if not handled securely.

**Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) Abuse:** This is the *most critical* vulnerability within `jackson-databind`. PTH allows Jackson to deserialize data into objects of different types based on type information in the data. Attackers can manipulate this to instantiate arbitrary classes, leading to gadget chains.

**JNDI:** Java Naming and Directory Interface.  A very common and dangerous component of many gadget chains.  Attackers often use JNDI to load and execute remote code.

**CVE-XXX (and other CVEs):**  Specific, known vulnerabilities in `jackson-databind` or related libraries.  These CVEs often provide readily available exploit paths and are a high priority for attackers.

**Enable Default Typing:**  An extremely dangerous configuration option that should *never* be used with untrusted data. It essentially disables most of Jackson's built-in security checks.

**No Type Validation:**  The absence of any type validation or whitelisting makes exploitation significantly easier.  The attacker has much greater freedom in choosing which classes to instantiate.

**System.exec (and ProcessBuilder):**  Common methods used to execute arbitrary commands on the server, representing the final step in achieving RCE.

**HTTP Request:** The most common method for an attacker to deliver malicious input to a web application.
