# Deep Analysis of Jackson-databind Attack Tree Path: "High-Risk Path 3"

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities introduced by the use of `enableDefaultTyping()` in `jackson-databind` and how it facilitates Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a simplified gadget chain exploitation.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate this specific risk.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on "High-Risk Path 3" of the provided attack tree.  We will examine:

*   The specific role of `enableDefaultTyping()`.
*   How this configuration bypasses security checks.
*   The implications for gadget chain exploitation.
*   The final impact of achieving `System.exec` execution.
*   Mitigation strategies.

We will *not* delve into the specifics of individual gadget chains beyond a conceptual level.  The focus is on the enabling misconfiguration, not the exploitation details of every possible gadget.  We also assume the attacker has already achieved the ability to send untrusted data to the application (steps 1 & 2 of the attack tree).

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review and Documentation Analysis:**  We will examine the `jackson-databind` source code (available on GitHub) and official Jackson documentation to understand the intended behavior and security implications of `enableDefaultTyping()`.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will review known CVEs, security advisories, and research papers related to `enableDefaultTyping()` and similar Jackson vulnerabilities.
3.  **Conceptual Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Analysis:** We will describe, at a high level, how a simplified PoC might work, without providing specific exploit code.  This is to illustrate the attack vector.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:** Based on the analysis, we will propose concrete and actionable mitigation strategies for developers.

## 2. Deep Analysis of "High-Risk Path 3"

### 2.1. Untrusted Data Input & Network Input (Steps 1 & 2)

These steps are prerequisites.  The attacker must be able to send data to the application that Jackson will deserialize.  This is a common scenario in web applications that accept JSON or XML input.  The attack vector could be an HTTP POST request, a message queue, or any other mechanism that feeds data to the `ObjectMapper`.

### 2.2. Misconfigured ObjectMapper & Enable Default Typing (Steps 3 & 4)

This is the core of the vulnerability.  The `ObjectMapper` is the central class in `jackson-databind` responsible for serialization (converting Java objects to JSON/XML) and deserialization (converting JSON/XML to Java objects).

The `enableDefaultTyping()` method (and its related configurations like `DefaultTyping` enum values) is **deprecated and highly dangerous**.  It was originally intended to handle polymorphic types (where the actual type of an object might not be known at compile time).  However, it does so in a way that opens a significant security hole.

**What `enableDefaultTyping()` does (and why it's bad):**

*   **Type Information Inclusion:** When serializing, `enableDefaultTyping()` includes type information (e.g., the fully qualified class name) in the JSON output.  This is often done using a special property like `@class`.
*   **Type-Based Deserialization:**  Crucially, during deserialization, Jackson *trusts* this type information.  It uses the `@class` property (or similar) to determine which class to instantiate.  This is where the vulnerability lies.
*   **Bypassing Security Checks:**  `enableDefaultTyping()` effectively disables many of the security checks that Jackson normally performs during deserialization.  It allows the attacker to specify *arbitrary* classes to be instantiated, as long as those classes are present on the classpath.  This bypass is the key to the attack.

**Example (Conceptual):**

Let's say the application expects a simple `User` object:

```java
class User {
    private String name;
    private String email;
    // Getters and setters
}
```

The attacker, instead of sending a valid `User` object, sends this:

```json
{
  "@class": "com.example.malicious.EvilGadget",
  "command": "calc.exe"
}
```

If `enableDefaultTyping()` is enabled, Jackson will:

1.  See the `@class` property.
2.  Attempt to load and instantiate `com.example.malicious.EvilGadget`.
3.  If `com.example.malicious.EvilGadget` is on the classpath (e.g., it's part of a library used by the application), the instantiation will succeed.
4.  The `EvilGadget` class can then execute arbitrary code, often during its initialization or through a setter method (like `setCommand` in this example).

### 2.3. ... (Gadget Chain) (Step 5)

With `enableDefaultTyping()`, the attacker's job of finding a suitable gadget chain is significantly simplified.  They don't need a complex, multi-step chain.  Any class on the classpath that performs dangerous actions upon instantiation or through setter methods becomes a potential gadget.

*   **Simplified Gadget Requirements:** The gadget doesn't need to be part of a specific, vulnerable library.  It just needs to be *present* and have a side effect that the attacker can leverage.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** The number of potential gadgets is vastly increased, making it much easier for the attacker to find one that works.
*   **Less Sophistication Required:** The attacker doesn't need deep knowledge of specific library vulnerabilities.  They can often use readily available classes.

### 2.4. System.exec (Step 6)

The final step is achieving RCE.  The `EvilGadget` in our example might contain code like this:

```java
package com.example.malicious;

public class EvilGadget {
    private String command;

    public void setCommand(String command) {
        this.command = command;
        try {
            Runtime.getRuntime().exec(this.command);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exception
        }
    }
}
```

When Jackson calls `setCommand("calc.exe")`, the `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` method is invoked, executing the attacker's command (in this case, launching the calculator on a Windows system).  This demonstrates RCE.  The attacker could, of course, execute any command, leading to complete system compromise.

## 3. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to prevent this vulnerability:

1.  **Disable Default Typing (Absolutely Essential):**
    *   **Never use `enableDefaultTyping()` or its equivalent configurations.**  This is the most important step.
    *   Ensure that no `DefaultTyping` enum values are used that would enable this behavior.
    *   Explicitly configure the `ObjectMapper` to *not* use default typing.  The default behavior in recent Jackson versions is to *not* enable default typing, but it's best to be explicit.

    ```java
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    // This is the default, but be explicit:
    mapper.deactivateDefaultTyping();
    ```

2.  **Use a Safe Deserialization Approach (Strongly Recommended):**
    *   **Whitelist Known Types:**  If you need to handle polymorphic types, use a whitelist approach.  Explicitly specify the allowed classes that can be deserialized.  Jackson provides mechanisms for this, such as `TypeResolverBuilder` and `@JsonTypeInfo` with `@JsonSubTypes`.

    ```java
    @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = "type")
    @JsonSubTypes({
        @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Dog.class, name = "dog"),
        @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Cat.class, name = "cat")
    })
    abstract class Animal { }

    class Dog extends Animal { }
    class Cat extends Animal { }
    ```
    This example uses annotations to define a whitelist of allowed subtypes (`Dog` and `Cat`).

    *   **Use a Custom `TypeResolverBuilder`:** For more fine-grained control, create a custom `TypeResolverBuilder` that validates the type information before allowing deserialization.

3.  **Keep Jackson Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update `jackson-databind` to the latest version.  Security patches are frequently released to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.

4.  **Input Validation:**  While not a complete solution, validate all incoming data *before* passing it to Jackson.  This can help prevent some attacks, especially those that rely on unexpected data structures.

5.  **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your application.

6.  **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the least necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve RCE.

7.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious payloads, providing an additional layer of defense.

## 4. Conclusion

The use of `enableDefaultTyping()` in `jackson-databind` is a critical security vulnerability that can easily lead to RCE.  By understanding how this configuration bypasses security checks and simplifies gadget chain exploitation, developers can take the necessary steps to mitigate this risk.  Disabling default typing and employing safe deserialization practices are essential for protecting applications that use Jackson.  Regular updates, security audits, and a defense-in-depth approach are also crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
