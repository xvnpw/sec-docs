# Project Design Document: jackson-databind

## BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Business Priorities and Goals:
    *   Provide a high-performance, standards-compliant, and highly configurable JSON data binding library for Java.
    *   Maintain backward compatibility with previous versions where possible.
    *   Support a wide range of Java objects for serialization and deserialization.
    *   Offer extensive customization options for handling different data formats and structures.
    *   Be a core dependency for many other Java projects and frameworks, ensuring reliability and stability.
    *   Minimize external dependencies to reduce the risk of conflicts and vulnerabilities.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to remote code execution (RCE) or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in applications that use it. This is the most critical risk due to the library's widespread use.
    *   Performance bottlenecks could impact the performance of applications relying on the library.
    *   Compatibility issues with different Java versions or other libraries could limit adoption or cause integration problems.
    *   Lack of support for new JSON features or standards could make the library less relevant over time.
    *   Bugs or unexpected behavior could lead to data corruption or incorrect processing of JSON data.
    *   License violations or legal issues related to the library's use or distribution.

## SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: Input validation: The library performs extensive input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and injection attacks. Implemented in parsing logic throughout the codebase.
    *   security control: Polymorphic Type Handling Restrictions: Specific configurations and checks are in place to mitigate risks associated with polymorphic type handling, a known source of vulnerabilities. Described in documentation and implemented in `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jsontype.impl`.
    *   security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning: The project maintainers and community perform ongoing security reviews and use vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   security control: Dependency management: Efforts are made to keep dependencies up-to-date and minimize the number of external dependencies.
    *   security control: Fuzz testing: Fuzz testing is used to discover potential vulnerabilities by providing invalid or unexpected inputs.
    *   security control: Secure coding practices: Developers follow secure coding guidelines to minimize the introduction of new vulnerabilities.

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: Certain advanced features, if misconfigured, could potentially be exploited. The documentation highlights these risks and provides guidance on secure configuration.
    *   accepted risk: Deserialization of untrusted data is inherently risky. The library provides mechanisms to mitigate these risks, but users must be aware of the potential dangers.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Implement a comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP) if the library is used in a web context (although this is less likely, as it's a backend library).
    *   security control: Integrate with static application security testing (SAST) tools for continuous code analysis during development.
    *   security control: Integrate with dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools for runtime security testing.
    *   security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

*   Security Requirements:

    *   Authentication: Not directly applicable, as this is a data-binding library, not an authentication system.
    *   Authorization: Not directly applicable. Authorization should be handled by the application using the library.
    *   Input Validation:
        *   The library MUST validate all input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and structure.
        *   The library MUST handle invalid or unexpected input gracefully, without crashing or exposing sensitive information.
        *   The library MUST protect against common injection attacks, such as buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.
    *   Cryptography:
        *   If the library handles sensitive data, it MUST use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
        *   Cryptographic keys MUST be managed securely, following best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.
        *   The library should not implement its own cryptography, but rely on well-vetted cryptographic libraries.
    *   Polymorphic Deserialization:
        *   The library MUST provide secure mechanisms for handling polymorphic deserialization, preventing attackers from instantiating arbitrary classes.
        *   Configuration options related to polymorphic deserialization MUST be secure by default.

    2.  Continuous Integration (CI) system (GitHub Actions) is triggered by commits.
    3.  CI system checks out the code.
    4.  Maven is used to build the project:
        *   Compile the source code.
        *   Run unit and integration tests.
        *   Perform static analysis (using plugins like SpotBugs, PMD, Checkstyle).
        *   Generate code coverage reports (using JaCoCo).
        *   Package the library into JAR files.
    5.  If all tests and checks pass, the JAR files are published to a Maven repository (e.g., Maven Central).
    6.  Release process involves tagging the repository, updating version numbers, and creating release notes.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Serialization and deserialization of JSON data in applications relying on jackson-databind. This is critical because a failure in this process can disrupt the functionality of numerous applications.
    *   Maintaining the stability and reliability of the library, as it's a core dependency for many projects.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   The library itself doesn't store or manage data directly. However, it processes data that may be highly sensitive, depending on the application using it. The sensitivity of the data is determined by the application, not the library.
    *   Data types handled can range from non-sensitive (e.g., configuration settings) to highly sensitive (e.g., personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, authentication credentials).
    *   The library should be treated as a potential conduit for sensitive data, and appropriate security measures should be taken in the applications that use it.

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications using this library typically need to meet? This will influence recommendations for data handling.
    *   What is the expected threat model for applications using this library? (e.g., web applications, internal services, embedded systems). This helps prioritize security controls.
    *   What level of security expertise is expected from developers using this library? This informs the level of detail needed in security guidance.
    *   What are the specific performance requirements for applications using this library? This helps identify potential performance bottlenecks.
    *   Are there any known limitations or weaknesses in the current implementation that need to be addressed?
