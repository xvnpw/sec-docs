# Deep Analysis: Safe Default Typing Strategy for Jackson-databind

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness and implementation details of the "Use a Safe Default Typing Strategy" mitigation strategy for addressing Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities within applications utilizing the `fasterxml/jackson-databind` library.  This analysis will go beyond a simple checklist and delve into the *why* and *how* of this strategy, providing actionable recommendations for the development team.  We aim to ensure a robust and secure configuration that minimizes the attack surface related to polymorphic deserialization.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the configuration of Jackson's `ObjectMapper` and its default typing settings.  It covers:

*   Identification of `ObjectMapper` configuration points within the application codebase.
*   Assessment of the current `DefaultTyping` enum value used (if any).
*   Evaluation of the security implications of the current setting.
*   Recommendations for safer `DefaultTyping` configurations.
*   The critical relationship between `DefaultTyping` and `PolymorphicTypeValidator` (PTV).
*   Testing considerations after implementing changes.
* The analysis does *not* cover:
    * Other mitigation strategies (e.g., blocking gadgets, using a deny list). These are important but outside the scope of *this* deep dive.
    * Specific vulnerabilities in third-party libraries beyond Jackson's core functionality.
    * General code hardening practices unrelated to Jackson's deserialization.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough static analysis of the application's codebase will be performed to identify all instances where `ObjectMapper` is instantiated and configured.  This will involve searching for keywords like `ObjectMapper`, `activateDefaultTyping`, `enableDefaultTyping`, `setDefaultTyping`, and `PolymorphicTypeValidator`.  We will use tools like grep, IDE search features, and potentially static analysis tools.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:**  For each identified `ObjectMapper` instance, the configuration related to default typing will be examined.  We will determine the specific `DefaultTyping` enum value being used (or if default typing is enabled at all).
3.  **Risk Assessment:**  Based on the identified configuration, we will assess the risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) associated with potential RCE and DoS vulnerabilities.  This will consider the known attack vectors associated with unsafe `DefaultTyping` settings.
4.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Specific, actionable recommendations will be provided to improve the security posture.  This will include:
    *   Recommended `DefaultTyping` settings.
    *   Guidance on implementing a `PolymorphicTypeValidator`.
    *   Concrete code examples where applicable.
5.  **Testing Guidance:**  Recommendations for testing the changes will be provided, emphasizing the importance of thorough regression testing and security-focused testing.
6. **Documentation:** All findings, configurations, risks, and recommendations will be documented.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy

### 4.1. Understanding Default Typing

Jackson's default typing mechanism is designed to handle polymorphic deserialization â€“ the process of reconstructing objects from JSON when the exact type is not known at compile time.  This is often used when dealing with inheritance hierarchies or interfaces.  The `DefaultTyping` enum controls *how* Jackson determines the type information to use during deserialization.

The key `DefaultTyping` enum values and their security implications are:

*   **`OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE` (UNSAFE):**  This is the most permissive and dangerous setting.  It allows Jackson to deserialize any object type, including abstract classes and interfaces, as long as type information is present in the JSON (e.g., via the `@class` property).  This opens the door wide for attackers to inject malicious objects.
*   **`NON_FINAL` (UNSAFE):**  This setting allows deserialization of any non-final class.  While slightly less permissive than `OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE`, it still presents a significant risk, as many common classes are non-final.  This is the setting currently identified in the "Currently Implemented" section.
*   **`NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS` (SAFER, but still requires PTV):** This setting restricts deserialization to non-concrete types (abstract classes and interfaces) and arrays of those types.  It's a step in the right direction, but *without a PTV, it's still vulnerable*.
*   **`JAVA_LANG_OBJECT`:** Only allow for `java.lang.Object`
*   **`NONE`:** No default typing is used.

### 4.2. The Critical Role of PolymorphicTypeValidator (PTV)

The `DefaultTyping` setting alone is *insufficient* for robust security.  Even with `NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS`, an attacker could potentially find a gadget chain within allowed abstract classes or interfaces.  This is where the `PolymorphicTypeValidator` (PTV) becomes *essential*.

A PTV allows you to define fine-grained rules for which types are allowed to be deserialized.  It acts as a gatekeeper, validating the type information provided in the JSON *before* Jackson attempts to create an instance of the class.  A well-configured PTV is the cornerstone of secure polymorphic deserialization with Jackson.

### 4.3. Current Implementation Analysis

The provided information states:

*   `ObjectMapper` is configured with `DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL`.
*   A `PolymorphicTypeValidator` is *not* implemented.

This configuration is **HIGHLY VULNERABLE** to RCE attacks.  `DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL` allows a wide range of classes to be deserialized, and the absence of a PTV means there's no additional layer of validation to prevent malicious object instantiation.

### 4.4. Recommended Implementation

1.  **Change `DefaultTyping`:**  At a minimum, change the `DefaultTyping` setting to `NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS`.  This immediately reduces the attack surface.  However, this is *not* a complete solution without the next step.

    ```java
    // Example (assuming ObjectMapper is already instantiated)
    objectMapper.activateDefaultTyping(
        BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder().build(), // See step 2 for PTV implementation
        ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS
    );
    ```
    Or, if you are not using default typing, it is better.

    ```java
    objectMapper.deactivateDefaultTyping();
    ```

2.  **Implement a `PolymorphicTypeValidator` (PTV):** This is the *most crucial* step.  You have several options for implementing a PTV:

    *   **`BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator` (Recommended for most cases):** This built-in validator allows you to define allowed subtypes using a builder pattern.  You can specify allowed base types and then add specific allowed subtypes.

        ```java
        PolymorphicTypeValidator ptv = BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
            .allowIfBaseType(MyBaseClass.class) // Allow deserialization if the base type is MyBaseClass
            .allowIfBaseType(AnotherBaseClass.class)
            .allowIfSubType(MySafeSubClass.class) // Allow specific safe subclasses
            .allowIfSubType(AnotherSafeSubClass.class)
            .allowIfSubTypeIsArray() // Allow arrays of allowed types
            .build();

        objectMapper.activateDefaultTyping(ptv, ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS);
        ```

    *   **Custom `PolymorphicTypeValidator`:**  For more complex scenarios, you can create your own implementation of the `PolymorphicTypeValidator` interface.  This gives you complete control over the validation logic.  However, this requires a deep understanding of the potential attack vectors and should be approached with caution.

    *  **`DefaultTyping.JAVA_LANG_OBJECT` with PTV:** You can use `DefaultTyping.JAVA_LANG_OBJECT` with PTV.

        ```java
        PolymorphicTypeValidator ptv = BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
            .allowIfBaseType(MyBaseClass.class) // Allow deserialization if the base type is MyBaseClass
            .allowIfBaseType(AnotherBaseClass.class)
            .allowIfSubType(MySafeSubClass.class) // Allow specific safe subclasses
            .allowIfSubType(AnotherSafeSubClass.class)
            .allowIfSubTypeIsArray() // Allow arrays of allowed types
            .build();

        objectMapper.activateDefaultTyping(ptv, ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.JAVA_LANG_OBJECT);
        ```

3.  **Thorough Testing:** After implementing these changes, rigorous testing is essential:

    *   **Regression Testing:** Ensure that existing functionality that relies on polymorphic deserialization continues to work as expected.
    *   **Security Testing:**  Attempt to deserialize known malicious payloads (e.g., from ysoserial) to verify that the PTV effectively blocks them.  This should be done in a controlled environment, *not* in production.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Consider using fuzz testing techniques to generate a wide variety of JSON inputs and test the robustness of the deserialization process.
    *   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Create specific unit and integration tests that cover the deserialization of various allowed and disallowed types.

### 4.5. Impact Assessment

| Threat        | Impact Before Mitigation | Impact After Mitigation (with PTV) | Risk Reduction |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| RCE (Critical) | Critical                 | Low                                | High           |
| DoS (High)    | High                     | Low                                | Medium         |

By implementing both a safer `DefaultTyping` setting *and* a `PolymorphicTypeValidator`, the risk of RCE is significantly reduced.  The impact of DoS is also reduced, as the complexity of the deserialization process is limited.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Use a Safe Default Typing Strategy" mitigation is a critical component of securing applications that use Jackson-databind.  However, it's essential to understand that the `DefaultTyping` setting alone is not sufficient.  A properly configured `PolymorphicTypeValidator` is absolutely necessary to provide robust protection against RCE vulnerabilities.  The combination of `NON_CONCRETE_AND_ARRAYS` (or even better, disabling default typing) with a well-defined PTV offers a strong defense against malicious object injection.  Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented solution and to prevent regressions.  The recommendations outlined in this analysis provide a clear path towards a more secure and resilient application.
