## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*Attack Vector*: This path focuses on exploiting the fundamental weakness of deserialization in Java, where untrusted data can be used to instantiate arbitrary objects.
*Steps*:
    * Supply Malicious JSON/YAML/XML Payload: The attacker crafts a payload containing instructions to instantiate malicious objects or trigger vulnerable code paths during deserialization.
    * [CRITICAL] Application Deserializes Payload using Vulnerable Configuration/Dependencies: The application, due to its configuration or the presence of vulnerable libraries, processes the malicious payload. This is a critical node because it's the point where the attack begins to unfold.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Polymorphic Deserialization with Known Gadget Chains](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_polymorphic_deserialization_with_known_gadget_chains.md)

*Attack Vector*: This is a specific type of deserialization attack that leverages Jackson's polymorphic deserialization feature. Attackers exploit the ability to specify the class to be instantiated during deserialization to trigger "gadget chains." These are sequences of method calls within existing libraries on the classpath that, when chained together, lead to arbitrary code execution.
*Steps*:
    * Identify Gadget Classes on Classpath (e.g., Commons Collections, Log4j): The attacker identifies vulnerable libraries present in the application's dependencies that contain exploitable gadget chains.
    * [CRITICAL] Craft Payload to Trigger Gadget Chain for Code Execution: The attacker crafts a specific payload that, when deserialized, instantiates objects from the identified gadget libraries in a specific order, triggering the chain of method calls that results in code execution. This is a critical node as it directly achieves the attacker's goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Specific Jackson-databind CVEs related to Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_specific_jackson-databind_cves_related_to_deserialization.md)

*Attack Vector*: This path involves exploiting known, publicly documented vulnerabilities (CVEs) within specific versions of the `jackson-databind` library itself. These CVEs often relate to insecure deserialization practices within Jackson.
*Steps*:
    * Identify Vulnerable Jackson-databind Version in Use: The attacker determines the version of `jackson-databind` being used by the application, often through reconnaissance techniques.
    * [CRITICAL] Craft Payload Exploiting the Specific CVE (e.g., using known exploit patterns): The attacker crafts a payload specifically designed to trigger the identified CVE in the target version of Jackson. This often involves understanding the specific vulnerability and how to trigger it through a crafted JSON/YAML/XML structure. This is a critical node as it directly leverages a known weakness for exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improperly Configured Default Typing](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improperly_configured_default_typing.md)

*Attack Vector*: Jackson's default typing feature, when enabled without proper restrictions, allows the deserializer to instantiate classes based on type information embedded in the input. This can be exploited by attackers to force the instantiation of malicious classes.
*Steps*:
    * [CRITICAL] Application Enables Default Typing without Sufficient Restrictions: The application's configuration enables default typing, making it vulnerable to this type of attack. This is a critical node because it creates the fundamental vulnerability.
    * Supply Payload with Malicious Class Information for Deserialization: The attacker crafts a payload that includes type information specifying malicious classes to be instantiated during deserialization. This can then be combined with gadget chain techniques to achieve code execution.
