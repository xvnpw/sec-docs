# Threat Model Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-databind

## Threat: [Polymorphic Deserialization Vulnerability](./threats/polymorphic_deserialization_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that exploits Jackson's polymorphic type handling (often used with `@JsonTypeInfo`). The payload forces Jackson to instantiate arbitrary classes present in the application's classpath. These classes might have harmful side effects in their constructors or during initialization, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to full compromise of the application server, potential data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `ObjectMapper`'s deserialization functionality, specifically when handling polymorphic types and resolving type identifiers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable default typing using `ObjectMapper.disableDefaultTyping()`.
* Use explicit type information and register only expected subtypes with the `ObjectMapper`.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization of incoming JSON data before deserialization.
* Keep the `jackson-databind` library updated to the latest version with security patches.

## Threat: [Default Typing Enabled Vulnerability](./threats/default_typing_enabled_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** When default typing is enabled (`ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`), Jackson includes type information in the serialized JSON. An attacker can manipulate this type information in a crafted JSON payload to instruct Jackson to instantiate arbitrary classes during deserialization, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially leading to full server compromise and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** `ObjectMapper`'s default typing feature, specifically the `enableDefaultTyping()` method and the deserialization process when default typing is active.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid enabling default typing unless absolutely necessary and with a deep understanding of the security implications.
* If default typing is required, use the most restrictive settings (e.g., `NON_FINAL`) and carefully define the allowed base types to limit the scope of potential exploitation.
* Keep the `jackson-databind` library updated to the latest version.

## Threat: [Gadget Chain Exploitation](./threats/gadget_chain_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage existing classes within the application's classpath or its dependencies to form "gadget chains." These chains exploit the side effects of method calls during the deserialization process to achieve malicious goals, such as executing arbitrary code. This can occur even without explicitly enabling default typing or using `@JsonTypeInfo` in a vulnerable way.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially leading to full server compromise.

**Affected Component:** `ObjectMapper`'s deserialization process, specifically how it instantiates and populates objects based on the JSON input and the available classes in the classpath.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep all application dependencies, including `jackson-databind`, updated to mitigate known gadget chain vulnerabilities.
* Employ security analysis tools to identify potential gadget chains within the application's dependencies.
* Consider using security managers or sandboxing to limit the impact of potential exploits by restricting the actions that deserialized objects can perform.
