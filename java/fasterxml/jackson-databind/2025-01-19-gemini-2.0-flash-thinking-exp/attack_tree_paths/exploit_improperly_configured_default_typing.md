**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

Exploit Improperly Configured Default Typing

*Attack Vector*: Jackson's default typing feature, when enabled without proper restrictions, allows the deserializer to instantiate classes based on type information embedded in the input. This can be exploited by attackers to force the instantiation of malicious classes.
*Steps*:
    * [CRITICAL] Application Enables Default Typing without Sufficient Restrictions: The application's configuration enables default typing, making it vulnerable to this type of attack. This is a critical node because it creates the fundamental vulnerability.
    * Supply Payload with Malicious Class Information for Deserialization: The attacker crafts a payload that includes type information specifying malicious classes to be instantiated during deserialization. This can then be combined with gadget chain techniques to achieve code execution.

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. [CRITICAL] Application Enables Default Typing without Sufficient Restrictions

This step represents the foundational vulnerability that enables the entire attack path. Jackson's default typing feature is designed to handle polymorphism during deserialization. When enabled, Jackson includes type information within the serialized JSON or other formats. During deserialization, it uses this information to instantiate the correct Java classes.

**Why is this a vulnerability?**

Without sufficient restrictions, the application trusts the type information provided in the input stream. This means an attacker can inject arbitrary class names into the payload. If Jackson is configured to use default typing broadly (e.g., for all `Object` types or a wide range of base classes), it will attempt to instantiate any class specified in the input.

**Technical Details:**

* **How Default Typing is Enabled:** Default typing can be enabled in Jackson using various configuration options on the `ObjectMapper`. Common methods include:
    * `enableDefaultTyping()`: Enables default typing for all non-final classes. This is the most dangerous option.
    * `enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL)`: Similar to the above.
    * `enableDefaultTypingAsProperty(PolymorphicTypeValidator, LaissezFaireSubTypeValidator)`:  While seemingly more restrictive, improper configuration of the `PolymorphicTypeValidator` can still lead to vulnerabilities.
    * Annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` can also contribute to polymorphic deserialization, but the focus here is on the global default typing settings.

* **The Role of `@class` Property:** When default typing is enabled, Jackson typically includes a property named `@class` in the serialized output to store the fully qualified name of the class. During deserialization, Jackson reads this property to determine which class to instantiate.

**Criticality:**

This step is marked as **CRITICAL** because it is the necessary precondition for the subsequent attack step. Without this misconfiguration, the attacker cannot control the classes being instantiated during deserialization. It represents a fundamental flaw in the application's security posture regarding data handling.

**Example (Illustrative - Vulnerable Configuration):**

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL); // Highly vulnerable configuration
```

#### 4.2. Supply Payload with Malicious Class Information for Deserialization

Once default typing is enabled without proper restrictions, the attacker can craft a malicious payload. This payload will contain the `@class` property with the fully qualified name of a class that can be exploited.

**How the Attack Works:**

The attacker leverages the fact that Jackson will attempt to instantiate the class specified in the `@class` property. The goal is to choose a class that, when instantiated and potentially with specific property values, will lead to undesirable actions, such as:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most severe outcome. Attackers often utilize "gadget chains" – sequences of method calls within existing libraries on the classpath – to achieve code execution. Commonly targeted libraries include Apache Commons Collections, Spring Framework, and others that have known deserialization vulnerabilities.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Instantiating resource-intensive objects or triggering infinite loops can lead to a denial of service.
* **Information Disclosure:**  In some cases, instantiating specific classes might expose sensitive information.

**Gadget Chains:**

A gadget chain is a sequence of method calls that, when triggered by deserialization, ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary code. Attackers identify classes with specific methods (e.g., `transform`, `invoke`) that can be chained together to achieve their objective.

**Crafting the Malicious Payload:**

The attacker needs to construct a JSON (or other supported format) payload that includes the `@class` property pointing to a malicious class or a class that is part of a gadget chain. The payload might also include other properties necessary to trigger the desired behavior within the chosen class.

**Example (Illustrative - Malicious Payload for RCE using a hypothetical gadget):**

```json
{
  "@class": "com.example.ExploitableGadget",
  "command": "rm -rf /tmp/*"
}
```

In this example, `com.example.ExploitableGadget` is a hypothetical class that, when instantiated with the `command` property set to `rm -rf /tmp/*`, would execute that command on the server. Real-world exploits often involve more complex gadget chains.

**The Deserialization Process:**

When the application receives this malicious payload and uses the `ObjectMapper` to deserialize it, the following happens:

1. Jackson encounters the `@class` property.
2. Based on the configured default typing rules, Jackson attempts to load and instantiate the class specified in the `@class` property (e.g., `com.example.ExploitableGadget`).
3. Jackson then attempts to populate the properties of the instantiated object using the remaining data in the payload (e.g., setting the `command` property).
4. If the chosen class is part of a gadget chain, the instantiation and property setting can trigger a sequence of method calls that ultimately lead to code execution.

**Impact:**

A successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:

* **Complete System Compromise:**  Remote code execution allows the attacker to gain full control over the server.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
* **Service Disruption:**  DoS attacks can render the application unavailable.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Security breaches can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

Preventing this type of attack requires addressing the root cause – the improperly configured default typing. Here are key mitigation strategies:

* **Avoid Enabling Default Typing if Possible:** The safest approach is to avoid enabling default typing altogether. If polymorphism is required, explore alternative approaches like using explicit type information or interface-based deserialization with registered subtypes.

* **Use Polymorphic Type Handling with Strict Restrictions:** If default typing is necessary, configure it with the strictest possible restrictions. This involves using a `PolymorphicTypeValidator` to explicitly whitelist the allowed base classes and their subtypes. Avoid using broad validators like `LaissezFaireSubTypeValidator` in production.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against this specific vulnerability, robust input validation can help detect and block suspicious payloads. However, relying solely on input validation is insufficient as attackers can often craft payloads that bypass simple checks.

* **Regularly Update Jackson-databind:**  Keep the `jackson-databind` library updated to the latest version. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched, so staying up-to-date is crucial.

* **Implement Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the application's code and configuration, specifically focusing on how deserialization is handled. Automated security scanning tools can also help identify potential vulnerabilities.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the impact of a successful attack.

* **Consider Alternatives to Deserialization:** If possible, explore alternative ways to handle data exchange that don't involve deserializing arbitrary data into Java objects.

### 6. Key Takeaways
