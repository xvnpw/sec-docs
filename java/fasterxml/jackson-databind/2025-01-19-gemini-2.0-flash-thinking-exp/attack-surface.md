# Attack Surface Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-databind

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization via Polymorphism](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_via_polymorphism.md)

*   **How Jackson-databind Contributes:** `jackson-databind`'s ability to deserialize objects into different concrete types based on type information embedded in the JSON (often using `@type` or similar mechanisms) allows an attacker to control which classes are instantiated.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload with a specific `@type` value pointing to a malicious or exploitable class present in the application's classpath. When `jackson-databind` deserializes this, it instantiates the attacker-controlled class.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). By instantiating malicious classes, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `enableDefaultTyping`:**  Never enable `enableDefaultTyping` globally or without extremely careful consideration and a very limited set of trusted classes.
        *   **Use Type-Safe Deserialization:** Explicitly define the expected types for deserialization whenever possible.
        *   **Implement Whitelisting of Types:** If polymorphic deserialization is necessary, implement a strict whitelist of allowed classes that can be deserialized.
        *   **Disable Polymorphic Type Handling:** If not required, disable polymorphic type handling features.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Gadget Chains](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_gadget_chains.md)

*   **How Jackson-databind Contributes:** `jackson-databind` acts as the entry point for deserialization. If there are exploitable "gadget chains" (sequences of method calls in existing classes that can be chained together to achieve a malicious outcome) present in the application's classpath (including dependencies), an attacker can craft a JSON payload that triggers this chain during deserialization.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a JSON payload that, when deserialized by `jackson-databind`, sets properties on specific classes in a way that ultimately leads to the execution of arbitrary code through a known gadget chain (e.g., using classes from libraries like Apache Commons Collections in older versions).
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update all dependencies, including transitive ones, to patch known vulnerabilities in potential gadget chain classes.
        *   **Use Security Scanning Tools:** Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential gadget chains within the application's dependencies.
        *   **Apply Contextual Deserialization:**  Where possible, use contextual deserialization to limit the available classes during deserialization in specific contexts.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Issues Leading to Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/configuration_issues_leading_to_insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **How Jackson-databind Contributes:**  Incorrect or overly permissive configuration of `jackson-databind` can widen the attack surface. For example, leaving `enableDefaultTyping` enabled or not properly configuring type visibility can make exploitation easier.
    *   **Example:** A developer unintentionally leaves `enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL)` enabled globally, making the application vulnerable to a wide range of deserialization attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Increased likelihood of successful exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities, potentially leading to RCE.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Default Configurations:** Understand the default configurations of `jackson-databind` and ensure they align with security best practices.
        *   **Follow Security Recommendations:** Adhere to security recommendations and best practices provided by the `jackson-databind` documentation and security advisories.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure `ObjectMapper` instances with the minimum necessary features enabled.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Deserializers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_deserializers.md)

*   **How Jackson-databind Contributes:** If the application implements custom deserializers, vulnerabilities within this custom code can be exploited when `jackson-databind` uses these deserializers to process input.
    *   **Example:** A custom deserializer might perform unsafe operations based on user-controlled input from the JSON, such as executing shell commands or accessing sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:**  Can range from Remote Code Execution (RCE) to data manipulation or information disclosure, depending on the vulnerability in the custom deserializer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Implement custom deserializers with security in mind, carefully validating and sanitizing input.
        *   **Thorough Testing:**  Thoroughly test custom deserializers for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct security-focused code reviews of custom deserializer implementations.
