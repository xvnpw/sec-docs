## Deep Analysis: Exploit Unsafe Default Typing in Jackson Databind

This analysis delves into the "Exploit Unsafe Default Typing" attack path within the context of an application using the `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind` library. As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, my goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its implications, and actionable steps for mitigation and prevention.

**Attack Tree Path:** [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Unsafe Default Typing

**Attack Vector:** The application has enabled unsafe default typing in Jackson (`ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`) without proper restrictions. This allows an attacker to include a `@class` property in the JSON payload, specifying the fully qualified name of any class available on the application's classpath. By specifying a malicious class, the attacker can force Jackson to instantiate it, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution during or after instantiation.

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Application Uses Unsafe Default Typing:** This configuration flaw is the fundamental vulnerability that enables this attack path.
* **Craft Payload with Malicious Type Information:** The attacker must craft a JSON payload that includes the `@class` property with the fully qualified name of a malicious class.

**Detailed Analysis of the Attack Path:**

1. **Understanding Unsafe Default Typing:**

   * **Mechanism:** Jackson's default typing feature, when enabled without careful configuration, instructs the deserializer to include type information within the serialized JSON. This is achieved by adding a `@class` property indicating the actual Java class of the object being serialized. When deserializing, Jackson uses this `@class` information to instantiate the correct object.
   * **Intended Use Case:**  This feature is often used to handle polymorphism, where a collection might contain objects of different subclasses of a common interface or abstract class. It allows Jackson to correctly reconstruct the objects during deserialization.
   * **The Security Risk:** The problem arises when `enableDefaultTyping()` is used without specifying *which* classes are allowed to be deserialized based on the `@class` property. This opens a Pandora's Box, allowing an attacker to dictate the class being instantiated.

2. **Exploiting the Vulnerability:**

   * **Attacker's Goal:** The attacker aims to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by forcing the instantiation of a malicious class.
   * **Malicious Classes:** These are classes present on the application's classpath that, when instantiated and potentially with specific properties set, can trigger harmful actions. Examples include:
      * **Gadget Chains:**  Pre-existing classes in libraries used by the application that, when chained together in a specific sequence, can lead to code execution. Well-known gadget chains exist for libraries like Apache Commons Collections, Spring, and others.
      * **Custom Malicious Classes (Less Common but Possible):** In rare scenarios, an attacker might be able to introduce a malicious JAR file onto the classpath, containing a class designed for exploitation.
   * **Crafting the Payload:** The attacker constructs a JSON payload that leverages the `@class` property. The payload will typically have the following structure:

     ```json
     {
       "@class": "fully.qualified.name.of.MaliciousClass",
       "someProperty": "someValue",
       "anotherProperty": {
         "@class": "another.malicious.class.if.needed",
         "nestedProperty": "nestedValue"
       }
     }
     ```

     The `fully.qualified.name.of.MaliciousClass` is the crucial element. Jackson will attempt to load and instantiate this class during deserialization. The other properties might be necessary to trigger the malicious behavior within the instantiated class.

3. **Impact and Consequences:**

   * **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** This is the most severe outcome. The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application. This can lead to:
      * **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker can take full control of the server.
      * **Data Breaches:**  Sensitive data can be accessed, exfiltrated, or modified.
      * **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can crash the application or the entire server.
      * **Malware Installation:**  The attacker can install persistent malware on the system.
   * **Other Potential Impacts:** Depending on the malicious class used, other attacks might be possible, such as:
      * **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  Loading and executing code from a remote server.
      * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Making requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server.

**Detailed Analysis of Critical Nodes:**

**1. Application Uses Unsafe Default Typing:**

* **Root Cause:** The developers have explicitly enabled default typing using `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()` without implementing any restrictions on the allowed classes.
* **Configuration Issue:** This is a configuration flaw, not a bug in the Jackson library itself. The library provides the functionality, but it's the developer's responsibility to use it securely.
* **Likely Scenarios:** This might happen due to:
    * **Lack of Security Awareness:** Developers might not be fully aware of the security implications of this setting.
    * **Misunderstanding of Polymorphism Handling:** Developers might have enabled it to handle polymorphism without understanding the risks and alternative secure approaches.
    * **Copy-Pasted Code:**  Developers might have copied code snippets from online resources without fully understanding the security context.
    * **Legacy Code:**  The setting might have been introduced in older versions of the application and not reviewed for security implications.

**2. Craft Payload with Malicious Type Information:**

* **Attacker Skill Level:** This requires a moderate level of understanding of Java deserialization vulnerabilities and the target application's classpath.
* **Payload Discovery:** Attackers often rely on publicly known "gadget chains" for popular Java libraries. They might also analyze the application's dependencies to identify potential attack vectors.
* **Iterative Process:** Crafting the perfect payload might involve some trial and error, sending different payloads and observing the application's behavior.
* **Automation:** Attackers can use automated tools to generate and test various payloads.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

As a cybersecurity expert, my primary recommendation to the development team is to **immediately address this critical vulnerability**. Here are the key mitigation strategies:

* **Disable Unsafe Default Typing:** The simplest and most effective solution, if feasible for the application's functionality, is to **remove the `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()` call entirely.** This eliminates the attack vector.

* **Implement Secure Default Typing with Restrictions:** If default typing is necessary for handling polymorphism, use the `PolymorphicTypeValidator` to restrict the allowed classes for deserialization. This is the **recommended approach** if default typing cannot be completely disabled.

   * **`LaissezFaireSubTypeValidator` (Discouraged):**  Allows any class, effectively negating the security benefit. **Avoid this.**
   * **`BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator` (Recommended):** Provides methods to define allowlists and denylists for classes. Use this to explicitly specify the allowed classes or packages.

     ```java
     ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
     BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator ptv = BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator.builder()
             .allowIfSubType("com.example.domain") // Allow all classes in this package
             .allowIfBaseType(MyInterface.class) // Allow subtypes of MyInterface
             // .denyExactSubType(MaliciousClass.class) // Explicitly deny a specific class
             .build();
     mapper.activateDefaultTyping(ptv, ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL);
     ```

* **Prefer Explicit Type Handling:**  Whenever possible, avoid relying on default typing. Instead, use explicit type information in your data structures or use Jackson's `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` annotations for controlled polymorphism handling.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a direct fix for this vulnerability, robust input validation can help prevent other types of attacks and might make it harder for attackers to inject malicious payloads.

* **Regularly Update Jackson Databind:** Ensure the application is using the latest stable version of the `jackson-databind` library. Newer versions often contain security fixes for known deserialization vulnerabilities.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve code execution.

**Detection Strategies:**

To identify if the application is vulnerable or if an attack is underway, consider the following:

* **Code Reviews:**  Manually inspect the codebase for instances of `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()` without proper `PolymorphicTypeValidator` configuration.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools that can identify insecure deserialization patterns and configurations.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Use DAST tools to send crafted payloads with malicious `@class` properties to see if the application attempts to deserialize them.
* **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to assess the application's overall security posture and identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for suspicious deserialization attempts or errors related to class loading. Look for patterns indicating attempts to instantiate unexpected classes.

**Developer Guidance:**

* **Understand the Risks:** Educate developers about the security implications of Jackson's default typing feature and the importance of secure configuration.
* **Prefer Explicit Configuration:** Encourage developers to use explicit type handling mechanisms instead of relying on potentially unsafe defaults.
* **Secure Defaults:** Emphasize the importance of configuring security features with secure defaults.
* **Testing:**  Include security testing as part of the development lifecycle to identify and address vulnerabilities early on.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit Unsafe Default Typing" attack path represents a **critical security vulnerability** in applications using Jackson Databind. The ease with which attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution through this flaw makes it a high-priority concern. The development team must prioritize mitigating this vulnerability by either disabling unsafe default typing or implementing secure restrictions using `PolymorphicTypeValidator`. Regular security assessments, code reviews, and developer training are crucial to prevent such vulnerabilities from being introduced or remaining undetected in the application. By taking proactive steps, we can significantly reduce the risk of successful exploitation and protect the application and its users.
