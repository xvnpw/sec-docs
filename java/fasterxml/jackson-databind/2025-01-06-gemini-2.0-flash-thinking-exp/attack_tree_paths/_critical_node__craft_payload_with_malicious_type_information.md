## Deep Analysis: Craft Payload with Malicious Type Information (Jackson-databind)

As a cybersecurity expert working with your development team, I've conducted a deep analysis of the attack tree path: **[CRITICAL NODE] Craft Payload with Malicious Type Information** within the context of your application using the `fasterxml/jackson-databind` library.

This attack path exploits a well-known vulnerability in Jackson-databind related to its default typing mechanism. Understanding this vulnerability and how it's exploited is crucial for securing your application.

**1. Understanding the Vulnerability: Unsafe Default Typing in Jackson-databind**

Jackson-databind, a popular Java library for serializing and deserializing JSON, offers a feature called "default typing."  When enabled, Jackson can embed type information within the JSON payload itself. This is done using the `@class` property, among others. This allows Jackson to correctly deserialize objects back into their original Java types, even if the declared type in the receiving code is an interface or abstract class.

However, this feature becomes a significant security risk when deserializing data from untrusted sources. If an attacker can control the value of the `@class` property, they can instruct Jackson to instantiate arbitrary Java classes present on the application's classpath. This can lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** if the attacker specifies a malicious class with a constructor, setter, or getter that performs dangerous operations.

**2. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path: Craft Payload with Malicious Type Information**

This attack path focuses on the attacker's ability to craft a malicious JSON payload that leverages this unsafe default typing configuration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* **Attacker Goal:** The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code on the server running the application.
* **Prerequisite:** The application must have enabled default typing in its Jackson `ObjectMapper` configuration. This is often done using methods like `enableDefaultTyping()`, `activateDefaultTyping()`, or through annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo`.
* **Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a JSON payload containing the following key elements:
    * **Target Property:** A property in the JSON structure that the application attempts to deserialize into a Java object.
    * **`@class` Property:** This is the crucial element. The attacker sets the value of this property to the fully qualified name of a malicious Java class present on the application's classpath. This malicious class typically has exploitable methods (constructors, setters, getters) that can be triggered during deserialization.
    * **Malicious Properties:**  The payload also includes properties that will be used to populate the fields of the malicious class. These properties are carefully crafted to trigger the malicious behavior within the chosen class.

**Example Payload Structure:**

```json
{
  "targetProperty": {
    "@class": "com.example.MaliciousClass",
    "command": "malicious_command"
  }
}
```

In this example:

* `"targetProperty"` is the name of a property the application expects.
* `"@class": "com.example.MaliciousClass"` instructs Jackson to instantiate an object of the `com.example.MaliciousClass`.
* `"command": "malicious_command"` provides input to the `MaliciousClass` that will be used to execute the attacker's desired command.

**3. How the Attack Works:**

1. **Application Receives Payload:** The application receives the crafted JSON payload, likely through an API endpoint or message queue.
2. **Deserialization Process:** The application uses its configured `ObjectMapper` to deserialize the JSON payload into Java objects.
3. **`@class` Processing:** When the `ObjectMapper` encounters the `@class` property, it uses the provided value to determine the concrete class to instantiate.
4. **Malicious Class Instantiation:**  Instead of instantiating the expected class, Jackson instantiates the malicious class specified in the `@class` property.
5. **Property Population:** Jackson then populates the fields of the malicious object using the other properties in the JSON payload (e.g., the `"command"` property in the example).
6. **Exploitable Method Invocation:**  Depending on the malicious class, the instantiation process or subsequent property setting might trigger the execution of malicious code. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the constructors, setters, or getters of the malicious class.
7. **Remote Code Execution:**  The malicious code executes within the context of the application, potentially granting the attacker full control over the server.

**4. Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

A successful exploitation of this attack path can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
* **Data Breach:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored in the application's database or file system.
* **System Compromise:** The attacker can install malware, create backdoors, and gain persistent access to the server.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can crash the application or consume resources, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**5. Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

To prevent this attack, the development team should implement the following mitigation strategies:

* **Disable Default Typing:** The most effective way to prevent this vulnerability is to **disable default typing entirely** if it's not absolutely necessary. Review your `ObjectMapper` configuration and remove any calls to `enableDefaultTyping()`, `activateDefaultTyping()`, or any related configurations.
* **Use Specific Typing:** Instead of relying on default typing, explicitly define the types you expect during deserialization. This can be done using annotations like `@JsonDeserialize(as = ConcreteClass.class)` or by providing the target class to the `readValue()` method.
* **Whitelist Allowed Types:** If default typing is unavoidable for specific use cases, implement a **strict whitelist of allowed classes** that Jackson can deserialize. This prevents the attacker from injecting arbitrary malicious classes. Jackson provides mechanisms for this, such as `PolymorphicTypeValidator`.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a direct mitigation for this specific vulnerability, robust input validation and sanitization can help prevent other types of attacks. However, it's generally ineffective against this specific `@class` injection.
* **Keep Jackson-databind Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the `jackson-databind` library to the latest version. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched, so staying up-to-date is crucial.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve code execution.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities, including misconfigurations of Jackson-databind.
* **Consider Alternative Serialization Libraries:** If the risks associated with Jackson's default typing are a major concern, consider using alternative JSON serialization libraries that do not have this default behavior.

**6. Detection and Monitoring:**

While prevention is key, it's also important to have mechanisms for detecting potential exploitation attempts:

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor application logs for unusual patterns, such as deserialization errors or attempts to instantiate unexpected classes.
* **Network Monitoring:** Analyze network traffic for suspicious payloads containing `@class` properties with potentially malicious class names.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Configure SIEM systems to alert on suspicious activity related to deserialization and class loading.
* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** Consider using RASP solutions that can detect and block malicious deserialization attempts at runtime.

**7. Example Malicious Classes (Illustrative - Do Not Use in Production):**

Here are a few examples of well-known "gadget" classes that have been used in Jackson-databind exploitation (for educational purposes only):

* **`org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`:** This class can be used to load and execute arbitrary Spring XML configuration files, potentially leading to RCE.
* **`com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TemplatesImpl`:** This class is commonly used to execute arbitrary bytecode.
* **Various JNDI-related classes:** These can be used to perform JNDI injection attacks.

**8. Key Takeaways for the Development Team:**

* **Default typing in Jackson-databind is a significant security risk when handling untrusted data.**
* **Disabling default typing is the most effective mitigation.**
* **If default typing is necessary, implement strict whitelisting of allowed types.**
* **Keep the Jackson-databind library up-to-date.**
* **Regular security audits and code reviews are essential.**
