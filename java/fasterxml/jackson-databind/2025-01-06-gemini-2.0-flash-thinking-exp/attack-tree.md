## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

Explanation: This is the root of the high-risk paths. Success at this node means the attacker has found a way to make the application deserialize untrusted data, opening the door for various exploitation techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Leverage Known Gadget Chains](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__leverage_known_gadget_chains.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker identifies a deserialization endpoint in the application that uses Jackson-databind. They then leverage publicly known "gadget chains" - sequences of existing Java classes with specific methods that, when invoked in a particular order during deserialization, can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Critical Node: Craft Malicious JSON Payload. The attacker must craft a specific JSON payload containing serialized objects of the chosen gadget chain classes, structured in a way that triggers the malicious method invocations during the deserialization process.

Explanation: This node represents the crucial step of creating the specific JSON payload that will trigger the desired malicious actions via a gadget chain during deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Craft Malicious JSON Payload](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__craft_malicious_json_payload.md)

Explanation: This node represents the crucial step of creating the specific JSON payload that will trigger the desired malicious actions via a gadget chain during deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Polymorphic Deserialization Issues](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_polymorphic_deserialization_issues.md)

Attack Vector: The application utilizes Jackson's polymorphic type handling (e.g., using annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo`). If not properly secured, an attacker can inject malicious type information within the JSON payload, forcing Jackson to deserialize the data into a malicious class of their choosing. This malicious class, when instantiated and potentially with its methods invoked, can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Critical Nodes: None explicitly marked within this path, but the entire flow relies on the vulnerable polymorphic deserialization setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Unsafe Default Typing](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__exploit_unsafe_default_typing.md)

Attack Vector: The application has enabled unsafe default typing in Jackson (`ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`) without proper restrictions. This allows an attacker to include a `@class` property in the JSON payload, specifying the fully qualified name of any class available on the application's classpath. By specifying a malicious class, the attacker can force Jackson to instantiate it, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution during or after instantiation.
- Critical Nodes:
    - Application Uses Unsafe Default Typing: This configuration flaw is the fundamental vulnerability that enables this attack path.
    - Craft Payload with Malicious Type Information: The attacker must craft a JSON payload that includes the `@class` property with the fully qualified name of a malicious class.

Explanation: This configuration setting is a critical vulnerability. If present, it drastically simplifies deserialization attacks, allowing attackers to directly control the classes being instantiated.

Explanation: This node represents the action of crafting the JSON payload that leverages the unsafe default typing configuration by including the `@class` property pointing to a malicious class.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Application Uses Unsafe Default Typing](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__application_uses_unsafe_default_typing.md)

Explanation: This configuration setting is a critical vulnerability. If present, it drastically simplifies deserialization attacks, allowing attackers to directly control the classes being instantiated.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Craft Payload with Malicious Type Information](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__craft_payload_with_malicious_type_information.md)

Explanation: This node represents the action of crafting the JSON payload that leverages the unsafe default typing configuration by including the `@class` property pointing to a malicious class.
