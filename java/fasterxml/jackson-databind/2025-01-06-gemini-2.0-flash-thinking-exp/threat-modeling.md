# Threat Model Analysis for fasterxml/jackson-databind

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Polymorphic Deserialization](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via_polymorphic_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload that, when deserialized by `jackson-databind` with default typing enabled or through vulnerable custom deserializers, instantiates and executes arbitrary code present in the application's classpath or its dependencies. The attacker manipulates the `@type` property or uses other mechanisms to specify classes that contain harmful code or can be chained together to achieve code execution (gadget chains).

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application server, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and potentially pivot to other systems.

**Affected Component:** `ObjectMapper.readValue()`, `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`, custom deserializers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable default typing globally unless absolutely necessary.
* If default typing is required, restrict the set of allowed base types and subtypes using `ObjectMapper.setDefaultTyping()`.
* Implement custom deserializers with extreme caution and thorough security reviews, avoiding the instantiation of potentially dangerous classes.
* Regularly update `jackson-databind` to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using a security manager or other sandboxing techniques to limit the impact of potential code execution.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Recursive or Deeply Nested JSON](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_recursive_or_deeply_nested_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload with excessive nesting or recursive structures. When `jackson-databind` attempts to parse this payload, it consumes excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service. The attacker exploits the library's parsing mechanism to overload the server.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Affected Component:** `JsonParser`, `ObjectMapper.readValue()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure limits on the maximum depth of JSON structures that `jackson-databind` will parse.
* Set timeouts for deserialization operations to prevent indefinitely long processing.
* Implement resource monitoring and alerts to detect and respond to excessive resource consumption.

## Threat: [Data Corruption or Manipulation through Deserialization](./threats/data_corruption_or_manipulation_through_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious JSON payloads that, when deserialized, modify the state of application objects in unintended or harmful ways. This could involve setting invalid values, bypassing validation logic, or corrupting critical data. The attacker exploits the deserialization process to manipulate application data.

**Impact:** Compromised data integrity, potential for application malfunction, and incorrect business logic execution.

**Affected Component:** Custom setters, constructors, `ObjectMapper.readValue()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation before and after deserialization to ensure data integrity.
* Design immutable objects where possible to prevent unintended state changes after creation.
* Carefully review and test custom setters and constructors for potential vulnerabilities.
* Consider using a separate Data Transfer Object (DTO) layer for deserialization and then mapping to internal domain objects with proper validation.
