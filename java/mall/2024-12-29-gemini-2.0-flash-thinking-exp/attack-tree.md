**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in mall (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** This category represents fundamental weaknesses in how the application verifies user identity and grants access to resources. Successful exploitation here often leads to complete system compromise or significant data breaches.

    *   **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**  Circumventing the login process allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users or gain unauthorized access without credentials.
        *   **Exploit Default Credentials (if any exist in mall) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** If the `mall` project includes default usernames and passwords that are not changed, attackers can easily gain initial access.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Login/Registration Logic (mall specific) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Flaws in the code handling user login or registration can allow attackers to bypass authentication checks, create unauthorized accounts, or gain access through logic errors.

    *   **Exploit Authorization Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Even after authentication, users might be able to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (within mall's roles) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Attackers can manipulate the system to grant themselves higher-level privileges (e.g., administrator), allowing them to perform sensitive actions.
        *   **Access Sensitive Data Without Proper Authorization (mall specific endpoints) (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**  Attackers can directly access sensitive data (like user details, order information) through improperly secured API endpoints or data access points, even without administrative privileges.

*   **Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities in mall (High-Risk Path):** This focuses on weaknesses that allow attackers to alter or access data in unauthorized ways, leading to financial loss, business disruption, or data breaches.

    *   **Modify Product Information Maliciously (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Change Product Prices to Zero or Negligible Values (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can manipulate product prices, allowing them to purchase items for free or at extremely low costs, causing direct financial loss.

    *   **Tamper with Order Data (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Modify Order Status to "Paid" Without Actual Payment (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can manipulate order statuses to appear as paid, allowing them to receive goods without paying, resulting in financial loss.
        *   **Access and Exfiltrate Order History and Customer Data (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive customer data and order details, leading to privacy violations, potential identity theft, and reputational damage.

    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Shopping Cart Logic (mall specific) (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Add Arbitrary Products or Quantities to Cart Without Cost (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can manipulate the shopping cart logic to add items without cost, effectively getting free products.

*   **Exploit Payment Processing Vulnerabilities (within mall's integration) (High-Risk Path):** This targets weaknesses in how the application interacts with payment systems, potentially leading to financial fraud.

    *   **Bypass Payment Verification Logic (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can circumvent the payment verification process, allowing them to complete orders without making actual payments.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Stored Payment Information (if mall stores any) (High-Risk Path):** If the application stores payment information (which is generally discouraged), vulnerabilities could allow attackers to access and steal this sensitive data, leading to significant financial harm and compliance issues.

*   **Exploit Insecure Administrative Features in mall (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Weaknesses in the administrative functionalities provide attackers with significant control over the application and its data.

    *   **Access Administrative Panel Without Authorization (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):** Gaining unauthorized access to the administrative panel grants attackers extensive control over the system, allowing them to perform any administrative action.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Admin Functionality (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Inject Malicious Code via Admin Input Fields (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can inject malicious code (like scripts or commands) through input fields in the admin panel, potentially leading to remote code execution or further compromise.
        *   **Modify Critical System Settings Maliciously (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can alter critical system settings, leading to instability, data corruption, or further security breaches.
        *   **Create Malicious Administrator Accounts (High-Risk Path):** Attackers can create new administrator accounts, providing them with persistent and potentially undetectable access to the system.
