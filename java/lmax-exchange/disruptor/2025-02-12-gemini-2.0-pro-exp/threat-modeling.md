# Threat Model Analysis for lmax-exchange/disruptor

## Threat: [Threat 1: Ring Buffer Overflow / Wrap-Around (Denial of Service)](./threats/threat_1_ring_buffer_overflow__wrap-around__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the system, causing producers to generate events faster than consumers can process.  If the `WaitStrategy` is overwhelmed or improperly configured (e.g., a `BlockingWaitStrategy` with indefinitely blocked consumers), the ring buffer's sequence number wraps around, overwriting unprocessed events. This is a direct attack on the Disruptor's core mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of critical events, application instability, and denial of service. Users cannot use the application.
    *   **Affected Disruptor Component:** `RingBuffer`, `WaitStrategy` (the specific implementation chosen), Producer logic (indirectly, as the source).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Appropriate `WaitStrategy`:** Choose a `WaitStrategy` that balances latency and backpressure handling. Avoid `BlockingWaitStrategy` without careful consideration of blocking conditions and timeouts. Prefer `YieldingWaitStrategy`, `SleepingWaitStrategy`, or `TimeoutBlockingWaitStrategy`.
        *   **Ring Buffer Capacity Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to track remaining ring buffer capacity. Alert on low capacity.
        *   **Producer-Side Backpressure:** Design producers to slow down or reject requests when the ring buffer is near full. Use `tryPublishEvent` and handle `InsufficientCapacityException`.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Input):** Implement rate limiting *before* event production to prevent overwhelming the system.
        *   **Sufficient Ring Buffer Size:** Ensure the ring buffer is adequately sized for peak load and consumer latency.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Blocking Operations in Event Handlers (Availability)](./threats/threat_2_blocking_operations_in_event_handlers__availability_.md)

*   **Description:** An event handler performs a long-running or blocking operation (synchronous I/O, etc.).  An attacker triggers actions that cause these operations to take an excessively long time. This directly impacts the Disruptor's ability to process events quickly, leading to a denial of service by delaying or preventing the processing of subsequent events. This is a direct attack on the Disruptor's performance guarantees.
    *   **Impact:** Increased latency, potential denial of service, reduced throughput.
    *   **Affected Disruptor Component:** `EventHandler` implementations, `EventProcessor`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous I/O and non-blocking operations within event handlers.
        *   **Offload Blocking Tasks:** Delegate long-running tasks to separate threads or processes, outside the Disruptor's event loop.
        *   **Timeouts:** If blocking is unavoidable, use strict timeouts to prevent indefinite delays.
        *   **Separate Disruptor Instances:** Use separate Disruptor instances for long-running tasks, isolating them from the main event flow.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Resource Exhaustion in Event Handlers (Availability)](./threats/threat_3_resource_exhaustion_in_event_handlers__availability_.md)

*   **Description:** Event handlers consume excessive resources (memory, file handles, connections) without proper management. An attacker crafts input to trigger excessive resource allocation within a vulnerable event handler, directly impacting the Disruptor's ability to function and potentially crashing the entire application.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, denial of service, potential crashes.
    *   **Affected Disruptor Component:** `EventHandler` implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Management:** Implement proper resource management (e.g., `try-finally` for release, connection pooling).
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set limits on resource usage (memory, open files, etc.).
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage to detect leaks or excessive consumption.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate input to prevent triggering excessive resource allocation.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Malicious Event Publication (Integrity/Availability)](./threats/threat_4_malicious_event_publication__integrityavailability_.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised or buggy producer publishes incorrect, malformed, or duplicate events. An attacker with control over a producer (or able to inject messages into the producer's input) directly corrupts the data flowing through the Disruptor, leading to application state corruption, errors, or DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application errors, crashes, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Disruptor Component:** Producer logic, `RingBuffer.publishEvent` (and related methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Producer-Side Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all data *before* publishing it as an event.
        *   **Event Schema:** Use a well-defined schema for event objects.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** If producers are external, implement authentication and authorization.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Focus code reviews on producer logic.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the event publication rate to prevent flooding.

## Threat: [Threat 5: Disruptor Library Vulnerability (Integrity/Availability/Confidentiality)](./threats/threat_5_disruptor_library_vulnerability__integrityavailabilityconfidentiality_.md)

* **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the LMAX Disruptor library itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise the application. This is a direct threat to the underlying library.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially ranging from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Affected Disruptor Component:** The LMAX Disruptor library itself (any part).
    * **Risk Severity:** Low probability, but potentially **High** impact.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Updated:** Maintain the Disruptor library at the latest stable version.
        * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases.
        * **Rapid Patching:** Have a process for quickly updating the library.
