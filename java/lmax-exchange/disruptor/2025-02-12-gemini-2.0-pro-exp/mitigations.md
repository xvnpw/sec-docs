# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lmax-exchange/disruptor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Appropriate Wait Strategy Selection](./mitigation_strategies/appropriate_wait_strategy_selection.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Wait Strategies:** Familiarize yourself with the different `WaitStrategy` implementations provided by the Disruptor (e.g., `BlockingWaitStrategy`, `YieldingWaitStrategy`, `BusySpinWaitStrategy`, `SleepingWaitStrategy`, `TimeoutBlockingWaitStrategy`). Each has different performance and CPU usage characteristics.
    2.  **Profile and Benchmark:** Profile your application with different wait strategies under realistic load conditions. Measure latency, throughput, and CPU utilization.
    3.  **Choose Based on Requirements:**
        *   **`BlockingWaitStrategy`:**  Good default choice for moderate latency and low CPU usage. Uses a lock and condition variable.
        *   **`YieldingWaitStrategy`:**  Good compromise between latency and CPU usage.  Yields the thread to the OS scheduler.
        *   **`BusySpinWaitStrategy`:**  Lowest latency, but *highest* CPU usage.  Continuously spins in a loop.  Only suitable for extremely low-latency scenarios where CPU usage is not a concern.
        *   **`SleepingWaitStrategy`:** Similar to Yielding, but sleeps for a short period.
        *   **`TimeoutBlockingWaitStrategy`:** Blocks with a timeout.
    4.  **Configure the Disruptor:**  Set the chosen `WaitStrategy` when constructing the `Disruptor` instance or when configuring the `EventHandler` (depending on your setup). For example:
        ```java
        WaitStrategy waitStrategy = new BlockingWaitStrategy(); // Or any other strategy
        Disruptor<MyEvent> disruptor = new Disruptor<>(MyEvent::new, ringBufferSize, threadFactory, ProducerType.MULTI, waitStrategy);
        ```
    5. **Re-evaluate Periodically:** As your application evolves or the load profile changes, re-evaluate the chosen `WaitStrategy` to ensure it remains optimal.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Slow Consumers:** (Severity: Medium) - Choosing a less aggressive wait strategy (e.g., `BlockingWaitStrategy` instead of `BusySpinWaitStrategy`) can reduce CPU contention and improve overall system stability, making it less likely that slow consumers will cause a complete DoS.  It allows the system to handle backpressure more gracefully.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** (Severity: Low) - Selecting the *wrong* wait strategy can lead to unnecessary CPU usage or increased latency.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (Medium Impact).  Proper wait strategy selection helps manage resource contention.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced (Low Impact). Optimizes CPU usage and latency.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes. `DisruptorConfiguration.java` currently uses `BlockingWaitStrategy`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   We need to add performance tests to benchmark different wait strategies under various load conditions to confirm that `BlockingWaitStrategy` is the optimal choice for our current and anticipated workloads.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Producer-Side `tryPublishEvent` (Non-Blocking Publish)](./mitigation_strategies/producer-side__trypublishevent___non-blocking_publish_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `tryPublishEvent`:** Instead of using `disruptor.publishEvent(translator)`, use `disruptor.tryPublishEvent(translator)`.  The `tryPublishEvent` method attempts to publish an event to the `RingBuffer` *without* blocking.
    2.  **Handle Return Value:**  `tryPublishEvent` returns a `boolean` value:
        *   `true`: The event was successfully published.
        *   `false`: The `RingBuffer` was full, and the event was *not* published.
    3.  **Implement Failure Handling:**  If `tryPublishEvent` returns `false`, implement appropriate logic:
        *   **Reject the Request:**  Return an error to the client or user, indicating that the system is overloaded.
        *   **Retry Later:**  Attempt to publish the event again after a short delay.  Use a backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the system.
        *   **Log an Error:**  Log the failure to publish the event for monitoring and debugging purposes.
        *   **Drop the Event (if acceptable):** In some cases, it might be acceptable to simply drop the event if it cannot be published immediately.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Slow Consumers:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the producer thread from blocking indefinitely when the `RingBuffer` is full, which can lead to cascading failures and a denial-of-service condition.  Provides a mechanism for graceful degradation under overload.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk significantly reduced (Medium Impact).  Allows the producer to handle overload gracefully without blocking.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The producer (`Producer.java`) currently uses `publishEvent`.  We need to modify it to use `tryPublishEvent` and implement the appropriate failure handling logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Custom `ExceptionHandler` (Disruptor-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/custom__exceptionhandler___disruptor-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** (Same as previous detailed description, but highlighting the Disruptor-specific parts)
    1.  **Create ExceptionHandler Class:** Create a class implementing `com.lmax.disruptor.ExceptionHandler<T>`.  
    2.  **Implement Handling Logic:** Implement the `handleEventException`, `handleOnStartException`, and `handleOnShutdownException` methods. The key here is that these methods are *called by the Disruptor itself* when exceptions occur during event processing, startup, or shutdown.
    3.  **Set the Exception Handler:**  Crucially, set the custom exception handler on the Disruptor *using the Disruptor's API*:
        ```java
        disruptor.setDefaultExceptionHandler(new MyCustomExceptionHandler());
        ```
        This tells the Disruptor to use *your* handler instead of its default behavior (which is to halt the sequence).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unhandled Exceptions in Event Handlers (Disruptor-Specific Aspect):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the Disruptor's default behavior of halting the sequence on an unhandled exception.  Allows for custom error handling and recovery *within the Disruptor's processing pipeline*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unhandled Exceptions:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium Impact).  Provides a controlled way to handle errors *within the Disruptor's context* and prevent disruption of event processing.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   We need to create a custom `ExceptionHandler` class (`CustomExceptionHandler.java`) and set it on the Disruptor instance using `setDefaultExceptionHandler`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ring Buffer Size Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/ring_buffer_size_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand the Impact:** The size of the `RingBuffer` is a critical configuration parameter.
        *   **Too Small:**  Increases the risk of the `RingBuffer` filling up quickly, leading to producer blocking or event rejection (if using `tryPublishEvent`).
        *   **Too Large:**  Consumes more memory than necessary.  While less directly a security issue, excessive memory usage can lead to performance problems or even out-of-memory errors.
    2.  **Estimate Requirements:** Estimate the required `RingBuffer` size based on:
        *   **Expected Event Rate:**  The average number of events per second.
        *   **Maximum Burst Size:**  The maximum number of events that might arrive in a short period.
        *   **Consumer Processing Time:**  The average time it takes for consumers to process an event.
    3.  **Power of Two:** The `RingBuffer` size *must* be a power of two (e.g., 1024, 2048, 4096). This is a requirement of the Disruptor's internal algorithms.
    4.  **Configure the Disruptor:** Set the `RingBuffer` size when constructing the `Disruptor` instance:
        ```java
        int ringBufferSize = 1024; // Or any power of two
        Disruptor<MyEvent> disruptor = new Disruptor<>(MyEvent::new, ringBufferSize, threadFactory, ProducerType.MULTI, waitStrategy);
        ```
    5. **Monitor and Adjust:** Monitor the `RingBuffer`'s remaining capacity during runtime.  If it consistently runs low, consider increasing the size.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Slow Consumers:** (Severity: Medium) - An appropriately sized `RingBuffer` provides a buffer to absorb bursts of events and gives slow consumers time to catch up, reducing the likelihood of a DoS.
    *   **Performance Issues:** (Severity: Low) - Avoids unnecessary memory allocation (if too large) or frequent blocking/rejection (if too small).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced (Medium Impact).  Provides a buffer against overload.
    *   **Performance Issues:** Risk reduced (Low Impact). Optimizes memory usage and avoids unnecessary blocking.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes. `DisruptorConfiguration.java` sets the ring buffer size.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   We need to document the rationale behind the chosen `RingBuffer` size and establish a process for periodically reviewing and adjusting it based on observed performance and load.
