# Attack Surface Analysis for lmax-exchange/disruptor

## Attack Surface: [Ring Buffer Exhaustion (Producer Outpacing Consumer)](./attack_surfaces/ring_buffer_exhaustion__producer_outpacing_consumer_.md)

*   **Description:**  Producers generate events faster than consumers can process them, leading to a buildup of events in the ring buffer.  While the buffer doesn't "overflow" (it wraps), the practical effect is similar: producers may block (depending on the `WaitStrategy`), leading to application slowdown or unresponsiveness.
*   **How Disruptor Contributes:** The Disruptor's core mechanism is the ring buffer.  Its performance characteristics encourage high-throughput event production, which, if not matched by consumer capacity, leads to this issue. This is a *direct* consequence of the Disruptor's design.
*   **Example:** A financial trading application receives a sudden burst of market data.  The producers flood the Disruptor with trade events, but the consumers cannot keep up.  Producers using a `BlockingWaitStrategy` start to block, halting the ingestion of new trades.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application becomes unresponsive or experiences significant delays.  Data loss may occur if a non-blocking `WaitStrategy` is used and events are overwritten.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Consumer Optimization:** Profile and optimize consumer logic to maximize throughput.
    *   **Backpressure:** Implement backpressure mechanisms *before* the Disruptor.  Rate-limit producers or use a queue to absorb bursts.
    *   **WaitStrategy Selection:** Carefully choose the `WaitStrategy`.  `BlockingWaitStrategy` can lead to deadlocks; consider `TimeoutBlockingWaitStrategy`.  `BusySpinWaitStrategy` consumes high CPU.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the remaining capacity of the ring buffer.  Alert on low remaining capacity.
    *   **Ring Buffer Sizing:**  Choose an appropriate ring buffer size.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Exhaustion (Event Objects)](./attack_surfaces/memory_exhaustion__event_objects_.md)

*   **Description:**  Large or numerous event objects, combined with inefficient memory management or leaks in event handling, lead to excessive memory consumption.
*   **How Disruptor Contributes:** While the ring buffer itself is pre-allocated, the *event objects* within it are often allocated dynamically.  The Disruptor's high throughput can *amplify* memory allocation issues *if* the event objects are not managed correctly. This is a direct interaction with how the Disruptor handles events.
*   **Example:**  A logging system uses the Disruptor.  Each log message is a large object.  A memory leak in the consumer prevents these objects from being garbage collected, leading to an `OutOfMemoryError`.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application crashes due to `OutOfMemoryError`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Event Object Pooling:** Use an `EventFactory` that pre-allocates and reuses event objects.  This is *crucial*.
    *   **Event Object Design:** Design event objects to be as small as possible.
    *   **Memory Profiling:**  Profile the application's memory usage.
    *   **Resource Release:** Ensure resources held by event objects are properly released.

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption (Incorrect Sequence Handling)](./attack_surfaces/data_corruption__incorrect_sequence_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs in custom `EventProcessor` or `EventHandler` implementations, or direct (and incorrect) manipulation of sequence numbers, lead to out-of-order processing or data inconsistencies.
*   **How Disruptor Contributes:** The Disruptor *relies* on sequence numbers for ordering.  Incorrect handling of these sequences *within the Disruptor's context* is the root cause. This is a direct attack surface of the Disruptor's core functionality.
*   **Example:**  A custom `EventHandler` incorrectly increments the sequence number, causing events to be processed out of order.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, application instability, incorrect results.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Direct Sequence Manipulation:**  Do *not* directly manipulate sequence numbers.
    *   **Thorough Testing:**  Extensively test any custom `EventProcessor` or `EventHandler` implementations.
    *   **Use Disruptor DSL:**  Prefer the provided Disruptor DSL and high-level APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Exceptions in Event Handlers](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_exceptions_in_event_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** An `EventHandler` throws an unhandled exception, causing the `EventProcessor` to halt, preventing further event processing.
*   **How Disruptor Contributes:** The Disruptor's event processing model relies on `EventHandler` implementations. Uncaught exceptions within these handlers *directly* impact the Disruptor's operation, halting its core processing loop.
*   **Example:** An `EventHandler` attempts to write to a database, but the connection is unavailable, resulting in an unhandled exception. The `EventProcessor` stops.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - Event processing stops.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Exception Handling:** Implement comprehensive exception handling within *all* `EventHandler` implementations.
    *   **ExceptionHandler:** Use an `ExceptionHandler` with the `EventProcessor` to log, retry, or skip the event.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Vulnerable Disruptor Version)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__vulnerable_disruptor_version_.md)

* **Description:** Using an outdated or vulnerable version of the Disruptor library.
    * **How Disruptor Contributes:** The vulnerability exists within the Disruptor library itself. This is a direct attack surface.
    * **Example:** A CVE is published for a specific version of the Disruptor, detailing a denial-of-service vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., DoS, data corruption).
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical) depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Regular Updates:** Keep the Disruptor library updated.
        * **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and CVE databases.
        * **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools.
