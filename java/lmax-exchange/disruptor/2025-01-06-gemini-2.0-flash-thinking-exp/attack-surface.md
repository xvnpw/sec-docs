# Attack Surface Analysis for lmax-exchange/disruptor

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data in the Ring Buffer](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_in_the_ring_buffer.md)

* **Description:** A compromised or malicious producer injects crafted data into the Ring Buffer intended to exploit vulnerabilities in consumer logic.
    * **How Disruptor Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Disruptor's core function is to facilitate data exchange between producers and consumers via the Ring Buffer. It provides the mechanism for this data to be passed, and if not handled carefully by consumers, malicious data can be processed.
    * **Example:** A producer writes a specially crafted string into the Ring Buffer. A consumer, expecting a certain format, attempts to process this string, leading to a buffer overflow or injection vulnerability in the consumer's code.
    * **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, or other unexpected behavior depending on the vulnerability in the consumer.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the consumer logic *before* processing data from the Ring Buffer.
        * **Data Type Enforcement:** Enforce strict data types and formats when writing to and reading from the Ring Buffer.
        * **Secure Deserialization:** If using serialization, employ secure deserialization practices to prevent object injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Producer Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/producer_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

* **Description:** A malicious or compromised producer floods the Ring Buffer with events, overwhelming consumers and preventing legitimate events from being processed.
    * **How Disruptor Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Disruptor's high-throughput nature can be exploited if producer input is not controlled, allowing a rapid injection of events that can overwhelm consumers.
    * **Example:** A rogue producer rapidly publishes a large volume of meaningless or resource-intensive events into the Disruptor Ring Buffer, causing consumers to fall behind and potentially crash or become unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the application's ability to process events in a timely manner.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Rate Limiting on Producers:** Implement rate limiting mechanisms on producers *before* they publish to the Disruptor.
        * **Backpressure Mechanisms:** Implement backpressure mechanisms to signal to producers when consumers are overloaded, preventing them from overwhelming the Ring Buffer.
        * **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor producer activity for unusual spikes in event production and set up alerts.

## Attack Surface: [Consumer Interference and Deadlocks](./attack_surfaces/consumer_interference_and_deadlocks.md)

* **Description:** In complex consumer setups utilizing Disruptor's concurrency features, a malicious or faulty consumer manipulates its sequence or the sequences of other consumers, leading to deadlocks or incorrect processing order.
    * **How Disruptor Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Disruptor's features like `SequenceBarrier` and `WorkPool` enable complex dependencies between consumers. If a consumer maliciously manipulates these, it can disrupt the intended processing flow.
    * **Example:** In a scenario where Consumer B depends on Consumer A completing its processing (managed by a `SequenceBarrier`), a malicious Consumer A could intentionally stall or never update its sequence, causing Consumer B to wait indefinitely, leading to a deadlock.
    * **Impact:** Application hangs, inability to process events, potential data inconsistencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Careful Design of Consumer Dependencies:** Thoroughly design and test consumer dependencies to avoid circular dependencies or complex scenarios prone to deadlocks.
        * **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeout mechanisms in consumers to prevent indefinite waiting on sequences.
        * **Monitoring Consumer Progress:** Monitor the progress of individual consumers' sequences and alert on stalled or unexpectedly slow consumers.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Event Handlers](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_event_handlers.md)

* **Description:** While the vulnerability lies within the developer-implemented `EventHandler` logic, the Disruptor provides the mechanism for delivering potentially malicious events to these handlers.
    * **How Disruptor Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Disruptor is the pipeline through which events, potentially containing malicious data, are passed to the `EventHandler`.
    * **Example:** An `EventHandler` that processes user input from an event without proper sanitization is vulnerable to injection attacks if a malicious producer injects crafted input into the Disruptor.
    * **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding practices when implementing `EventHandler` logic, including input validation, output encoding, and avoiding common vulnerabilities.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews of `EventHandler` implementations.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure `EventHandler` components operate with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through Event Data](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_event_data.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information stored within events in the Ring Buffer without proper protection can be exposed if an attacker gains unauthorized access to the Disruptor's memory or the application's process.
    * **How Disruptor Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Disruptor manages the storage and transfer of event data within its Ring Buffer. If sensitive data is present and not protected, the Disruptor becomes a point where this data could be accessed.
    * **Example:** Events in the Ring Buffer contain personally identifiable information (PII) in plain text. An attacker who gains access to the application's memory space can potentially read this sensitive data directly from the Disruptor's buffer.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, compliance issues.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data *before* it is placed into the Ring Buffer and decrypt it only when necessary within the consumers.
        * **Minimize Sensitive Data in Events:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in events if possible. Consider using references to secure data stores instead.
        * **Memory Protection:** Employ operating system and language-level memory protection mechanisms to limit access to the application's memory space.
