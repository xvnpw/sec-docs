## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Disruptor Weakness](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_disruptor_weakness.md)

This represents the overarching goal and encompasses all identified high-risk methods to achieve it by exploiting Disruptor.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sequence Management Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sequence_management_issues.md)

This path focuses on disrupting the core mechanism of Disruptor by manipulating the sequences that govern event flow between producers and consumers. Success here can lead to data corruption, loss, or application instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Sequence Wrap-Around Issues](./attack_tree_paths/cause_sequence_wrap-around_issues.md)

This path aims to exploit the fixed-size nature of the Ring Buffer by causing the producer sequence to overtake the consumer sequence, potentially leading to data overwriting or repeated processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Producer Sequence](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_producer_sequence.md)

This is critical because directly controlling the producer sequence allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values, leading to data corruption, missed events, and application instability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Consumer Starvation](./attack_tree_paths/cause_consumer_starvation.md)

This path focuses on preventing consumers from processing events, leading to backlogs, unresponsiveness, and potential data loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Consumer Sequence](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_consumer_sequence.md)

This is critical because directly controlling the consumer sequence allows an attacker to stall event processing, leading to backlogs, unresponsiveness, and potential data loss.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Race Conditions in Sequence Updates](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_race_conditions_in_sequence_updates.md)

This path targets the concurrent updates to sequence numbers, aiming to introduce inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior.

This is critical because successfully exploiting race conditions can lead to subtle but significant data inconsistencies that are difficult to detect and can have widespread consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ring Buffer Access Control](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ring_buffer_access_control.md)

This path aims to bypass the intended access controls of the Ring Buffer, allowing attackers to read uncommitted data or overwrite existing events, leading to data corruption or information disclosure.

This is critical because bypassing access controls allows for direct manipulation of the data within the Ring Buffer, leading to data corruption, information disclosure, and unpredictable application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Handling/Processing Logic (Triggered by Disruptor Behavior)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_handlingprocessing_logic__triggered_by_disruptor_behavior_.md)

This path focuses on leveraging the specific order and timing of event processing within Disruptor to trigger unexpected and potentially harmful state transitions within the application's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

This path aims to make the application unavailable by either preventing producers from adding new events or blocking consumers from processing existing ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Block Producers](./attack_tree_paths/block_producers.md)

This path focuses on preventing producers from adding new events to the Ring Buffer, effectively halting the application's core functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Block Consumers](./attack_tree_paths/block_consumers.md)

This path focuses on preventing consumers from processing events, leading to a backlog and potentially application failure.
