# Threat Model Analysis for lmax-exchange/disruptor

## Threat: [Ring Buffer Overflow leading to Data Loss or DoS](./threats/ring_buffer_overflow_leading_to_data_loss_or_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, by controlling or influencing producers, sends a high volume of events or excessively large events to the Disruptor's ring buffer, exceeding its capacity. This directly exploits the fixed-size nature of the ring buffer.
    *   **Impact:**  Older, unprocessed events in the ring buffer might be overwritten, leading to data loss. Alternatively, the system might become unresponsive due to resource exhaustion within the Disruptor.
    *   **Affected Component:** Ring Buffer (specifically the write operation)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure the ring buffer size based on expected throughput and available resources.
        *   Implement backpressure mechanisms that interact with the Disruptor's gating sequences to signal to producers when the buffer is nearing capacity.

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Sequence Management leading to Data Loss or Duplication](./threats/race_conditions_in_sequence_management_leading_to_data_loss_or_duplication.md)

*   **Description:**  With multiple producers or consumers, improper synchronization or flawed logic *within the Disruptor's sequence management mechanisms* could lead to race conditions. An attacker might exploit timing windows to cause events to be missed by consumers or processed multiple times. This directly targets the Disruptor's concurrency control.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss if events are skipped, or data corruption and inconsistent state if events are processed more than once.
    *   **Affected Component:** SequenceBarrier, Sequences, Event Processors
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize the Disruptor's provided sequence management mechanisms (e.g., `SequenceBarrier`, `WaitStrategy`) correctly and according to best practices.
        *   Thoroughly test concurrent access patterns involving the Disruptor's components.
