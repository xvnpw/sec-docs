## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Goal: Execute Arbitrary Code or Cause Denial of Service via Disruptor](./attack_tree_paths/attack_goal_execute_arbitrary_code_or_cause_denial_of_service_via_disruptor.md)

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has compromised the application through vulnerabilities in the Disruptor framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ring Buffer Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ring_buffer_vulnerabilities.md)

The Ring Buffer is the core data structure of the Disruptor. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to directly manipulate the data being processed, potentially leading to memory corruption, data breaches, or denial of service. This includes attacks like overflowing the buffer or corrupting data within it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overflow/Underflow Ring Buffer](./attack_tree_paths/overflowunderflow_ring_buffer.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to write data beyond the allocated boundaries of the Ring Buffer (overflow) or read data from uninitialized or already processed slots (underflow). This can be achieved by manipulating the producer or consumer sequence numbers, potentially through race conditions or by exploiting a lack of proper bounds checking in the sequence management logic.
    **Potential Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service due to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Deadlock/Starvation](./attack_tree_paths/cause_deadlockstarvation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate the producer and consumer sequences in a way that causes them to wait indefinitely for each other (deadlock). Alternatively, they can flood the Ring Buffer with events faster than consumers can process them (starvation), leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
    **Potential Impact:** Denial of service, rendering the application unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Sequencer Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sequencer_vulnerabilities.md)

The Sequencer controls the order and availability of events in the Ring Buffer. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Sequencer allows attackers to disrupt the flow of events, potentially causing data loss, incorrect processing, or denial of service by manipulating producer and consumer cursors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Producer Sequencer](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_producer_sequencer.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to manipulate the producer sequencer to claim invalid sequence numbers or force a premature wrap-around of the sequence. This can be achieved by exploiting weaknesses in the claiming mechanism or through race conditions in sequence updates.
    **Potential Impact:** Data loss (overwriting unprocessed events), incorrect processing, or potentially memory corruption if invalid sequence numbers lead to out-of-bounds access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Processor Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_processor_vulnerabilities.md)

Event Processors contain the application's business logic for handling events. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to inject malicious data that can be executed by the application, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service through resource exhaustion or triggering errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Event Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_event_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers publish events containing malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities within the event handlers. This could include command injection, SQL injection (if handlers interact with databases), or resource exhaustion attacks triggered by processing specific event data.
    **Potential Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or compromise of other systems if the event handlers interact with external services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies within Event Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_within_event_handlers.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft events that, when processed, trigger interactions with vulnerable external dependencies used by the event handlers. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries or services the handlers rely on.
    **Potential Impact:** Compromise of external systems, data breaches, or denial of service affecting dependent services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Publisher Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_publisher_vulnerabilities.md)

The Event Publisher is responsible for adding events to the Disruptor. Exploiting vulnerabilities here allows attackers to inject arbitrary and potentially malicious events directly into the processing pipeline, bypassing intended validation or security measures.
