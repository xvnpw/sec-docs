# Threat Model Analysis for lmax-exchange/disruptor

## Threat: [Ring Buffer Overflow Leading to Data Loss](./threats/ring_buffer_overflow_leading_to_data_loss.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially by compromising a producer or exploiting a vulnerability in the producer logic, floods the ring buffer with events at a rate exceeding the consumers' processing capacity. This causes newer events to overwrite older, unprocessed events due to the fixed-size nature of the `RingBuffer`.

**Impact:** Loss of critical data, incomplete processing of events, inconsistent application state.

**Affected Component:** `RingBuffer`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement backpressure mechanisms to slow down producers when the buffer is nearing capacity.
* Monitor producer and consumer lag to detect potential overflow situations.
* Choose an appropriately sized ring buffer based on expected throughput and processing capacity.

## Threat: [Premature Data Consumption by Consumers](./threats/premature_data_consumption_by_consumers.md)

**Description:** An attacker, by manipulating timing or exploiting a flaw in the `SequenceBarrier` logic, could cause consumers to read data from the `RingBuffer` before a producer has fully written the event. This results in consumers processing incomplete or corrupted data.

**Impact:** Processing of invalid data leading to errors, incorrect calculations, application crashes.

**Affected Component:** `SequenceBarrier`, `RingBuffer`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure correct configuration and usage of the `SequenceBarrier` to enforce proper producer-consumer synchronization.
* Utilize appropriate wait strategies that guarantee event availability before consumption.

## Threat: [Consumer Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/consumer_denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects a stream of events designed to overwhelm a specific consumer, causing it to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) and potentially crash or become unresponsive. This can be amplified by the Disruptor's mechanism of delivering events to consumers.

**Impact:**  Individual consumer failure, potentially halting the processing of certain types of events, leading to application instability or denial of service for specific functionalities.

**Affected Component:** `EventProcessor`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement resource limits and monitoring for consumers.
* Choose appropriate wait strategies to prevent excessive spinning or blocking.
* Implement circuit breaker patterns to isolate failing consumers.

## Threat: [Sequence Barrier Manipulation Leading to Out-of-Order Processing](./threats/sequence_barrier_manipulation_leading_to_out-of-order_processing.md)

**Description:** In custom implementations or due to vulnerabilities within the Disruptor itself, an attacker might manipulate the `SequenceBarrier`, causing consumers to process events in an incorrect order. This can lead to inconsistencies and errors in applications where event order is critical.

**Impact:** Incorrect application state, data corruption, failure to maintain transactional integrity.

**Affected Component:** `SequenceBarrier`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rely on the Disruptor's built-in sequence barrier implementations whenever possible.
* Thoroughly review and test any custom sequence barrier logic for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Wait Strategy Exploitation Leading to Resource Starvation](./threats/wait_strategy_exploitation_leading_to_resource_starvation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit the chosen `WaitStrategy` to cause excessive resource consumption. For example, if a busy-waiting strategy is used, an attacker could prevent new events from being published, causing consumers to spin endlessly and consume CPU resources unnecessarily.

**Impact:** Performance degradation, increased resource costs, potential denial of service due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** `WaitStrategy`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully choose wait strategies based on the application's latency and resource requirements.
* Monitor CPU usage and other resource metrics to detect potential issues related to wait strategy choices.
* Consider using blocking or yielding wait strategies in environments where resource consumption is a major concern.
