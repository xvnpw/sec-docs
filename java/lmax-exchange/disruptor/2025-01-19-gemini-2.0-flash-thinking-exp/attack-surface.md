# Attack Surface Analysis for lmax-exchange/disruptor

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Event Payloads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_event_payloads.md)

**Description:** Producers can publish events containing malicious data that, when processed by event handlers, can lead to vulnerabilities.

**How Disruptor Contributes:** Disruptor acts as the transport mechanism for these events, efficiently delivering them to consumers without inherently validating their content. Its high-throughput nature can amplify the impact of a successful attack.

**Example:** A producer sends an event containing a specially crafted string that, when processed by an event handler, is interpreted as a command and executed on the system.

**Impact:** Code injection, command injection, data corruption, denial of service (if processing the malicious payload is resource-intensive).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization within event handlers *before* processing event data received from the Disruptor.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing event handlers that consume data from the Disruptor.
* Consider using data signing or encryption for events published to the Disruptor to ensure integrity and authenticity.

## Attack Surface: [Producer Overflow Leading to Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/producer_overflow_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** A malicious or compromised producer overwhelms the Disruptor with events at a rate faster than consumers can process them.

**How Disruptor Contributes:** Disruptor's high-throughput design can exacerbate this if not properly managed. The Ring Buffer can fill up quickly, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Example:** An attacker floods the system with a large number of events, causing the Ring Buffer to fill up, potentially leading to memory exhaustion or blocking legitimate producers from publishing.

**Impact:** Denial of service, performance degradation, potential application crashes due to resource starvation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms on producers *before* they publish events to the Disruptor.
* Monitor the Ring Buffer occupancy and consumer lag to detect potential overflow situations.
* Design consumers to handle bursts of events efficiently.
* Consider using a blocking wait strategy on producers if backpressure is desired to prevent overwhelming the Disruptor.

## Attack Surface: [Sequence Number Manipulation (If Exposed)](./attack_surfaces/sequence_number_manipulation__if_exposed_.md)

**Description:** If the application exposes or allows manipulation of the sequence numbers used by Disruptor, an attacker could disrupt the event processing order.

**How Disruptor Contributes:** Disruptor relies heavily on sequence numbers for coordinating producers and consumers. Tampering with these sequences directly interferes with Disruptor's core functionality.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a consumer's sequence number to skip processing certain events or to reprocess events multiple times, leading to inconsistent data processing.

**Impact:** Data inconsistencies, incorrect processing order, potential for data loss or duplication, application logic errors.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid exposing Disruptor's internal sequence numbers directly to external entities or untrusted code.
* Implement strict access control if sequence numbers need to be managed programmatically.
* Ensure that any logic manipulating sequence numbers is thoroughly tested and validated to prevent unintended consequences within the Disruptor's workflow.
