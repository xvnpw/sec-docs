# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the Disruptor library, aims to provide a high-performance inter-thread messaging solution for Java applications.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - High Performance: The primary goal is to enable applications to achieve extremely low latency and high throughput in inter-thread communication.
  - Scalability:  Facilitate the development of applications that can scale to handle increasing workloads and data volumes.
  - Reliability: Ensure robust and dependable message processing within applications.
  - Efficiency: Optimize resource utilization by minimizing overhead in inter-thread communication.

- Business Risks:
  - Performance Bottlenecks: If not implemented correctly, the library might introduce performance bottlenecks instead of resolving them.
  - Integration Complexity: Integrating Disruptor into existing systems might introduce complexity and potential instability.
  - Operational Overhead:  Misconfiguration or improper usage can lead to increased operational overhead and monitoring challenges.
  - Dependency Risk: Reliance on an external library introduces a dependency risk, including potential bugs or security vulnerabilities in the library itself.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Development: The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the code. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY.
  - security control: Code Review:  Pull requests are likely reviewed by maintainers before merging. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY - assumed based on typical open source project practices.
  - security control: Unit Testing:  The project likely includes unit tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. Implemented: GITHUB REPOSITORY - assumed based on typical software development practices.
  - security control: Static Analysis: Developers might use static analysis tools during development. Implemented: DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT - assumed best practice.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities:  The project depends on other libraries, which might have vulnerabilities. Accepted risk: inherent to software development and dependency management.
  - accepted risk:  No Formal Security Audit:  There is no indication of a formal security audit being performed on the library. Accepted risk: typical for many open-source projects.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Disruptor and projects using Disruptor.
  - security control: Security Focused Code Review:  Incorporate security considerations into the code review process, specifically looking for common vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, resource leaks).
  - security control:  Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report potential issues responsibly.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable directly to the library itself, as it's an inter-thread communication mechanism within an application. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using Disruptor.
  - Authorization: Not applicable directly to the library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using Disruptor to control access to data and operations performed using the library.
  - Input Validation:  While Disruptor itself handles internal data structures, applications using Disruptor must perform input validation on data that is processed or published through Disruptor to prevent injection attacks or data corruption. Implemented: APPLICATION USING DISRUPTOR.
  - Cryptography:  Disruptor itself does not provide cryptographic functionality. If applications require encryption of data passed through Disruptor, it must be implemented by the application itself. Implemented: APPLICATION USING DISRUPTOR.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - High-Performance Messaging: The core business process being protected is the ability to perform high-performance, low-latency inter-thread messaging within applications. Disruptor is designed to enhance this process.
  - Application Stability and Performance: Ensuring the stability and performance of applications that rely on Disruptor for critical operations.
