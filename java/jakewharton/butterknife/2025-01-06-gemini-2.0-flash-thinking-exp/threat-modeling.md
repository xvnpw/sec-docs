# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/butterknife

## Threat: [Incorrect View Binding Leading to UI Manipulation](./threats/incorrect_view_binding_leading_to_ui_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect View Binding Leading to UI Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker, by compromising the development or build environment, could potentially manipulate the generated Butterknife code or influence the resource IDs at build time. This could lead to binding an interactive UI element (like a button) to a different, seemingly benign view. When the user interacts with the visible element, the action associated with the incorrectly bound element is triggered instead.
    *   **Impact:**  Users might unknowingly trigger unintended actions, potentially leading to data modification, unauthorized access, or other security breaches depending on the functionality of the misbound elements.
    *   **Affected Butterknife Component:** `@BindView` annotation, generated binding code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the development and build environment to prevent unauthorized code modification.
        *   Implement code signing and integrity checks for build artifacts.
        *   Conduct thorough UI testing, including automated tests, to verify correct element binding and functionality.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential discrepancies between layout files and Butterknife annotations.

## Threat: [Build-Time Manipulation of Butterknife Generated Code for Malicious Intent](./threats/build-time_manipulation_of_butterknife_generated_code_for_malicious_intent.md)

*   **Threat:** Build-Time Manipulation of Butterknife Generated Code for Malicious Intent
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the build environment could modify the code generated by Butterknife's annotation processor. This could involve injecting malicious code, altering view bindings to point to attacker-controlled logic, or removing security checks.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially catastrophic, leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or complete compromise of the application.
    *   **Affected Butterknife Component:** Annotation processor, generated binding code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the build environment and restrict access to authorized personnel.
        *   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Use secure build pipelines and practices.
        *   Consider using reproducible builds to ensure consistency and detect tampering.

## Threat: [Incorrect Event Handler Binding Leading to Unintended Actions](./threats/incorrect_event_handler_binding_leading_to_unintended_actions.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Event Handler Binding Leading to Unintended Actions
    *   **Description:** Similar to incorrect view binding, a compromised build environment or developer error could lead to binding an event handler (e.g., `@OnClick`) to the wrong view. When the user interacts with the intended view, the action associated with the incorrectly bound view is triggered.
    *   **Impact:**  Users might unknowingly trigger unintended actions, potentially leading to data modification, unauthorized access, or other security breaches depending on the functionality of the misbound event handler.
    *   **Affected Butterknife Component:** `@OnClick`, `@OnLongClick`, and other event binding annotations, generated binding code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review all Butterknife event binding annotations to ensure they correspond to the correct views and actions.
        *   Utilize linting tools and code reviews to catch potential mismatches.
        *   Implement robust UI testing, including testing of event handlers, to verify correct functionality.
