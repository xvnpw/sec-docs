# Attack Surface Analysis for jakewharton/butterknife

## Attack Surface: [Annotation Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/annotation_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Malicious or compromised annotation processors in the project's dependencies can manipulate the code generated during compilation.
    * **How ButterKnife Contributes:** ButterKnife relies on annotation processing to generate binding code based on annotations like `@BindView` and `@OnClick`. A malicious processor could alter this generated code.
    * **Example:** A compromised annotation processor could inject code into the generated ButterKnife binding classes that sends user input data to a remote server whenever a button (bound with `@OnClick`) is clicked.
    * **Impact:** Code injection, data exfiltration, application malfunction, build failures.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully vet and trust all annotation processor dependencies.
        * Regularly audit project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to detect potential issues.
        * Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) practices.

## Attack Surface: [Resource ID Confusion/Collision](./attack_surfaces/resource_id_confusioncollision.md)

* **Description:**  Overlapping or intentionally conflicting resource IDs can lead to UI elements being bound to incorrect fields or click listeners being attached to the wrong views.
    * **How ButterKnife Contributes:** ButterKnife uses resource IDs to link views in layouts to fields in code. If resource IDs collide, ButterKnife might bind to the wrong view.
    * **Example:** A malicious library includes a layout with a view having the same ID as a critical button in the application. ButterKnife might incorrectly bind the click listener of the application's button to the malicious library's view (if it's also present in the activity/fragment's view hierarchy).
    * **Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, potential for triggering unintended actions, denial of service (if critical UI elements are affected).
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully manage resource IDs and avoid naming collisions, especially when integrating external libraries.
        * Use unique prefixes for resource IDs in different modules or libraries.
        * Employ tooling that can detect resource ID conflicts during the build process.
