## Attack Surface: [Dependency Chain Compromise](./attack_surfaces/dependency_chain_compromise.md)

* **Description:** Dependency Chain Compromise
    * **How ButterKnife Contributes to the Attack Surface:** As a dependency, ButterKnife itself could be compromised, leading to the introduction of malicious code into applications using it.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor could gain access to the ButterKnife repository or distribution channels and inject malicious code into a release.
    * **Impact:** Full application compromise, data theft, malware distribution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use trusted dependency management tools and repositories.
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies (e.g., using checksums).
        * Regularly audit project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using dependency scanning tools to detect potential issues.
