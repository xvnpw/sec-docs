# Threat Model Analysis for jakewharton/butterknife

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Generated Code due to Malicious Annotation Processor](./threats/vulnerability_in_generated_code_due_to_malicious_annotation_processor.md)

*   **Description:** If a compromised or malicious annotation processor is included in the project's dependencies, it could potentially inject malicious code into the generated ButterKnife binding classes during the build process. This injected code would then be executed within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected ButterKnife Component:** Annotation processing mechanism, generated binding classes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet all dependencies, including annotation processors. Only use reputable and well-maintained libraries.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   Implement a secure software development lifecycle with code reviews and security audits.
    *   Consider using a controlled and trusted build environment.

## Threat: [Build System Tampering to Modify Generated Code](./threats/build_system_tampering_to_modify_generated_code.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the development environment or build pipeline could potentially modify the generated ButterKnife binding code directly. This could involve injecting malicious logic or altering existing binding behavior.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected ButterKnife Component:** Generated binding classes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the development environment and build pipeline with strong access controls and authentication.
    *   Implement code signing to ensure the integrity of the build artifacts.
    *   Regularly audit the build process and dependencies.
    *   Use a version control system and track changes to build scripts and generated code.
