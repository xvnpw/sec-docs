## Attack Tree Path: [1. [HR][CR] Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1___hr__cr__exploit_supply_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Step Description:**  Targeting the process of obtaining and integrating Butterknife into the application to introduce malicious code or a compromised version.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement dependency verification (checksum, signature).
    *   Use dependency lock files.
    *   Utilize private/internal repositories with access control.
    *   Regular dependency audits and vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HR][CR] Malicious Dependency Injection](./attack_tree_paths/2___hr__cr__malicious_dependency_injection.md)

**Attack Step Description:** Replacing the legitimate Butterknife library with a malicious version during dependency resolution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Dependency verification.
    *   Dependency locking.
    *   Secure build system and dependency registry.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HR][CR] Dependency Confusion Attack](./attack_tree_paths/3___hr__cr__dependency_confusion_attack.md)

**Attack Step Description:** Uploading a malicious library with the same name to public repositories to trick the build system into downloading it.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly define dependency sources (prioritize private/internal repositories).
    *   Dependency verification.
    *   Dependency locking.
    *   Regularly review and audit dependency configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CR] Compromised Build System/Registry](./attack_tree_paths/4___cr__compromised_build_systemregistry.md)

**Attack Step Description:** Compromising the build system or a private dependency registry to inject a malicious Butterknife library directly into the build process.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden build systems and dependency registries with strong access controls.
    *   Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of build infrastructure.
    *   Implement integrity checks for dependencies within the build process.
    *   Principle of least privilege for build processes and users.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CR] Compromised Butterknife Repository (Implicitly High Risk)](./attack_tree_paths/5___cr__compromised_butterknife_repository__implicitly_high_risk_.md)

**Attack Step Description:** Compromising the official Butterknife GitHub repository or its distribution channels to inject malicious code.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Very High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Likely to be detected quickly due to widespread impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rely on official and trusted sources for dependencies.
    *   Monitor for security advisories related to Butterknife.
    *   Verify checksums of downloaded libraries if provided.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [CR] [2.1.1.2.1] Sensitive Data in Annotations Exposed](./attack_tree_paths/6___cr___2_1_1_2_1__sensitive_data_in_annotations_exposed.md)

**Attack Step Description:**  Developers unintentionally include sensitive data in Butterknife annotations, and a bug in the annotation processor leads to its exposure in generated code or build artifacts.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (Requires developer mistake and processor bug)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low (Developer mistake is the primary factor)
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Developer mistake)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in annotations.
    *   Use secure configuration management practices (environment variables, configuration files).
    *   Regularly review generated code and build artifacts for unintended data exposure.
    *   Static analysis tools to detect potential sensitive data in annotations.
