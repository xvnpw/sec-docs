# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities:
  - Increase Android developer productivity by reducing boilerplate code related to view binding.
  - Simplify Android UI development and make it faster.
  - Improve code readability and maintainability in Android projects.
- Business goals:
  - Provide a widely adopted and reliable library for Android view binding.
  - Empower Android developers to focus on application logic rather than repetitive UI setup.
  - Maintain the library as open-source and community-driven.
- Business risks:
  - Dependency on a community-maintained open-source library.
  - Potential for security vulnerabilities within the library code.
  - Risk of library becoming outdated or unmaintained in the future.
  - Compatibility issues with new Android SDK versions or development tools.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Open source code - publicly available for review and scrutiny on GitHub. Implemented: GitHub repository.
  - security control: Community review - relies on community contributions and issue reporting for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub community engagement.
  - security control: Static analysis - likely performed by developers using standard Android development tools and IDEs, which may include static analysis features. Implemented: Developer's local development environment and CI pipelines (if used by integrating applications).
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential delay in security patch availability due to open-source and community-driven nature.
  - accepted risk: Indirect security impact on applications using Butterknife if vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited.
- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Dependency scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Butterknife during development and build processes.
  - security control: Regular security code review - Conduct periodic security-focused code reviews by experienced security engineers to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities beyond standard development practices.
  - security control: Automated security testing - Integrate automated security testing tools (SAST/DAST) into the Butterknife build and release pipeline to detect common code-level vulnerabilities.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable - Butterknife is a client-side library and does not handle user authentication.
  - Authorization: Not applicable - Butterknife does not manage access control or authorization.
  - Input validation: Not directly applicable - Butterknife primarily deals with view binding and code generation, not direct user input. However, generated code should not introduce vulnerabilities. Input validation should be handled in the application code that uses Butterknife, not within the library itself.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable - Butterknife does not handle sensitive data or cryptographic operations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process: Android application development speed and efficiency for developers using Butterknife. Indirectly, the quality and security of Android applications that depend on Butterknife.
- Data we are trying to protect:
  - Butterknife library source code: Sensitivity - Medium (Intellectual property, community trust).
  - Build artifacts (JAR files): Sensitivity - Medium (Integrity and availability for developers).
  - Indirectly, the security and integrity of applications using Butterknife: Sensitivity - High (Potential impact on end-users and application functionality).
- Data sensitivity:
  - Butterknife source code is publicly available, but modifications and unauthorized changes need to be prevented.
  - Build artifacts need to be protected from tampering and unauthorized modification during the build and publishing process.
  - Applications using Butterknife rely on the library's integrity and security, so vulnerabilities in Butterknife can indirectly impact application security.
