* **Attack Surface:** Inclusion of Insecure Code Examples
    * **Description:**  The example code provided in the `java-design-patterns` repository might contain insecure coding practices that are not intended for production use but could be inadvertently copied.
    * **How java-design-patterns contributes to the attack surface:** The repository's primary purpose is to demonstrate design patterns, not to provide secure coding examples. Therefore, examples might lack proper input validation, error handling, or secure storage practices for simplicity and clarity of the pattern.
    * **Example:** An example demonstrating the Singleton pattern might hardcode database credentials for simplicity, which a developer might copy into their application without realizing the security implications.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (credentials), potential for unauthorized access, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Treat all code from the repository as examples and not production-ready.
        * Conduct thorough code reviews of any code copied from the repository.
        * Implement secure coding practices independently of the examples.
        * Avoid directly copying configuration or credential handling from examples.

* **Attack Surface:** Use of Vulnerable Dependencies in Examples
    * **Description:** The example code might depend on older versions of libraries that have known security vulnerabilities.
    * **How java-design-patterns contributes to the attack surface:** The repository's dependencies are managed for the purpose of running the examples. These dependencies might not be regularly updated to the latest secure versions. If a developer uses the same dependency versions in their application, they inherit those vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** An example might use an older version of a logging library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. If a developer uses the same version in their application, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Independently manage dependencies for the application.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.
        * Do not directly copy dependency configurations from the example project.
        * Regularly update all application dependencies to their latest secure versions.

* **Attack Surface:** Accidental Inclusion of Example Code in Production
    * **Description:** Developers might inadvertently include entire example modules or classes in their production build, which could contain vulnerabilities or expose unnecessary functionality.
    * **How java-design-patterns contributes to the attack surface:** The repository structure makes it easy to browse and potentially copy entire modules. If build processes are not carefully configured, example code could be unintentionally packaged with the application.
    * **Example:** An entire example module demonstrating the Visitor pattern, including test classes and sample data, might be included in the final application artifact, potentially exposing internal logic or test credentials.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for exploitation of vulnerabilities within the example code, increased attack surface due to unnecessary code.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully configure build processes to include only necessary source code.
        * Implement code analysis tools to detect and prevent the inclusion of example code.
        * Regularly review the application's build artifacts to ensure only intended code is included.
        * Educate developers on the importance of excluding example code from production builds.
