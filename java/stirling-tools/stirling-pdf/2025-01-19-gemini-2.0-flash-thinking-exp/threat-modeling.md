# Threat Model Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/malicious_pdf_exploiting_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed PDF file containing malicious data or structures that exploit vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF's PDF parsing logic. This could involve triggering buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues during the parsing process. The attacker uploads this malicious PDF to the application, which then passes it to Stirling-PDF for processing.
*   **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting Stirling-PDF, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt services. It could also cause a denial of service by crashing the Stirling-PDF process.
*   **Affected Component:** PDF Parsing Module (specifically the components responsible for interpreting PDF file structures and data).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Stirling-PDF updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Run Stirling-PDF in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools on the Stirling-PDF codebase (if feasible) to identify potential parsing vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during File Processing](./threats/path_traversal_during_file_processing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a PDF that, when processed by Stirling-PDF (e.g., during merge or split operations), includes instructions or metadata that cause Stirling-PDF to access or modify files outside of the intended processing directory. The attacker leverages Stirling-PDF's file handling capabilities to navigate the file system.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potential modification or deletion of critical system files, or exfiltration of data.
*   **Affected Component:** File Handling Functions (within modules responsible for operations like merging, splitting, and potentially watermarking).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Stirling-PDF is configured to operate within a restricted file system environment.
    *   Sanitize and validate all file paths *internally within Stirling-PDF's processing logic*.
    *   Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly influence file paths used by Stirling-PDF.
    *   Implement strict access controls on the directories where Stirling-PDF operates.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious PDF](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_pdf.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) when processed by Stirling-PDF. This could involve complex PDF structures, large numbers of objects, or inefficient processing operations *within Stirling-PDF's algorithms*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. The server hosting Stirling-PDF might become unresponsive or crash.
*   **Affected Component:** Core Processing Engine (the components responsible for performing the requested PDF operations).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement timeouts and resource limits *for Stirling-PDF processing tasks*.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and implement alerts for unusual activity *related to Stirling-PDF processes*.
    *   Consider using a queueing system to limit the number of concurrent Stirling-PDF processing tasks.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Stirling-PDF relies on various third-party libraries for PDF processing and other functionalities. These dependencies might contain known vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific inputs or triggering certain operations that utilize the vulnerable dependency *within Stirling-PDF's code*.
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from code execution and information disclosure to denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-Party Libraries (the specific vulnerable library component *as integrated within Stirling-PDF*).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Stirling-PDF and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF's dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the libraries used by Stirling-PDF.
