    C -- "13. Serve File via HTTPS" --> A
```

**Data Flow Steps:**

1. **User Uploads PDF File:** The user selects a PDF file through the Web UI.
2. **HTTPS POST /upload (File):** The Web UI sends an HTTPS POST request to the Backend API, including the file data.
3. **Validate File, Store Temporarily:** The Backend API validates the uploaded file (e.g., file type, size) and stores it securely in the Temporary Storage.
4. **Initiate Processing Request (File Path, Task):** The Backend API sends a request to the PDF Processing Engine, specifying the path to the input file in temporary storage and the desired processing task.
5. **Read Input File from Storage:** The PDF Processing Engine reads the input PDF file from the Temporary Storage.
6. **Process PDF using Library:** The PDF Processing Engine utilizes a PDF processing library to perform the requested manipulation.
7. **Write Output File to Storage:** The PDF Processing Engine writes the processed PDF file back to the Temporary Storage.
8. **Processing Complete Notification (Output File Path):** The Backend API notifies the Web UI that the processing is complete and provides the path or identifier for the output file.
9. **Display Download Link:** The Web UI displays a download link to the user.
10. **HTTPS GET /download/{fileId}:** The user clicks the download link, triggering an HTTPS GET request to the Backend API with a file identifier.
11. **Authenticate/Authorize Download Request:** The Backend API authenticates and authorizes the download request to ensure the user has permission to access the file.
12. **Retrieve File from Storage:** The Backend API retrieves the requested file from the Temporary Storage.
13. **Serve File via HTTPS:** The Backend API serves the processed PDF file to the user's browser over HTTPS.

**6. Security Considerations (Detailed)**

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples of potential threats and vulnerabilities associated with each component and the data flow.

* **Web UI (Frontend):**
    * **Threat:** Malicious scripts injected through XSS could steal user credentials or perform actions on their behalf.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
    * **Threat:** CSRF attacks could trick users into performing unintended actions.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens synchronized with the backend.
    * **Threat:** Sensitive information stored in browser storage could be compromised.
    * **Mitigation:** Avoid storing sensitive data in local or session storage. If necessary, encrypt the data.
    * **Threat:** Clickjacking attacks could trick users into clicking on malicious elements.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement frame busting techniques or use the `X-Frame-Options` header.

* **Backend API Service:**
    * **Threat:** SQL injection attacks if database queries are constructed using unsanitized user input (if a database is used for user management or other data).
    * **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries or an ORM to prevent SQL injection.
    * **Threat:** Command injection attacks if the application executes system commands based on user input.
    * **Mitigation:** Avoid executing system commands based on user input. If necessary, sanitize input thoroughly and use safe APIs.
    * **Threat:** Path traversal vulnerabilities during file upload could allow attackers to write files to arbitrary locations.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement strict validation of uploaded file paths and store files in a secure location with restricted access.
    * **Threat:** Brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints (if implemented).
    * **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, account lockout policies, and strong password requirements.
    * **Threat:** Exposure of sensitive information through error messages or logs.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement secure logging practices and avoid displaying detailed error messages to users in production.

* **PDF Processing Engine:**
    * **Threat:** Vulnerabilities within the PDF processing library could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause denial-of-service.
    * **Mitigation:** Keep the PDF processing library up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Threat:** Processing extremely large or complex PDF files could lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory).
    * **Mitigation:** Implement file size limits and timeouts for processing operations.
    * **Threat:** Maliciously crafted PDF files could exploit vulnerabilities in the processing library.
    * **Mitigation:** Consider using sandboxing techniques or running the processing engine in a restricted environment.

* **Temporary File Storage:**
    * **Threat:** Unauthorized access to temporary files could expose sensitive data.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement strong access controls and file permissions on the temporary storage location.
    * **Threat:** Failure to securely delete temporary files could leave sensitive data vulnerable.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement secure deletion mechanisms that overwrite file data before deletion.
    * **Threat:** Filling up the temporary storage could lead to denial-of-service.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement mechanisms to monitor storage usage and automatically clean up old files.

**7. Deployment Architecture**

A typical deployment of Stirling-PDF, emphasizing security considerations, might involve:

* **Containerization (Docker):** Packaging the application and its dependencies in Docker containers for consistent and isolated deployments. This helps in limiting the impact of potential security breaches within the container.
* **Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx with TLS Termination):** Placing a reverse proxy in front of the application to handle SSL/TLS encryption, protecting data in transit. The reverse proxy can also provide additional security features like request filtering and rate limiting.
* **Secure Network Configuration:** Deploying the application within a secure network environment with appropriate firewall rules to restrict access to necessary ports and services.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Periodically assessing the security of the deployed environment and the application itself to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensuring that each component and process runs with the minimum necessary permissions.
