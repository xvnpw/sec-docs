# Attack Surface Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to upload PDF files, which are then processed by Stirling-PDF. Maliciously crafted PDF files can exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying PDF processing libraries used by Stirling-PDF.
    *   **How Stirling-PDF Contributes:** Stirling-PDF's core functionality involves parsing and manipulating user-provided PDF files, making it directly responsible for handling potentially malicious input.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in Ghostscript (a common dependency of PDF processing tools), leading to remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on uploaded files, checking file types and sizes.
        *   Run Stirling-PDF in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to restrict the impact of potential exploits.
        *   Regularly update Stirling-PDF and its underlying PDF processing libraries (e.g., Ghostscript, PDFBox) to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a dedicated, hardened PDF processing service instead of directly integrating the library.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Stirling-PDF relies on various third-party libraries and packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **How Stirling-PDF Contributes:** By including these dependencies, Stirling-PDF introduces the attack surface associated with those libraries.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in a specific version of a library used by Stirling-PDF for image processing within PDFs. An attacker could upload a PDF containing a specially crafted image that triggers this vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust dependency management strategy, including regular scanning for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
        *   Keep Stirling-PDF and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions with security patches.
        *   Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection (Less Likely, but Possible with Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection__less_likely__but_possible_with_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** If the integrating application or Stirling-PDF's configuration allows user-controlled input to be directly used in system commands executed by Stirling-PDF (e.g., specifying output file names or options), attackers could inject malicious commands.
    *   **How Stirling-PDF Contributes:** While Stirling-PDF itself might not directly expose command injection vulnerabilities, improper integration or configuration could lead to this.
    *   **Example:** The application allows users to specify the output filename for a processed PDF. An attacker provides a filename like "; rm -rf /", which, if not properly sanitized, could be executed as a system command.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in system commands.
        *   If necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection.
        *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to system calls whenever possible.
        *   Run Stirling-PDF with minimal privileges to limit the impact of potential command injection.
