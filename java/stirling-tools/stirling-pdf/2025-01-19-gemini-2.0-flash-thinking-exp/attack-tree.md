## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PDF Processing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pdf_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Exploit PDF Processing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):** This category represents a broad range of attacks that leverage weaknesses in how Stirling PDF handles and interprets PDF files. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious PDF Upload (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_pdf_upload__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Malicious PDF Upload (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START):** This is the initial step for many high-risk attacks. An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Stirling PDF's processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PDF Parsing Bugs (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pdf_parsing_bugs__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit PDF Parsing Bugs (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Attackers craft PDFs that exploit flaws in Stirling PDF's PDF parsing engine.
    * **Inject Malicious Code (e.g., JavaScript, embedded scripts) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Malicious PDFs can contain embedded JavaScript or other scripting languages. If Stirling PDF doesn't properly sanitize or sandbox these scripts, they can execute on the server during processing, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    * **Trigger Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  By including specific, oversized, or malformed elements in the PDF structure, attackers can cause Stirling PDF or its underlying libraries to write beyond allocated memory buffers. This can lead to application crashes (Denial of Service) or, more critically, allow attackers to overwrite memory and potentially gain control of the execution flow (Remote Code Execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code (e.g., JavaScript, embedded scripts) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code__e_g___javascript__embedded_scripts___high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious Code (e.g., JavaScript, embedded scripts) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Malicious PDFs can contain embedded JavaScript or other scripting languages. If Stirling PDF doesn't properly sanitize or sandbox these scripts, they can execute on the server during processing, potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflowmemory_corruption__high-risk_path_.md)

**Trigger Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  By including specific, oversized, or malformed elements in the PDF structure, attackers can cause Stirling PDF or its underlying libraries to write beyond allocated memory buffers. This can lead to application crashes (Denial of Service) or, more critically, allow attackers to overwrite memory and potentially gain control of the execution flow (Remote Code Execution).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., Ghostscript) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_libraries__e_g___ghostscript___high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Libraries (e.g., Ghostscript) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Stirling PDF relies on external libraries like Ghostscript for rendering and manipulating PDFs. Known vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by crafting specific PDF files that trigger the flaws during processing by Stirling PDF, potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Filename/Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_filenameparameters__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Command Injection via Filename/Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH START):** If the application uses user-controlled input (like filenames or processing parameters) directly in commands executed by Stirling PDF without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    * **Inject Malicious Commands in Filename (HIGH-RISK PATH):** An attacker provides a filename containing malicious shell commands. If this filename is used in a command executed by Stirling PDF, the injected commands will be executed on the server.
    * **Inject Malicious Commands in Processing Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Similar to filename injection, attackers can inject malicious commands into parameters passed to Stirling PDF's command-line interface, leading to command execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands in Filename (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_in_filename__high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious Commands in Filename (HIGH-RISK PATH):** An attacker provides a filename containing malicious shell commands. If this filename is used in a command executed by Stirling PDF, the injected commands will be executed on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Commands in Processing Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_commands_in_processing_parameters__high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious Commands in Processing Parameters (HIGH-RISK PATH):**  Similar to filename injection, attackers can inject malicious commands into parameters passed to Stirling PDF's command-line interface, leading to command execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal during Download (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_during_download__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Path Traversal during Download (HIGH-RISK PATH START):** This vulnerability occurs when the application allows users to download processed PDFs and uses user-controlled input to construct the download path without proper validation.
    * **Access Sensitive Files Outside Intended Directory (HIGH-RISK PATH):** By manipulating the download path (e.g., using ".."), an attacker can bypass intended directory restrictions and access sensitive files on the server's file system. This could expose application configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Files Outside Intended Directory (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_files_outside_intended_directory__high-risk_path_.md)

**Access Sensitive Files Outside Intended Directory (HIGH-RISK PATH):** By manipulating the download path (e.g., using ".."), an attacker can bypass intended directory restrictions and access sensitive files on the server's file system. This could expose application configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive data.
