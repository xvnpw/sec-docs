# Attack Surface Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Attack Surface: [PDF Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/pdf_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Critical vulnerabilities within the PDF parsing libraries utilized by Stirling PDF. These flaws can be triggered by maliciously crafted PDF files processed by the application.
*   **Stirling PDF Contribution:** Stirling PDF's core functionality relies on parsing PDF files for various operations (conversion, merging, etc.).  Vulnerabilities in the chosen PDF parsing libraries directly expose Stirling PDF to attack.  The application's purpose *is* to process PDFs, making it inherently vulnerable if the parsing process is flawed.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted PDF is uploaded to Stirling PDF. This PDF exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the underlying PDF parsing library during processing. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Stirling PDF.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Full control of the server hosting Stirling PDF, allowing attackers to install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malformed PDFs can crash the parsing process, rendering Stirling PDF unavailable and disrupting services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Prioritize Secure PDF Libraries:** Select and use PDF parsing libraries known for their security and active maintenance.
        *   **Continuous Dependency Updates:** Implement a rigorous process for regularly updating PDF parsing libraries and all other dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities immediately.
        *   **Input Validation & Fuzzing (PDF Specific):**  Develop and implement specific input validation checks for PDF file structures to detect and reject potentially malicious files *before* they reach the parsing libraries. Employ fuzzing techniques specifically targeting the PDF parsing components with malformed and malicious PDF samples.
        *   **Sandboxing & Isolation:** Isolate the PDF parsing process within a sandboxed environment or container to limit the damage if a parsing vulnerability is exploited.
    *   **Users (Deployers):**
        *   **Maintain Up-to-date Stirling PDF:**  Ensure Stirling PDF is always updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches, especially those addressing PDF parsing library vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Limits & Monitoring:** Implement resource limits for Stirling PDF to mitigate DoS attacks. Monitor system logs for errors or unusual activity related to PDF processing, which could indicate exploitation attempts.

## Attack Surface: [File Handling Vulnerabilities (Path Traversal & Insecure Temporary Files)](./attack_surfaces/file_handling_vulnerabilities__path_traversal_&_insecure_temporary_files_.md)

*   **Description:** High severity vulnerabilities stemming from improper handling of file paths and temporary files by Stirling PDF during PDF processing. This can enable unauthorized file system access and manipulation.
*   **Stirling PDF Contribution:** Stirling PDF must manage file paths for uploaded PDFs, create temporary files for intermediate processing steps, and handle output file locations.  Flaws in how Stirling PDF manages these file operations directly create path traversal and temporary file vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PDF with a filename containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../sensitive_config.txt`). If Stirling PDF doesn't properly sanitize filenames when creating temporary files or processing output paths, it might inadvertently access or overwrite sensitive files outside of its intended working directory.  Insecure temporary file creation with predictable names could allow attackers to access or replace these temporary files to influence processing.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data from the server's file system.
    *   **Data Tampering & Integrity Compromise:** Modifying or deleting critical application files or user data, leading to application malfunction or data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Path Sanitization:** Implement robust and consistent sanitization of all user-provided file paths and filenames.  Specifically, remove or neutralize path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`).
        *   **Absolute Paths & Controlled Directories:**  Use absolute paths for all internal file operations. Confine file operations to a strictly controlled and isolated directory structure.
        *   **Secure Temporary File Generation:** Utilize secure functions for temporary file creation that generate cryptographically random and unpredictable filenames. Set restrictive permissions on temporary files and directories. Ensure temporary files are deleted promptly after use.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):** Run Stirling PDF with minimal file system permissions necessary for its operation. Restrict write access to only essential directories.
    *   **Users (Deployers):**
        *   **File System Access Control:** Configure the server environment to restrict Stirling PDF's file system access to the absolute minimum required. Use operating system level access controls to enforce these restrictions.
        *   **Regular Security Audits (File Handling):** Periodically audit Stirling PDF's configuration and deployment to ensure secure file handling practices are in place and effective.
