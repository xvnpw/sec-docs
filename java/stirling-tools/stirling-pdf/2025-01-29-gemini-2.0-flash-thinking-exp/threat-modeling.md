# Threat Model Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Upload leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/malicious_pdf_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF's PDF parsing libraries. Upon processing, the malicious PDF triggers code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to gain control.
**Impact:** Critical - Full server compromise, data breach, complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
**Stirling-PDF Component Affected:** PDF Processing Module (underlying PDF parsing libraries).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Stirling-PDF and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement resource limits for PDF processing.
*   Consider sandboxing or containerization for PDF processing.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Upload leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_pdf_upload_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a PDF file crafted to consume excessive server resources during processing by Stirling-PDF, overloading the server and making the application unavailable.
**Impact:** High - Application unavailability, service disruption, performance degradation for legitimate users.
**Stirling-PDF Component Affected:** PDF Processing Module (resource consumption during PDF parsing).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory, processing time) for PDF processing.
*   Implement rate limiting on file uploads.
*   Limit the maximum allowed file size for PDF uploads.
*   Offload PDF processing to background queues.

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Upload leading to Information Disclosure](./threats/malicious_pdf_upload_leading_to_information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** A specially crafted PDF exploits vulnerabilities in PDF parsing to extract sensitive information from the server's memory or file system during processing, potentially exposing confidential data.
**Impact:** High - Exposure of sensitive data, configuration details, internal application information.
**Stirling-PDF Component Affected:** PDF Processing Module (memory management during PDF parsing).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Stirling-PDF and its dependencies updated to patch information disclosure vulnerabilities.
*   Run Stirling-PDF with the principle of least privilege.
*   Conduct regular security audits to identify potential information leakage vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Libraries)](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies__libraries_.md)

**Description:** Stirling-PDF relies on Java libraries that may contain known security vulnerabilities. Using vulnerable versions exposes the application to exploitation, potentially leading to RCE, DoS, or information disclosure.
**Impact:** Varies - Can be Critical or High depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability.
**Stirling-PDF Component Affected:** Dependency Management (vulnerable libraries used by Stirling-PDF).
**Risk Severity:** Varies (Critical to High)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement automated dependency scanning to identify vulnerable libraries.
*   Regularly update Stirling-PDF's dependencies to the latest secure versions.
*   Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for continuous monitoring.

## Threat: [Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/transitive_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in libraries that are dependencies of Stirling-PDF's direct dependencies (transitive dependencies) can be exploited indirectly, posing similar risks as direct dependency vulnerabilities.
**Impact:** Varies - Can be Critical or High depending on the severity of the transitive dependency vulnerability.
**Stirling-PDF Component Affected:** Dependency Management (transitive dependencies of Stirling-PDF's libraries).
**Risk Severity:** Varies (Critical to High)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use dependency scanning tools that identify transitive vulnerabilities.
*   Analyze the dependency tree to understand transitive dependencies.
*   Regularly update dependencies and rebuild Stirling-PDF to incorporate patches.

## Threat: [Lack of Security Updates and Patching](./threats/lack_of_security_updates_and_patching.md)

**Description:** Neglecting to regularly update Stirling-PDF and its dependencies with security patches leaves the application vulnerable to known exploits, increasing the risk of RCE, DoS, or information disclosure over time.
**Impact:** High (over time) - Re-emergence of vulnerabilities, increased risk of exploitation as vulnerabilities become public.
**Stirling-PDF Component Affected:** Operational Maintenance, Dependency Management.
**Risk Severity:** High (over time)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Establish a robust patch management process for Stirling-PDF and its dependencies.
*   Regularly monitor for security updates and announcements.
*   Implement automated update mechanisms where feasible and safe.
