# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Stirling-PDF, aims to provide a self-hosted, open-source PDF manipulation tool. It addresses the business need for users and organizations to handle PDF documents securely and privately, without relying on third-party cloud services.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a comprehensive suite of PDF manipulation tools.
- Ensure user privacy and data security through self-hosting.
- Offer a free and open-source alternative to commercial PDF software.
- Maintain ease of use and accessibility for a wide range of users.
- Foster a community around the project for contributions and support.

Business Risks:
- Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities in the software.
- Operational risks associated with self-hosting complexity and user configuration errors.
- Legal and compliance risks if the software is misused for malicious purposes or data breaches.
- Risk of insufficient community support and maintenance leading to project stagnation.
- Competition from established commercial and open-source PDF tools.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control HTTPS enforcement for web access (inferred from typical web application best practices).
- security control Input validation on file uploads (inferred as necessary for PDF processing).
- security control Dependency scanning as part of development process (inferred as good practice for open-source projects).
- accepted risk Reliance on user's infrastructure security for self-hosting deployments.
- accepted risk Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used for PDF processing.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the application and its features.
- security control Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- security control Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- security control Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
- security control Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- security control Secure file handling practices, including secure temporary file storage and deletion.
- security control Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control Implement logging and monitoring for security events and anomalies.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement Implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify user identity. Consider supporting various authentication methods (e.g., username/password, OAuth).
    - Requirement Protect authentication credentials in transit and at rest.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user permissions and access to different functionalities.
    - Requirement Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement Validate all user inputs, especially file uploads and form data, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, path traversal).
    - Requirement Sanitize user inputs before processing and displaying them to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Requirement Implement file type validation and size limits for uploaded files to prevent malicious uploads and resource exhaustion.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement Use strong cryptography for sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement Securely store cryptographic keys and manage their lifecycle.
    - Requirement Utilize HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - Requirement Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest, such as user configurations or temporary files containing sensitive information.
