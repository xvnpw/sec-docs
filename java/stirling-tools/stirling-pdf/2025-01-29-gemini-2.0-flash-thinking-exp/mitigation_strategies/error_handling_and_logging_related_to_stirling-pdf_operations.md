### 5. Threats Mitigated

*   **Information Leakage via Stirling-PDF Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity):**  The mitigation strategy effectively addresses this threat through **Step 2 (Sanitize error messages)**. By removing sensitive information from user-facing error messages, the risk of accidental data exposure is significantly reduced. The severity is considered Low to Medium as the information leaked is typically technical details and not direct user data, but can still aid attackers in reconnaissance.
*   **Lack of Visibility into Stirling-PDF Issues (Medium Severity):** This threat is directly mitigated by **Step 3 (Detailed Logging)** and further enhanced by **Step 5 (Log Monitoring and Alerting)**.  Detailed logs provide the necessary data to understand Stirling-PDF operations, diagnose problems, and identify security issues. Monitoring and alerting transform this visibility into proactive detection capabilities. The severity is Medium as lack of visibility can hinder timely problem resolution and potentially allow security incidents to go unnoticed for longer periods.
*   **Delayed Incident Response (Medium Severity):**  This threat is primarily addressed by **Step 3 (Detailed Logging)**, **Step 4 (Secure Log Storage)**, and **Step 5 (Log Monitoring and Alerting)**.  Comprehensive and securely stored logs are essential for effective incident investigation and response. Log monitoring and alerting enable faster detection of security-relevant events, reducing the delay in incident response. The severity is Medium as delayed incident response can increase the impact of security incidents and allow attackers more time to compromise systems or data.
