## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a malicious PDF file to the application.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Input processing, especially of complex formats like PDF, is a common source of vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or Arbitrary File Access.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Exploit PDF Parser Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a PDF that triggers vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflow, Integer Overflow, Logic Errors, Deserialization issues) in the PDF parsing libraries used by Stirling-PDF.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** PDF parsers are complex and historically prone to vulnerabilities. Exploits can lead to RCE or DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Stirling-PDF and its PDF parsing dependencies updated. Consider sandboxing.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in PDF Processing Modules:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF modules responsible for image extraction, text extraction (OCR), PDF manipulation, or format conversion.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Modules handling specific PDF functionalities can also contain vulnerabilities leading to RCE or DoS during processing.
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Stirling-PDF updated. Disable unnecessary modules if possible.
    *   **Exploit Resource Exhaustion via Large/Complex PDFs:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading extremely large or computationally complex PDFs designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, Memory, Disk).
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Easy to execute, high likelihood of success in causing DoS if resource limits are not in place.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strict resource limits (file size, processing time, memory usage).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting insecure configurations of Stirling-PDF or its environment.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations are common and can expose sensitive information or create pathways for further attacks. Dependency vulnerabilities are a major source of RCE.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Misconfiguration of Stirling-PDF Settings - Enable Debug/Verbose Logging in Production:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting debug or verbose logging enabled in a production environment to gain access to sensitive information exposed in logs (paths, internal data, potentially secrets).
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Information disclosure can aid further attacks or directly leak sensitive data. Misconfigurations are common.
        *   **Mitigation:** Disable debug/verbose logging in production. Securely manage and monitor logs.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities - Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable libraries used by Stirling-PDF (PDF parsing libraries, image processing libraries, other Node.js modules).
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Dependency vulnerabilities are a major attack vector. Exploits are often publicly available, leading to RCE or DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust dependency management, vulnerability scanning, and regular updates of Stirling-PDF and its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Output Handling Vulnerabilities - Resource Exhaustion via Output Generation](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_output_handling_vulnerabilities_-_resource_exhaustion_via_output_generation.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering Stirling-PDF to generate excessively large output files (e.g., through specific PDF operations or content).
*   **Why High-Risk:** Can lead to Denial of Service by filling up disk space or overloading download bandwidth. Relatively easy to trigger.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Generate excessively large output files:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting input PDFs or using Stirling-PDF features in a way that results in extremely large output files.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** DoS impact, relatively easy to achieve.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement output size limits. Monitor disk space and bandwidth usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Operational Vulnerabilities - DoS via Repeated Malicious Requests](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_operational_vulnerabilities_-_dos_via_repeated_malicious_requests.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Flooding the application with numerous requests to process (potentially malicious) PDFs, overwhelming Stirling-PDF and the server.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Simple and effective DoS attack. High likelihood of success if rate limiting is not in place.
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **Overload Stirling-PDF processing with numerous malicious PDF requests:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a high volume of requests to the application's Stirling-PDF processing endpoint.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Easy to perform, can quickly lead to DoS.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting, request throttling, and potentially use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
