## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Stirling-PDF [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_stirling-pdf__critical_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and serves as the root of all potential attack paths involving Stirling-PDF. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved significant control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Processing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_processing_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from how Stirling-PDF processes PDF files. It's a critical node because successful exploitation here can lead to severe consequences like RCE or data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious PDF Upload [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK START]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_pdf_upload__critical___high_risk_start_.md)

This is a primary attack vector. The application allows users to upload PDF files, which are then processed by Stirling-PDF. This node is critical as it's the entry point for several high-risk attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PDF Parsing Vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows) [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pdf_parsing_vulnerabilities__e_g___buffer_overflows__integer_overflows___critical___high_ris_566f58d3.md)

The PDF format is complex, and the libraries used by Stirling-PDF to parse these files might contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file specifically designed to trigger a vulnerability in the parsing library. This could involve exceeding buffer limits, causing integer overflows, or exploiting other parsing logic flaws.
    *   **Consequences:** Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) during parsing [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__during_parsing__critical___high_risk_.md)

This is the most severe outcome of exploiting PDF parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By successfully exploiting a parsing vulnerability, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application.
    *   **Consequences:** This grants the attacker complete control over the server, allowing them to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via PDF features (e.g., external resources, JavaScript) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_pdf_features__e_g___external_resources__javascript___high_ris_814fe023.md)

PDFs can include features that cause the processing application to make network requests.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF containing elements (like embedded URLs or JavaScript code) that force the Stirling-PDF server to make requests to internal or external resources controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Consequences:** This can be used to:
        *   **Access internal resources or systems [HIGH RISK]:**  Bypass firewalls and access internal services that are not directly exposed to the internet.
        *   **Exfiltrate sensitive information [HIGH RISK]:**  Force the server to send sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite critical application files [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_critical_application_files__critical_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Stirling-PDF handles file paths or filenames during processing can lead to arbitrary file writes.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF that, when processed, causes Stirling-PDF to write data to unintended locations on the server, potentially overwriting critical application files or configuration files.
    *   **Consequences:** This can lead to application malfunction, denial of service, or even allow the attacker to inject malicious code into the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Storage and Handling [HIGH RISK START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_storage_and_handling__high_risk_start_.md)

This category focuses on risks associated with how the application stores and manages files processed by Stirling-PDF.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload a malicious file that gets stored on the server [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/upload_a_malicious_file_that_gets_stored_on_the_server__high_risk_.md)

If the application stores uploaded or processed files on the server without proper security measures.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker uploads a file containing malicious code (e.g., a PHP script).
    *   **Consequences:** This becomes a high-risk path if the storage location is web-accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute the malicious file if the storage location is web-accessible [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK END]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_the_malicious_file_if_the_storage_location_is_web-accessible__critical___high_risk_end_.md)

This is a direct path to code execution if the uploaded malicious file can be accessed via a web browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:** If the directory where uploaded files are stored is accessible through the web server, the attacker can directly request the malicious file (e.g., `http://vulnerable-app/uploads/malicious.php`) and execute the code.
    *   **Consequences:** This grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit insecure file permissions on processed files [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_file_permissions_on_processed_files__high_risk_.md)

If the application doesn't set appropriate permissions on files processed by Stirling-PDF.
    *   **Attack Vector:** After Stirling-PDF processes a file, the permissions might be too permissive, allowing unauthorized access or modification.
    *   **Consequences:**
        *   **Access sensitive data in processed files [HIGH RISK END]:** Attackers can read sensitive information contained within the processed files.
