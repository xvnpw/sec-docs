# Attack Surface Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Attack Surface: [Malicious PDF Uploads](./attack_surfaces/malicious_pdf_uploads.md)

**Description:** Users upload crafted PDF files intended to exploit vulnerabilities in PDF processing.

**How Stirling-PDF Contributes:** Stirling-PDF processes user-uploaded PDF files, making it a target for malicious PDFs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in its underlying PDF processing libraries.

**Example:** A user uploads a PDF containing a crafted object that triggers a buffer overflow in a library used by Stirling-PDF during parsing.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application, Denial of Service (DoS), or information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on uploaded PDF files.
* Utilize dedicated PDF security scanning libraries to detect malicious content before processing by Stirling-PDF.
* Run Stirling-PDF in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
* Keep Stirling-PDF and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement file size limits and resource usage monitoring for PDF processing.
* Educate users about the risks of uploading PDFs from untrusted sources.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting PDF Features (JavaScript, Embedded Files, External Links)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_pdf_features__javascript__embedded_files__external_links_.md)

**Description:** Malicious actors leverage legitimate PDF features for malicious purposes.

**How Stirling-PDF Contributes:** If Stirling-PDF processes or renders PDFs without proper security considerations for these features, it can become a vector for attack.

**Example:** A PDF contains malicious JavaScript that, if executed during Stirling-PDF's processing, could compromise the server or access sensitive data. Another example is a PDF with an embedded executable that could be extracted if Stirling-PDF doesn't prevent this.

**Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Remote Code Execution (if JavaScript execution is allowed), exfiltration of embedded files, or further exploitation of the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable or strictly control the execution of JavaScript within PDFs processed by Stirling-PDF.
* Implement strict policies regarding the handling of embedded files, preventing automatic extraction or execution.
* Sanitize or block external links within PDFs to prevent SSRF attacks.
* Configure Stirling-PDF to ignore or neutralize potentially dangerous PDF features.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_stirling-pdf_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Stirling-PDF relies on third-party libraries that may contain security vulnerabilities.

**How Stirling-PDF Contributes:** By incorporating these libraries, Stirling-PDF inherits their potential vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a popular PDF parsing library used by Stirling-PDF. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted PDF.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Stirling-PDF and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
* Implement dependency scanning tools to identify and track known vulnerabilities in используемые библиотеки.
* Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
* If possible, explore configuration options within Stirling-PDF to use more secure or hardened versions of dependencies.
