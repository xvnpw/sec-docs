# Threat Model Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Exploitation](./threats/malicious_pdf_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted PDF file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF's PDF parsing libraries. This could involve triggering buffer overflows, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution *within the Stirling-PDF process*.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** PDF Parsing Module (likely within a dependency like Apache PDFBox or similar *used by Stirling-PDF*), potentially specific functions related to object parsing, font handling, or embedded scripts.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on uploaded files, including file type and size checks.
    *   Run Stirling-PDF in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
    *   Keep Stirling-PDF and its dependencies (especially PDF parsing libraries) updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Consider using a dedicated PDF security scanning tool to pre-process uploaded files.

## Threat: [Malicious Image Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted image file (e.g., TIFF, JPEG) that exploits vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF's image processing libraries during conversion to PDF or other image manipulations. This could lead to similar outcomes as malicious PDF exploitation *within the Stirling-PDF process*.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** Image Processing Module (likely within a dependency like ImageIO or similar *used by Stirling-PDF*), potentially functions related to image decoding, format conversion, or metadata handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for image files.
    *   Run Stirling-PDF in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Keep Stirling-PDF and its image processing dependencies updated.
    *   Consider using image security scanning tools.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries.md)

*   **Description:** Stirling-PDF relies on various third-party libraries for PDF parsing, image processing, and other functionalities. These libraries may contain their own vulnerabilities that could be exploited *through Stirling-PDF's use of them*.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:**  Any of the third-party libraries *used by Stirling-PDF* (e.g., Apache PDFBox, ImageIO, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain an inventory of Stirling-PDF's dependencies.
    *   Regularly check for known vulnerabilities in these dependencies using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Keep all dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
