## Attack Tree Path: [2. Arbitrary Code Execution (High Impact, Medium Likelihood)](./attack_tree_paths/2__arbitrary_code_execution__high_impact__medium_likelihood_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most severe threat, as it allows an attacker to gain full control of the server.
*   **Justification:** While exploiting a zero-day is less likely, the potential impact is catastrophic.  Code injection via PDF fields is a more realistic, though still challenging, attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 PDF Injection (Medium Likelihood, High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_pdf_injection__medium_likelihood__high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript into PDF form fields or annotations.
*   **Justification:** This relies on the application not properly sanitizing user-supplied data within the PDF.  If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the server or other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1 Upload a PDF with malicious JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1_upload_a_pdf_with_malicious_javascript.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a PDF with malicious JavaScript embedded in form fields or annotations.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Depends on the application's input validation and sanitization.
*   **Impact:** High.  Could lead to complete server compromise.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires crafting the malicious PDF.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires knowledge of JavaScript and PDF manipulation.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires monitoring for unusual JavaScript execution and potentially analyzing PDF content.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Exploit Vulnerabilities (Low Likelihood, High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_exploit_vulnerabilities__low_likelihood__high_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits a vulnerability in Stirling-PDF or its dependencies (e.g., buffer overflow, XXE).
*   **Justification:** This is less likely without a known vulnerability, but the impact is severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.1 (Hypothetical - Specific Vulnerability)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_1__hypothetical_-_specific_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** Placeholder for a specific vulnerability if one is discovered.  Details would depend on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (until a specific vulnerability is found).
*   **Impact:** High (potential for complete system compromise).
*   **Effort:** High (requires significant research and exploit development).
*   **Skill Level:** High (expert-level vulnerability research and exploitation skills).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High (likely requires advanced intrusion detection and forensic analysis).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Impact, High Likelihood)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos___medium_impact__high_likelihood_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker aims to make the application unavailable by overwhelming it with malicious PDFs.
*   **Justification:** DoS attacks are generally easier to execute than code execution attacks, and PDF processing can be resource-intensive.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Resource Exhaustion (High Likelihood, Medium Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_resource_exhaustion__high_likelihood__medium_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker uploads very large or complex PDFs to consume server resources.
*   **Justification:** This is a common and relatively easy attack to perform.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1.1 Upload a PDF designed to consume excessive memory](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_1_upload_a_pdf_designed_to_consume_excessive_memory.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uploads a PDF with large images, complex operations, or other features designed to consume a large amount of memory.
*   **Likelihood:** High.  Easy to create such PDFs.
*   **Impact:** Medium.  Can cause service disruption or crashes.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Minimal technical skill required.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.  Easily detected through resource monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 PDF Structure Exploitation (Medium Likelihood, Medium Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_pdf_structure_exploitation__medium_likelihood__medium_impact_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker crafts a malformed PDF to trigger parsing errors or infinite loops.
*   **Justification:**  Exploiting parsing vulnerabilities can be more complex than simple resource exhaustion, but still achievable.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1.1 Upload a PDF with thousands of deeply nested objects](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_1_upload_a_pdf_with_thousands_of_deeply_nested_objects.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates a PDF with a deeply nested structure designed to cause parsing issues.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Requires some understanding of PDF structure.
*   **Impact:** Medium. Can cause service disruption or crashes.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires crafting a specifically malformed PDF.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires monitoring for crashes and analyzing malformed PDFs.
