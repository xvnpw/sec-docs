# Deep Analysis: External Resource Fetching (SSRF) in Stirling-PDF

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities within an application leveraging the Stirling-PDF library.  We aim to identify specific code paths, configurations, and library dependencies that could contribute to this vulnerability, and to propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  This analysis will inform development and deployment best practices to minimize the risk of SSRF exploitation.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the SSRF attack surface related to Stirling-PDF.  It encompasses:

*   **Stirling-PDF's core functionality:**  How Stirling-PDF itself handles URLs and external resources, if at all.
*   **Underlying PDF parsing libraries:**  Deep dive into the libraries used by Stirling-PDF (e.g., PDFBox, iText, etc.) to understand their external resource fetching behavior and configuration options.
*   **Application-level integration:** How the application *using* Stirling-PDF might inadvertently introduce or exacerbate SSRF risks.
*   **Configuration settings:**  Examination of relevant configuration options within Stirling-PDF, its dependencies, and the application environment that could impact SSRF vulnerability.
*   **Network interactions:**  Analysis of how network requests are initiated, handled, and validated (or not) within the relevant code paths.

This analysis *excludes* general SSRF vulnerabilities unrelated to Stirling-PDF's functionality (e.g., SSRF in other parts of the application).

## 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be employed:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the Stirling-PDF source code (available on GitHub) for any explicit handling of URLs or external resources.  Look for functions related to fetching, downloading, or embedding content.
    *   Identify the specific PDF parsing libraries used by Stirling-PDF (e.g., by inspecting `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` files).
    *   Analyze the source code of the identified PDF parsing libraries for their external resource handling mechanisms.  Focus on classes and methods related to:
        *   `URL`, `URLConnection`, `HttpClient`, or similar networking classes.
        *   Image loading, font loading, embedded object handling.
        *   XML External Entity (XXE) processing (as XXE can lead to SSRF).
    *   Trace the flow of data from PDF input to potential network requests.
    *   Identify any configuration options related to external resource fetching (e.g., system properties, environment variables, configuration files).

2.  **Dependency Analysis:**
    *   Use dependency analysis tools (e.g., `mvn dependency:tree`, `gradle dependencies`) to identify all transitive dependencies of Stirling-PDF and the chosen PDF parsing library.
    *   Research known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in these dependencies related to SSRF or related issues (e.g., XXE).

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   Craft malicious PDF files containing various SSRF payloads:
        *   URLs pointing to internal network resources (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`, `http://127.0.0.1`, `http://192.168.1.1`).
        *   URLs using different protocols (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`, `gopher://`, `ftp://`).
        *   URLs designed to trigger DNS lookups (to identify if any external resolution is happening).
        *   URLs with encoded characters or unusual formats.
    *   Use a debugging proxy (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to intercept and analyze any network requests made by the application when processing these malicious PDFs.
    *   Monitor system logs and application logs for any errors or warnings related to external resource fetching.

4.  **Configuration Review:**
    *   Identify all relevant configuration files and settings for Stirling-PDF, the PDF parsing library, and the application environment.
    *   Examine these settings for options that control external resource fetching, URL validation, or network access.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Based on the methodology, here's a breakdown of the potential attack surface, focusing on specific areas of concern:

### 4.1. Stirling-PDF's Role

Stirling-PDF, at its core, acts as a wrapper and user interface around underlying PDF processing libraries.  Its *direct* contribution to SSRF is likely minimal *unless* it explicitly implements features that fetch external resources.  However, it's crucial to examine:

*   **Custom URL Handling:**  Does Stirling-PDF have any custom code that parses or manipulates URLs extracted from PDFs *before* passing them to the underlying library?  If so, this code needs careful scrutiny for vulnerabilities.
*   **Configuration Passthrough:**  Does Stirling-PDF expose configuration options that directly control the behavior of the underlying PDF library's resource fetching?  If so, these options need to be documented and secured.
* **UI-Initiated Actions:** Does the Stirling-PDF UI allow users to input URLs or trigger actions that could lead to external resource fetching?

### 4.2. PDF Parsing Library (Critical Area)

This is the most likely source of SSRF vulnerabilities.  The specific library used (PDFBox, iText, etc.) is paramount.  We need to investigate:

*   **PDFBox (Likely Candidate):**
    *   **`PDDocument.load(URL)`:**  This method *directly* fetches a PDF from a URL.  This is a *major* SSRF vector if the URL is derived from user-controlled input (e.g., a PDF containing a link that specifies the URL to load another PDF).
    *   **Embedded Images and Resources:**  PDFBox will attempt to load embedded images and other resources.  If these resources are specified with URLs, and those URLs are attacker-controlled, this is an SSRF vulnerability.
    *   **Fonts:**  PDFBox may fetch fonts from external URLs if the PDF specifies them.
    *   **XFA Forms:**  XML Forms Architecture (XFA) forms can contain scripts and actions that might trigger network requests.
    *   **GoToE and GoToR actions:** These actions can specify external files or URLs.
    *   **Configuration:** PDFBox has various configuration options (system properties) that can affect resource loading.  These need to be identified and locked down.  Examples include:
        *   `org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.common.Resources.STRICT_ERROR_HANDLING`
        *   `pdfbox.fontcache` (controls font caching, potentially influencing external font loading)

*   **iText (Another Likely Candidate):**
    *   **`PdfReader(URL)`:** Similar to PDFBox, iText can load PDFs directly from URLs.
    *   **Image Handling:** iText's image handling mechanisms need to be examined for URL-based resource loading.
    *   **XML Worker:** If iText's XML Worker is used to convert HTML to PDF, this introduces a *significant* SSRF risk, as HTML can easily contain external resource references.
    *   **Configuration:** iText also has configuration options that can influence resource loading.

*   **Other Libraries:**  If Stirling-PDF uses a different library, the same principles apply â€“ identify URL loading mechanisms, resource handling, and configuration options.

### 4.3. Application-Level Integration

Even if Stirling-PDF and the underlying library are configured securely, the application *using* them can introduce SSRF vulnerabilities:

*   **Unvalidated Input:**  If the application takes a URL as input (e.g., "load PDF from this URL") and passes it directly to Stirling-PDF without validation, this is a classic SSRF vulnerability.
*   **Indirect Input:**  If the application allows users to upload PDFs, and those PDFs contain malicious URLs that are then processed by Stirling-PDF, this is an indirect SSRF vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Network Segmentation:**  If the application server running Stirling-PDF has unrestricted network access to internal systems, the impact of an SSRF vulnerability is greatly increased.

### 4.4. Specific Attack Vectors

Here are some specific attack vectors to test:

*   **PDF with Embedded Image pointing to Internal Server:**  Create a PDF with an image tag like `<img src="http://localhost:8080/admin">`.
*   **PDF with a Link to a `file:///` URL:**  Create a PDF with a link like `<a href="file:///etc/passwd">Click here</a>`.
*   **PDF with XFA Form containing a Script to Fetch a URL:**  Use PDF editing tools to create an XFA form with JavaScript that uses `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` to access an internal URL.
*   **PDF with a GoToR Action:** Use a GoToR action to point to an internal resource.
*   **PDF Referencing External Fonts:** Create a PDF that uses fonts hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Chained PDF Loading:** If Stirling-PDF allows loading PDFs from URLs, create a PDF that, when loaded, triggers the loading of *another* PDF from an internal URL.

## 5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Beyond the high-level mitigations, here are more detailed and actionable strategies:

1.  **Disable External Resource Fetching (If Possible):**
    *   **PDFBox:** Investigate system properties and configuration options to completely disable external resource loading.  This might involve disabling features like image loading or font embedding.
    *   **iText:**  Similarly, explore configuration options to disable URL-based loading and external resource handling.
    *   **Stirling-PDF:**  If Stirling-PDF provides any configuration options related to this, use them to disable external fetching.

2.  **Strict URL Whitelisting (If External Fetching is Required):**
    *   **Implement a Deny-by-Default Policy:**  Start with an empty whitelist and only add *absolutely necessary* domains and protocols.
    *   **Use a Robust Whitelist Implementation:**  Don't rely on simple string matching.  Use a proper URL parsing library to validate the scheme, host, and path.  Consider using a dedicated library for URL sanitization.
    *   **Avoid Wildcards:**  Do *not* use wildcards in the whitelist (e.g., `*.example.com`).  Be as specific as possible.
    *   **Regularly Review and Update the Whitelist:**  The whitelist should be treated as a living document and updated as needed.

3.  **Thorough URL Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Parse the URL:**  Use a robust URL parsing library (e.g., `java.net.URL` in Java) to decompose the URL into its components.
    *   **Validate the Scheme:**  Only allow specific schemes (e.g., `https`, `http`).  Reject `file`, `ftp`, `gopher`, etc.
    *   **Validate the Host:**  Check the host against the whitelist (if applicable).  Consider using DNS resolution to verify that the host resolves to an expected IP address (but be aware of DNS rebinding attacks).
    *   **Validate the Path:**  Be wary of path traversal attacks (e.g., `../`).  Sanitize the path to remove any potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Reject Internal IP Addresses:**  Explicitly reject URLs that point to internal IP addresses (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x`).
    *   **Reject Loopback Addresses:** Reject `localhost` and any other loopback addresses.

4.  **Network Segmentation:**
    *   **Isolate the Application Server:**  Run the application server in a separate network segment with restricted access to internal systems.
    *   **Use a Firewall:**  Configure a firewall to block outgoing connections to internal networks, except for explicitly allowed destinations.
    *   **Consider a Reverse Proxy:**  Use a reverse proxy to handle all incoming requests and further restrict access to the application server.

5.  **Input Validation (at the Application Level):**
    *   **Validate All User Input:**  Never trust user-provided URLs or PDF files.
    *   **Sanitize PDF Content:**  Consider using a library to sanitize PDF content *before* passing it to Stirling-PDF.  This could involve removing potentially dangerous elements like scripts or external resource references.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the application and its dependencies.
    *   Perform penetration testing to identify and exploit potential SSRF vulnerabilities.

7.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   Keep all dependencies (including Stirling-PDF and the PDF parsing library) up to date.
    *   Use a dependency management tool to track and manage dependencies.
    *   Monitor for security advisories related to your dependencies.

8.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   Implement comprehensive logging to track all network requests made by the application.
    *   Monitor logs for any suspicious activity, such as requests to internal IP addresses or unusual URLs.

9. **Least Privilege:**
    * Run the application with the least privileges necessary. Avoid running as root or an administrator.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the risk of SSRF vulnerabilities in an application using Stirling-PDF can be significantly reduced. The key is to understand the potential attack vectors, thoroughly validate and sanitize all input, and configure the application and its dependencies securely.
