# Threat Model Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability (PDF Parsing)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability__pdf_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a PDF parsing library used by Stirling-PDF (e.g., PDFBox, iText). The attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerability, such as a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or code injection flaw.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application. Information Disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying PDF parsing libraries (e.g., `org.apache.pdfbox.*`, `com.itextpdf.*` packages, or specific classes within). Affects *all* Stirling-PDF features that parse PDF content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Automated Dependency Updates:** Use tools like Dependabot or Snyk for automatic detection and updates.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies with tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Trivy.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run the PDF processing component in a restricted environment (e.g., Docker container).
        *   **Input Validation (Limited):** Basic input validation (e.g., file size limits) can offer some mitigation.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability (Image Processing)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability__image_processing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an image processing library used by Stirling-PDF for OCR, image extraction, etc.  A malicious PDF with a crafted image triggers the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure – similar to PDF parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying image processing libraries (depends on Stirling-PDF's implementation; may include `java.awt.image.*` or third-party libraries). Affects OCR, image extraction, and potentially PDF rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as for PDF parsing dependency vulnerabilities: automated updates, vulnerability scanning, and sandboxing.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability (OCR)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability__ocr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in OCR libraries used by Stirling-PDF for text recognition. The attacker uploads a PDF containing a malicious image designed to exploit a vulnerability in the OCR library.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure – similar to PDF parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying OCR libraries (specific libraries will depend on Stirling-PDF's implementation and may include libraries like Tesseract).  This affects features like OCR.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Same as for PDF parsing dependency vulnerabilities: automated updates, vulnerability scanning, and potential sandboxing.

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Input (Stirling-PDF Logic Flaw)](./threats/malicious_pdf_input__stirling-pdf_logic_flaw_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a PDF file that exploits a bug *within* Stirling-PDF's own code (not a dependency). This could be a flaw in handling specific PDF features, a buffer overflow, or a logic error.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure, or bypassing security controls within Stirling-PDF.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Stirling-PDF modules and functions that handle PDF parsing, manipulation, and feature processing.  Could be in any part of the codebase that interacts directly with PDF data (e.g., `processAnnotations()`, `extractFormData()`, `parseObject()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sandboxing:** *Crucial* to contain the impact of an exploit.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Integrate fuzz testing (or encourage maintainers to do so).
        *   **Code Review:** Thorough code reviews, focusing on complex PDF structure handling.
        *   **Input Validation (Limited):** Basic input validation can help, but is not a primary defense.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (PDF Bomb)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__pdf_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a "PDF bomb" designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) – e.g., a PDF with deeply nested structures, high-resolution images, or many pages.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
    *   **Affected Component:** All Stirling-PDF components involved in PDF processing. The most affected component depends on the type of PDF bomb.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Size Limits:** Enforce limits on uploaded PDF file size.
        *   **Resource Limits (Per Process/Container):** Configure CPU and memory limits for the PDF processing component.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for all PDF processing operations.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of PDF processing requests per user/IP.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage to detect potential DoS attacks.
