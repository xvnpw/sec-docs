# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Timeouts (Stirling-PDF Operations)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_timeouts__stirling-pdf_operations_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Stirling-PDF API Calls:** List all direct calls to Stirling-PDF functions within your application code (e.g., `splitPDF()`, `mergePDF()`, `extractText()`, `performOCR()`, and any others you use).
2.  **Determine Reasonable Time Limits:** For *each* Stirling-PDF function call, estimate a maximum reasonable processing time. This should be based on factors like expected file size ranges, complexity of operations, and server resources. Start conservatively and adjust based on testing.
3.  **Implement Timeouts Around API Calls:** Wrap *each* individual Stirling-PDF function call in a timeout mechanism provided by your programming language.  If the Stirling-PDF operation exceeds the timeout, forcefully terminate the associated process or release the resources held by the Stirling-PDF library.  This prevents a single, slow operation from blocking the entire application.
4.  **Handle Timeout Exceptions:** Implement robust error handling to catch timeout exceptions that occur when a Stirling-PDF operation is terminated. Log the event, handle the error gracefully, and prevent application crashes.
5. **Regularly review and adjust:** Periodically review the timeout values and adjust them as needed based on performance monitoring and changes in the application or expected input.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) within Stirling-PDF:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from crafting malicious PDFs that cause specific Stirling-PDF operations (splitting, merging, OCR, etc.) to consume excessive CPU or memory, even if the overall file size is within limits.
*   **Hanging Stirling-PDF Processes:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the application from becoming unresponsive due to a Stirling-PDF operation getting stuck on a malformed or complex PDF.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the time any single Stirling-PDF operation can consume.
*   **Hanging Processes:** Eliminates the risk of individual Stirling-PDF operations hanging indefinitely.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Timeout for the `extractText()` function implemented using Python's `concurrent.futures` with a timeout of 30 seconds.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Timeouts are missing for `mergePDF()` and `performOCR()` functions. These need to be added with appropriate timeout values.
*   No granular timeouts based on file size *within* the Stirling-PDF operation wrappers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable JavaScript and Forms (PDFBox Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_javascript_and_forms__pdfbox_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Assess the Need:** Determine if your application's use of Stirling-PDF *requires* JavaScript execution or form handling within the processed PDFs. If these features are not essential, disabling them significantly reduces the attack surface.
2.  **Identify PDFBox Configuration Options:** Stirling-PDF relies on PDFBox.  Consult the PDFBox documentation to find the specific configuration options for disabling JavaScript and form execution.  Common options include:
    *   `PDDocument.setJavaScript(null)` (or equivalent to disable JavaScript)
    *   Settings related to `PDAcroForm` to disable form filling and submission.
3.  **Apply Configuration in Code:** Modify your application code to apply these PDFBox configuration settings *before* passing the PDF document to Stirling-PDF for processing. This ensures that the underlying PDF parsing library operates with these security restrictions.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** After implementing these changes, thoroughly test your application's functionality to ensure that core features are not broken and that PDFs are still processed as expected (without JavaScript or form execution).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious PDF Content (Exploits via PDFBox):** (Severity: High) - Eliminates a large category of PDF-based exploits that rely on malicious JavaScript or form actions to compromise the PDF parsing library (PDFBox) itself.

**Impact:**
*   **Malicious PDF Content:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploits targeting PDFBox, *if* JavaScript and forms are not required for your application's functionality.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   None.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   The application does not currently configure PDFBox to disable JavaScript or forms. This is a missing security measure that should be implemented if the application's functionality permits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Secure Temporary File Handling (Stirling-PDF/PDFBox)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_secure_temporary_file_handling__stirling-pdfpdfbox_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Temporary File Usage:** Determine how Stirling-PDF and, crucially, its underlying PDFBox library, create and manage temporary files during PDF processing. This may involve inspecting the Stirling-PDF and PDFBox source code or documentation.
2.  **Configure a Dedicated Temporary Directory (if possible):** If Stirling-PDF or PDFBox provides configuration options to specify a temporary directory, use this to set a dedicated, secure directory. This directory should:
    *   Be located on a secure partition.
    *   Have restricted permissions (only the user running the application should have access).
    *   Be regularly cleaned up (e.g., via a separate process or system utility).
3.  **Influence Temporary File Permissions (if possible):** If Stirling-PDF or PDFBox allows control over the permissions of created temporary files, ensure they are set to the most restrictive settings possible (e.g., read/write only for the owning user). This might involve modifying Stirling-PDF's code if direct configuration options are not available.
4. **Secure Deletion (if control is possible):** If you have any influence over how Stirling-PDF deletes temporary files (e.g., through callbacks or by modifying its source), ensure secure deletion methods are used that overwrite the file contents to prevent data recovery.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage (from Stirling-PDF's temporary files):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of sensitive data from processed PDFs remaining in temporary files, where it could be accessed by unauthorized users or recovered.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) targeting Stirling-PDF:** (Severity: Medium) - Makes it harder for attackers to exploit LFI vulnerabilities to access or manipulate Stirling-PDF's temporary files.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Reduces the risk of data exposure from temporary files created by Stirling-PDF.
*   **LFI:** Provides some mitigation, but other LFI defenses are also needed.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The application relies on the default temporary file handling of Stirling-PDF and the underlying OS.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No specific configuration of Stirling-PDF or PDFBox's temporary file handling is in place. This should be investigated to determine if any control is possible and, if so, to implement secure settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit OCR Usage (Stirling-PDF Feature Control)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_ocr_usage__stirling-pdf_feature_control_.md)

**Description:**
1. **Assess OCR Necessity:** Determine if OCR is *essential* for all PDF processing within your application. If not, provide mechanisms to control or limit its use.
2. **Provide a Disable Option:** If OCR is not always required, offer a user-configurable option (e.g., a checkbox, an API parameter) to disable OCR processing for specific files or requests.
3. **Conditional OCR:** Implement logic within your application to only invoke Stirling-PDF's OCR functionality when it's truly needed, based on file type, user input, or other criteria. Avoid unnecessary OCR processing.
4. **Separate OCR Processing:** If possible, consider isolating OCR processing into a separate function or service within your application. This allows for more granular control over timeouts, resource limits, and error handling specifically for OCR.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service) targeting OCR:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the attack surface by allowing users or the application to disable OCR when it's not needed, preventing attackers from forcing expensive OCR operations on maliciously crafted images within PDFs.
*   **Performance Issues:** (Severity: Medium) - Improves overall application performance by avoiding unnecessary OCR processing, which is computationally intensive.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces the risk if OCR can be selectively disabled or controlled.
*   **Performance Issues:** Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary OCR.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   OCR is automatically performed on all uploaded PDFs.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No mechanism to disable or conditionally control OCR usage. This should be added to allow users or the application to avoid unnecessary OCR processing.
