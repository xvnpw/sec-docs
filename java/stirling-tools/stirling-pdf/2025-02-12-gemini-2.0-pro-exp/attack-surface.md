# Attack Surface Analysis for stirling-tools/stirling-pdf

## Attack Surface: [Malformed PDF Processing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_pdf_processing.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from the parsing and processing of maliciously crafted PDF documents by Stirling-PDF's underlying libraries.
    *   **Stirling-PDF Contribution:** Stirling-PDF directly uses libraries like PDFBox and iText for PDF parsing, making it the entry point for these attacks.
    *   **Example:** A PDF with deeply nested objects designed to cause a stack overflow in PDFBox, triggered when Stirling-PDF attempts to extract text.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) in severe cases (depending on the underlying library vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the underlying library and vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict limits on PDF file size, page count, and complexity *before* passing to Stirling-PDF.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Keep Stirling-PDF and all its dependencies (PDFBox, iText, etc.) up-to-date with the latest security patches. Use SCA tools.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU and memory usage during PDF processing. Implement timeouts.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run the PDF processing component in a sandboxed environment.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Perform fuzzing on PDF parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Image Processing (OCR and Extraction)](./attack_surfaces/image_processing__ocr_and_extraction_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to the handling of images within PDFs during OCR and image extraction, leveraging Stirling-PDF's integration with external libraries.
    *   **Stirling-PDF Contribution:** Stirling-PDF directly calls OCR libraries (like Tesseract) and image processing libraries, making it the conduit for these exploits.
    *   **Example:** A PDF containing a malformed JPEG image designed to trigger a buffer overflow in Tesseract when Stirling-PDF attempts OCR.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the underlying library and vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Keep OCR and image processing libraries (Tesseract, etc.) up-to-date.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate image dimensions, formats, and sizes before processing.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate the image processing component (especially OCR) in a sandboxed environment.
        *   **Secure Configuration:** Configure OCR engine to limit resource usage.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Perform fuzzing on image processing.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection (OCR)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection__ocr_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerability where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server via the OCR process initiated by Stirling-PDF.
    *   **Stirling-PDF Contribution:** Stirling-PDF directly invokes external OCR tools, making it the vulnerable component if input sanitization is inadequate.
    *   **Example:** Attacker uploads a PDF file with specially crafted text that, when passed to the OCR engine, results in command execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Rigorously sanitize *all* input passed to the OCR engine.  Assume all input is malicious.
        *   **Parameter Allow List:** Use a strict allow list for parameters passed to the OCR engine.  Do not allow arbitrary parameters.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the OCR engine (and ideally, the entire Stirling-PDF process) with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [External Resource Fetching (SSRF) - *Conditional High*](./attack_surfaces/external_resource_fetching__ssrf__-_conditional_high.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerability where Stirling-PDF, or its underlying libraries, can be tricked into making requests to arbitrary URLs based on PDF content.  This is *conditional* because it depends on whether Stirling-PDF or its libraries are configured to fetch external resources.
    *   **Stirling-PDF Contribution:** If Stirling-PDF or its underlying PDF parsing libraries are configured to fetch external resources (e.g., for embedded content or links), it directly creates the SSRF vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A PDF contains a link to `http://internal-server/admin`, and Stirling-PDF's underlying library attempts to fetch this URL.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal systems, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Conditional - only if external resource fetching is enabled).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable External Resource Fetching:** The most secure option is to disable this functionality entirely if it's not essential.
        *   **URL Whitelisting:** If external fetching is required, implement a *strict* whitelist of allowed domains and protocols.
        *   **URL Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any URLs extracted from PDFs before any attempt to fetch them.

## Attack Surface: [Docker Escape](./attack_surfaces/docker_escape.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerability that allows escaping from docker container.
    * **Stirling-PDF Contribution:** Stirling-PDF is often run in docker container. Missconfiguration can lead to docker escape.
    * **Example:** Stirling-PDF is run with `--privileged` flag.
    * **Impact:** Host compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Privileged Mode:** Do not run Stirling-PDF container with `--privileged` flag.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the container with the least necessary privileges.
        * **Secure Configuration:** Follow best practices for docker configuration.
