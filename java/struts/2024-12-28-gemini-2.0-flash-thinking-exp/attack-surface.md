Here's the updated list of high and critical attack surfaces directly involving Apache Struts:

*   **Attack Surface: OGNL Injection (Remote Code Execution)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions into vulnerable input fields or request parameters. When Struts processes these expressions, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **How Struts Contributes:** Struts' core architecture relies heavily on OGNL for data access, type conversion, and expression evaluation. This deep integration makes the framework susceptible when user-provided input is used in OGNL expressions without proper sanitization.
    *   **Example:** A malicious URL like `http://example.com/index.action?redirect:${%23a%3d(new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder(new%20java.lang.String[]{'whoami'})).start(),%23b%3d%23a.getInputStream(),%23c%3dnew%20java.io.InputStreamReader(%23b),%23d%3dnew%20java.io.BufferedReader(%23c),%23out%3d@org.apache.struts2.ServletActionContext@getResponse().getWriter(),%23out.println(%23d.readLine()),%23out.flush(),%23out.close()}` could execute the `whoami` command on the server.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full control of the server, data breach, malware installation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Upgrade Struts:**  Use the latest stable version of Struts, as numerous OGNL injection vulnerabilities have been patched.
        *   **Avoid Direct OGNL Evaluation of User Input:**  Never directly use user-provided input in OGNL expressions.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  While crucial, focus on preventing user input from reaching OGNL evaluation contexts.
        *   **Use Parameter Interceptors with Caution:**  Understand the security implications of parameter interceptors and configure them securely.
        *   **Consider Alternative Expression Languages:** If feasible, explore alternative, safer expression languages.

*   **Attack Surface: Action Mapping and Namespace Manipulation**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the request URL or parameters to access unintended actions or namespaces within the Struts application.
    *   **How Struts Contributes:** Struts' routing mechanism, based on action mappings and namespaces, can be vulnerable if these mappings are not strictly defined and secured. Improper configuration allows attackers to potentially bypass intended access controls.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might modify the URL from `http://example.com/admin/users.action` to `http://example.com/unsecured/sensitiveData.action` if the `unsecured` namespace is accessible due to misconfiguration in `struts.xml`.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of data, bypassing security controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Action Mappings:**  Carefully define and secure action mappings and namespaces in `struts.xml`.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary access to actions and namespaces based on user roles, enforced within Struts configuration.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate user input that influences action or namespace resolution, although the primary defense is secure configuration.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review action mappings and namespace configurations in `struts.xml` for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface: Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI)**
    *   **Description:** Older versions of Struts allowed specifying the method to be executed on an action class through request parameters. If not properly secured, this could allow attackers to invoke arbitrary methods.
    *   **How Struts Contributes:**  Struts' DMI feature, while intended for flexibility, directly introduces the risk of arbitrary method invocation if enabled without strict controls.
    *   **Example:** A request like `http://example.com/user.action?method:deleteUser` could potentially delete a user if the `deleteUser` method is accessible and DMI is enabled without proper restrictions in `struts.xml`.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, potential code execution (depending on the invoked method).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (if enabled)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Dynamic Method Invocation:**  The strongly recommended approach is to disable DMI entirely in `struts.xml`.
        *   **Restrict Allowed Methods:** If DMI is absolutely necessary, explicitly define a limited set of allowed methods in `struts.xml`.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate the method name provided in the request, although disabling DMI is the most effective mitigation.

*   **Attack Surface: REST Plugin Deserialization Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** If the Struts REST plugin is used and handles user-provided data through deserialization (e.g., JSON or XML), vulnerabilities can arise if the deserialization process is not secure. This can lead to remote code execution.
    *   **How Struts Contributes:** The Struts REST plugin's functionality involves handling request bodies and parameters, which might include deserializing untrusted data into Java objects. This deserialization process, if not carefully managed, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload to a Struts REST endpoint. When the REST plugin deserializes this payload, it instantiates malicious objects that execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if REST plugin with vulnerable deserialization is used)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Secure Deserialization Practices:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly. If necessary, use safe deserialization libraries and techniques, and configure the REST plugin to use them.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the structure and content of data received by the REST API before deserialization.
        *   **Upgrade REST Plugin:** Keep the Struts REST plugin updated to the latest version, as vulnerabilities are often patched.
        *   **Consider Alternative Data Formats:** If possible, use data formats that are less prone to deserialization attacks.
