# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-java

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./threats/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Data at Rest
    *   **Description:** An attacker with physical access to the device or server where the Realm database file is stored can directly access and read the contents of the database file because Realm's default storage is not encrypted. They can use tools to browse the file and extract sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data stored within the Realm database is exposed, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, privacy violations, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Core (Storage Engine)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Realm file encryption using `RealmConfiguration.Builder().encryptionKey()` and securely manage the encryption key.

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Concurrent Access Issues](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_concurrent_access_issues.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption due to Concurrent Access Issues
    *   **Description:** Multiple threads or processes within the application attempt to read and write to the Realm database concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms. This can lead to race conditions and data inconsistencies within Realm's data structures, resulting in a corrupted database.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, unexpected behavior, and potential data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Core (Concurrency Control)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Realm's built-in mechanisms for handling concurrency, such as transactions and thread confinement.
        *   Avoid sharing Realm instances across threads without proper synchronization.
        *   Carefully manage the lifecycle of Realm instances.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Sync Traffic (If Using Realm Sync)](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_sync_traffic__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Sync Traffic (If Using Realm Sync)
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the client application and the Realm Object Server. If the connection facilitated by the Realm Sync Client SDK is not properly secured with HTTPS, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially reading or modifying synchronized data managed by Realm.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data being synchronized, potential data manipulation, and compromise of data integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Sync Client SDK
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all communication between the client and the Realm Object Server uses HTTPS with valid TLS certificates.
        *   Implement certificate pinning for added security.

## Threat: [Replay Attacks on Sync Operations (If Using Realm Sync)](./threats/replay_attacks_on_sync_operations__if_using_realm_sync_.md)

*   **Threat:** Replay Attacks on Sync Operations (If Using Realm Sync)
    *   **Description:** An attacker captures valid synchronization requests made by the Realm Sync Client SDK and replays them to the server to perform unauthorized actions or manipulate data. This is possible if the requests lack sufficient protection against replay attacks within the Realm Sync protocol.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification or actions performed on behalf of legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Sync Client SDK (Authentication/Authorization)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement nonce or timestamp-based mechanisms in synchronization requests to prevent replay attacks. (This is generally handled by the Realm Sync protocol, but understanding its limitations is important).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Realm Java Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_realm_java_library_itself.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Realm Java Library Itself
    *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the Realm Java library code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to Realm data, cause crashes within the Realm library, or potentially execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, from data breaches to complete application compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules within the Realm Java library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Realm Java library updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and release notes for Realm Java.

## Threat: [Exposure of Realm Configuration Details](./threats/exposure_of_realm_configuration_details.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Realm Configuration Details
    *   **Description:** Sensitive configuration details for Realm, such as encryption keys or server URLs, are hardcoded in the application or stored insecurely. An attacker who gains access to the application's code or configuration files can retrieve this information, potentially compromising Realm's security features.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of encryption, unauthorized access to the Realm Object Server, and other security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Configuration
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive configuration details.
        *   Store sensitive configuration information securely, such as using environment variables or secure configuration management tools.
        *   Encrypt configuration files if necessary.
