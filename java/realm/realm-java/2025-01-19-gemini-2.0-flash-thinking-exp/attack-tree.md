# Attack Tree Analysis for realm/realm-java

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by the Realm database within the application, potentially leading to data exfiltration, manipulation, or application disruption.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via Realm-Java
    * **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Data Storage Vulnerabilities
        * **[CRITICAL]** Bypass Realm Encryption
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Weak Encryption Key Management
                * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Hardcoded Encryption Key **[CRITICAL]**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Access Unencrypted Realm File **[CRITICAL]**
    * **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Data Access Vulnerabilities
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Logic Errors in Permission Checks **[CRITICAL]**
        * **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Data Corruption via Invalid Input
```


## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Data Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_data_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node represents a broad category of attacks targeting how Realm-Java stores data persistently.
* Successful exploitation can lead to direct access or manipulation of the underlying data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Bypass Realm Encryption](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__bypass_realm_encryption.md)

* This node focuses on techniques to circumvent the encryption protecting the Realm database.
* If successful, the attacker gains access to the plaintext data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Weak Encryption Key Management](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_weak_encryption_key_management.md)

* This path describes scenarios where the encryption key used by Realm-Java is compromised due to poor management practices.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Hardcoded Encryption Key [CRITICAL]:**
        * Description: Encryption key is stored directly in the application code or configuration files.
        * How Realm-Java is Involved: Realm-Java uses this key for encryption/decryption.
        * Impact: High (Full access to sensitive data)
        * Mitigation: Implement secure key storage mechanisms like Android Keystore or equivalent platform-specific solutions. Avoid storing keys directly in code.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Access Unencrypted Realm File [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__access_unencrypted_realm_file__critical_.md)

* Description: The Realm database file is stored without encryption or with inadequate file system permissions.
* How Realm-Java is Involved: Realm-Java creates and manages the database file.
* Impact: High (Full access to sensitive data)
* Mitigation: Always encrypt the Realm database. Ensure proper file system permissions are set to restrict access to the application's data directory.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Effort: Low
* Skill Level: Low to Medium
* Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Data Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_data_access_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node encompasses attacks that bypass intended access controls to read or modify data within the Realm database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Logic Errors in Permission Checks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__logic_errors_in_permission_checks__critical_.md)

* Description: Flaws in the application's code that handles Realm permissions allow unauthorized access to data.
* How Realm-Java is Involved: The application uses Realm-Java's API to define and enforce permissions, but the implementation is flawed.
* Impact: Medium to High (Access to specific data based on the flaw)
* Mitigation: Implement robust and well-tested permission checks. Follow the principle of least privilege.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Effort: Medium
* Skill Level: Medium
* Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Data Corruption via Invalid Input](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__data_corruption_via_invalid_input.md)

* Description: Providing invalid or unexpected data through the application's interface can corrupt the Realm database.
* How Realm-Java is Involved: Realm-Java stores the data.
* Impact: Medium (Application instability, data loss, or denial of service)
* Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization before writing data to Realm.
* Likelihood: Medium
* Effort: Low to Medium
* Skill Level: Low to Medium
* Detection Difficulty: Medium
