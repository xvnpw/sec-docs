# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-java

## Attack Surface: [Local Data Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/local_data_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of the Realm database file stored on the device.

**How Realm-Java Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Realm Java manages a local database file containing application data. If file system permissions are not properly configured, this file can be accessed by malicious actors or other applications on the same device.

**Example:** A malicious application installed on the same device with broad storage permissions reads the unencrypted Realm database file, accessing sensitive user data.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential regulatory violations, data corruption, or application malfunction.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable Realm Encryption:** Utilize Realm's built-in encryption feature to protect the database file at rest.
* **Set Appropriate File System Permissions:** Ensure the Realm database file is stored in a location with restricted access, preventing other applications or unauthorized users from accessing it.

## Attack Surface: [Synchronization Vulnerabilities (if using Realm Sync/Atlas)](./attack_surfaces/synchronization_vulnerabilities__if_using_realm_syncatlas_.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the synchronization process between the application and the Realm Sync server.

**How Realm-Java Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Realm Java handles the communication and data transfer with the Realm Sync server. Weaknesses in this communication or the synchronization protocol can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the network traffic between the application and the Realm Sync server, intercepting and potentially modifying synchronized data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to synchronized data, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS with Certificate Pinning:** Ensure all communication with the Realm Sync server is over HTTPS and implement certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks.
* **Use Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms and enforce proper authorization rules on the Realm Sync server to control access to data.
* **Keep Realm Java Updated:** Regularly update the Realm Java library to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Realm Query Language (RQL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/realm_query_language__rql__injection.md)

**Description:**  Crafting malicious Realm queries by injecting untrusted user input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.

**How Realm-Java Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If user-provided input is directly incorporated into Realm queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, it can lead to RQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a search field in the application to inject malicious RQL, allowing them to retrieve data they are not authorized to access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, potential data modification or deletion.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Parameterize Queries:** Always use parameterized queries when incorporating user input into Realm queries.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in Realm queries.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Less Common, but Possible)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities__less_common__but_possible_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process of Realm objects, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**How Realm-Java Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While less common in typical Realm usage, if Realm objects are serialized and deserialized (e.g., for caching or inter-process communication), vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious actor provides a crafted serialized Realm object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the device.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the device.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if applicable to the application's architecture)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to deserialize Realm objects from untrusted sources.
* **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** If serialization is necessary, use well-vetted and secure serialization libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Native Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/native_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities present in the underlying native libraries that Realm Java relies on.

**How Realm-Java Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Realm Java utilizes native libraries for core functionality. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can directly impact the security of the application.

**Example:** A known buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of the native Realm library, which an attacker can exploit to gain control of the application.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, application crashes, data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Realm Java Updated:** Regularly update the Realm Java library to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the native libraries.
