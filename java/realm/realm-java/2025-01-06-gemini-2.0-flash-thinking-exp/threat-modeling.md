# Threat Model Analysis for realm/realm-java

## Threat: [Local Data Exposure](./threats/local_data_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Local Data Exposure
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's device (e.g., through theft, loss, or malware infection). They can then directly access the Realm database file stored on the device's file system.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data stored within the Realm database is exposed to the attacker. This could include personal information, financial data, application secrets, or any other sensitive information managed by the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Local Realm file (the `.realm` file stored on the device).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable Realm encryption.
        *   Use strong, randomly generated encryption keys.
        *   Securely store the encryption key using Android Keystore or equivalent platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.
        *   Implement device locking mechanisms (PIN, password, biometrics).
        *   Educate users about the risks of device compromise.

## Threat: [Encryption Misconfiguration/Weak Encryption](./threats/encryption_misconfigurationweak_encryption.md)

*   **Threat:** Encryption Misconfiguration/Weak Encryption
    *   **Description:** Developers fail to enable Realm encryption, use a weak or easily guessable encryption key, or improperly implement the encryption setup. An attacker who gains access to the local Realm file can then decrypt it with minimal effort.
    *   **Impact:**  The encryption intended to protect the data is ineffective, leading to the exposure of sensitive information within the Realm database.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm encryption API, Encryption key storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce encryption as a default or mandatory setting.
        *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators to create encryption keys.
        *   Avoid hardcoding encryption keys in the application code.
        *   Follow Realm's documentation for proper encryption setup and key management.
        *   Regularly review and audit encryption implementation.

## Threat: [Key Management Issues](./threats/key_management_issues.md)

*   **Threat:** Key Management Issues
    *   **Description:** The encryption key is stored insecurely (e.g., in shared preferences without encryption, hardcoded in code, transmitted insecurely). An attacker who gains access to the key can then decrypt the Realm database.
    *   **Impact:**  The encryption is bypassed, leading to the exposure of sensitive data stored within the Realm database.
    *   **Affected Component:** Encryption key storage, Application code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms like Android Keystore or iOS Keychain for storing encryption keys.
        *   Avoid storing keys in easily accessible locations like shared preferences or application code.
        *   If transmitting keys is necessary (which should be avoided if possible), use secure channels (e.g., TLS/SSL).

## Threat: [Schema Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./threats/schema_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Schema Manipulation Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If the application allows dynamic schema modifications based on user input or external data, vulnerabilities in Realm's schema migration process could be exploited to corrupt data, cause application crashes, or potentially execute arbitrary code (though less likely with Realm Java).
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, the application becomes unstable, or in severe cases, the attacker gains control over the application's execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm schema migration API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid allowing dynamic schema modifications based on untrusted input.
        *   Carefully validate any data used in schema migrations.
        *   Thoroughly test schema migration logic.
        *   Keep the Realm SDK updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Threat: [SDK Vulnerabilities](./threats/sdk_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** SDK Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**  The Realm Java SDK itself contains undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they are present in the application's dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**  A wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including data breaches, denial of service, or even remote code execution (though less likely with Realm Java).
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm Java SDK.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Realm Java SDK updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in Realm Java.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion](./threats/resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** Improper use of Realm objects, large datasets, or unoptimized queries can lead to excessive memory consumption, CPU usage, or disk I/O, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive. An attacker could intentionally trigger these scenarios.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, poor user experience.
    *   **Affected Component:** Realm query engine, Object management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Optimize Realm queries to fetch only necessary data.
        *   Use asynchronous operations for long-running Realm tasks.
        *   Implement pagination or other techniques for handling large datasets.
        *   Monitor application resource usage.
