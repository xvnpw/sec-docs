# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-java

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Unencrypted Data in Local Storage](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_unencrypted_data_in_local_storage.md)

*   **Description:** If Realm encryption is not enabled, sensitive data stored within the `.realm` file is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the device is compromised.
    *   **How Realm-Java Contributes:** Realm Java, by default, stores data unencrypted in the local file system. The responsibility for enabling encryption lies with the developer.
    *   **Example:** An attacker who gains physical access to an unlocked device or compromises the device through malware could access the unencrypted `.realm` file and read sensitive user data.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), financial data theft, violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Realm Encryption:** This is the primary mitigation. Ensure encryption is enabled from the start of development and that the encryption key is managed securely.
        *   **Minimize Stored Sensitive Data:** Only store necessary sensitive data locally. Consider alternative storage solutions for highly sensitive information.
        *   **Data Masking/Obfuscation:** If full encryption is not feasible for certain data, consider masking or obfuscating sensitive fields.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Realm Synchronization (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_realm_synchronization__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If Realm Synchronization is used and the communication channel between the client and the Realm Object Server (or Realm Cloud) is not properly secured, an attacker could intercept and potentially modify synchronization traffic.
    *   **How Realm-Java Contributes:** Realm Java handles the client-side of the synchronization process. If the developer doesn't configure secure communication, the library will use the provided configuration, which might be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as a user could intercept synchronization traffic and potentially modify data being sent to the server or read data being received.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access to synchronized data, potential compromise of other users sharing the same Realm.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure that all communication with the Realm Object Server or Realm Cloud uses HTTPS with strong TLS configurations.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks even if a trusted Certificate Authority is compromised.
        *   **Secure Network Practices:** Educate users about the risks of using public and unsecured Wi-Fi networks.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the Underlying Native Realm Core](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_underlying_native_realm_core.md)

*   **Description:** Realm Java relies on a native C++ core. Vulnerabilities within this core could be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **How Realm-Java Contributes:** Realm Java acts as a wrapper around this native core, exposing its functionality. Any security flaws in the core directly impact applications using Realm Java.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the native core could be exploited by sending specially crafted data to the Realm library, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, arbitrary code execution, data corruption, potential device compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (depending on the specific vulnerability), can be Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Realm Java Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of Realm Java to benefit from security patches and bug fixes in the native core.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories related to Realm and its dependencies.
