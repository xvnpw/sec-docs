## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Realm Data (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_realm_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Local Storage Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **Weak or No Encryption (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The Realm database file is stored on the device's file system without encryption or with a trivially weak encryption key.
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains access to the device's file system (e.g., through rooting/jailbreaking, physical access, or OS vulnerabilities) and directly reads the unencrypted or easily decrypted Realm database file.
        *   **Impact:** Complete exposure of all data stored within the Realm database.

*   **Exploit Synchronization Vulnerabilities (If Realm Object Server is used)**
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Flaws exist in the authentication mechanisms or permission models of the Realm Object Server.
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits these flaws to gain unauthorized access to data they should not be able to see or modify, potentially impersonating legitimate users or bypassing permission checks.
        *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data belonging to other users or the ability to perform actions on their behalf.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack (HIGH-RISK PATH if HTTPS is weak):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Communication between the application and the Realm Object Server is not properly secured using HTTPS, or there are vulnerabilities in the HTTPS implementation.
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the server, potentially decrypting and viewing the data being transmitted, including sensitive information and authentication credentials.
        *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data in transit, potential compromise of authentication credentials, and the ability to manipulate data being synchronized.

*   **Exploit Realm API Misuse (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **Insecure Query Construction (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application constructs Realm queries dynamically based on user input without proper sanitization or parameterization.
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used to build a query, bypasses intended access controls, allowing them to retrieve data they should not have access to.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data through manipulated queries.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application does not properly validate user input before using it in Realm queries or storing it in the database.
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker provides malicious input that is stored in Realm and later retrieved or used in queries, potentially leading to data exposure or other vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data due to the retrieval of malicious input, or the ability to inject malicious data into the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify or Corrupt Realm Data (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_or_corrupt_realm_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Local Storage Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **Directly modify Realm database files (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the device's file system.
        *   **Attacker Action:** The attacker directly modifies the Realm database file, altering or corrupting the data stored within.
        *   **Impact:** Tampering with sensitive data, potentially leading to application malfunction, data loss, or the introduction of malicious information.

*   **Exploit Realm API Misuse (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **Data Tampering through API (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application allows data modification through the Realm API without proper authorization checks.
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker, having gained some level of access or by exploiting API vulnerabilities, uses API calls to directly modify sensitive data within the Realm database.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of critical data, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, or manipulation of application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Exploit Synchronization Vulnerabilities (If Realm Object Server is used) (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
    *   **Flood the server with malicious sync requests (CRITICAL NODE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The Realm Object Server lacks sufficient rate limiting or request validation mechanisms.
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker sends a large volume of malicious or invalid synchronization requests to the server, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
        *   **Impact:** Inability for users to access or synchronize data, potentially causing significant disruption to the application's functionality.
