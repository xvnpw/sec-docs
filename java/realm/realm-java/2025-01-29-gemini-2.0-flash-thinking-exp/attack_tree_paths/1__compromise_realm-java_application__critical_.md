        4. **Data Manipulation or Access:**  Injected query allows unauthorized data modification or access.
    * **Impact:** Integrity and potentially Confidentiality breach - potential for data manipulation and unauthorized data access.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Parameterized Queries/Safe Query Construction:**  Use Realm's API in a way that minimizes or eliminates the need for dynamic string concatenation when building queries. Explore if Realm provides mechanisms for parameterized queries or safe query builders.
        * **Input Validation & Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs used in query construction.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege (Querying):** Design queries to retrieve only the necessary data and avoid overly broad queries that could be exploited.

**4.3. Denial of Service (DoS) - Disrupting Application Availability [MEDIUM to HIGH Impact depending on application criticality]**

* **4.3.1. Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Realm Operations:**
    * **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious requests or inputs that cause the application to perform resource-intensive Realm operations, leading to performance degradation or application crashes. This could involve creating excessively large datasets, triggering complex queries, or exploiting inefficient Realm operations.
    * **Attack Vector:**
        1. **Identify Resource-Intensive Operations:** Attacker analyzes application behavior to identify Realm operations that consume significant resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
        2. **Trigger Malicious Operations:** Attacker sends crafted requests or inputs to trigger these resource-intensive operations repeatedly or at scale.
        3. **Resource Exhaustion:** Application resources are exhausted, leading to slow performance, crashes, or denial of service.
