# SECURITY POSTURE

Security Controls:
- security control: Code Reviews: The project is hosted on GitHub, suggesting that code reviews are likely part of the development process, although not explicitly stated in the repository. Implementation location: GitHub Pull Requests.
- security control: Open Source: Being open source allows for community scrutiny and potential identification of security vulnerabilities. Implementation location: GitHub Repository.
- security control: Issue Tracking: GitHub Issues are used for bug reporting and feature requests, which can include security-related issues. Implementation location: GitHub Issues.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential delays in security patch releases due to the open-source development model.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not immediately identified or addressed.
- accepted risk: Security misconfigurations by developers using Realm Java in their applications.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Security Scanning: Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) and dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Penetration Testing: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits by external security experts to identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Security Champions: Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
- security control: Security Training: Provide security training to developers and contributors on secure coding practices and common mobile security threats.
- security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers and users on how to report security issues responsibly.
- security control: Incident Response Plan: Develop an incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively and minimize their impact.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Realm Java itself does not handle user authentication directly, as it is a local database. Applications using Realm Java are responsible for implementing their own authentication mechanisms to control access to the application and its features.
    - Requirement: Consider integration with device-level authentication mechanisms (e.g., biometrics, device lock) for enhanced security of locally stored data.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Realm Java should provide mechanisms for fine-grained access control to data within the database. This may involve defining roles and permissions to restrict access to specific data objects or fields based on user roles or application logic.
    - Requirement: Ensure that default configurations are secure and do not grant excessive permissions.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Realm Java should perform input validation to prevent injection attacks and data corruption. This includes validating data types, formats, and ranges before storing data in the database.
    - Requirement: Applications using Realm Java should also implement input validation at the application level to sanitize user inputs before passing them to Realm Java.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Data at Rest Encryption: Realm Java should provide built-in support for encrypting data at rest to protect sensitive information stored locally on the device. This encryption should be robust and use industry-standard encryption algorithms.
    - Requirement: Data in Transit Encryption: If Realm Java supports data synchronization with a backend service, ensure that data in transit is encrypted using secure protocols such as TLS/SSL.
    - Requirement: Secure Key Management: Implement secure key management practices for encryption keys, ensuring that keys are stored securely and are not easily accessible to unauthorized users or processes.

    style F fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code, fix bugs, and add features for Realm Java.
2. Version Control System (GitHub): Code changes are committed and pushed to the GitHub repository, which acts as the version control system.
3. CI/CD System (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used as the CI/CD system. Pushing code changes to the repository triggers automated build pipelines defined in GitHub Actions workflows.
4. Build Environment: A dedicated build environment is set up by GitHub Actions. This environment includes necessary tools like Java SDK, Android SDK, Gradle, and potentially native build tools.
5. Build & Test: The build process involves compiling Java and potentially native code, running unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
6. Static Analysis & Security Scans: Static analysis tools (e.g., linters, SAST scanners) are integrated into the build pipeline to automatically check the code for potential bugs, code style violations, and security vulnerabilities. Dependency scanning is also performed to identify vulnerable dependencies.
7. Compile & Package: If tests and security scans pass, the code is compiled and packaged into build artifacts, typically JAR (Java Archive) and AAR (Android Archive) files for Realm Java.
8. Artifact Repository (Maven Central): The build artifacts are published to an artifact repository like Maven Central, making them available for developers to download and use in their projects.

Build Security Controls:
- security control: Secure Build Environment: Using a clean and controlled build environment provided by GitHub Actions reduces the risk of build contamination.
- security control: Automated Build Process: Automation through GitHub Actions ensures consistency and repeatability of the build process, reducing manual errors.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integration of SAST tools in the build pipeline helps identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code before release.
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Automated dependency scanning tools check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Realm Java.
- security control: Code Signing: Build artifacts are likely signed to ensure integrity and authenticity, although this needs to be confirmed by examining the build process details.
- security control: Access Control to Build System: Access to the GitHub repository and GitHub Actions workflows should be restricted to authorized personnel to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process.
- security control: Build Artifact Integrity: Publishing to a trusted artifact repository like Maven Central helps ensure the integrity and authenticity of the released artifacts.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Providing reliable and performant local data storage for mobile applications.
- Ensuring data integrity and preventing data loss or corruption in mobile applications using Realm Java.
- Maintaining developer trust and adoption of Realm Java as a secure and dependable mobile database solution.

Data to Protect:
- Source code of Realm Java: Sensitivity: High (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in the library itself.
- Build artifacts (JAR/AAR): Sensitivity: High (Integrity, Availability). Compromised artifacts could introduce vulnerabilities into applications using Realm Java.
- User data stored in Realm databases by applications: Sensitivity: Varies (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Sensitivity depends on the type of data stored by applications using Realm Java. Could range from low (application settings) to high (personal identifiable information, financial data).
- Intellectual property and proprietary algorithms within Realm Java: Sensitivity: High (Confidentiality, Integrity).

Data Sensitivity Levels:
- Public: Realm Java source code (open source).
- Internal: Build process details, internal documentation, issue tracker information.
- Confidential: Potential proprietary algorithms, security vulnerability details before public disclosure, user data stored by applications (sensitivity depends on application context).
