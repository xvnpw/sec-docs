## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Realm-Java Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_realm-java_application__critical_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing harm to the application and its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Realm-Java Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_realm-java_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting inherent weaknesses within the Realm-Java library itself.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Discovering and exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in specific Realm-Java versions.
        *   Reverse engineering Realm-Java to identify undocumented vulnerabilities in the Java or native C++ code.
        *   Fuzzing Realm-Java APIs with malformed or unexpected inputs to trigger crashes or exploitable conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Code Execution [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__code_execution__critical_.md)

*   This is a high-impact attack where the attacker aims to execute arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) in the native C++ core of Realm-Java.
        *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in JNI (Java Native Interface) interactions between Java and native code.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in any third-party native libraries used by Realm-Java.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Native Code Vulnerabilities (JNI/C++) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__native_code_vulnerabilities__jnic++___critical_.md)

*   This is a specific type of code execution vulnerability residing in the native C++ component of Realm-Java.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Buffer Overflows:** Sending overly long strings or data that exceeds buffer boundaries in C++ code, leading to memory corruption and potential code execution.
        *   **Integer Overflows:** Triggering integer overflows in C++ calculations that can lead to unexpected behavior and memory corruption.
        *   **Use-After-Free:** Exploiting memory management errors where freed memory is accessed again, potentially allowing for code execution.
        *   **Format String Vulnerabilities:** If C++ code uses format strings with user-controlled input without proper sanitization, it could lead to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Application Misuse of Realm-Java [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_application_misuse_of_realm-java__critical_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how developers incorrectly or insecurely use Realm-Java in their application code.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Analyzing application code for insecure Realm-Java usage patterns.
        *   Testing application workflows and data handling logic to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Data Breach [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6__data_breach__critical_.md)

*   This attack aims to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the Realm database.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Gaining unauthorized access to the Realm database file on the device's file system.
        *   Exploiting insecure data handling practices within the application to access data.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Realm File Access Vulnerability [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/7__realm_file_access_vulnerability__critical_.md)

*   This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the physical Realm database file.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Local File System Access:** If the device is rooted/jailbroken or if the application stores the Realm file in a publicly accessible location, an attacker with local access can copy or read the file.
        *   **Backup Exploitation:** If application backups (e.g., Android backups) include the Realm file and are not properly secured, an attacker can extract the file from a compromised backup.
        *   **Path Traversal (Application Logic):** If application code handles file paths related to Realm operations based on user input without proper validation, path traversal vulnerabilities could allow access to the Realm file.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Insecure Data Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/8__insecure_data_handling__critical_.md)

*   This refers to application-level failures to protect sensitive data stored in Realm.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Code Review:** Analyzing application code to identify instances where sensitive data is stored in Realm without encryption.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Using static analysis tools to detect potential plaintext storage of sensitive data.
        *   **Dynamic Analysis:** Observing data stored in the Realm file during runtime to confirm plaintext storage of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Storing Sensitive Data in Plaintext [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/9__storing_sensitive_data_in_plaintext__critical_.md)

*   This is a specific type of insecure data handling where sensitive information is stored directly in Realm without any encryption.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Directly accessing the Realm file (via Realm File Access Vulnerability) and reading the plaintext sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Lack of Encryption [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/10__lack_of_encryption__critical_.md)

*   This refers to the absence of any encryption mechanism for sensitive data within Realm, making it vulnerable if the Realm file is accessed.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Directly accessing the Realm file (via Realm File Access Vulnerability) and reading all data, including sensitive information, as it is not encrypted.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Injection Attacks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/11__injection_attacks__critical_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities where user-controlled input is used to construct Realm queries without proper sanitization.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Analyzing application code for dynamic Realm query construction using user input.
        *   Fuzzing application inputs that are used in Realm queries to identify injection points.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Realm Query Injection (Realm Query Language) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/12__realm_query_injection__realm_query_language___critical_.md)

*   This is a specific type of injection attack targeting Realm Query Language.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Malicious Query Input:** Providing crafted input to application fields that are used to build Realm queries. This input is designed to manipulate the query logic and bypass intended access controls or retrieve unauthorized data.
        *   **Exploiting Dynamic Query Construction:** If application code concatenates user input directly into Realm query strings, attackers can inject malicious query fragments.
        *   **Bypassing Authentication/Authorization:** Injecting query conditions that bypass authentication or authorization checks, allowing access to data that should be restricted.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Crafting queries to retrieve and potentially exfiltrate large amounts of sensitive data from the Realm database.
