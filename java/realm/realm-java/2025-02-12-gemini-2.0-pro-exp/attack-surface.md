# Attack Surface Analysis for realm/realm-java

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Access (File System - Unencrypted or Weakly Encrypted)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_access__file_system_-_unencrypted_or_weakly_encrypted_.md)

*   **Description:** Direct access to the Realm database file (`.realm`) on the device, bypassing application security, when encryption is not used or the key is easily compromised.
*   **Realm-Java Contribution:** Realm Java is responsible for creating and managing the `.realm` file on the local file system. The library *provides* the encryption feature, but its *use and secure configuration are the developer's responsibility*.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains root access to a device and copies the unencrypted `.realm` file. Or, the application stores the Realm file in a publicly accessible directory.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all data stored in the Realm database.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if encryption is not used), High (if encryption is used, but key management is weak).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Encryption:** *Always* enable Realm's built-in encryption.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Store the encryption key in a secure location (Android Keystore, hardware-backed security). *Never* hardcode the key.
    *   **Proper File Permissions:** Use the most restrictive file permissions. On Android, use internal storage. Avoid external storage.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Encryption Key Management](./attack_surfaces/weak_encryption_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure handling of the encryption key, making it vulnerable to discovery or brute-forcing.
*   **Realm-Java Contribution:** Realm Java provides the API for encryption, but the *developer is entirely responsible for secure key management*. This is a direct consequence of using the Realm encryption feature.
*   **Example:** The key is hardcoded, stored in plain text, or derived using a weak password and predictable salt.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who obtains the key decrypts the entire database, negating encryption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Key Generation:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator.
    *   **Secure Key Storage:** Use platform-specific secure key storage (Android Keystore, iOS Keychain).
    *   **Strong KDF:** If deriving from a password, use a strong KDF (PBKDF2, Argon2) with a high iteration count and random salt.
    *   **Key Rotation:** Implement a key rotation strategy.
    *   **Never Hardcode:** Absolutely avoid hardcoding keys.

## Attack Surface: [Data Synchronization Vulnerabilities (Realm Sync / Atlas Device Sync - Authentication/Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/data_synchronization_vulnerabilities__realm_sync__atlas_device_sync_-_authenticationauthorization_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of weaknesses in the *authentication and authorization* mechanisms of Realm Sync/Atlas Device Sync, leading to unauthorized data access.
*   **Realm-Java Contribution:** The Realm Java SDK provides the client-side interface for interacting with Realm Sync.  The *correct configuration and use of authentication and authorization features within the SDK are crucial*.  Misuse directly impacts security.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker uses compromised credentials to access synchronized data.
    *   Misconfigured Flexible Sync permissions allow unauthorized data access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to, modification of, or deletion of synchronized data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data sensitivity and the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure Flexible Sync permissions and roles to grant *only* the minimum necessary access.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Atlas Device Sync configuration and client application.
    *   **Use App Services Authentication:** Leverage MongoDB Atlas App Services authentication for robust user management.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Asynchronous Operation Handling (Leading to Data Corruption)](./attack_surfaces/improper_asynchronous_operation_handling__leading_to_data_corruption_.md)

* **Description:** Incorrect management of Realm's asynchronous operations, specifically leading to *data corruption* due to race conditions or improper transaction handling.
* **Realm-Java Contribution:** Realm Java provides asynchronous APIs. Incorrect *use* of these APIs by the developer directly causes this risk.
* **Example:** Multiple threads attempt to write to the same Realm objects concurrently without proper synchronization (using Realm's thread-safe APIs), leading to inconsistent data or a corrupted Realm file.  Or, an asynchronous write transaction is started, but a crash occurs before it's properly committed or rolled back, leaving the database in an inconsistent state.
* **Impact:** Data loss or corruption, potentially rendering the database unusable.
* **Risk Severity:** High.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Proper Resource Management:** Always close Realm instances when no longer needed. Use `try-finally` or Kotlin's `use`.
    * **Thread Safety:** Understand Realm's threading model. Use background threads appropriately and Realm's thread-safe APIs for cross-thread access.
    * **Transaction Management:** Use Realm's transaction APIs correctly. Ensure transactions are properly committed or rolled back, even in asynchronous operations. Handle exceptions appropriately.
    * **Use `executeTransactionAsync` Correctly:** Utilize asynchronous transaction methods and handle success/error callbacks meticulously.
