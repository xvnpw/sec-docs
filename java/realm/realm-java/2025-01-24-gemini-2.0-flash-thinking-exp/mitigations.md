# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for realm/realm-java

## Mitigation Strategy: [Realm Database Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/realm_database_encryption.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate a 64-byte random encryption key:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create a 64-byte (512-bit) key.  Avoid predictable methods.
    2.  **Initialize Realm Configuration:** When setting up Realm, use `RealmConfiguration.Builder`.
    3.  **Set Encryption Key:** Call the `.encryptionKey(key)` method on the `RealmConfiguration.Builder` instance, providing the generated 64-byte key as a `byte[]`.
    4.  **Build Configuration:** Finalize the configuration by calling `.build()`.
    5.  **Open Realm with Configuration:** Use the built `RealmConfiguration` when opening Realm instances using `Realm.getInstance(config)`.
    6.  **Key Storage:** Securely store the encryption key (see separate "Securely Manage Encryption Keys" mitigation strategy, although key management itself is a broader topic, its direct application to Realm encryption is relevant here).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach due to device loss or theft (Severity: High) - If a device is lost or stolen, the data within the Realm database remains encrypted and inaccessible without the key.
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data on compromised device (Severity: High) - If a device is compromised by malware or unauthorized access, the encrypted Realm database protects data confidentiality.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach due to device loss or theft: Significantly Reduces
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data on compromised device: Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the `RealmDatabaseManager` class during application startup.
*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Fully Implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Fine-Grained Access Control within Application Logic](./mitigation_strategies/implement_fine-grained_access_control_within_application_logic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define User Roles and Permissions:** Identify different user roles within the application and define the data and actions each role is permitted to access or perform within the context of Realm data.
    2.  **Implement Role-Based Checks:** In your application code, before accessing or modifying Realm data using Realm APIs, check the current user's role and permissions.
    3.  **Data Scoping with Realm Queries:** Use Realm queries with appropriate filters and conditions to retrieve only the data relevant to the current user's role. Leverage Realm's query capabilities to limit data access.
    4.  **Object-Level Permission Logic (Application Enforced):**  For sensitive Realm objects or fields, implement explicit checks in your application code to ensure the user has permission to access or modify that specific object or field before interacting with it through Realm APIs.
    5.  **Enforce Access Control in all Realm Data Access Points:** Ensure access control checks are consistently applied throughout the application wherever Realm data is accessed or modified using Realm API calls.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access within the Application (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents users or application components from accessing Realm data they are not authorized to see or modify through Realm API calls.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of users or components gaining access to higher levels of Realm data or functionality than intended, when interacting with Realm.
    *   Data Integrity Issues due to unintended modifications (Severity: Medium) - Limits the scope of potential accidental or malicious Realm data modifications through application logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access within the Application: Significantly Reduces
    *   Privilege Escalation: Moderately Reduces
    *   Data Integrity Issues due to unintended modifications: Moderately Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Role-based access control is implemented for UI elements, but data access checks in data layer using Realm queries are still under development.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Data access control checks need to be fully implemented in the data layer (repositories, data sources) to enforce permissions before querying or modifying Realm data. Object-level permission logic for Realm objects is not yet implemented and needs to be designed and added for highly sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Data Input and Output](./mitigation_strategies/validate_data_input_and_output.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Input Validation (Before Storing in Realm):**
        *   **Define Validation Rules:** For each field in your Realm objects, define validation rules (e.g., data type, length, format, allowed values, ranges) that are relevant to Realm's data types and constraints.
        *   **Implement Validation Logic:** Before writing data to Realm using Realm API, implement validation logic to check if the input data conforms to the defined rules. This should happen before `realm.copyToRealm()` or `realm.createObject()`.
        *   **Handle Validation Errors:** If validation fails, reject the input and prevent it from being stored in Realm. Provide informative error messages or log errors.
    2.  **Output Sanitization (When Retrieving from Realm, if applicable):**
        *   **Identify Output Contexts:** Determine where data retrieved from Realm is displayed or used (e.g., UI text views, web views, external APIs).
        *   **Sanitize for Specific Contexts:** If data from Realm is used in contexts susceptible to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., web views), sanitize the output *after* retrieving it from Realm but *before* using it in the vulnerable context.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues within Realm (Severity: Medium) - Prevents invalid or malformed data from being stored in Realm, maintaining data consistency within the Realm database.
    *   Application Errors and Crashes (Severity: Low to Medium) - Reduces the likelihood of application errors caused by unexpected or invalid data retrieved from Realm.
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium, if output from Realm is not sanitized and used in vulnerable contexts) - Prevents injection attacks if output sanitization of Realm data is necessary and implemented.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Integrity Issues within Realm: Moderately Reduces
    *   Application Errors and Crashes: Moderately Reduces
    *   Injection Vulnerabilities: Moderately Reduces (if applicable)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Input validation is partially implemented in UI input forms, but not consistently applied across all data input points that eventually write to Realm. Output sanitization of data retrieved from Realm is not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input validation needs to be implemented consistently across all data input points that interact with Realm, including background processes and API integrations, *before* data is persisted to Realm. Output sanitization needs to be assessed and implemented for contexts where Realm data is displayed in web views or used in external systems after retrieval from Realm.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Review and Audit Realm Schema and Data Model](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_review_and_audit_realm_schema_and_data_model.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Reviews:** Establish a schedule for periodic reviews of the Realm schema (`RealmModule` definitions, Realm object classes) and data model (how Realm objects are structured and related).
    2.  **Schema Review Checklist (Realm Specific):** Create a checklist for schema reviews, specifically considering Realm's schema features:
        *   Are all Realm object fields necessary and justified?
        *   Is sensitive data minimized in the Realm schema and stored only when required?
        *   Are Realm data types appropriate for the data being stored in Realm?
        *   Are Realm object relationships correctly defined and secure in terms of data access and integrity within Realm?
        *   Are there any overly permissive Realm schema designs that could expose data unnecessarily within the Realm database?
    3.  **Data Model Audit Checklist (Realm Context):** Create a checklist for data model audits, focusing on how data is organized and accessed within Realm:
        *   Is the Realm data model aligned with the principle of least privilege in terms of data access patterns within the application using Realm?
        *   Are there opportunities to improve access control within the application through Realm schema changes or Realm data restructuring?
        *   Are there any potential data leakage points in how Realm data is accessed and used within the application?
        *   Is the Realm data model designed to support future security requirements related to data stored in Realm?
    4.  **Document Review Findings:** Document the findings of each Realm schema and data model review, including identified issues and recommended improvements related to Realm usage.
    5.  **Implement Improvements:** Prioritize and implement the recommended improvements to the Realm schema and data model based on the review findings, focusing on changes within Realm object definitions and data access patterns.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Exposure due to Realm schema vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium) - Prevents unintentional data exposure caused by a poorly designed or overly permissive Realm schema.
    *   Access Control Weaknesses related to Realm data model design (Severity: Medium) - Identifies and addresses weaknesses in application-level access control arising from the structure of the Realm data model.
    *   Future Security Risks related to Realm usage (Severity: Low to Medium) - Proactive reviews help anticipate and mitigate potential future security risks related to data storage and access within Realm.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure due to Realm schema vulnerabilities: Moderately Reduces
    *   Access Control Weaknesses related to Realm data model design: Moderately Reduces
    *   Future Security Risks related to Realm usage: Minimally to Moderately Reduces (proactive measure)
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, Realm schema and data model reviews are not currently performed regularly.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to establish a process for regular Realm schema and data model reviews, including creating Realm-specific checklists, scheduling reviews, documenting findings, and implementing improvements related to Realm.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Realm Java Library Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_realm_java_library_up-to-date.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Realm Releases:** Regularly check for new releases of the Realm Java library on the official Realm website, GitHub repository, or through dependency management tools.
    2.  **Review Realm Release Notes:** When a new version is released, carefully review the Realm release notes to identify bug fixes, new features, and, most importantly, security patches specifically for Realm Java.
    3.  **Update Realm Dependency:** Update the Realm Java dependency in your project's build file to the latest stable version.
    4.  **Test Realm Integration After Update:** After updating Realm, thoroughly test your application's functionality that uses Realm to ensure compatibility and that no regressions have been introduced in Realm integration. Pay special attention to areas that directly interact with Realm APIs.
    5.  **Establish Realm Update Cadence:** Define a regular cadence for checking and applying Realm updates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Realm Library Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical) - Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known security vulnerabilities present in older versions of Realm Java.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Realm Library Vulnerabilities: Significantly Reduces
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of updates, but a formal process for regular Realm updates and testing of Realm integration is missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Need to establish a formal process for regularly monitoring Realm releases, reviewing Realm release notes, updating the Realm library dependency, and performing post-update testing specifically focused on Realm integration within the application.
