# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apolloconfig/apollo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Apollo Portal Access](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_apollo_portal_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify the authentication mechanism used for Apollo Portal (e.g., local accounts, LDAP, OAuth).
    2.  If using local accounts, enable MFA if Apollo Portal supports it directly (check Apollo documentation for MFA capabilities).
    3.  If integrated with an Identity Provider (IdP) like LDAP or OAuth, configure MFA within the IdP.
    4.  Enforce MFA for all users accessing the Apollo Portal, especially administrators and configuration managers.
    5.  Educate users on how to set up and use MFA.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Apollo Portal (Severity: High) - Attackers gaining access to manage configurations within Apollo.
    *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks (Severity: Medium) - Attackers trying to guess or reuse compromised credentials to access Apollo Portal.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Apollo Portal: Significantly Reduced
    *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks: Significantly Reduced
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the development environment using local accounts with basic password policies.
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA is not enabled for production and staging environments.  Integration with corporate IdP for SSO and MFA is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Apollo Admin Service and Portal](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_apollo_admin_service_and_portal.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define clear roles within Apollo based on responsibilities (e.g., Administrator, Config Manager, Read-Only User, Developer).
    2.  Utilize Apollo's RBAC features to create these roles and assign specific permissions to each role (e.g., create namespace, modify configuration, view configuration).
    3.  Assign users to roles based on the principle of least privilege.  Grant only the necessary permissions for their job function within Apollo.
    4.  Regularly review and audit role assignments to ensure they are still appropriate within Apollo.
    5.  Document the Apollo RBAC model and roles for clarity and maintainability.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Modification within Apollo (Severity: High) - Users with excessive permissions accidentally or maliciously altering critical configurations in Apollo.
    *   Privilege Escalation within Apollo (Severity: Medium) - Attackers exploiting compromised accounts to gain higher privileges within Apollo.
    *   Data Breach via Configuration Exposure within Apollo (Severity: Medium) - Unauthorized users accessing sensitive configurations they shouldn't see within Apollo.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Modification within Apollo: Significantly Reduced
    *   Privilege Escalation within Apollo: Partially Reduced
    *   Data Breach via Configuration Exposure within Apollo: Partially Reduced
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic RBAC is implemented, separating admin and developer roles. Namespaces are used to separate environments within Apollo.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular permissions within namespaces are not fully utilized in Apollo.  Review and audit process for role assignments is not formalized for Apollo.  Documentation of the Apollo RBAC model is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encrypt Sensitive Configuration Data at Rest in Apollo Database](./mitigation_strategies/encrypt_sensitive_configuration_data_at_rest_in_apollo_database.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify sensitive configuration data stored in Apollo that requires encryption (e.g., database passwords, API keys, secrets).
    2.  Choose a database encryption method supported by your database system hosting Apollo's database (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for MySQL, encryption at rest options for other databases).
    3.  Configure database encryption according to your database vendor's documentation for the database used by Apollo.
    4.  Verify that encryption is properly enabled and functioning for Apollo's database.
    5.  Implement key management practices for the encryption keys used for Apollo's database, ensuring secure storage and rotation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach from Apollo Database Compromise (Severity: High) - Attackers gaining access to the Apollo database and extracting sensitive configuration data stored within Apollo.
    *   Data Leakage from Apollo Database Backup Media (Severity: Medium) - Sensitive configuration data exposed if Apollo database backups are compromised or improperly stored.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Breach from Apollo Database Compromise: Significantly Reduced
    *   Data Leakage from Apollo Database Backup Media: Significantly Reduced
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. The database used by Apollo is currently not encrypted at rest.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Encryption at rest is missing for the Apollo database in all environments (dev, staging, production). Key management strategy needs to be defined for Apollo's database encryption.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS for All Apollo Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_for_all_apollo_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Obtain SSL/TLS certificates for all Apollo services (Portal, Admin Service, Config Service, Meta Service).
    2.  Configure each Apollo service to use HTTPS and the obtained SSL/TLS certificates. Refer to Apollo documentation for specific configuration steps for each component.
    3.  Ensure that all client applications and Apollo components communicate with each other using HTTPS URLs when interacting with Apollo.
    4.  Disable HTTP access to Apollo services to enforce HTTPS only communication within the Apollo ecosystem.
    5.  Regularly renew SSL/TLS certificates before they expire for Apollo services.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Apollo Communication (Severity: High) - Attackers intercepting communication between Apollo components or between applications and Apollo to steal configuration data managed by Apollo.
    *   Eavesdropping and Data Interception of Apollo Configuration Data (Severity: Medium) - Sensitive configuration data transmitted in plaintext over insecure HTTP connections within the Apollo ecosystem.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Apollo Communication: Significantly Reduced
    *   Eavesdropping and Data Interception of Apollo Configuration Data: Significantly Reduced
*   **Currently Implemented:** HTTPS is enabled for Apollo Portal and Admin Service using self-signed certificates in development and staging.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Production environment is still using HTTP for Config Service and Meta Service communication within Apollo.  Valid, CA-signed certificates are not used in production and staging for Apollo services.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Apollo Components and Perform Vulnerability Scanning](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_apollo_components_and_perform_vulnerability_scanning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly checking for new Apollo releases and security updates. Subscribe to Apollo project's release notes and security announcements.
    2.  Schedule regular updates for all Apollo components (Portal, Admin Service, Config Service, Meta Service) to the latest stable versions. Follow Apollo's upgrade documentation.
    3.  Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline or schedule regular vulnerability scans of the Apollo infrastructure using vulnerability scanning tools.
    4.  Prioritize and remediate identified vulnerabilities in Apollo based on their severity and exploitability.
    5.  Keep track of applied patches and updates for Apollo components for audit and compliance purposes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Apollo (Severity: High) - Attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated Apollo versions to compromise the Apollo system itself.
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Apollo (Severity: Medium) - While updates mitigate known vulnerabilities, staying updated reduces the window of exposure to newly discovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Apollo.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Apollo: Significantly Reduced
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Apollo: Partially Reduced (reduces exposure window)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Apollo components are updated manually every few months, but no formal schedule or process is in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated update process for Apollo is missing. Vulnerability scanning is not regularly performed on the Apollo infrastructure.  No formal tracking of applied patches for Apollo components.
