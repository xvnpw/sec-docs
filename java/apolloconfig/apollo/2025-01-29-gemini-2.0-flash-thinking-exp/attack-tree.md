## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application via Apollo Config Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_via_apollo_config_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal. Success here means the attacker has achieved control over the application through Apollo Config.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Apollo Server (Config Service & Admin Service) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_apollo_server__config_service_&_admin_service___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** The Apollo Server is the central component for configuration management. Compromising it grants the attacker the ability to manipulate configurations for all applications using this Apollo instance. This can lead to widespread application compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **1.1. Exploit Server Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **1.1.1. Exploit Known Apollo Server Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the Apollo Server software.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Public exploits are often readily available, making this a relatively easy path for attackers if the server is not patched.
                *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, allowing configuration manipulation, data access, and potentially code execution on the server.

        *   **1.2. Credential Compromise of Apollo Server [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **1.2.1. Brute-Force/Password Spraying Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attempting to guess administrator credentials through brute-force or password spraying attacks.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** If weak passwords are used or MFA is not enabled, this is a straightforward attack.
                *   **Impact:** Gain administrative access to the Apollo Server, allowing full control over configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Apollo Database [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_apollo_database__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** The database stores all configuration data. Compromising it provides direct access to sensitive information and the ability to manipulate configurations at the data layer.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.2. Database Credential Compromise [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **2.2.2. Exposed Database Credentials (e.g., in configuration files, code) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Discovering database credentials that are inadvertently exposed in configuration files, source code, or other accessible locations.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** This is a common misconfiguration and a very easy way for attackers to gain database access if credentials are not properly secured.
                *   **Impact:** Direct access to the Apollo database, allowing data exfiltration, modification, and potentially database server compromise.

        *   **2.4. Data Exfiltration from Database [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            *   **2.4.1. After successful compromise (any of 2.1, 2.2, 2.3):**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Once database access is gained through any means (SQL injection, credential compromise, direct access), exfiltrating sensitive configuration data.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** Data exfiltration leads to confidentiality breaches and can expose sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and internal system details.
                *   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise Apollo Portal (Admin UI) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_apollo_portal__admin_ui___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** The Apollo Portal provides a user-friendly interface for managing configurations. Compromising it allows attackers to manipulate configurations through the UI, potentially bypassing other security controls.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **3.3. Exploiting Portal Functionality for Configuration Tampering**
            *   **3.3.1. Unauthorized Configuration Changes via Portal UI:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting misconfigured or overly permissive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the Apollo Portal to make unauthorized configuration changes.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** If RBAC is not properly implemented, attackers might gain access to functionalities they shouldn't have, allowing them to alter configurations.
                *   **Impact:** Application behavior manipulation, denial of service, depending on the configurations changed.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Compromise Apollo Client (Application-Side) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH if HTTP is used]](./attack_tree_paths/4__compromise_apollo_client__application-side___critical_node__high-risk_path_if_http_is_used_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk (if HTTP is used):** If communication between the Apollo Client and Server is not encrypted using HTTPS, it becomes highly vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **4.1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Client-Server Communication [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH if HTTP is used]**
            *   **4.1.1. Intercepting HTTP Traffic (If not using HTTPS) [CRITICAL PATH, HIGHEST RISK if HTTP is used]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Intercepting unencrypted HTTP traffic between the Apollo Client and Server.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** HTTP traffic is transmitted in plaintext, making it trivial for an attacker on the network path to intercept and read or modify configuration data in transit. **This is the most critical vulnerability if HTTP is used.**
                *   **Impact:** Configuration data interception, manipulation of configurations in transit, potentially leading to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploiting Apollo System Logic/Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploiting_apollo_system_logicmisconfiguration.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **5.3. Insecure Communication Channels (HTTP instead of HTTPS) [HIGH-RISK PATH if HTTP is used]**
            *   **5.3.1. Using HTTP for Apollo Server and Portal communication [CRITICAL PATH, HIGHEST RISK if HTTP is used]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  The entire Apollo system (Server, Portal, Client communication) is configured to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
                *   **Why High-Risk:** System-wide use of HTTP exposes all communication to MITM attacks, making the entire configuration management system insecure. **This is a fundamental security flaw.**
                *   **Impact:** System-wide vulnerability to MITM attacks, data interception, configuration manipulation, and potential application compromise.
