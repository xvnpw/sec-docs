# BUSINESS POSTURE

Apollo Configuration Management system aims to provide a reliable, scalable, and centralized configuration management solution for distributed applications. It addresses the challenges of managing configurations across different environments and applications, ensuring consistency and enabling dynamic updates without service restarts.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Centralized Configuration Management: Provide a single source of truth for application configurations, reducing configuration drift and inconsistencies.
- Dynamic Configuration Updates: Enable real-time configuration updates without requiring application restarts, improving agility and reducing downtime.
- Environment and Namespace Isolation: Support multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) and namespaces within environments to manage configurations effectively.
- Scalability and High Availability: Ensure the configuration management system can handle a large number of applications and requests with high availability.
- User-Friendly Interface: Offer a web-based portal for managing configurations, making it accessible and easy to use for operations and development teams.
- Auditability and Versioning: Track configuration changes and provide versioning to enable rollback and audit trails.

Business Risks:
- Configuration Data Integrity: Risk of data corruption or unauthorized modification of configuration data, leading to application malfunctions or security vulnerabilities.
- Availability of Configuration Service: Downtime of the configuration service can impact all dependent applications, leading to service disruptions.
- Unauthorized Access to Configuration Data: Exposure of sensitive configuration data to unauthorized users or systems, potentially leading to security breaches.
- Configuration Errors: Incorrect or inconsistent configurations can lead to application failures or unexpected behavior.
- Operational Complexity: Managing and maintaining the configuration management system itself can become complex, especially at scale.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Secure communication channels (HTTPS) are likely used for communication between clients and server components. (Assumed based on common best practices)
- security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the Apollo Portal to manage user permissions for configuration management. (Likely implemented in Apollo Portal application)
- security control: Audit logging of configuration changes and access events. (Likely implemented in Apollo server components)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on underlying infrastructure security (network, servers, databases).
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Apollo components.
- accepted risk: Risk of misconfiguration by authorized users.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Application Configuration Management: The core business process is managing and delivering configurations to applications. Disruption or compromise of this process can lead to widespread application failures or misbehavior.
- Configuration Updates: Dynamic configuration updates are a key feature. Failure to deliver updates or delays can impact application functionality and responsiveness.
- Access Control and Authorization: Managing access to configurations and ensuring only authorized users can modify configurations is critical to prevent unauthorized changes and maintain data integrity.

Data Sensitivity:
- Configuration Data: Configuration data itself can contain sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets. The sensitivity level depends on the specific configurations being managed. High sensitivity if secrets are stored. Medium to High sensitivity if configurations impact critical business functions.
- Audit Logs: Audit logs contain information about configuration changes and user access, which can be sensitive and important for security monitoring and compliance. Medium sensitivity.
- User Credentials: User credentials for accessing the Apollo Portal are highly sensitive and must be protected. High sensitivity.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What type of authentication is currently used for the Apollo Portal? Is it integrated with any enterprise SSO or directory services?
- Is sensitive configuration data currently encrypted at rest in the database?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) that Apollo needs to adhere to?
- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding configuration management security?
- What is the expected scale of Apollo deployment (number of applications, configurations, users)?
