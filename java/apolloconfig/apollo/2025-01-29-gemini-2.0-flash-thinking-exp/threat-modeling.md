# Threat Model Analysis for apolloconfig/apollo

## Threat: [Configuration Data Tampering](./threats/configuration_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Apollo Admin Service or database (e.g., via compromised credentials or vulnerabilities). They modify configuration values, potentially altering application behavior, injecting malicious settings, or exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Application malfunction, incorrect application behavior leading to security vulnerabilities, data breaches if sensitive configuration is modified (e.g., changing database connection to attacker's server), business disruption.
    *   **Affected Apollo Component:** Apollo Admin Service, Apollo Config Database
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Apollo Admin Service access.
        *   Enforce strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Apollo to limit modification permissions.
        *   Utilize HTTPS for all Apollo component communication to protect data in transit.
        *   Maintain comprehensive audit logs of all configuration changes for monitoring and incident response.
        *   Implement configuration versioning and rollback capabilities to revert unauthorized changes.
        *   Secure the underlying Apollo database with robust access controls and encryption at rest.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Configuration Data (Information Disclosure)](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_configuration_data__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication or authorization controls in Apollo Admin or Config Service (e.g., through vulnerabilities or misconfigurations). They gain read access to configuration data, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration details like database credentials, API keys, internal service URLs, and business logic, enabling further attacks, data breaches, or competitive disadvantage.
    *   **Affected Apollo Component:** Apollo Config Service, Apollo Admin Service
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for Apollo Admin and Config Services.
        *   Utilize Apollo's namespace and permission features to restrict read access to sensitive configurations.
        *   Enforce network segmentation to limit access to Apollo services from untrusted networks.
        *   Regularly audit and review access control configurations within Apollo.
        *   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest in the database and in transit (HTTPS).
        *   Minimize storing highly sensitive secrets directly in Apollo; consider dedicated secret management solutions.

## Threat: [Client SDK Vulnerabilities](./threats/client_sdk_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws exist in Apollo Client SDKs (e.g., insecure deserialization, buffer overflows). Attackers might exploit these by crafting malicious configuration data that triggers vulnerabilities when processed by the SDK within applications.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, potentially leading to remote code execution on application servers, data breaches, or denial of service depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Affected Apollo Component:** Apollo Client SDKs (Java, .Net, Node.js, etc.)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Apollo Client SDKs updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Perform security testing and vulnerability scanning of applications using Apollo Client SDKs.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Apollo Client SDKs and apply updates promptly.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when integrating Apollo Client SDKs into applications.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation in Admin Service](./threats/insufficient_input_validation_in_admin_service.md)

*   **Description:** The Apollo Admin Service lacks proper input validation for configuration data or API requests. An attacker could inject malicious payloads (e.g., command injection, path traversal) through configuration values or API calls, exploiting these weaknesses.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Apollo Admin Service, potentially leading to server compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Apollo Component:** Apollo Admin Service (API endpoints, configuration data processing)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all user inputs and API requests in the Apollo Admin Service.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Apollo Admin Service.
        *   Adhere to secure coding practices during development and maintenance of the Admin Service.
        *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests to the Admin Service.

## Threat: [Default Credentials or Weak Authentication](./threats/default_credentials_or_weak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Default or easily guessable credentials are used for the Apollo Admin Service. Attackers can exploit these to gain full administrative access to the Apollo Config system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Apollo Config system, enabling configuration data tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and potentially wider infrastructure compromise.
    *   **Affected Apollo Component:** Apollo Admin Service
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately change all default credentials** for the Apollo Admin Service upon deployment.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.
        *   Mandate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Apollo Admin Service access.
        *   Integrate with enterprise identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth 2.0) for robust authentication management.
