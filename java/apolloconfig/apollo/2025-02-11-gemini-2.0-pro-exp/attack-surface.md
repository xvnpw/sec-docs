# Attack Surface Analysis for apolloconfig/apollo

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Configuration Access and Modification](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_configuration_access_and_modification.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers gain unauthorized access to the Apollo Portal (Admin Service) or API, allowing them to view, modify, or delete configurations.
    *   *How Apollo Contributes:* Apollo provides a centralized configuration management system, which, if not properly secured, becomes a single point of failure for configuration control.  This is *inherent* to Apollo's core functionality.
    *   *Example:* An attacker bypasses weak authentication on the Apollo Portal and changes the database connection string to point to a malicious database, stealing user data.
    *   *Impact:* Complete application compromise, data breaches, denial of service, injection of malicious code.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing the Apollo Portal. Integrate with existing SSO/IAM solutions.
        *   **Robust Authorization:** Enforce the principle of least privilege. Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to specific namespaces and applications. Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Apollo Config Service and Portal on a separate network segment, limiting access from untrusted networks. Use firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs).
        *   **API Security:** Secure the Apollo API with API keys, OAuth 2.0, or other appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms. Implement rate limiting and input validation on the API.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Apollo Portal and API to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Poisoning](./attack_surfaces/configuration_poisoning.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers inject malicious configuration values into the system, either through the Portal, API, or by compromising the configuration storage.
    *   *How Apollo Contributes:* Apollo's dynamic configuration capabilities, a *core feature*, introduce the risk of malicious configurations being applied if not properly validated. The ability to change configurations at runtime is central to Apollo.
    *   *Example:* An attacker with write access to a specific namespace injects a configuration value that disables a security feature, allowing for further exploitation. Or, if the application uses configuration values to construct file paths, an attacker could inject a path traversal payload (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`).
    *   *Impact:* Varies widely, from minor disruptions to complete application compromise, depending on the nature of the injected configuration.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the application's use of configuration)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Server-Side):** Implement rigorous server-side validation for *all* configuration values. Define allowed data types, formats, and ranges. Reject any input that doesn't conform to the defined schema. This validation must occur *within the Apollo server itself*.
        *   **Configuration Schemas:** Use configuration schemas (e.g., JSON Schema) to define the structure and allowed values for configurations. Enforce schema validation on the server-side (within Apollo).
        *   **Review and Approval Process:** Implement a multi-person approval workflow for configuration changes, especially for critical configurations. This workflow should be integrated into the Apollo change management process.
        *   **Configuration Auditing:** Regularly audit configuration values for anomalies and unexpected changes. Use automated tools to detect potential malicious configurations *within the Apollo system*.
        *   **Least Privilege (Namespaces):** Utilize Apollo's namespace feature to limit the scope of configuration changes. Grant users access only to the namespaces they need. This is a built-in Apollo mitigation.
        *   **Sandboxing (if applicable):** If the application dynamically executes configuration values (e.g., as code), consider running this code in a sandboxed environment to limit its impact. This is generally a high-risk practice and should be avoided if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Configurations](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_configurations.md)

*   *Description:* Developers inadvertently store sensitive data (API keys, passwords, secrets) directly within Apollo configurations without proper encryption.
    *   *How Apollo Contributes:* Apollo's ease of use and its role as a *central configuration store* can lead to developers taking shortcuts and storing secrets directly in configurations, rather than using a dedicated secrets management solution. The *temptation* to store secrets directly in Apollo is the key contribution.
    *   *Example:* A developer stores a database password directly in an Apollo configuration value. An attacker gains read access to the configuration and obtains the password.
    *   *Impact:* Data breaches, unauthorized access to other systems, reputational damage.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Never Store Secrets in Configurations:** Emphasize this rule to all developers. Provide clear guidelines and training on secure configuration practices.
        *   **Secrets Management Integration:** Integrate Apollo with a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault). Apollo *supports* referencing external secrets; this is the crucial mitigation.
        *   **Automated Scanning:** Implement automated scanning of configurations *within Apollo* for potential secrets. Use tools that can detect common secret patterns (e.g., API keys, passwords).
        *   **Education and Training:** Train developers on secure coding practices and the proper use of secrets management tools.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Apollo Config Service](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__against_apollo_config_service.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers flood the Apollo Config Service with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate applications.
    *   *How Apollo Contributes:* Apollo is a *central point* for configuration retrieval; if it's down, applications can't get their configurations. This is a direct consequence of Apollo's architecture.
    *   *Example:* An attacker launches a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the Apollo Config Service, preventing applications from starting or updating their configurations.
    *   *Impact:* Application unavailability.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling *on the Apollo Config Service itself* to prevent abuse.
        *   **Scalable Infrastructure:** Deploy the Apollo Config Service on a robust and scalable infrastructure that can handle high loads. Use load balancing and auto-scaling. This is directly related to how Apollo is deployed.
        *   **Caching (Server-Side):** Implement caching mechanisms *within the Apollo Config Service* to reduce the load.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor the Apollo Config Service for performance and availability. Set up alerts to notify administrators of potential DoS attacks.
        *   **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Consider using a CDN to distribute configuration data, reducing the load on the origin server (Apollo).

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Tampering during Transit (MitM)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_tampering_during_transit__mitm_.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers intercept and modify configurations in transit between the Apollo Config Service and the application.
    *   *How Apollo Contributes:* While Apollo uses HTTPS, misconfigurations or compromised certificates can still allow for MitM attacks *specifically targeting the communication between the application and the Apollo server*.
    *   *Example:* An attacker compromises a network device and intercepts traffic between the application and the Apollo Config Service, injecting a malicious configuration value.
    *   *Impact:* The application receives and uses a malicious configuration, leading to various security issues.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strong TLS Configuration:** Enforce strong TLS configurations (modern ciphers, strong key exchange, disable weak protocols like SSLv3) *for the connection to the Apollo server*.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning on the client-side (within the application) *specifically for the Apollo server's certificate* to prevent the use of fraudulent certificates.
        *   **Certificate Authority (CA) Security:** Ensure the CA used to issue certificates for the Apollo Config Service is trusted and secure. Use a reputable CA.
        *   **Regular Certificate Updates:** Regularly update and rotate certificates *for the Apollo Config Service* to minimize the impact of potential certificate compromises.
        *   **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, such as unexpected connections or certificate changes, *particularly focusing on traffic to and from the Apollo server*.
