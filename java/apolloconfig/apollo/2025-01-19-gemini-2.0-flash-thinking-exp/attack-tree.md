## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Apollo Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_apollo_server_vulnerabilities.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Apollo Server Vulnerabilities
- Attack Vector: Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Apollo Server software to gain unauthorized access or control.
- Critical Node: Exploit Apollo Server Vulnerabilities - This is a critical entry point that can lead to full server compromise.
- Critical Node: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses - Weak authentication allows attackers to gain initial access to the server.
- Critical Node: Brute-force or Credential Stuffing Admin Credentials - A common method to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit API Vulnerabilities
- Attack Vector: Abusing unprotected or weakly protected API endpoints to manipulate configuration data or retrieve sensitive information.
- Critical Node: Exploit API Vulnerabilities -  Highlights the risk of insecure API endpoints.
- Critical Node: Abuse Unprotected or Weakly Protected APIs -  Specific focus on the danger of exposed APIs.
- Critical Node: Directly Modify Configuration Data - The point where attackers can inject malicious configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Apollo Client (Application-Side)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_apollo_client__application-side_.md)

High-Risk Path: Compromise Apollo Client (Application-Side)
- Attack Vector: Performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept and modify configuration data as it's being transmitted between the application and the Apollo Server.
- Critical Node: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Configuration Retrieval - The point where communication is intercepted.
- Critical Node: Intercept and Modify Configuration Data During Transit - The action of altering the configuration data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Storage Vulnerabilities
- Attack Vector: Gaining direct access to the underlying database where Apollo stores its configurations, bypassing the Apollo Server's intended access controls.
- Critical Node: Exploit Configuration Storage Vulnerabilities -  Highlights the risk of direct database access.
- Critical Node: Direct Access to Apollo Configuration Database - The point of unauthorized entry into the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Apollo Admin Interface Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_apollo_admin_interface_functionality.md)

High-Risk Path: Abuse Apollo Admin Interface Functionality
- Attack Vector: Gaining unauthorized access to the Apollo Admin Interface and using its functionalities to make malicious changes to the application's configuration.
- Critical Node: Abuse Apollo Admin Interface Functionality -  Highlights the danger of a compromised admin interface.
- Critical Node: Malicious Configuration Changes via Compromised Admin Account -  Focuses on the impact of a compromised admin account.
- Critical Node: Inject Malicious Configurations - The action of injecting harmful settings through the admin interface.
