*   **Malware Infection:** Introduction of malware through various means (e.g., phishing, drive-by downloads, compromised software) that allows remote access and control.
*   **Unsecured Remote Access:**  Insecurely configured or unmonitored remote access protocols (e.g., RDP, SSH) can be targeted.
*   **Network-Based Attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in network services or protocols, or performing man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Physical Access:** Inadequate physical security controls allowing unauthorized access to servers.

#### 4.3. Detailed Impact Analysis

A successful compromise of the underlying infrastructure hosting Apollo Config can have severe consequences:

*   **Complete Control over Configuration Data:** Attackers could modify, delete, or exfiltrate all configuration data stored in the database. This allows them to:
    *   **Inject Malicious Configurations:**  Push configurations that redirect users to malicious sites, alter application behavior for malicious purposes (e.g., data theft, privilege escalation), or cause application outages.
    *   **Steal Sensitive Information:** Access configuration data that might contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
    *   **Cause Widespread Application Failures:**  Deploy configurations that intentionally break dependent applications, leading to service disruptions and business impact.
*   **Control over Apollo Services:** Gaining control over the Admin, Config, and Meta Services allows attackers to:
    *   **Manipulate User Access:** Create new administrative accounts, revoke access for legitimate users, and control who can manage configurations.
    *   **Alter Service Behavior:** Modify the internal workings of Apollo services, potentially introducing backdoors or disabling security features.
    *   **Disrupt Service Availability:**  Shut down or degrade the performance of Apollo services, impacting all dependent applications.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised servers can be used as a launching point to attack other systems within the network.
*   **Data Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive configuration data or data accessed through compromised applications.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Significant damage to the organization's reputation due to service outages, data breaches, or security incidents.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Failure to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity can lead to regulatory fines and penalties.

#### 4.4. Control Analysis
