# Threat Model Analysis for apolloconfig/apollo

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via Compromised Admin Service](./threats/configuration_tampering_via_compromised_admin_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker who has successfully compromised the Apollo Admin Service can directly modify configuration values stored within Apollo.

**Impact:**  Tampered configurations can lead to a wide range of negative impacts, including application malfunction, security vulnerabilities, data corruption, or redirection of users to malicious sites.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Admin Service (configuration management module), Apollo Config Service (data storage)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the Admin Service with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Implement audit logging for all configuration changes within Apollo.
*   Consider implementing a configuration change approval workflow.
*   Regularly back up Apollo configuration data.

## Threat: [Compromise of Underlying Infrastructure](./threats/compromise_of_underlying_infrastructure.md)

**Description:** If the servers or infrastructure hosting the Apollo services are compromised, attackers could gain full control over the configuration management system and potentially impact all dependent applications.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the configuration management system, potentially affecting all applications relying on it.

**Affected Component:** Servers and infrastructure hosting Apollo services (Admin Service, Config Service, Meta Service, Database)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust security measures for the underlying infrastructure, including operating system hardening, regular patching, and network segmentation.
*   Secure access to the infrastructure.

## Threat: [Weak Authentication to Apollo Admin Service](./threats/weak_authentication_to_apollo_admin_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Apollo Admin Service by exploiting default credentials, brute-forcing weak passwords, or using stolen credentials. Once authenticated, they can manage configurations.

**Impact:**  Successful authentication allows the attacker to modify application configurations, potentially leading to service disruption, data breaches, or the introduction of malicious settings.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Admin Service (authentication module)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for Admin Service accounts.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Admin Service access.
*   Disable or change default administrative credentials immediately after installation.
*   Regularly audit Admin Service user accounts and permissions.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via Compromised Database](./threats/configuration_tampering_via_compromised_database.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains access to the underlying database used by Apollo to store configurations could directly manipulate the data, bypassing the intended access controls of the Admin Service.

**Impact:** Similar to tampering via the Admin Service, this can lead to application malfunction, security vulnerabilities, or data corruption.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Config Service (database)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the database with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Restrict network access to the database.
*   Encrypt the database at rest and in transit.
*   Regularly back up the database.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** Apollo configurations might contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or internal service URLs. Weak access controls or insecure storage could lead to unauthorized disclosure of this data.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data can lead to further attacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access to other systems.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Config Service (data storage), Apollo Admin Service (access control)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing Apollo configurations.
*   Encrypt sensitive configuration values at rest within Apollo.
*   Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in configurations if possible; consider using secrets management solutions.

## Threat: [Lack of Proper Security Updates and Patching](./threats/lack_of_proper_security_updates_and_patching.md)

**Description:** Failure to apply security updates and patches to the Apollo services and their underlying operating systems can leave them vulnerable to known exploits.

**Impact:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities leading to compromise of Apollo services.

**Affected Component:** Apollo services, underlying operating systems and dependencies

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Establish a process for regularly applying security updates and patches to Apollo services and their underlying infrastructure.
*   Monitor security advisories for Apollo and related components.
