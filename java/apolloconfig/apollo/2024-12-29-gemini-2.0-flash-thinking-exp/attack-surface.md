### Key Attack Surfaces Involving Apollo (High & Critical)

*   **Attack Surface:** Weak or Default Admin Service Credentials
    *   **Description:** The Admin Service, being the central management point, is vulnerable if default or easily guessable credentials are used for administrative accounts.
    *   **How Apollo Contributes:** Apollo's Admin Service requires authentication. If this is not properly configured with strong, unique credentials, it becomes a primary entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials like "apollo:admin" or "root:password" to log into the Admin Service.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Apollo configuration management system, allowing attackers to modify configurations, potentially impacting all applications using Apollo.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for Admin Service accounts.
        *   Mandate changing default credentials during initial setup.
        *   Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
        *   Regularly audit and rotate administrative credentials.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated or Poorly Authenticated Admin Service API Endpoints
    *   **Description:** API endpoints in the Admin Service that lack proper authentication or use weak authentication mechanisms can be exploited to perform administrative actions without authorization.
    *   **How Apollo Contributes:** Apollo exposes APIs for managing configurations. If these APIs are not secured, attackers can directly interact with them.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts API requests to create, modify, or delete namespaces or configurations without logging in or with stolen API keys that have broad permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of application configurations, leading to application malfunction, data breaches, or other security incidents.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) for all Admin Service API endpoints.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for API keys and access tokens.
        *   Regularly review and revoke unused or overly permissive API keys.
        *   Implement API rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Lack of Input Validation in Admin Service
    *   **Description:** Insufficient validation of input data provided to the Admin Service can lead to various injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Apollo Contributes:** Apollo's Admin Service accepts user input for creating and modifying configurations. If this input is not sanitized, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into a configuration value field, which is then executed by the Admin Service's backend database.
    *   **Impact:** SQL injection, command injection, or other injection attacks, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution on the Admin Service server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data received by the Admin Service.
        *   Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to prevent SQL injection.
        *   Avoid constructing system commands directly from user-provided input.
        *   Implement output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the admin UI.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Storage of Client SDK Credentials
    *   **Description:** Applications using the Apollo Client SDK might store API keys or other authentication credentials insecurely.
    *   **How Apollo Contributes:** Apollo requires applications to authenticate with the Config Service, often using API keys. If these keys are not managed securely, they become a target.
    *   **Example:** API keys are hardcoded in the application's source code or stored in plain text configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised API keys can be used by attackers to access and potentially modify application configurations, leading to application disruption or data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid hardcoding API keys in the application code.
        *   Store API keys securely using environment variables, secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.
        *   Implement proper access control and rotation policies for API keys.

*   **Attack Surface:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Client-Config Service Communication
    *   **Description:** Communication between the application using the Client SDK and the Config Service might be vulnerable to interception if not properly secured.
    *   **How Apollo Contributes:** Apollo's Client SDK communicates with the Config Service to retrieve configurations. If this communication is not encrypted, it's susceptible to MITM attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the communication between an application and the Config Service, potentially reading sensitive configuration data or injecting malicious configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data, injection of malicious configurations that could compromise the application's security or functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the Client SDK is configured to communicate with the Config Service over HTTPS.
        *   Implement proper certificate validation on the client-side to prevent connecting to rogue Config Services.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced security.

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration Injection in Client Applications
    *   **Description:** If applications blindly trust and execute configuration values received from Apollo without proper sanitization, attackers could inject malicious code or commands.
    *   **How Apollo Contributes:** Apollo's core function is to provide configuration data. If this data is treated as trusted input without validation, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A configuration value intended to be a file path is manipulated to include shell commands, which are then executed by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the application server, data breaches, or other security incidents depending on the application's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat configuration values as untrusted input.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all configuration values before using them.
        *   Avoid directly executing configuration values as code or commands.
        *   Use type-safe configuration management practices.
