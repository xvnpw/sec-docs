# Threat Model Analysis for apolloconfig/apollo

## Threat: [Unauthorized Configuration Modification via Admin Interface](./threats/unauthorized_configuration_modification_via_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Apollo Admin interface (e.g., through compromised credentials, session hijacking, or exploiting vulnerabilities *in the admin interface itself*). They can then modify configuration values for any application or namespace they have access to.

**Impact:**  Applications could receive manipulated configurations, leading to application malfunction, data corruption, privilege escalation within the application, or exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Admin Service, Apollo Config Service (data storage).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for access to the Apollo Admin interface.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular RBAC within Apollo to restrict access to specific namespaces and applications based on user roles.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the Apollo Admin interface and its underlying infrastructure to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Session Management:** Implement secure session management practices, including appropriate timeouts and protection against session hijacking.
*   **Input Validation:** Ensure proper input validation on the Apollo Admin interface to prevent injection attacks.

## Threat: [Direct Configuration Data Tampering](./threats/direct_configuration_data_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the underlying configuration storage (e.g., the Git repository or database used by Apollo) without going through the Apollo Admin interface. They can then directly modify configuration files.

**Impact:** Similar to unauthorized modification via the admin interface, this can lead to application malfunction, data corruption, privilege escalation, and information exposure. This bypasses any audit logs or access controls enforced by the Apollo Admin interface.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Config Service (data storage, e.g., Git repository, database).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Implement strong access controls and permissions on the underlying configuration storage (Git repository, database). Restrict access to only authorized Apollo server processes.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest within the storage system.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the security of the configuration storage infrastructure.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to the Apollo server processes accessing the configuration storage.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:**  Sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, or internal service URLs, is stored within the Apollo configurations. If the Apollo server or its storage is compromised, this sensitive data could be exposed to unauthorized individuals.

**Impact:** Exposed credentials can lead to unauthorized access to other systems and data. Exposed API keys can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate services.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Config Service (data storage).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Avoid Storing Secrets Directly:**  Avoid storing sensitive secrets directly in Apollo configurations.
*   **Use Secret Management Solutions:** Integrate Apollo with dedicated secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve secrets.
*   **Encryption in Transit and at Rest:** Ensure all communication with the Apollo server is encrypted (HTTPS) and sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Restrict access to namespaces and configurations containing sensitive data.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Apollo Server](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_apollo_server.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the Apollo server with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate applications from retrieving configurations.

**Impact:** Applications may fail to start or function correctly due to the inability to retrieve necessary configurations. This can lead to service outages and business disruption.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Config Service, Apollo Admin Service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the Apollo server to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time period.
*   **Resource Monitoring and Scaling:** Monitor the resource utilization of the Apollo server and implement auto-scaling to handle increased load.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to filter malicious traffic and protect the Apollo server from common web attacks.
*   **Infrastructure Protection:** Ensure the underlying infrastructure hosting the Apollo server is protected against DDoS attacks.

## Threat: [Client-Side Configuration Tampering (Man-in-the-Middle) *exploiting lack of TLS enforcement in Apollo Client*](./threats/client-side_configuration_tampering__man-in-the-middle__exploiting_lack_of_tls_enforcement_in_apollo_1189568c.md)

**Description:** If the Apollo Client is not configured to enforce HTTPS or if there are vulnerabilities in the client's TLS implementation, an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack could intercept and modify the configuration data in transit. This is a direct issue with how the Apollo Client handles secure connections.

**Impact:** Applications could receive tampered configurations, leading to malfunction, data corruption, or redirection to malicious services.

**Affected Component:** Apollo Client SDK, network communication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Enforce HTTPS in Apollo Client Configuration:** Ensure the Apollo Client is explicitly configured to use and enforce HTTPS for all communication with the Apollo server.
*   **Keep Apollo Client SDK Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the Apollo Client SDK to benefit from security patches and improvements in TLS handling.
*   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** While not directly an Apollo issue, ensuring a secure network infrastructure reduces the likelihood of MitM attacks.
