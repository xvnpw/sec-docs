## 6. Data Flow

This section describes the key data flows within the Apollo system, highlighting the data being transferred and the protocols used.

### 6.1. Fetching Configuration

1. A **Client SDK** within an application initiates a request for configuration for a specific namespace (e.g., "application.properties").
2. The **Client SDK** sends an authenticated HTTP/HTTPS GET request to the **Config Service**, including the application ID, cluster name, and requested namespaces.
3. The **Config Service** authenticates the request using the provided application ID.
4. The **Config Service** retrieves the latest, active configuration data for the requested namespace from its in-memory cache. If not present, it fetches it from the **Database**.
5. The **Database** returns the configuration data (key-value pairs) to the **Config Service** over a secure database connection.
6. The **Config Service** returns the configuration data (typically in JSON or properties format) to the **Client SDK** via the HTTP/HTTPS response.
7. The **Client SDK** caches the configuration locally in memory or on disk.

### 6.2. Updating Configuration

1. A user interacts with the **Portal** to modify a configuration (e.g., changes a property value).
2. The **Portal** sends an authenticated HTTP/HTTPS POST/PUT request to the **Admin Service** API, including the namespace, key, new value, and user credentials.
3. The **Admin Service** authenticates and authorizes the request based on the user's roles and permissions.
4. The **Admin Service** validates the input data.
5. The **Admin Service** updates the configuration data in the **Database**, including creating an audit log entry with the user and timestamp.
6. The **Database** persists the changes and the audit log entry.
7. The **Admin Service** publishes an event or directly notifies the **Config Service** about the configuration update, often using an internal communication mechanism.
8. The **Config Service** receives the notification, invalidates its cache for the affected namespace, and reloads the latest configuration from the **Database**.
9. The **Config Service** sends asynchronous notifications (e.g., via WebSockets or long polling) to subscribed **Client SDKs** about the configuration update.
10. **Client SDKs** receive the notification and fetch the latest configuration from the **Config Service**, repeating the fetching process.

### 6.3. Configuration Synchronization with External System

1. A user performs a configuration change through the **Portal**, triggering an update in the **Database**.
2. The **Admin Service**, after successfully updating the **Database**, initiates a synchronization process with the **External Configuration Source** (e.g., Git).
3. The **Admin Service** authenticates with the **External Configuration Source** using configured credentials.
4. The **Admin Service** commits the configuration changes to the **External Configuration Source**, including metadata like the user and timestamp.
5. The **External Configuration Source** acknowledges the successful synchronization.
6. Alternatively, the **Admin Service** can periodically poll the **External Configuration Source** for changes. Upon detecting changes, it retrieves them, validates them, and updates the **Database**, following the standard update flow.

## 7. Security Considerations

This section outlines key security considerations for the Apollo system, categorized for clarity.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Client SDK to Config Service:** Authentication via application ID or API key. Authorization based on the application's allowed namespaces.
    *   **Portal to Admin Service:** Authentication via username/password, API keys, or potentially multi-factor authentication. Authorization based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Admin Service to Database:** Authentication via database credentials. Authorization limited to necessary database operations.
    *   **Config Service to Database:** Authentication via database credentials. Authorization limited to read operations on configuration data.
    *   **Admin Service to External System:** Authentication via SSH keys, access tokens, or other mechanisms specific to the external system. Authorization based on the required actions.
*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:**
    *   **In Transit:** All communication between components should be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
    *   **At Rest:** Sensitive configuration data in the database should be encrypted. Consider encryption for local caches in the Client SDK.
    *   **Integrity:**  Mechanisms to ensure the integrity of configuration data during transmission and storage (e.g., checksums).
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs in the Portal and API requests to the Admin Service to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
    *   Validation of configuration data format and values.
*   **Secure Communication:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all external-facing interfaces (Portal, Config Service, Admin Service).
    *   Consider secure communication mechanisms for internal communication between services.
*   **Auditing and Logging:**
    *   Comprehensive audit logs for configuration changes, administrative actions, and user logins.
    *   Secure storage and management of audit logs.
*   **Rate Limiting and Denial of Service Prevention:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Regularly review and update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Database Configuration:**
    *   Harden the database server, use strong passwords, and restrict network access.
*   **Secrets Management:**
    *   Securely manage and store sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys, etc.) using dedicated secrets management solutions.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

## 8. Deployment Considerations

*   The Apollo system can be deployed on various infrastructure platforms, including on-premises and cloud environments.
*   Containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes are recommended for deployment and scaling.
*   High availability and fault tolerance should be considered for critical components like the Config Service and Database (e.g., using multiple instances, load balancing, database replication).
*   Proper network segmentation and firewall rules should be implemented to restrict access to the Apollo system components based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Secure network configuration to prevent unauthorized access between components.

## 9. Future Enhancements (Optional)

*   Support for more sophisticated configuration formats (e.g., YAML, TOML) and validation schemas.
*   Enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities for system health and security events.
*   Integration with other security tools and platforms (e.g., SIEM systems).
*   Improved user interface and user experience in the Portal.
*   Support for configuration change approvals and workflows.
