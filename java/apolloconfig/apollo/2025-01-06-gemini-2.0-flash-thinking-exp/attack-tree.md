## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit vulnerabilities in Apollo Config components](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_apollo_config_components.md)

Attack Vector: Exploit Config Service vulnerabilities **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    - Attack Vector: Authentication Bypass **[CRITICAL]**
        - Description: Attacker bypasses authentication mechanisms in the Config Service to gain unauthorized access.
        - Potential Techniques: Exploiting flaws in authentication logic, using default credentials, exploiting credential stuffing vulnerabilities.
    - Attack Vector: Remote Code Execution (RCE) **[CRITICAL]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        - Description: Attacker executes arbitrary code on the Config Service server.
        - Potential Techniques: Exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities, exploiting injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection via configuration values), exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    - Attack Vector: Exploit Admin Service vulnerabilities **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        - Attack Vector: Authentication Bypass **[CRITICAL]**
            - Description: Attacker bypasses authentication mechanisms in the Admin Service to gain unauthorized access to the configuration management interface.
            - Potential Techniques: Exploiting flaws in authentication logic, using default credentials, exploiting credential stuffing vulnerabilities.
        - Attack Vector: Account Takeover **[CRITICAL]**
            - Description: Attacker gains control of a legitimate administrator account.
            - Potential Techniques: Exploiting vulnerabilities in user management or password reset functionalities, social engineering, phishing.
    - Attack Vector: Exploit Client SDK vulnerabilities **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        - Attack Vector: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on client-server communication
            - Description: Attacker intercepts and modifies configuration data during transit between the client application and the Config Service.
            - Potential Techniques: ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, exploiting weak TLS configurations or lack of certificate validation.
        - Attack Vector: Configuration Injection
            - Description: Attacker injects malicious configuration values that are processed by the client application, leading to unintended behavior or further exploitation.
            - Potential Techniques: Manipulating network traffic, compromising the Config Service (leading to this as a secondary attack).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Compromise Apollo's underlying infrastructure](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_compromise_apollo's_underlying_infrastructure.md)

Attack Vector: Compromise the database storing Apollo configurations **[CRITICAL]**
        - Description: Attacker gains unauthorized access to the database where Apollo stores its configuration data.
        - Potential Techniques: Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities (if applicable), exploiting database vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access to database credentials.
    - Attack Vector: Compromise the servers hosting Apollo components **[CRITICAL]**
        - Description: Attacker gains unauthorized access to the servers running the Config Service, Admin Service, or Meta Service.
        - Potential Techniques: Exploiting operating system vulnerabilities, exploiting vulnerabilities in other services running on the same server, gaining unauthorized access via compromised credentials (SSH, RDP, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse Apollo's intended functionality](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_apollo's_intended_functionality.md)

Attack Vector: Gain unauthorized access to the Admin Service **[CRITICAL]**
        - Description: Attacker gains access to the Admin Service without exploiting software vulnerabilities.
        - Potential Techniques: Brute-force or dictionary attack on admin credentials, phishing attack to obtain admin credentials, social engineering to gain access.
