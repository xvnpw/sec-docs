### High and Critical Solr Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve Apache Solr:

*   **Threat:** Query Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input within a query parameter that is not properly sanitized before being passed to Solr. This allows the attacker to manipulate the query logic, potentially retrieving unauthorized data, bypassing security restrictions, or even triggering server-side actions depending on the configuration and plugins. The attacker might inject Solr syntax or use special characters to alter the intended query.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, potential data breaches, bypassing application security controls, possible denial of service if the injected query is resource-intensive, and in some cases, remote code execution if specific plugins or configurations are vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Solr Admin UI
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Solr Admin UI, often due to default credentials, weak passwords, or lack of authentication. This allows the attacker to perform administrative tasks, such as modifying configurations, creating or deleting cores, and potentially executing arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Solr instance, including data manipulation, deletion, and potential server takeover. This can lead to significant data loss, service disruption, and reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Data Poisoning through Update Requests
    *   **Description:** An attacker, either internal or external with compromised credentials, sends malicious or incorrect data through update requests to Solr. This can corrupt the index, leading to inaccurate search results, or inject malicious content. The attacker might directly interact with Solr's update API if it's not properly secured.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, inaccurate search results, potential for stored XSS attacks if the poisoned data contains malicious scripts, and erosion of trust in the application's data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Solr Plugins or Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Solr's functionality can be extended through plugins. Vulnerabilities in these plugins or in the underlying libraries and dependencies used by Solr can be exploited by attackers. This could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configuration
    *   **Description:** Solr might be deployed with insecure default configurations, such as disabled authentication, overly permissive access controls, or exposed administrative endpoints. Attackers can exploit these default settings to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:**  Increased attack surface, making it easier for attackers to compromise the Solr instance. Potential for unauthorized access, data manipulation, and denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
