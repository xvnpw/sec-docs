# Attack Surface Analysis for netty/netty

## Attack Surface: [Request Smuggling (HTTP/1.x)](./attack_surfaces/request_smuggling__http1_x_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting discrepancies in HTTP request parsing between Netty and backend servers, allowing attackers to inject requests into other users' connections.
*   **Netty Contribution:** Netty's HTTP/1.x decoder, if not strictly configured and used, can lead to variations in request parsing. Custom handlers or relaxed configurations increase this risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with ambiguous `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. Netty parses it one way, while a backend server parses it differently, enabling the attacker to prepend their malicious request to a legitimate request.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cache poisoning, bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly adhere to HTTP RFC specifications in Netty handler implementations.
    *   Normalize and validate HTTP requests before forwarding them to backend servers.
    *   Configure Netty's HTTP decoder to be strict and reject ambiguous requests.
    *   Prefer HTTP/2 where possible, as it is less susceptible to request smuggling.

## Attack Surface: [HPACK Compression Bomb (HTTP/2)](./attack_surfaces/hpack_compression_bomb__http2_.md)

*   **Description:** Sending highly compressible HTTP/2 headers that expand significantly upon decompression, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service.
*   **Netty Contribution:** Netty's HTTP/2 implementation uses HPACK for header compression and decompression. Vulnerable if decompression is not resource-limited within Netty.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a malicious HTTP/2 request with headers designed to compress to a small size but decompress to a very large size. Netty's HPACK decompression consumes excessive memory, potentially causing OutOfMemory errors and application crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crash, memory exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the decompressed header size within Netty's HTTP/2 configuration.
    *   Configure HPACK decoder settings to restrict maximum header table size and string size in Netty.
    *   Monitor memory usage during HTTP/2 header decompression in Netty applications.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in deserialization processes to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious serialized objects.
*   **Netty Contribution:** Netty provides `ObjectDecoder` and `ObjectEncoder` for handling Java object serialization. Using these directly without security considerations introduces insecure deserialization risks within Netty applications. Custom codecs built with Netty might also implement vulnerable deserialization.
*   **Example:** An application uses `ObjectDecoder` to receive serialized Java objects over Netty. An attacker sends a specially crafted serialized object containing malicious code. When `ObjectDecoder` deserializes this object using Netty, the malicious code is executed on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using Java's default deserialization via `ObjectDecoder` if possible.**
    *   If deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers with Netty handlers.
    *   If using `ObjectDecoder` is unavoidable, implement strict filtering and validation of deserialized objects within Netty handlers.
    *   Consider using a sandboxed deserialization environment in conjunction with Netty.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Custom Handlers](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflowunderflow_in_custom_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of `ByteBuf` objects in custom Netty channel handlers, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Netty Contribution:** Netty's architecture relies on developers writing secure channel handlers. Incorrect buffer management in these handlers, which are core components of Netty applications, can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A custom handler in a Netty pipeline reads data from a `ByteBuf` without properly checking the buffer's readable bytes. This can lead to reading beyond the buffer's boundaries (buffer overflow) or before the buffer's starting point (buffer underflow) within Netty's processing, potentially causing crashes or exploitable conditions.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), memory corruption, potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) in severe cases.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly validate buffer boundaries before reading or writing data in custom Netty handlers.
    *   Use Netty's `ByteBuf` API correctly, especially methods like `readableBytes()`, `readerIndex()`, `writerIndex()`, and `capacity()` within handlers.
    *   Perform rigorous testing and code reviews of custom channel handlers, focusing on buffer handling logic specific to Netty's `ByteBuf` usage.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Management Endpoints (Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_management_endpoints__misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** Unintentionally exposing management or administrative endpoints through Netty without proper access control, allowing unauthorized access and control.
*   **Netty Contribution:** Netty is used to build network services, including management interfaces. Misconfiguration in Netty handler setup, routing, or binding can directly lead to unintended exposure of these endpoints.
*   **Example:** A developer creates a Netty server that includes a management endpoint for monitoring or configuration. This endpoint is accidentally bound to a public interface or lacks proper authentication handlers in the Netty pipeline, allowing anyone to access and potentially manipulate the application via Netty.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breach, system compromise, configuration manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strong authentication and authorization within the Netty handler pipeline for all management endpoints.**
    *   Restrict network binding of management endpoints to trusted interfaces or IP addresses in Netty server configuration.
    *   Carefully review Netty server configurations and routing rules to ensure management endpoints are not unintentionally exposed through Netty.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing and deploying management interfaces using Netty.
