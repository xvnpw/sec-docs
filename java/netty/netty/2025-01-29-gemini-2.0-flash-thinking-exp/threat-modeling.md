# Threat Model Analysis for netty/netty

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Native Transports (e.g., epoll, kqueue, io_uring)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_native_transports__e_g___epoll__kqueue__io_uring_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the operating system's native transport APIs that Netty utilizes for performance. By sending crafted network packets or triggering specific system calls through Netty, they can cause crashes, kernel panics, or potentially gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges due to flaws in the underlying native transport handling within Netty or the OS interaction.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), System Instability, Potential Privilege Escalation, Complete system compromise in severe cases.
*   **Netty Component Affected:** Native Transport Modules (epoll, kqueue, io_uring channel implementations), Native JNI bindings, Netty's native transport integration layer.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly patch and update the operating system kernel to address known native transport vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor Netty project for reported issues related to native transports and apply Netty updates promptly.
    *   Consider using Java NIO transport as a more portable fallback if native transport vulnerabilities are a significant concern in the deployment environment, accepting potential performance trade-offs.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Netty server with a massive number of connection requests, overwhelming Netty's connection handling mechanisms. This rapidly consumes server resources managed by Netty, such as file descriptors, memory allocated for channels, and thread pool resources, preventing legitimate clients from establishing connections and rendering the application unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Application unavailability, Business disruption.
*   **Netty Component Affected:** `ServerBootstrap`, `NioServerSocketChannel`/`EpollServerSocketChannel`/`KQueueServerSocketChannel`, Netty's connection acceptance and registration logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement connection limits within Netty using `ServerBootstrap` options like `childOption(ChannelOption.SO_BACKLOG, ...)`.
