## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application deserializes data received through Netty without proper sanitization or type checking, an attacker can send specially crafted serialized objects. Upon deserialization, these objects can trigger the execution of arbitrary code on the server. This is a critical vulnerability as it directly leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Critical Node: Send Malicious Serialized Objects:** The attacker's action of sending the malicious serialized data is the core of this attack.
    *   **Critical Node: Craft serialized objects that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code:** This describes the specific technique used to achieve RCE. Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries or application-specific deserialization logic.
    *   **Critical Node: Target known vulnerable classes or libraries used in deserialization:** Attackers often target well-known vulnerable classes or libraries (e.g., those found in common Java libraries) that are known to have deserialization flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Netty Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_netty_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Netty, like any software, may have publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs). If the application uses an outdated or unpatched version of Netty, attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities. The impact can range from Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Critical Node: Leverage Publicly Disclosed CVEs:** This highlights the attacker's strategy of focusing on known weaknesses.
    *   **Critical Node: Research and exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific Netty version being used:**  Attackers will identify the exact version of Netty the application is using and then search for corresponding exploits.
    *   **Critical Node: Target unpatched instances with known exploits:**  The success of this attack relies on the application not having applied the necessary security patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities via Netty Integration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_third-party_library_vulnerabilities_via_netty_integration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Applications built with Netty often integrate with other third-party libraries for tasks like encoding/decoding data (codecs), handling message formats (e.g., JSON libraries), or other functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these third-party libraries can be exploited by sending malicious data through Netty that triggers the vulnerable code within the library. This can lead to various impacts, including RCE.
    *   **Critical Node: Target Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used with Netty:**  The attacker focuses on the weaknesses present in the external libraries used alongside Netty.
    *   **Critical Node: Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in libraries that are integrated with Netty handlers or used for processing data received through Netty:** This describes the process of finding and leveraging flaws in these integrated libraries.
    *   **Critical Node: This includes codecs, message formatters (like JSON libraries), etc.:** This provides concrete examples of the types of libraries that are often targets for this kind of attack.
