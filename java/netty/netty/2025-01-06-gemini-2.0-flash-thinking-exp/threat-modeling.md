# Threat Model Analysis for netty/netty

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

- **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted serialized object to the application. When Netty's deserialization mechanism (e.g., `ObjectDecoder` or custom decoders) processes this object, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to instantiate malicious objects or trigger harmful code execution. This directly involves Netty's components for handling object serialization.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, and potentially pivoting to other systems.
    - **Affected Netty Component:** `ObjectDecoder`, custom `ChannelHandler` implementations performing deserialization.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
        - If deserialization is necessary, use secure serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers with appropriate validation.
        - Implement custom deserialization logic with strict input validation and whitelisting of allowed classes.
        - Consider using filtering deserialization mechanisms if available in your Java version.
        - Regularly update Netty and the JVM to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow/Underflow in Custom Handlers](./threats/buffer_overflowunderflow_in_custom_handlers.md)

- **Description:** An attacker sends data that, when processed by a custom `ChannelHandler`, causes a buffer overflow or underflow. This can happen if the handler incorrectly calculates buffer sizes, reads or writes beyond buffer boundaries, or mishandles buffer indices. This directly involves the way custom handlers interact with Netty's `ByteBuf`.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow can overwrite critical memory regions.
    - **Affected Netty Component:** Custom `ChannelInboundHandler` or `ChannelOutboundHandler` implementations, specifically those dealing with `ByteBuf` manipulation.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Thoroughly test custom handlers with various input sizes and edge cases.
        - Utilize Netty's built-in buffer management features correctly.
        - Avoid direct manipulation of buffer pointers unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        - Use methods like `readableBytes()`, `writableBytes()`, and `ensureWritable()` to check buffer boundaries.
        - Consider using higher-level codecs provided by Netty to handle common protocols.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Length Field Processing](./threats/integer_overflow_in_length_field_processing.md)

- **Description:** An attacker sends a message with a maliciously crafted length field that, due to integer overflow, results in a much smaller value than intended. When the application attempts to read data based on this overflowed length, it might read beyond the bounds of the actual data, potentially leading to information disclosure or crashes. Conversely, an attacker might cause an integer overflow leading to a very large allocation, causing a denial of service. This directly relates to how Netty decoders interpret length prefixes.
    - **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service due to excessive memory allocation, potential for buffer overflows in subsequent processing.
    - **Affected Netty Component:** Custom `ByteToMessageDecoder` or `MessageToByteEncoder` implementations that handle length-prefixed messages.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Validate length fields to ensure they fall within reasonable bounds before allocating buffers or reading data.
        - Use appropriate data types (e.g., `long` instead of `int`) for length fields if the expected data size can exceed the maximum value of an `int`.
        - Implement checks to prevent integer overflows before performing calculations based on length fields.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Connection Flooding](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos__via_connection_flooding.md)

- **Description:** An attacker floods the server with a large number of connection requests, exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors) and preventing legitimate clients from connecting. While application logic plays a role, Netty's `ServerBootstrap` and channel implementations are directly involved in handling these connections.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    - **Affected Netty Component:** `ServerBootstrap`, `NioServerSocketChannel`, `EpollServerSocketChannel`, connection handling logic.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement connection limits and rate limiting at the application level or using network infrastructure.
        - Configure Netty's `ServerBootstrap` with appropriate backlog settings.
        - Implement connection timeouts to release resources from idle connections.
        - Consider using techniques like SYN cookies to mitigate SYN flood attacks.

## Threat: [Protocol Parsing Vulnerabilities in Custom Decoders](./threats/protocol_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_custom_decoders.md)

- **Description:** An attacker sends malformed or unexpected data that exploits flaws in the custom protocol parsing logic implemented within a `ByteToMessageDecoder`. This directly involves the logic within Netty's decoder components.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service, application instability, potential for information disclosure or further exploitation depending on the vulnerability.
    - **Affected Netty Component:** Custom `ByteToMessageDecoder` implementations.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Follow secure coding practices when implementing protocol parsers.
        - Thoroughly test decoders with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including edge cases and malformed data.
        - Implement robust error handling and input validation within the decoder.
        - Consider using well-established and vetted protocol libraries if possible, rather than implementing custom parsing from scratch.
