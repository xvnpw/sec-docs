# Attack Surface Analysis for netty/netty

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS/DDoS) - Netty-Facilitated](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__dosddos__-_netty-facilitated.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit Netty's efficiency to overwhelm server resources, making the application unavailable. This is *not* about general DoS, but how Netty's features can be misused.
    *   **Netty Contribution:** Netty's asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model, while performant, can be leveraged by attackers if resource limits and proper handling are not implemented.  Netty's ability to handle many connections concurrently makes it a target.
    *   **Example:**
        *   *Slowloris Attack (Netty-Specific):*  Exploiting the lack of `ReadTimeoutHandler` or `WriteTimeoutHandler` to keep many connections open with minimal data transfer, exhausting server threads or file descriptors.
        *   *Connection Flood (Netty-Specific):* Rapidly opening connections, exceeding Netty's configured backlog (`ChannelOption.SO_BACKLOG`) and preventing legitimate connections.
        *   *Large Message Attack (Netty-Specific):* Sending huge messages without proper frame size limits (missing `LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder` or equivalent), causing excessive memory allocation within Netty's buffers.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Timeouts (Netty-Specific):** *Crucially*, use `ReadTimeoutHandler` and `WriteTimeoutHandler` to close idle or slow connections.  These are Netty-specific components.
        *   **Connection Limits (Netty-Specific):** Configure `ChannelOption.SO_BACKLOG` appropriately.  Implement custom handlers to limit concurrent connections (globally or per-IP).
        *   **Rate Limiting (Netty-Specific):** Implement rate limiting using a custom Netty handler or integrate a library within the Netty pipeline.
        *   **Message Size Limits (Netty-Specific):** Use Netty's `LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder`, `DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder`, or a custom decoder with strict size checks *within the Netty pipeline*.
        *   **Thread Pool Management (Netty-Specific):** Avoid blocking operations within Netty handlers.  Offload long-running tasks to a *separate* thread pool from the `EventLoopGroup`. Monitor Netty's `EventLoopGroup` thread pool utilization.
        *   **Memory Management (Netty-Specific):** Use Netty's pooled `ByteBufAllocator` where appropriate. Carefully manage `ByteBuf` allocation and release within custom Netty codecs.

## Attack Surface: [Codec Vulnerabilities (Deserialization)](./attack_surfaces/codec_vulnerabilities__deserialization_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Netty codecs, *particularly* those performing deserialization, to achieve remote code execution or other malicious actions.
    *   **Netty Contribution:** Netty's framework allows for custom codecs, increasing the risk of developer-introduced vulnerabilities.  Netty's `ObjectDecoder` (using Java serialization) is inherently dangerous.
    *   **Example:**
        *   *Deserialization Attack (Netty-Specific):* An attacker sends a crafted serialized object to a Netty endpoint using `ObjectDecoder` (or a custom codec using vulnerable deserialization), leading to RCE.
        *   *Codec Injection (Netty-Specific):* A flaw in a *custom* Netty encoder or decoder allows an attacker to inject malicious data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Java Serialization (Netty-Specific):** *Never* use `ObjectDecoder` without extreme caution and robust whitelisting.  Prefer safer alternatives.
        *   **Secure Deserialization (Netty-Specific):** If using *any* deserialization within a Netty codec (even with third-party libraries), implement strict input validation *before* deserialization occurs within the Netty pipeline. Use whitelists for allowed classes. Consider `CompatibleObjectDecoder`.
        *   **Codec Testing (Netty-Specific):** Thoroughly test and fuzz *all* custom Netty codecs. Use static analysis tools specifically looking for vulnerabilities in Netty handler code.
        *   **Input Validation (Netty-Specific):** Validate *all* input data *before* it reaches any Netty codec that performs deserialization or complex parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Channel Pipeline Misconfiguration (Security-Critical)](./attack_surfaces/channel_pipeline_misconfiguration__security-critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect ordering or omission of Netty handlers, leading to security bypasses.
    *   **Netty Contribution:** The `ChannelPipeline` is a core Netty concept, and its configuration directly impacts security.
    *   **Example:**
        *   *Authentication Bypass (Netty-Specific):* Placing an authentication handler *after* a handler that processes untrusted data within the Netty pipeline.
        *   *Missing Rate Limiter (Netty-Specific):* Failing to include a rate limiting handler *within the Netty pipeline*, leaving the application vulnerable to Netty-facilitated DoS.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication/authorization bypass, DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pipeline Design (Netty-Specific):** Carefully design the Netty `ChannelPipeline`, ensuring handlers are in the correct order. Document the security implications of each handler's position.
        *   **Handler Completeness (Netty-Specific):** Ensure all necessary security-related handlers (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, timeouts) are present *within the Netty pipeline*.
        *   **Code Reviews (Netty-Specific):* Review the `ChannelPipeline` configuration, focusing on the order and presence of security-critical Netty handlers.
        *   **Testing (Netty-Specific):* Unit and integration tests should specifically verify the correct behavior of the Netty `ChannelPipeline` and its security properties.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration (Netty's `SslHandler`)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration__netty's__sslhandler__.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguring Netty's `SslHandler`, leading to weak encryption or certificate validation failures.
    *   **Netty Contribution:** `SslHandler` is Netty's component for TLS/SSL; its configuration is crucial.
    *   **Example:**
        *   *Weak Cipher Usage (Netty-Specific):* Configuring `SslHandler` with outdated or weak cipher suites.
        *   *Certificate Validation Bypass (Netty-Specific):* Incorrectly configuring `SslHandler` to skip or improperly perform certificate validation.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Ciphers (Netty-Specific):** Configure `SslHandler` with a strong cipher suite and only support TLS 1.2 and 1.3.
        *   **Certificate Validation (Netty-Specific):* Ensure `SslHandler` is correctly configured to validate certificates (hostname, expiration, trust chain). Use a trusted CA. Consider certificate pinning within the `SslHandler` configuration.
        *   **Secure Key Management:** This is less *directly* Netty-specific, but still crucial when using `SslHandler`.
