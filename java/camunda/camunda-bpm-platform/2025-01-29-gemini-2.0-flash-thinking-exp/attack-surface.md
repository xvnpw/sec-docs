# Attack Surface Analysis for camunda/camunda-bpm-platform

## Attack Surface: [Default Administrator Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default usernames and passwords for administrative accounts.
*   **Camunda Contribution:** Camunda ships with default credentials for the `camunda-admin` user, making it an immediate vulnerability if unchanged.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses `camunda-admin/camunda` to log into Camunda Cockpit and gain full administrative control over the platform.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Camunda platform, including access to all process definitions, data, and system configuration. Potential for data breaches, system manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately change the default administrator password** upon initial deployment.
    *   Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password changes for administrative accounts.
    *   Consider disabling the default administrator account and creating role-based administrative accounts with least privilege.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Language Injection](./attack_surfaces/expression_language_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Camunda Expression Language (UEL) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Camunda Contribution:** Camunda heavily relies on UEL for process definitions, task forms, listeners, and connectors.  Improper handling of user input within UEL expressions can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a process variable name containing a UEL expression that executes system commands when the variable is evaluated by the process engine. For instance, a variable name like `${Runtime.getRuntime().exec("malicious_command")}`.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Camunda server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid using user input directly in UEL expressions.**
    *   **Sanitize and validate all user input** before incorporating it into process definitions or UEL expressions.
    *   **Use secure coding practices** when writing custom UEL functions or scripts.
    *   **Implement input validation and output encoding** in task forms and REST APIs that interact with process variables.
    *   **Consider using a restricted expression language** or sandboxing mechanisms if available and applicable to limit the capabilities of UEL.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Script Tasks](./attack_surfaces/insecure_script_tasks.md)

*   **Description:** Using script tasks (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) within process definitions that contain vulnerabilities or execute untrusted code.
*   **Camunda Contribution:** Camunda allows embedding script tasks directly within process definitions for complex logic or integrations. These scripts run with the privileges of the Camunda process engine, making insecure scripts a direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A process definition includes a JavaScript script task that executes arbitrary system commands based on user-controlled process variables, or accesses sensitive resources without proper authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Camunda server, leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize the use of script tasks.** Prefer service tasks or external tasks for complex logic where possible.
    *   **Thoroughly review and audit all script tasks** for security vulnerabilities and adherence to secure coding practices.
    *   **Restrict the permissions of the scripting engine** if possible to limit the impact of a compromised script.
    *   **Implement input validation and output encoding** within script tasks to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider using a secure scripting environment** or sandboxing mechanisms to isolate script execution.
    *   **Enforce code review processes** for all process definitions containing script tasks, focusing on security aspects.

## Attack Surface: [REST API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/rest_api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing authentication and authorization mechanisms in the Camunda REST API to gain unauthorized access to Camunda functionalities.
*   **Camunda Contribution:** Camunda exposes a comprehensive REST API for process management, task management, and administration. Weaknesses in the API's security directly expose core functionalities and data.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the REST API's authentication filter or authorization logic to bypass security checks and access sensitive process data or administrative endpoints without valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to process data, system configuration, and administrative functions. Potential for data breaches, system manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms** for the REST API (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    *   **Enforce least privilege access control** for API endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Regularly audit and test API security configurations** to identify and fix potential bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable or restrict access to administrative API endpoints** from public networks, limiting exposure.
    *   **Implement rate limiting and API abuse prevention mechanisms** to mitigate potential brute-force attacks or denial of service attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web Applications (Cockpit, Admin, Tasklist)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_web_applications__cockpit__admin__tasklist_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into the Camunda web applications that are executed in other users' browsers.
*   **Camunda Contribution:** Camunda's web applications (Cockpit, Admin, Tasklist) handle user-provided data in process definitions, task forms, and comments. Insufficient input sanitization within these applications can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A malicious user injects a JavaScript payload into a task form field. When another user views this task form in Tasklist, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies, performing actions on their behalf, or redirecting to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, defacement of web applications, and potential redirection to malicious websites, leading to further compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding** in all Camunda web applications (Cockpit, Admin, Tasklist).
    *   **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP)** to restrict the sources of content that the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of XSS.
    *   **Regularly scan Camunda web applications for XSS vulnerabilities** using automated tools and manual testing.
    *   **Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or entering data into untrusted forms** within the Camunda applications.
    *   **Utilize modern front-end frameworks** that offer built-in XSS protection mechanisms.
