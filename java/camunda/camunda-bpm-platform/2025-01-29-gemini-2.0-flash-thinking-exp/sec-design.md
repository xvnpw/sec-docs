Build Process Description:

The build process for Camunda BPM Platform typically involves the following steps, focusing on security controls:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Source Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. A webhook triggers the CI/CD System (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) upon code changes.
3. The CI/CD system automatically builds the project, compiles code, and runs unit and integration tests.
4. Security Scans are performed during the build process:
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
   - Linters are used to enforce code quality and security best practices.
5. Build Artifacts (e.g., JAR or WAR files) are generated if the build and security checks are successful.
6. Security Scan Results are collected and reviewed. Failures can block the build pipeline.
7. Build Artifacts are published to an Artifact Repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory) for version control and secure storage.
