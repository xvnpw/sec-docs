# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for camunda/camunda-bpm-platform

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Process Definition Deployment - Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/secure_process_definition_deployment_-_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define roles within your organization that should have permission to deploy process definitions (e.g., Process Developers, Administrators).
    2.  **Configure Authorization Service:** Utilize Camunda's Authorization Service (configured in `camunda.cfg.xml` or through the Admin web application).
    3.  **Grant Deploy Permissions:**  Grant "CREATE" permission for "Deployment" resource type to the defined roles. This restricts deployment capabilities to authorized users within Camunda's authorization framework.
    4.  **Test Permissions:** Verify that users without the assigned roles are unable to deploy new process definitions through Camunda's web applications or API, confirming Camunda's authorization enforcement.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Process Modification (High Severity): Malicious actors or unauthorized personnel could deploy modified or malicious process definitions, potentially disrupting business processes or introducing vulnerabilities *within the Camunda engine*.
    *   Accidental Process Corruption (Medium Severity):  Accidental deployment of incorrect or untested process definitions by developers without proper authorization can lead to process failures and downtime *within Camunda*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Process Modification: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring only authorized individuals, as defined within Camunda's authorization system, can deploy process definitions.
    *   Accidental Process Corruption: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk by limiting deployment access to trained personnel, controlled by Camunda's roles, but proper testing and versioning are also crucial.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the Production environment using Camunda's Authorization Service. Roles are defined based on LDAP groups and configured in `camunda.cfg.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not fully implemented in the Staging and Development environments. Authorization needs to be consistently configured across all environments to mirror production security within Camunda's authorization framework.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Script Task Security - Restrict Scripting Languages](./mitigation_strategies/script_task_security_-_restrict_scripting_languages.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Process Needs:** Determine the necessary scripting languages for your process definitions *within Camunda*. If possible, avoid scripting altogether and use Java or connectors.
    2.  **Configure Script Engine:** In `camunda.cfg.xml`, configure the script engine to only allow the required scripting languages *within Camunda's engine configuration*. For example, if only Javascript is needed, disable Groovy and other potentially more powerful languages.
    3.  **Verify Configuration:** Test by attempting to deploy a process definition using a disabled scripting language. The deployment should fail *within Camunda*, indicating the restriction is in place.
    4.  **Document Restrictions:** Clearly document the allowed scripting languages for developers to ensure compliance with Camunda's scripting language policy.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Script Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):  Using overly permissive scripting languages like Groovy can increase the attack surface for script injection attacks *within Camunda's script engine*, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code on the server *through Camunda*.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):  Uncontrolled or poorly written scripts, especially in powerful languages, can potentially consume excessive server resources *due to Camunda's script execution*, leading to performance degradation or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Script Injection Vulnerabilities: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the attack surface and complexity of the scripting environment *within Camunda*.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk by limiting the capabilities of scripts *executed by Camunda*, but proper script design and resource monitoring are still important.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in all environments (Development, Staging, Production) by configuring the `scriptEnginePlugins` in `camunda.cfg.xml` to only allow `javascript`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No missing implementation currently related to Camunda configuration. However, ongoing review of process definitions is needed to ensure developers are adhering to the restricted language policy and not circumventing it through other means *within Camunda processes*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [External Task Security - Secure Worker Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/external_task_security_-_secure_worker_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Authentication Method:** Select a robust authentication method for external task workers *interacting with Camunda*. Options include API Keys or OAuth 2.0.
    2.  **Implement Authentication in Workers:**  Modify external task worker applications to include the chosen authentication credentials (e.g., API key in headers, OAuth 2.0 tokens) when communicating with the Camunda engine *for external task operations*.
    3.  **Configure Camunda Authentication:** Configure Camunda to validate the incoming authentication credentials from external task workers. This might involve setting up an authentication filter or using Camunda's identity service integration *to secure external task interactions*.
    4.  **Test Authentication:** Thoroughly test the authentication flow to ensure only workers with valid credentials can claim and complete external tasks *within Camunda's external task framework*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Task Execution (High Severity):  Without proper authentication, malicious actors could impersonate external task workers and execute tasks they are not authorized to perform *within Camunda's process execution*, potentially leading to data breaches or process manipulation.
    *   Data Tampering (Medium Severity):  If workers are not authenticated *to Camunda*, attackers could potentially intercept and modify task data in transit between the engine and workers *related to Camunda external tasks*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Task Execution: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring only authenticated workers, as validated by Camunda, can interact with external tasks.
    *   Data Tampering: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk of worker impersonation *from Camunda's perspective*, but HTTPS is also crucial for securing data in transit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the Production and Staging environments using API Keys for worker authentication. API Keys are securely stored in environment variables on worker servers. Authentication is validated using a custom authentication filter in Camunda.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Authentication is not yet fully implemented in the Development environment. Developers are currently using basic authentication for testing, which needs to be upgraded to API Keys or a more secure method for consistency in securing Camunda external task interactions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Web Application Security - Authentication and Authorization Hardening (Camunda RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/web_application_security_-_authentication_and_authorization_hardening__camunda_rbac_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms for Camunda web applications (Cockpit, Admin, Tasklist), such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong password policies *integrated with Camunda's identity management or external providers*.
    2.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Leverage Camunda's authorization service to implement granular RBAC for web applications. Define roles with specific permissions *within Camunda's authorization framework* and assign users to roles based on their responsibilities.
    3.  **Session Management Security:**  Configure secure session management for Camunda web applications *using Camunda's session management capabilities*. Use HTTP-Only and Secure flags for cookies, implement session timeouts, and consider using secure session storage mechanisms.
    4.  **Regularly Review User Permissions:** Periodically review user permissions and roles within Camunda web applications *configured in Camunda's authorization service* to ensure they are still appropriate and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Web Applications (High Severity): Weak authentication or authorization can allow unauthorized users to access Camunda web applications and potentially gain access to sensitive process data or administrative functions.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):  Insufficiently granular RBAC can allow users to gain access to functionalities or data beyond their authorized scope within Camunda web applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Web Applications: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing strong authentication and controlling access to Camunda web applications through RBAC.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk by implementing granular permissions within Camunda's authorization framework, ensuring users only have access to what they need.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the Production environment using Camunda's Authorization Service and LDAP integration for user authentication and role management.
*   **Missing Implementation:** MFA is not yet implemented for Camunda web applications in any environment.  Exploring and implementing MFA integration with Camunda's authentication framework would further enhance security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [REST API Security - API Authentication and Authorization (Camunda API Security)](./mitigation_strategies/rest_api_security_-_api_authentication_and_authorization__camunda_api_security_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure API Endpoints:**  Implement authentication and authorization for Camunda REST API endpoints *using Camunda's API security features*. Use appropriate authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0, API keys, or basic authentication over HTTPS *integrated with Camunda's security context*.
    2.  **API Key Management:**  If using API keys *with Camunda*, implement secure API key management practices, including key rotation, secure storage, and access control for key generation and distribution.
    3.  **Authorization for API Access:** Implement authorization rules *within Camunda's authorization service* to control which users or applications can access specific API endpoints and perform certain actions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):  Without proper authentication and authorization, malicious actors could access the Camunda REST API and potentially manipulate process instances, access sensitive data, or disrupt operations.
    *   Data Breaches via API (High Severity):  Unauthorized API access can lead to data breaches if attackers can retrieve sensitive process data through the API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized API Access: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by enforcing authentication and authorization for all Camunda REST API requests.
    *   Data Breaches via API: High Reduction - Protects sensitive process data by controlling access to the API and ensuring only authorized entities can retrieve information.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the Production and Staging environments using API Keys for API authentication and Camunda's Authorization Service for API endpoint authorization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More granular authorization rules for specific API endpoints could be implemented in all environments. Currently, authorization is primarily based on API key validity, but role-based authorization for API access within Camunda's framework could be further enhanced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [General Camunda Platform Security - Secure Configuration Management (Camunda Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/general_camunda_platform_security_-_secure_configuration_management__camunda_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Externalize Configuration:**  Externalize configuration settings for Camunda and its components (e.g., database credentials, LDAP settings) and manage them securely, ideally using environment variables or secure configuration management tools *outside of Camunda's deployment artifacts*.
    2.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration:**  Grant access to configuration files and settings *related to Camunda* only to authorized personnel and systems. Secure access to `camunda.cfg.xml` and other configuration files.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data (High Severity):  Storing sensitive configuration data (e.g., database passwords) in easily accessible files can lead to unauthorized access and compromise of the Camunda platform and underlying systems.
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Medium Severity):  Unauthorized modification of Camunda configuration can lead to security vulnerabilities, instability, or disruption of services.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by removing sensitive data from easily accessible configuration files and managing it securely.
    *   Unauthorized Configuration Changes: Medium Reduction - Reduces the risk by limiting access to configuration files, but proper access control mechanisms for the configuration management system are also essential.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in all environments. Sensitive configuration parameters (database credentials, LDAP passwords) are externalized using environment variables and managed through a secure configuration management system.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No major missing implementation currently. Regularly review and audit access controls to the configuration management system and Camunda configuration files to ensure ongoing security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [General Camunda Platform Security - Logging and Auditing (Camunda Auditing)](./mitigation_strategies/general_camunda_platform_security_-_logging_and_auditing__camunda_auditing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Comprehensive Logging:**  Enable comprehensive logging for Camunda components, including process engine events, web application access, and API requests *within Camunda's logging configuration*.
    2.  **Secure Log Storage and Management:**  Store logs securely and implement proper log management practices, including log rotation, retention, and access control *for Camunda logs*.
    3.  **Auditing of Security-Relevant Events:**  Specifically audit security-relevant events *within Camunda*, such as authentication attempts, authorization changes, and process definition deployments, to detect and respond to security incidents. Configure Camunda's audit logging features.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Lack of Visibility into Security Incidents (High Severity):  Insufficient logging and auditing can hinder the detection and response to security incidents affecting the Camunda platform.
    *   Delayed Incident Response (Medium Severity):  Without proper auditing, it can take longer to identify and investigate security breaches or suspicious activities within Camunda.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Lack of Visibility into Security Incidents: High Reduction - Significantly improves visibility into security-related events within Camunda, enabling faster detection of potential incidents.
    *   Delayed Incident Response: Medium Reduction - Reduces incident response time by providing audit trails and logs for investigation, but effective incident response procedures are also crucial.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the Production and Staging environments. Camunda's logging is configured to capture process engine events, web application access logs, and API requests. Audit logging for security-relevant events is enabled. Logs are stored in a centralized logging system.
