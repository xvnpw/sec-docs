            *   **Attack:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in input handling within Camunda web applications to inject malicious SQL queries.
            *   **Risk:** Can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially gaining control over the underlying database and application.
            *   **Mitigation:** Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks, implement strict input validation and sanitization, regularly perform SQL injection vulnerability scanning.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HR]:**
            *   **Attack:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into web pages served by Camunda web applications, which is then executed in users' browsers.
            *   **Risk:** Can lead to session hijacking, credential theft, defacement of the application, and redirection to malicious sites.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust output encoding, use Content Security Policy (CSP), regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities, educate users about phishing and suspicious links.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass [HR]:**
        *   **Default Credentials [HR]:**
            *   **Attack:** Attempting to log in using default usernames and passwords for Camunda web applications or the underlying database.
            *   **Risk:** If default credentials are not changed, attackers can gain immediate administrative access.
            *   **Mitigation:** Change all default credentials immediately upon deployment, enforce strong password policies, regularly audit user accounts.
        *   **Weak Password Policies [HR]:**
            *   **Attack:** Exploiting weak password policies by using brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess user passwords.
            *   **Risk:** Successful password cracking can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and application functionalities.
            *   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation), implement account lockout mechanisms, consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   **Authorization Flaws [HR]:**
            *   **Attack:** Identifying and exploiting flaws in Camunda's authorization model to access resources or perform actions that should be restricted.
            *   **Risk:** Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of processes, and privilege escalation.

            *   **Attack:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable third-party libraries used by Camunda web applications.
            *   **Risk:** Vulnerable dependencies can provide easy entry points for attackers to compromise the application and potentially the server.
            *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update Camunda BPM Platform and all its dependencies, use dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable libraries, subscribe to security advisories for used libraries.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [HR]:**
        *   **Attack:** Tricking an authenticated user into unknowingly sending malicious requests to the Camunda web application, performing actions on their behalf.
        *   **Risk:** Can lead to unauthorized actions being performed, such as process modification, data changes, or account manipulation.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens in web forms and API requests, use proper HTTP method handling (e.g., using POST for state-changing operations).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit REST API Vulnerabilities (Camunda REST API) [HR] [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_rest_api_vulnerabilities__camunda_rest_api___hr___cr_.md)

            *   **Attack:** Injecting malicious BPMN process definitions into the Camunda process engine, often through deployment APIs or file uploads.
            *   **Risk:** Malicious processes can be designed to perform arbitrary actions within the engine's context, potentially leading to full application compromise.
            *   **Mitigation:** Restrict access to process deployment functionalities, implement strict validation and sanitization of BPMN process definitions before deployment, perform security reviews of process definitions.

        *   **Exploit scripting vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the engine context [HR] [CR]:**
            *   **Attack:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom scripts (Groovy, JavaScript) embedded within BPMN processes.
            *   **Risk:** Scripting vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code within the Camunda process engine's context, potentially gaining full control.
            *   **Mitigation:** Carefully review and sanitize all custom scripts, limit the use of scripting if possible, use secure coding practices in scripts, consider using sandboxed scripting environments, regularly audit BPMN processes for script vulnerabilities.
