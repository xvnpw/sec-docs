## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Process Definitions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_process_definitions__critical_.md)

**High-Risk Path:** This path is high-risk because successful exploitation allows attackers to directly influence the core business logic and execution flow of the application.
**Critical Node:** This node is critical as it represents a fundamental weakness in how process definitions are handled.

    * **Inject Malicious Code via BPMN XML [CRITICAL]**
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** High
        * **Effort:** Medium
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * An attacker uploads a crafted BPMN XML file containing embedded code (e.g., using `<script>` tags within a task description or a custom listener definition) that executes arbitrary commands on the server when the process is deployed or executed.
            * An attacker modifies an existing BPMN XML definition (if they have the necessary permissions or can exploit an authorization flaw) to include malicious code.

    * **Exploit Scripting Capabilities (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) [CRITICAL]**
        * **High-Risk Path:**  Scripting capabilities within Camunda provide significant power and flexibility but also introduce a significant attack surface if not secured properly.
        * **Critical Node:** This node is critical because scripting allows for dynamic code execution within the process engine.

            * **Inject Malicious Scripts within Process Definitions [CRITICAL]**
                * **Likelihood:** High
                * **Impact:** High
                * **Effort:** Medium
                * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                * **Attack Vectors:**
                    * An attacker injects malicious scripts into script tasks, execution listeners, or task listeners within the BPMN definition. These scripts can perform various malicious actions, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying process variables, interacting with external systems, or even executing system commands.
                    * An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the scripting engine itself (though less common).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Camunda APIs (REST, Java) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_camunda_apis__rest__java___critical_.md)

**High-Risk Path:**  Compromising the APIs provides a direct programmatic interface to Camunda's core functionalities, allowing attackers to bypass application-level controls.
**Critical Node:** This node is critical as it represents a fundamental point of access and control over the Camunda engine.

    * **Exploit REST API Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]**
        * **High-Risk Path:** The REST API is often exposed for integration purposes, making it a readily accessible target.
        * **Critical Node:** This node is critical as it's a primary interface for interacting with Camunda remotely.

            * **Bypass Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]**
                * **Likelihood:** Medium
                * **Impact:** High
                * **Effort:** Medium
                * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                * **Attack Vectors:**
                    * Exploiting flaws in the authentication mechanism (e.g., weak credentials, session management vulnerabilities).
                    * Exploiting authorization vulnerabilities to access resources or perform actions beyond the attacker's privileges (e.g., missing authorization checks on API endpoints).

        * **Manipulate Internal Camunda Objects [CRITICAL]**
            * **Likelihood:** Low
            * **Impact:** Critical
            * **Effort:** High
            * **Skill Level:** Expert
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
            * **Attack Vectors:**
                * An attacker with deep knowledge of Camunda's internal Java API and object model could potentially manipulate internal objects to bypass security checks, alter process execution, or gain administrative privileges. This often requires direct access to the Java API or exploiting vulnerabilities in custom code that interacts with it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Camunda Web Applications (Cockpit, Tasklist, Admin) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_camunda_web_applications__cockpit__tasklist__admin___critical_.md)

**High-Risk Path:** These applications are user-facing and often provide administrative or operational access to Camunda, making them attractive targets.
**Critical Node:** This node is critical as it represents the primary user interface for interacting with Camunda.

    * **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws [CRITICAL]**
        * **High-Risk Path:**  Gaining unauthorized access to these applications can provide significant control over Camunda.
        * **Critical Node:** This node is critical as it controls access to the web applications.

            * **Bypass Login Mechanisms [CRITICAL]**
                * **Likelihood:** Medium
                * **Impact:** High

                * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                * **Attack Vectors:**
                    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the login form or authentication logic (e.g., SQL injection, brute-force attacks if not protected, bypassing two-factor authentication).
                    * Exploiting session management flaws to hijack legitimate user sessions.

            * **Privilege Escalation [CRITICAL]**
                * **Likelihood:** Medium
                * **Impact:** High
                * **Effort:** Medium
                * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
