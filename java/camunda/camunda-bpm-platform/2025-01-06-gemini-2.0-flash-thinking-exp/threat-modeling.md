# Threat Model Analysis for camunda/camunda-bpm-platform

## Threat: [BPMN Expression Language Injection](./threats/bpmn_expression_language_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code or scripts within BPMN expressions (e.g., in script tasks, conditional sequence flows, execution listeners). This injected code is then evaluated and executed by the Camunda engine.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the Camunda engine, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Expression Evaluation

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable script execution in production environments if not absolutely necessary.
*   If script execution is required, use a secure expression language sandbox or restrict the available scripting engines and libraries.
*   Rigorously validate and sanitize all user-provided input that influences BPMN expressions.
*   Implement strict access controls on who can deploy or modify process definitions.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Process Definition Deployment/Modification](./threats/unauthorized_process_definition_deploymentmodification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to deploy new or modify existing BPMN process definitions. This allows them to introduce malicious logic, bypass security checks, or exfiltrate data through crafted processes.

**Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application's workflow, circumvention of business rules, data manipulation, and potential exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:**  BPMN Engine - Deployment Service, REST API - Deployment Endpoint, Admin Web Application

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the deployment service and API endpoints.
*   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy or modify process definitions.
*   Implement a review process for all process definition changes before deployment.
*   Audit process definition deployments and modifications.

## Threat: [Process Instance Manipulation via API](./threats/process_instance_manipulation_via_api.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient authorization checks in the Camunda REST API to manipulate running process instances. This could involve actions like starting, canceling, or modifying process instances, accessing sensitive process variables, or manipulating user tasks without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Disruption of business processes, unauthorized access to or modification of sensitive data associated with process instances, and potential circumvention of intended workflows.

**Affected Component:** REST API - Process Instance Endpoints, Task Endpoints, Variable Endpoints

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization for all REST API endpoints.
*   Enforce fine-grained access control based on user roles and process instance context.
*   Validate all input parameters to API requests to prevent parameter tampering.
*   Regularly audit API access logs.

## Threat: [Data Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/data_serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in how Camunda serializes and deserializes process variables or other data could be exploited to inject malicious payloads or trigger vulnerabilities in the underlying Java runtime environment (e.g., Java deserialization vulnerabilities).

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting Camunda, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Variable Handling, REST API - Data Serialization/Deserialization

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid serializing complex objects as process variables if possible.
*   If serialization is necessary, use secure serialization mechanisms and carefully control the classes that can be serialized/deserialized.
*   Keep the Java runtime environment and Camunda dependencies updated with the latest security patches.
*   Consider using data formats like JSON for process variables where appropriate, as they are generally less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization Checks in Camunda Web Applications](./threats/insufficient_authorization_checks_in_camunda_web_applications.md)

**Description:** Weak or missing authorization checks in the Tasklist or Admin web applications could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive information or perform administrative actions they are not permitted to.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to process data, user information, or system configuration, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Tasklist Web Application, Admin Web Application - Backend Authorization Logic

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) within the web applications.
*   Ensure that all actions performed through the web applications are properly authorized.
*   Regularly review and audit authorization configurations.

## Threat: [Default Credentials or Weak Default Configurations](./threats/default_credentials_or_weak_default_configurations.md)

**Description:** Using default credentials for administrative accounts or relying on insecure default configurations (e.g., open ports, weak passwords) can provide an easy entry point for attackers.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the Camunda platform, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Camunda Core - Authentication and Authorization Modules, Deployment Configurations

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change all default administrative passwords immediately after installation.
*   Review and harden default configurations, disabling unnecessary features and securing network access.
*   Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.
