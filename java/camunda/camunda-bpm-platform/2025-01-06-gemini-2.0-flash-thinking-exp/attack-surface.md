# Attack Surface Analysis for camunda/camunda-bpm-platform

## Attack Surface: [BPMN Process Definition Injection](./attack_surfaces/bpmn_process_definition_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can upload or deploy malicious BPMN process definitions containing embedded scripts or service tasks that perform unintended actions.

**Camunda-bpm-platform Contribution:** The platform allows users with appropriate permissions to deploy and execute BPMN 2.0 XML files. This functionality can be abused if not properly controlled and validated.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a BPMN file with a service task containing a Groovy script that deletes files from the server's filesystem.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control policies for deploying process definitions.
*   Thoroughly review and sanitize all BPMN definitions before deployment, especially those from untrusted sources.
*   Disable or restrict the use of embedded scripting languages (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) if not absolutely necessary.
*   Implement a secure process for managing and updating process definitions.
*   Consider using a static analysis tool to scan BPMN definitions for potential security issues.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within the scripting engines (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) used by Camunda can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Camunda-bpm-platform Contribution:** Camunda allows embedding scripts within process definitions (e.g., in service tasks, listeners, gateways) for dynamic behavior.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious script within a process definition that leverages a known vulnerability in the Groovy engine to execute system commands.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the scripting engine libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Implement sandboxing or other security measures for the scripting environment.
*   Avoid using dynamic scripting where possible; prefer using Java delegates or external services.
*   Enforce strict input validation and output encoding for data used within scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Language Injection](./attack_surfaces/expression_language_injection.md)

**Description:** If user-controlled input is directly used within Camunda's expression language (e.g., JUEL) without proper sanitization, it can lead to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation.

**Camunda-bpm-platform Contribution:** Camunda uses expression language for evaluating conditions, accessing variables, and configuring various aspects of process execution.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a form field value that is used in a JUEL expression within a gateway condition, leading to the execution of a malicious method.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, workflow manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly using user input within expression language evaluations.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used in expressions.
*   Use parameterized expressions where possible.
*   Regularly review and audit expressions used within process definitions.

## Attack Surface: [REST API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/rest_api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of Camunda's REST API can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities.

**Camunda-bpm-platform Contribution:** Camunda provides a comprehensive REST API for interacting with the process engine, including deploying processes, managing instances, and accessing historical data.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the API authentication logic to gain access to administrative endpoints without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, manipulation of process instances, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
*   Implement robust authorization policies based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Regularly audit API access logs for suspicious activity.
*   Ensure proper configuration of authentication filters and security constraints.
*   Secure API endpoints using HTTPS.

## Attack Surface: [Process Engine Plugins Security](./attack_surfaces/process_engine_plugins_security.md)

**Description:** Custom or third-party process engine plugins may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code that can compromise the Camunda platform.

**Camunda-bpm-platform Contribution:** Camunda allows extending its functionality through process engine plugins.

**Example:** A malicious plugin is installed that provides a backdoor for unauthorized access or introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin's capabilities and vulnerabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
*   Thoroughly review the code of any custom or third-party plugins before deployment.
*   Implement a process for managing and updating plugins.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to plugin permissions.
