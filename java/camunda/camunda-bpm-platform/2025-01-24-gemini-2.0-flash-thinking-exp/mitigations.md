## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Process Definition Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_process_definition_authorization.md)

### Camunda BPM Platform - Specific Mitigation Strategies

#### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Process Definition Authorization

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles and Groups in Camunda:** Define user roles and groups within Camunda that align with your organization's access control needs for process definitions. Camunda's Identity Service can be used for user and group management, or integration with external systems like LDAP/Active Directory.
    2.  **Enable Authorization Service in Camunda Configuration:** Ensure the authorization service is enabled in your Camunda configuration file (e.g., `camunda.cfg.xml` or Spring Boot configuration). This activates Camunda's built-in authorization checks.
    3.  **Define Authorization Rules using Camunda APIs or Web Applications:** Utilize Camunda's Admin web application or REST API to create granular authorization rules specifically for process definitions.
        *   Grant permissions (e.g., `CREATE_DEFINITION`, `READ_DEFINITION`, `UPDATE_DEFINITION`, `DELETE_DEFINITION`) to defined roles or groups for the "Process Definition" resource type in Camunda.
        *   Restrict deployment permissions by granting `CREATE_DEFINITION` only to authorized roles (e.g., "process-admins").
        *   Consider using resource-specific authorizations to control access to individual process definitions by their keys or IDs.
    4.  **Camunda Engine Enforces Authorizations:** Camunda's engine will automatically enforce these configured authorization rules whenever users or applications attempt to deploy, access, or modify process definitions through Camunda APIs or web applications.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Camunda Authorizations:** Periodically review and audit the authorization configurations within Camunda to ensure they remain aligned with your security policies and organizational changes, using Camunda's Admin web application or APIs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Process Definition Deployment (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from deploying malicious or incorrect process definitions into the Camunda engine, leveraging Camunda's authorization framework.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Process Definitions (Medium Severity):** Protects sensitive business logic within process definitions from unauthorized viewing or modification through Camunda's APIs and web applications.
    *   **Process Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification of deployed process definitions within Camunda, ensuring process integrity.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Process Definition Deployment:** Risk reduced by 90% (Camunda authorization effectively controls deployment access).
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Process Definitions:** Risk reduced by 80% (Camunda authorization limits access based on defined roles).
    *   **Process Tampering:** Risk reduced by 85% (Camunda authorization restricts modification permissions).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Camunda authorization service is enabled. Basic group-based authorization is configured for Cockpit access within Camunda.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular authorization rules for process definition deployment within Camunda are missing. Deployment is currently open to developers group in Camunda.
    *   Resource-specific authorizations for individual process definitions in Camunda are not configured.
    *   Regular audits of Camunda authorization rules are not formally scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Process Definitions within Camunda](./mitigation_strategies/validate_process_definitions_within_camunda.md)

#### Mitigation Strategy: Validate Process Definitions within Camunda

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Camunda's BPMN Validation during Deployment:** Leverage Camunda's built-in BPMN validation feature, which is automatically active during process definition deployment to catch syntax errors and structural issues in BPMN XML.
    2.  **Develop Custom Validation Rules Specific to Camunda Elements:** Create custom validation logic to check for security-relevant aspects within Camunda process definitions *before* deployment to Camunda. This can be implemented as part of a deployment pipeline or as a manual check. Examples include:
        *   **External Task Endpoint Whitelisting for Camunda External Tasks:**  Validate that URLs used in Camunda external task definitions are within a predefined whitelist of trusted endpoints.
        *   **Script Task Language Restriction in Camunda:** Verify that script tasks in Camunda only use allowed scripting languages as configured in Camunda (or that scripting is disabled in Camunda if not needed).
        *   **Service Task Class Whitelisting for Camunda Java Delegates:** If using Java delegates in Camunda service tasks, whitelist allowed service task classes to prevent execution of arbitrary code through Camunda.
    3.  **Integrate Validation into Camunda Deployment Process:** Incorporate these validation steps into your process for deploying process definitions to Camunda, ideally within a CI/CD pipeline that deploys to Camunda.
    4.  **Fail Camunda Deployment on Validation Failure:** Configure your deployment process to prevent deployment to Camunda if any validation rule fails, ensuring only validated process definitions are deployed to the Camunda engine.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Process Definition Deployment to Camunda (High Severity):** Prevents deployment of process definitions containing malicious elements into Camunda, such as untrusted external task calls or insecure scripts within Camunda.
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities via Process Data in Camunda (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of injection attacks by validating input and output data handled within Camunda process definitions.
    *   **Configuration Errors Leading to Security Issues in Camunda (Medium Severity):** Catches misconfigurations in Camunda process definitions that could inadvertently create security loopholes within the Camunda environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Process Definition Deployment to Camunda:** Risk reduced by 75% (validation catches many common malicious patterns before deployment to Camunda).
    *   **Injection Vulnerabilities via Process Data in Camunda:** Risk reduced by 60% (validation helps sanitize data flow within Camunda processes).
    *   **Configuration Errors Leading to Security Issues in Camunda:** Risk reduced by 70% (validation identifies and prevents many configuration mistakes in Camunda).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Camunda's default BPMN validation is active during deployment to Camunda.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Custom validation rules for security aspects specific to Camunda elements (endpoint whitelisting for Camunda external tasks, script language restriction in Camunda, etc.) are not implemented.
    *   Deployment pipeline does not currently fail on validation failures when deploying to Camunda (only warnings are logged).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Scripting Languages in Camunda](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_scripting_languages_in_camunda.md)

#### Mitigation Strategy: Restrict Scripting Languages in Camunda

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Evaluate Scripting Necessity in Camunda Processes:**  Assess if scripting is truly required for process logic within your Camunda processes. Explore alternatives like Java delegates, external tasks, or FEEL expressions in Camunda if possible.
    2.  **Disable Scripting Engines in Camunda Configuration (If Possible):** If scripting is not essential for your Camunda processes, disable scripting engines entirely in Camunda's configuration (e.g., set `script-enabled="false"` in `camunda.cfg.xml` or Spring Boot properties for Camunda).
    3.  **Restrict Allowed Scripting Languages in Camunda (If Scripting Needed):** If scripting is necessary in Camunda, limit the allowed scripting languages to the most secure and least permissive options within Camunda's configuration. Configure the `script-engine-resolver` in Camunda to only allow specific languages (e.g., JavaScript with secure sandboxing, FEEL) and disallow others.
    4.  **Document Camunda Scripting Language Policy:** Clearly document the allowed scripting languages within Camunda and the rationale behind the restriction for developers working with Camunda processes.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Script Tasks in Camunda (Critical Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in scripting engines or insecure scripts within Camunda script tasks to execute arbitrary code on the Camunda server.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Script Tasks in Camunda (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of scripts within Camunda being used to access and leak sensitive information from the Camunda environment.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Script Tasks in Camunda (Medium Severity):** Mitigates the risk of scripts in Camunda causing performance issues or crashes due to inefficient or malicious code execution within Camunda.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Script Tasks in Camunda:** Risk reduced by 95% (disabling scripting in Camunda eliminates the primary RCE vector through Camunda scripts). If restricting languages in Camunda, risk reduction depends on the security of the chosen language and sandboxing, potentially reducing risk by 70-80%.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Script Tasks in Camunda:** Risk reduced by 80-90% (limiting scripting capabilities in Camunda restricts access to sensitive data within Camunda).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Script Tasks in Camunda:** Risk reduced by 70-80% (restricting scripting in Camunda reduces the potential for resource-intensive or malicious scripts within Camunda).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Scripting is enabled in Camunda with default settings, allowing multiple scripting languages within Camunda processes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Scripting engine restriction is not configured in Camunda. All default scripting languages are currently enabled in Camunda.
    *   Policy on scripting language usage within Camunda is not documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure External Task Communication with Camunda (HTTPS & mTLS)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_external_task_communication_with_camunda__https_&_mtls_.md)

#### Mitigation Strategy: Secure External Task Communication with Camunda (HTTPS & mTLS)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure HTTPS for Camunda Engine Access:** Ensure the Camunda engine is accessible via HTTPS. Configure your application server (e.g., Tomcat, WildFly, Spring Boot embedded server) hosting Camunda to use HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate. This secures communication *to* the Camunda engine.
    2.  **Enforce HTTPS in External Task Clients for Camunda:** When developing external task workers that interact with Camunda, configure them to *always* communicate with the Camunda engine using HTTPS endpoints for fetching and completing tasks. This ensures secure communication *from* external task clients *to* Camunda.
    3.  **Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Camunda External Tasks (Optional but Recommended):** For enhanced security of Camunda external task communication, implement mTLS.
        *   **Generate Client Certificates for Camunda External Task Workers:** Generate unique client certificates for each external task worker that will interact with Camunda.
        *   **Configure Camunda Engine for mTLS for External Tasks:** Configure the Camunda engine to *require* client certificates for all incoming HTTPS connections specifically for external task related endpoints. This is typically done in the application server configuration hosting Camunda.
        *   **Configure External Task Workers for mTLS with Camunda:** Configure external task workers to present their generated client certificates during HTTPS connections when communicating with the Camunda engine for external tasks.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Camunda External Task Communication (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on communication between Camunda and external task workers, potentially stealing sensitive data or manipulating task execution related to Camunda processes.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping during Camunda External Task Communication (Medium Severity):** Protects sensitive data exchanged between Camunda and external task workers from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties during Camunda process execution.
    *   **Unauthorized External Task Worker Impersonation with Camunda (Medium Severity - mitigated by mTLS):** With mTLS, prevents unauthorized systems from impersonating legitimate external task workers and interacting with the Camunda engine for external tasks, ensuring only authorized workers can process Camunda tasks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Camunda External Task Communication:** Risk reduced by 90% (HTTPS encryption makes interception and manipulation significantly harder for Camunda external task communication).
    *   **Data Eavesdropping during Camunda External Task Communication:** Risk reduced by 95% (HTTPS encryption protects data confidentiality during transit for Camunda external tasks).
    *   **Unauthorized External Task Worker Impersonation with Camunda (mTLS):** Risk reduced by 85% (mTLS provides strong authentication, making impersonation very difficult for Camunda external task workers).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Camunda engine is accessible via HTTPS.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   External task workers are not explicitly configured to enforce HTTPS communication with Camunda (though likely using HTTPS by default if Camunda endpoint is HTTPS).
    *   Mutual TLS (mTLS) is not implemented for Camunda external task communication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting for Camunda REST API (via API Gateway or Camunda Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_for_camunda_rest_api__via_api_gateway_or_camunda_configuration_.md)

#### Mitigation Strategy: Rate Limiting for Camunda REST API (via API Gateway or Camunda Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Rate Limiting using an API Gateway (Recommended):**  The most robust approach is to use an API Gateway in front of the Camunda REST API to enforce rate limiting. Configure the API Gateway to:
        *   Limit the number of requests from a single IP address or API client within a specific time window to the Camunda REST API.
        *   Define different rate limits for different API endpoints or user roles accessing the Camunda REST API.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting within Camunda Application (If API Gateway Not Available):** If an API Gateway is not feasible, explore options to implement rate limiting directly within the Camunda application. This might involve:
        *   Developing a custom filter or interceptor within the Camunda application to track and limit request rates to the Camunda REST API.
        *   Using a third-party rate limiting library integrated into the Camunda application.
    3.  **Configure Appropriate Rate Limits for Camunda REST API:** Define rate limits for the Camunda REST API that are appropriate for your expected traffic patterns and security needs. Start with conservative limits and adjust as needed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Camunda REST API:** Risk reduced by 80% (rate limiting effectively mitigates many types of DoS attacks targeting Camunda API).
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Camunda REST API Authentication:** Risk reduced by 70% (rate limiting slows down brute-force attempts, increasing detection and prevention chances for Camunda API).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Rate limiting is not currently configured for the Camunda REST API.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No API Gateway is currently used in front of the Camunda REST API for rate limiting.
    *   Rate limiting is not implemented within the Camunda application itself.
