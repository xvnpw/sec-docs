## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Critical Node:** The Camunda Engine itself. This is the core processing unit, and vulnerabilities here have the widest impact.

    *   **High-Risk Path: CVEs (Known):**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the Camunda engine or its dependencies.  This often involves using readily available exploit code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on patching frequency)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Can lead to full control, remote code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits may be publicly available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Signature-based detection, vulnerability scanners)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Regularly update Camunda to the latest stable version.
            *   Monitor the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and Camunda's security advisories.
            *   Perform vulnerability scanning.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Misconfiguration (Unrestricted Scripting):**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting misconfigurations that allow unrestricted execution of scripts (Java, Groovy, JavaScript) within the Camunda engine.  This allows attackers to inject and run malicious code.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Code execution, data manipulation, privilege escalation)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review, monitoring script execution)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enable Camunda's script security features (e.g., `scripting.enabled`).
            *   Use a whitelist approach for allowed scripts.
            *   Code review all scripts.
            *   Avoid inline scripts; use external, version-controlled scripts.
            *   Disable scripting if not needed.
            *   Strict Input Validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Admin Console](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_admin_console.md)

*   **Critical Node:** The Admin Console. This is the primary management interface, and compromise grants extensive control.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Weak/Default Credentials:**
        *   **Description:**  Gaining access to the Admin Console by using default credentials or easily guessable passwords.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If defaults aren't changed)
        *   **Impact:** High (Full administrative access)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Failed login attempts)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Change default passwords immediately after installation.
            *   Enforce strong password policies.
            *   Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).
            *   Limit access to the Admin Console (IP whitelisting).

    *   **High-Risk Path: Social Engineering (Phishing Admin):**
        *   **Description:** Tricking an administrator into revealing their credentials through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on user awareness)
        *   **Impact:** High (Full administrative access)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires user reporting, email analysis)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Provide security awareness training to administrators.
            *   Implement email security measures (anti-phishing filters).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Abuse External Task Integration](./attack_tree_paths/3__abuse_external_task_integration.md)

*   **Critical Node:** External Task Workers and their communication with the engine. These are often less secured than the core engine.
*   **Critical Node:** Scripting Mechanisms.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Scripts/Code:**
        *   **Description:**  Injecting malicious code into scripts used by external task workers. This allows for code execution on the worker and potentially the engine.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If scripting is not restricted)
        *   **Impact:** High (Code execution on external worker, potential engine compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review, monitoring external worker behavior)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Follow secure scripting guidelines (as with embedded scripts).
            *   Use secure communication (HTTPS).
            *   Authenticate external task workers.
            *   Strict Input Validation.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Data Exfiltration via External Task:**
        *   **Description:**  Using an external task to send sensitive data from the Camunda engine to an attacker-controlled external system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on network restrictions and monitoring)
        *   **Impact:** High (Data breach)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires network traffic analysis, data loss prevention)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Monitor network traffic from external task workers.
            *   Restrict network access of external task workers.
            *   Audit data sent to/from external task workers.
            *   Use encrypted communication.
