Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Script Task Code Injection" attack surface for a Camunda-based application, following the structure you outlined:

# Deep Analysis: Script Task Code Injection in Camunda

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with script task code injection within a Camunda BPM environment, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide developers with practical guidance to prevent this attack vector.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the attack surface described as "Script Task Code Injection (within Camunda's execution context)."  This includes:

*   **Scripting Languages:**  All scripting languages supported by Camunda (JavaScript, Groovy, Python/Jython, Ruby/JRuby).  We will pay particular attention to JavaScript and Groovy, as they are the most common.
*   **Script Task Types:**  All types of script tasks where Camunda executes user-provided or influenced code, including:
    *   Standard Script Tasks
    *   Service Tasks with script expressions
    *   Listener scripts (Task Listeners, Execution Listeners)
    *   Conditional expressions in sequence flows (if they use scripting)
    *   Input/Output mappings (if they use scripting)
*   **Data Sources:**  All potential sources of tainted data that could be used in scripts, including:
    *   Process variables (especially those populated from user input)
    *   External data sources accessed within the script
    *   Data passed from other process instances
*   **Camunda Configuration:**  Relevant Camunda engine configuration settings related to scripting and security.
*   **Deployment Environment:** The security context in which the Camunda engine is running (e.g., operating system user, permissions).

This analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities that are not directly related to Camunda's execution of scripts. For example, vulnerabilities in external systems accessed *by* a script are out of scope, although the *way* the script accesses them is in scope.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify specific attack scenarios and threat actors.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Examine Camunda's scripting engine and configuration options for potential weaknesses.
3.  **Code Review (Conceptual):**  Analyze example BPMN models and script task implementations to identify common vulnerabilities.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Develop detailed, practical mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration recommendations.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest specific testing techniques to verify the effectiveness of mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 2.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Threat Actors:**
    *   **External Attackers:**  Users who can submit data that influences process variables (e.g., through forms, APIs).
    *   **Malicious Insiders:**  Developers or administrators with access to modify process definitions or Camunda configuration.
    *   **Compromised Third-Party Systems:**  If a system that provides data to Camunda is compromised, it could inject malicious code.

*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Scenario 1: User Input Injection:** An attacker submits a form that populates a process variable.  This variable is then used directly within a JavaScript script task without sanitization. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code (e.g., ``;alert(1);//`) into the form field.
    *   **Scenario 2:  Malicious Process Definition:** A malicious insider modifies a BPMN process definition to include a script task with malicious code.  This could be done directly in the XML or through the Camunda Modeler.
    *   **Scenario 3:  Data Exfiltration:** An attacker injects code that accesses sensitive data within the Camunda engine's context (e.g., other process variables, database connections) and sends it to an external server.
    *   **Scenario 4:  System Command Execution:**  An attacker injects code that leverages the scripting engine's capabilities to execute system commands (e.g., using `java.lang.Runtime` in Groovy or `child_process` in Node.js if the engine is configured to allow it).
    * **Scenario 5: Denial of Service:** An attacker injects a script that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) causing the Camunda engine to become unresponsive. For example, an infinite loop or a very large allocation.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis

*   **Default Scripting Engine Behavior:** Camunda, by default, does *not* provide a sandboxed scripting environment.  The scripting engine (e.g., Nashorn for JavaScript, the built-in Groovy engine) has access to the full Java API and can potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **Configuration Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of `scriptEngineName` Restriction:** If the `scriptEngineName` is not explicitly configured and restricted, an attacker might be able to influence the choice of scripting engine, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in a less secure engine.
    *   **Missing Security Manager:**  If a Java Security Manager is not enabled and properly configured, scripts can perform actions that should be restricted (e.g., file system access, network connections).
    *   **Overly Permissive Class Filter:** If a class filter is used (e.g., with GraalVM JavaScript), but it's too permissive, it might allow access to dangerous classes.
*   **BPMN Modeling Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Direct Use of Unsanitized Variables:**  The most common vulnerability is directly embedding process variables within script tasks without any sanitization or escaping.
    *   **Inline Scripts:**  Using inline scripts makes it harder to audit and control the code.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Not validating user input *before* it's stored in process variables.

### 2.3 Code Review (Conceptual)

**Vulnerable Example (JavaScript):**

```bpmn
<bpmn:scriptTask id="ScriptTask_1" name="Process User Input" scriptFormat="javascript">
  <bpmn:script>
    var userInput = execution.getVariable("userInput");
    // Vulnerability: Directly using userInput without sanitization
    execution.setVariable("processedInput", "Hello, " + userInput);
  </bpmn:script>
</bpmn:scriptTask>
```

**Vulnerable Example (Groovy):**

```bpmn
<bpmn:scriptTask id="ScriptTask_2" name="Execute System Command" scriptFormat="groovy">
  <bpmn:script>
    def command = execution.getVariable("command");
    // Vulnerability: Executing arbitrary system commands
    def proc = command.execute();
    proc.waitFor();
    execution.setVariable("output", proc.text);
  </bpmn:script>
</bpmn:scriptTask>
```

**Vulnerable Example (Listener - Groovy):**

```bpmn
<bpmn:serviceTask id="ServiceTask_1" name="Send Email">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <camunda:taskListener event="create" scriptFormat="groovy">
      <camunda:script>
        def userEmail = execution.getVariable("userEmail");
        // Vulnerability: Potential for email header injection if userEmail is not sanitized
        println "Sending email to: " + userEmail;
      </camunda:script>
    </camunda:taskListener>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Refinement

1.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Validation:**  Validate *all* user input *before* it's stored in process variables.  Use strict whitelists for allowed characters and formats.  Reject any input that doesn't conform.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Even after validation, sanitize data *before* using it in scripts.  Use appropriate sanitization techniques for the specific scripting language and context.  For example:
        *   **JavaScript:** Use a library like `DOMPurify` (if the output is HTML) or a custom function to escape special characters.  Avoid `eval()` and similar functions.
        *   **Groovy:**  Use `StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaScript()` or `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4()` from Apache Commons Text, depending on the context.
    *   **Example (JavaScript - Improved):**

        ```javascript
        var userInput = execution.getVariable("userInput");
        // Sanitize userInput (example - replace with a robust library)
        var sanitizedInput = userInput.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s]/g, "");
        execution.setVariable("processedInput", "Hello, " + sanitizedInput);
        ```

2.  **Sandboxed Scripting Engine:**
    *   **GraalVM JavaScript:**  Use GraalVM JavaScript with a restricted context.  This provides a much more secure environment than Nashorn.
        *   **Configuration (camunda.cfg.xml):**

            ```xml
            <property name="scriptEngineName">graal.js</property>
            <property name="scriptEngineHostAccess">NONE</property>  <!-- Or 'INHERIT' with careful class filtering -->
            <property name="scriptEngineNashornCompat">false</property>
            ```
        *   **Class Filtering (with `scriptEngineHostAccess` set to `INHERIT`):**  Create a `META-INF/resources/allowlist.json` file to specify allowed classes.  Be *extremely* restrictive.  Example:

            ```json
            {
              "classes": [
                "java.lang.String",
                "java.util.ArrayList",
                "java.util.HashMap"
              ],
              "methods": []
            }
            ```

    *   **Custom Script Engine:**  Implement a custom `ScriptEngineFactory` that wraps a secure scripting engine (e.g., a sandboxed JavaScript engine) and enforces strict security policies.

3.  **External Scripts:**
    *   Store scripts in external files (e.g., `.js`, `.groovy`) and reference them in the BPMN model.
    *   **Example (BPMN):**

        ```bpmn
        <bpmn:scriptTask id="ScriptTask_3" name="Process Data" scriptFormat="javascript">
          <bpmn:script>resource:classpath:scripts/processData.js</bpmn:script>
        </bpmn:scriptTask>
        ```

    *   This allows for:
        *   **Code Review:**  Easier to review and audit external scripts.
        *   **Version Control:**  Track changes to scripts using a version control system.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the scripts.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Run the Camunda engine with the minimum necessary operating system user privileges.
    *   Restrict the Java Security Manager to allow only the required permissions for the Camunda engine and the scripting engine.
    *   If using a database, use a database user with limited privileges.

5.  **Code Review (Process Definitions):**
    *   Establish a mandatory code review process for all BPMN process definitions.
    *   Focus on how scripts are used and how data is passed to them.
    *   Use a checklist to ensure that all mitigation strategies are followed.

6. **Disable Scripting Where Not Needed:**
    * If a particular process or task does not require scripting, disable it entirely. This reduces the attack surface.

7. **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) Protection:**
    * If regular expressions are used within scripts (or for input validation), ensure they are not vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. Use safe regular expression libraries or carefully craft expressions to avoid catastrophic backtracking.

### 2.5 Testing Recommendations

1.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Use a fuzzer to generate a large number of random and malformed inputs to test the input validation and sanitization logic.
2.  **Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other testing techniques.
3.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to scan the BPMN models and external scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
4.  **Dynamic Analysis:**  Use a debugger to step through the execution of script tasks and observe the behavior of the scripting engine.
5.  **Security Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests that specifically target the security aspects of script tasks, such as input validation and sanitization.  Example (using a testing framework like JUnit):

    ```java
    @Test
    public void testScriptTaskSanitization() {
        // Set up a process instance with a malicious input
        runtimeService.startProcessInstanceByKey("myProcess",
            Variables.createVariables().putValue("userInput", "<script>alert(1)</script>"));

        // Execute the script task
        // ...

        // Assert that the output is sanitized
        String processedInput = (String) runtimeService.getVariable(processInstance.getId(), "processedInput");
        assertFalse(processedInput.contains("<script>"));
    }
    ```
6. **Regression Testing:** After implementing mitigations, run regression tests to ensure that existing functionality is not broken.

## 3. Conclusion

Script task code injection is a serious vulnerability in Camunda BPM applications. By following the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  Regular testing and ongoing security reviews are essential to maintain a secure environment. The most important takeaways are:

*   **Never trust user input:**  Always validate and sanitize data before using it in scripts.
*   **Use a sandboxed scripting engine:**  GraalVM JavaScript with a restricted context is a good option.
*   **Externalize scripts:**  Store scripts in external files for better control and auditing.
*   **Principle of least privilege:**  Run Camunda with minimal permissions.
*   **Continuous testing:**  Regularly test for vulnerabilities using a variety of techniques.
