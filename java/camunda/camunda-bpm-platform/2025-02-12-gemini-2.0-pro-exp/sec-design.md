# BUSINESS POSTURE

Camunda BPM is a platform for workflow and decision automation. It's used by businesses to automate core processes, improving efficiency and visibility. Based on the GitHub repository, here's a breakdown of the business posture:

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and reliable platform for workflow and decision automation.
*   Offer a flexible and extensible platform that can be adapted to various business needs.
*   Enable developers to easily design, implement, and manage workflows and decisions.
*   Ensure scalability and performance to handle large volumes of transactions.
*   Provide tools for monitoring and analyzing workflow execution.
*   Maintain an active open-source community and ecosystem.

Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive business process data.
*   System downtime or performance degradation impacting critical business operations.
*   Incorrect or flawed workflow definitions leading to business errors or compliance violations.
*   Lack of auditability and traceability of workflow executions.
*   Vulnerabilities in the platform or its dependencies that could be exploited by attackers.
*   Difficulty in integrating with existing enterprise systems.
*   Inability to scale to meet growing business demands.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication mechanisms for users and API clients (e.g., HTTP Basic, OAuth 2.0). Described in Camunda documentation and implementation.
*   security control: Authorization framework to control access to resources and operations based on roles and permissions. Described in Camunda documentation and implementation.
*   security control: Encryption of data in transit using TLS/SSL. Described in Camunda documentation and implementation.
*   security control: Input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection). Described in Camunda documentation and implementation.
*   security control: Audit logging to track user actions and system events. Described in Camunda documentation and implementation.
*   security control: Regular security updates and patches to address vulnerabilities. Described in Camunda documentation and implementation.
*   security control: Secure configuration guidelines and best practices. Described in Camunda documentation.
*   security control: Support for external identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory). Described in Camunda documentation and implementation.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The platform relies on the security of the underlying infrastructure (e.g., operating system, database, network).
*   accepted risk: The security of custom scripts and extensions developed by users is the responsibility of the users.
*   accepted risk: The platform may be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks if not properly configured and protected.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust secrets management solution to securely store and manage sensitive configuration data (e.g., API keys, passwords).
*   Integrate with a centralized security information and event management (SIEM) system for real-time threat detection and response.
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate the platform from other systems and limit the impact of potential breaches.
*   Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address security weaknesses.
*   Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web-based attacks.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Strong password policies and enforcement.
    *   Secure session management with appropriate timeouts.
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks.
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and permissions.
    *   Principle of least privilege.
    *   Regular review and auditing of user permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Encoding of output data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS).
    *   Protection against other common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, SQL Injection).
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Encryption of sensitive data at rest.
*   Auditing:
    *   Comprehensive audit logging of all security-relevant events.
    *   Secure storage and protection of audit logs.
    *   Regular review and analysis of audit logs.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") --> GitHub("GitHub Repository")
    GitHub --> GitHubActions("GitHub Actions")
    GitHubActions -- "Build & Test" --> Maven("Maven")
    Maven -- "SAST" --> FindBugs("FindBugs")

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions triggers a build workflow.
3.  Maven is used to manage dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package the application.
4.  Security checks are performed during the build process:
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using FindBugs to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    *   Dependency checking using OWASP Dependency-Check to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    *   Unit and integration tests using JUnit to ensure code quality and functionality.
5.  Build artifacts (JAR, WAR, Docker Image) are created.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: SAST (FindBugs).
*   security control: Dependency checking (OWASP Dependency-Check).
