## Mitigation Strategy: [Process Definition Validation (Camunda-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/process_definition_validation__camunda-centric_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Strict Pre-Deployment Process Definition Validation (Camunda-Integrated)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Deployment API:** Utilize Camunda's Deployment API (Java or REST) to intercept process definitions *before* they are persisted to the engine's database.
    2.  **Custom Parse Listener:** Implement a custom `BpmnParseListener` (or equivalent for DMN/CMMN) within a Camunda process application. This listener will be invoked by the engine during the parsing of the BPMN XML.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic:** Within the `BpmnParseListener`, access the parsed BPMN model elements (activities, gateways, expressions, etc.) and apply your validation rules:
        *   **Complexity Checks:** Traverse the model to count elements, check nesting depth, and estimate loop iterations.
        *   **Expression Analysis:**  Parse expressions (using Camunda's expression API) and check against a whitelist of allowed functions and operators.
        *   **Script Validation:** If scripts are used, access the script content and perform static analysis (if possible) or at least check for known dangerous patterns.
        *   **Connector Configuration:** Inspect connector configurations (e.g., HTTP connector URLs, authentication details) for security best practices.
    4.  **Throw Exceptions:** If any validation rule fails, throw a `BpmnParseException` (or a custom exception) from the `BpmnParseListener`. This will prevent the process definition from being deployed.
    5.  **Unit Testing:** Thoroughly unit test your `BpmnParseListener` to ensure it correctly identifies and blocks invalid process definitions.
    6. **Configuration:** Ensure the process application containing the parse listener is deployed *before* any process definitions that need to be validated.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Process Definitions (High Severity):** Prevents deployment of processes designed to cause DoS, execute arbitrary code, or bypass security controls.
    *   **Accidental Errors (Medium Severity):** Catches unintentional errors in process design.
    *   **Expression Injection (High Severity):** Prevents malicious code injection through expressions.
    *   **Script Injection (High Severity):** Prevents malicious code injection through scripts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Process Definitions:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
    *   **Accidental Errors:** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).
    *   **Expression Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
    *   **Script Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Not implemented.  Relies on external validation (which is partially implemented).

*   **Missing Implementation:**  A custom `BpmnParseListener` with comprehensive validation logic is not implemented within a Camunda process application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Scripting and Expression Handling (Camunda Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_scripting_and_expression_handling__camunda_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Restrict Scripting and Secure Expression Evaluation (Camunda Engine Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Unused Engines:**  In the Camunda configuration (`bpm-platform.xml` or Spring Boot configuration), disable any scripting engines that are not absolutely required.  For example:
        ```xml
        <property name="scriptingEngines">
          <map>
            <entry key="javascript" value="graal.js" />
            <!-- Groovy, Python, etc. are NOT included -->
          </map>
        </property>
        ```
    2.  **Configure Secure Scripting Engine (GraalVM JS):** If using JavaScript, configure the GraalVM JS engine with security restrictions within the Camunda configuration:
        ```xml
        <property name="scriptEngineProperties">
          <map>
            <entry key="javascript">
              <map>
                <entry key="engine.WarnInterpreterOnly" value="true" />
                <entry key="js.nashorn-compat" value="false" />
                <entry key="polyglot.js.allowHostAccess" value="false" />
                <entry key="polyglot.js.allowHostClassLookup" value="false" />
                <entry key="polyglot.js.allowIO" value="false" />
                <entry key="polyglot.js.allowNativeAccess" value="false" />
                <entry key="polyglot.js.allowCreateThread" value="false" />
                <entry key="polyglot.js.allowHostClassLoading" value="false" />
                <!-- Add a custom ClassFilter if needed -->
              </map>
            </entry>
          </map>
        </property>
        ```
    3. **Custom ClassFilter (Advanced):** Create a custom Java class that implements `org.graalvm.polyglot.Value` and acts as a `ClassFilter`. This filter will be used by GraalVM JS to restrict access to Java classes.  Only allow access to specific, safe classes.  Register this `ClassFilter` in the Camunda configuration.
    4. **Typed Variables:** Use typed variables (e.g., `SpinJsonNode`, `SpinXmlNode`, `ObjectValue`) instead of raw strings whenever possible. This helps to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    5. **Contextualize Variables:** When passing variables to scripts, use the `VariableScope` API to provide context and type information.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Script Injection (High Severity):**  Reduces the attack surface and restricts script capabilities.
    *   **Expression Injection (High Severity):**  Limits the potential for malicious code execution.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Resource limits (if configured) prevent DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Script Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (85-90%).
    *   **Expression Injection:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced moderately (60-70%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Partially implemented.  Groovy is disabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive GraalVM JS configuration with security restrictions (including a `ClassFilter`) is not fully implemented. Typed variables are not consistently used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API and User Interface Security (Camunda Authorization)](./mitigation_strategies/api_and_user_interface_security__camunda_authorization_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Secure API Access via Camunda's Authorization Service

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authorization:** Ensure that authorization is enabled in the Camunda configuration (`bpm-platform.xml` or Spring Boot):
        ```xml
        <property name="authorizationEnabled" value="true" />
        ```
    2.  **Define Resources and Permissions:**  Use Camunda's authorization framework to define granular permissions for users and groups.  This involves:
        *   **Resources:**  Define which Camunda resources are subject to authorization (e.g., `PROCESS_DEFINITION`, `PROCESS_INSTANCE`, `TASK`, `DEPLOYMENT`).
        *   **Permissions:**  Define the actions that can be performed on each resource (e.g., `READ`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE_INSTANCE`, `READ_INSTANCE`).
        *   **Authorizations:**  Create authorizations that grant specific permissions on specific resources to specific users or groups.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and groups.  For example, a user who only needs to complete tasks should not have permission to deploy process definitions.
    4.  **Use Built-in Permissions:** Leverage Camunda's built-in permission constants (e.g., `Permissions.READ`, `Resources.PROCESS_DEFINITION`) for consistency.
    5.  **Regular Review:**  Regularly review and update user roles and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate.
    6. **Admin Group:** Carefully control membership in the `camunda-admin` group (or equivalent), as this group typically has full access.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):**  Prevents unauthorized access to Camunda's REST API and web applications.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):**  Prevents users from gaining unauthorized access.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):**  Limits access to sensitive data.
    *   **Process Manipulation (High Severity):**  Controls who can start, stop, or modify processes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced significantly (85-90%).
    *   **Process Manipulation:** Risk reduced significantly (90-95%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Partially implemented.  Authorization is enabled, and basic roles are defined.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Fine-grained permissions are not consistently applied across all resources.  Regular reviews of authorizations are not performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Engine Configuration (Camunda-Specific Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/engine_configuration__camunda-specific_settings_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Harden Camunda Engine Configuration

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  In the Camunda configuration (`bpm-platform.xml` or Spring Boot), disable any features that are not required:
        *   **History Cleanup:** If you don't need to automatically clean up historical data, disable the history cleanup job.
        *   **Job Executor:** If you are not using asynchronous continuations or timers, disable the job executor.
        *   **Telemetry:** Disable telemetry if you do not want to send usage data to Camunda.
    2.  **Restrict History Levels:**  Configure the history level (`historyLevel`) to the minimum necessary level.  Higher history levels store more data, which could increase the impact of a data breach.  Consider `audit` or `full` only when strictly necessary.
    3.  **Secure Default User:** Change the default administrator user (`demo`) and password immediately after installation.
    4. **Configure Failed Job Handling:** Configure appropriate settings for handling failed jobs, including retry attempts and error handling. Prevent infinite retries.
    5. **Audit Logging:** Enable and configure audit logging to capture security-relevant events, such as user logins, authorization checks, and process definition deployments. Use Camunda's `HistoryService` and configure appropriate event listeners.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the attack surface by disabling unused features.
    *   **Data Exposure (Medium Severity):**  Limits the amount of historical data stored.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Proper failed job handling prevents resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced moderately (60-70%).
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced moderately (50-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Partially implemented. The history level is set to `audit`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Unnecessary features (telemetry) are not explicitly disabled.  The default administrator user and password have *not* been changed.  Comprehensive audit logging is not configured. Failed job handling is not optimized.
