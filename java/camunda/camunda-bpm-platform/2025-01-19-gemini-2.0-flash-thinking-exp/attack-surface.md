# Attack Surface Analysis for camunda/camunda-bpm-platform

## Attack Surface: [Process Definition Injection](./attack_surfaces/process_definition_injection.md)

* **Description:** Malicious actors can inject or modify process definitions (BPMN XML) within the Camunda engine.
    * **How Camunda-BPM-Platform Contributes:** Camunda provides mechanisms for deploying and updating process definitions via the REST API, web interface (Cockpit), and potentially through shared file systems. If these mechanisms lack sufficient authorization or input validation, they become attack vectors.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the deployment endpoint of the REST API (due to weak authentication) and uploads a modified process definition that includes a script task executing arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Camunda server, manipulation of business logic, data breaches, and denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for all deployment mechanisms (REST API, Cockpit).
        * Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for uploaded process definitions.
        * Consider using digitally signed process definitions to ensure integrity.
        * Regularly audit deployed process definitions for unexpected changes.
        * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can deploy or modify process definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Process Instance Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/process_instance_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** Unauthorized modification of running process instances, including variables, task assignments, and execution flow.
    * **How Camunda-BPM-Platform Contributes:** Camunda exposes APIs and UI components (Tasklist, Cockpit) that allow interaction with running process instances. Weak authorization checks on these components can allow unauthorized manipulation.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Tasklist API to complete a task that they are not assigned to, potentially bypassing required approvals or steps in a business process.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions within business processes, financial loss, and regulatory non-compliance.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement fine-grained authorization checks on all process instance manipulation APIs and UI components.
        * Utilize Camunda's built-in authorization service and configure it appropriately.
        * Regularly review and audit authorization configurations.
        * Implement audit logging for all process instance modifications.

## Attack Surface: [External Task Client Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/external_task_client_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** Compromising external task clients or the communication channel between them and the Camunda engine.
    * **How Camunda-BPM-Platform Contributes:** Camunda relies on external task clients to perform work outside the engine. If the communication is not secured or the clients themselves are vulnerable, attackers can intercept or manipulate task data.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts the communication between an external task client and the Camunda engine and modifies the variables associated with a task, leading to incorrect processing.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of external systems, and disruption of business processes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the communication channel between Camunda and external task clients using TLS/SSL.
        * Implement authentication and authorization for external task clients.
        * Ensure external task clients are developed and maintained securely, following secure coding practices.
        * Regularly audit the security of external task clients and their deployment environments.

## Attack Surface: [Camunda Connectors Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/camunda_connectors_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within specific Camunda Connector implementations to access or manipulate connected external systems.
    * **How Camunda-BPM-Platform Contributes:** Camunda Connectors provide integration points with external systems. Vulnerabilities in these connectors (developed by Camunda or third parties) can expose those systems.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in a database connector allows an attacker to inject SQL queries through process variables, leading to unauthorized data access or modification in the connected database.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches in connected systems, unauthorized actions in external applications, and disruption of integrated services.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use only trusted and well-maintained Camunda Connectors.
        * Keep Camunda Connectors updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Review the code of custom connectors for security vulnerabilities.
        * Implement the principle of least privilege for connector configurations and credentials.

## Attack Surface: [REST API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rest_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Camunda REST API to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions.
    * **How Camunda-BPM-Platform Contributes:** The Camunda REST API exposes a wide range of functionalities for managing and interacting with the process engine. Improperly secured or implemented endpoints can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a lack of rate limiting on the process instance creation endpoint to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Camunda engine.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of process instances, denial of service, and remote code execution (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for all REST API endpoints (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
        * Enforce input validation and sanitization for all API requests.
        * Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse.
        * Regularly audit the security of the REST API endpoints.
        * Disable or restrict access to unnecessary API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

* **Description:** Circumventing Camunda's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
    * **How Camunda-BPM-Platform Contributes:** Weaknesses in the configuration or implementation of Camunda's authentication (e.g., basic auth, LDAP, custom plugins) or authorization (e.g., user groups, permissions) can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits default credentials or a misconfigured authentication plugin to gain administrative access to the Camunda Cockpit.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Camunda platform, access to sensitive data, and the ability to manipulate all aspects of the process engine.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enforce strong password policies for Camunda users and API clients.
        * Avoid using default credentials and change them immediately after installation.
        * Securely configure authentication providers (LDAP, Active Directory, etc.).
        * Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
        * Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.
