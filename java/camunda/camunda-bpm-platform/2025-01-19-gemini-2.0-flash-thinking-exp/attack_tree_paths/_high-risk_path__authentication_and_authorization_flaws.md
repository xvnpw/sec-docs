    * **Description:**  The application fails to properly enforce authorization checks, allowing users to access resources or perform actions they are not permitted to. This often involves manipulating object identifiers (IDs) in requests.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Users can access sensitive data belonging to other users, modify or delete data they shouldn't, or execute unauthorized processes.
    * **Camunda Specific Considerations:**  Accessing process instances, tasks, or deployment definitions that the user is not authorized to view or modify. Manipulating task IDs or process instance IDs in API calls.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust authorization checks on all access points.
        * Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly to users.
        * Use access control lists (ACLs) or role-based access control (RBAC).
        * Implement proper input validation and sanitization.

* **4.2.2 Privilege Escalation:**
    * **Description:**  Attackers find ways to gain higher privileges than they are initially granted. This can be horizontal (accessing resources of users with the same privilege level) or vertical (gaining administrative privileges).
    * **Potential Impact:**  Attackers can perform actions reserved for administrators, leading to significant damage and control over the application.
    * **Camunda Specific Considerations:**  Gaining access to administrative functionalities in Camunda Cockpit or Admin, or escalating privileges within custom application roles.
