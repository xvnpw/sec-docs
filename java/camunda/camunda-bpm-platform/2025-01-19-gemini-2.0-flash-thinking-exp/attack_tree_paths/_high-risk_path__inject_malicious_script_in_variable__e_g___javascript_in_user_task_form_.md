## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Script in Variable (e.g., JavaScript in User Task Form)

**Attack Description:**

This attack path focuses on injecting malicious scripts, such as JavaScript, into variables within the Camunda BPM platform. A common entry point for this is through User Task Forms. An attacker could manipulate input fields within a form to include malicious code that gets stored as a variable value. When this variable is subsequently used and rendered by the application (e.g., displayed in another form, used in a notification, or processed by a script task), the injected script can be executed within the user's browser or the server environment, depending on the context.

**Attack Vector:**

The primary attack vector for this path is through **unvalidated user input** within User Task Forms. Specifically:

1. **Malicious Input in User Task Form Fields:** An attacker, potentially an authenticated user or someone exploiting a vulnerability allowing them to interact with a task, enters malicious JavaScript code into a form field.
2. **Variable Storage:** When the User Task is completed or the form is submitted, the value from the manipulated field is stored as a process variable.
3. **Variable Retrieval and Rendering:**  Later in the process execution, this variable is retrieved and used in a context where it is rendered, such as:
    * **Displaying the variable in another User Task Form:** If the variable is used to populate a field in a subsequent form, the browser will execute the injected JavaScript.
    * **Using the variable in a notification email:** Depending on how the email template is constructed, the injected script could be executed by the email client (though less likely due to email security measures).
    * **Processing the variable in a Script Task:** If the variable is used within a Script Task (e.g., using Groovy or JavaScript), the malicious script could be executed on the server. This is a particularly high-risk scenario.
    * **Displaying the variable in a Camunda Cockpit view:**  If the variable is displayed in the Cockpit interface without proper sanitization, it could potentially execute malicious scripts for administrators.
    * **Using the variable in a custom web application interacting with the Camunda API:** If a separate application retrieves and displays this variable, it could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Technical Details and Potential Vulnerabilities:**

* **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:** The most critical vulnerability is the absence of robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side when processing data from User Task Forms. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary code.
* **Insecure Output Encoding:** When the variable containing the malicious script is rendered, the application might not properly encode the output to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code. This is the core issue leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
* **Insufficient Contextual Output Encoding:** Different contexts require different encoding strategies. For example, HTML encoding is needed for displaying in HTML, while URL encoding is needed for embedding in URLs. Failure to use the correct encoding for the specific output context can lead to successful script execution.
* **Reliance on Client-Side Validation:**  Client-side validation can be bypassed by attackers. Server-side validation is crucial for security.
* **Permissions and Access Control:**  If unauthorized users can interact with tasks and input data, the attack surface increases.
* **Vulnerabilities in Custom UI Components:** If custom UI components are used in User Task Forms, they might have their own vulnerabilities that allow script injection.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

The impact of successfully injecting malicious scripts can be severe and include:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    * **Stealing User Credentials:**  The injected script can steal session cookies or other sensitive information from users interacting with the application.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions and perform actions on their behalf.
    * **Defacement:** The application's UI can be altered or defaced.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users can be redirected to phishing sites or other malicious domains.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data displayed on the page can be exfiltrated.
* **Server-Side Code Execution (if injected script is executed in a Script Task):**
    * **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored in the Camunda database or connected systems.
    * **System Compromise:** Potential to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Camunda platform.
    * **Denial of Service:**  Malicious scripts could consume resources and lead to a denial of service.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode trust.
* **Compliance Violations:**  Depending on the nature of the data handled by the application, a breach could lead to regulatory fines and penalties.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Server-Side Validation:** Implement strict server-side validation for all user inputs in User Task Forms. Validate data types, formats, and lengths.
    * **Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters and code. Use appropriate libraries and functions for sanitization.
    * **Whitelist Approach:**  Prefer a whitelist approach for input validation, allowing only known good patterns and rejecting everything else.
* **Secure Output Encoding:**
    * **Contextual Output Encoding:**  Encode data appropriately based on the context where it will be rendered.
        * **HTML Encoding:** Use HTML entity encoding (e.g., using libraries like OWASP Java Encoder) when displaying data in HTML to prevent the browser from interpreting HTML tags and JavaScript.
        * **JavaScript Encoding:** Encode data for use within JavaScript code.
        * **URL Encoding:** Encode data for inclusion in URLs.
    * **Template Engines with Auto-Escaping:** Utilize template engines that offer automatic output escaping by default (e.g., Thymeleaf with its default settings). Ensure auto-escaping is enabled and configured correctly.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement and Enforce CSP:**  Configure a strong Content Security Policy to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks.
    * **`script-src` Directive:**  Carefully configure the `script-src` directive to restrict the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted sources. Consider using nonces or hashes for inline scripts.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Restrict User Permissions:** Ensure users only have the necessary permissions to interact with tasks and data. Limit the ability of potentially malicious users to inject scripts.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct Regular Audits:**  Perform regular security audits of the application code and configuration to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses.
* **Secure Development Practices:**
    * **Security Training for Developers:**  Educate developers on secure coding practices, including how to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Code Reviews:**  Implement thorough code reviews to identify potential security flaws before deployment.
    * **Static and Dynamic Analysis Tools:**  Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
* **Camunda BPM Platform Security Features:**
    * **Review Camunda Security Documentation:**  Stay up-to-date with the latest security recommendations and features provided by the Camunda BPM platform.
    * **Consider Using Form Field Validation in Camunda:** Explore the built-in form field validation capabilities within Camunda to enforce basic input constraints.
* **Escaping in Script Tasks:** If variables containing user input are used within Script Tasks, ensure proper escaping or sanitization is performed within the script before any potentially dangerous operations are executed.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Script in Variable (e.g., JavaScript in User Task Form)" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications built on the Camunda BPM platform. The lack of proper input validation and output encoding creates opportunities for attackers to inject malicious scripts, leading to various forms of XSS and potentially even server-side code execution.
