# Threat Model Analysis for camunda/camunda-bpm-platform

## Threat: [Malicious Process Definition Deployment](./threats/malicious_process_definition_deployment.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to deployment mechanisms (e.g., compromised credentials for the REST API or deployment directory) deploys a crafted BPMN process definition. This definition contains malicious code within script tasks, execution listeners, or connectors. Upon instantiation and execution of this process, the embedded malicious code is executed by the Camunda engine.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Camunda server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. The attacker could gain full control of the server or use it as a pivot point for further attacks.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Process Definition Deployment, Script Task Execution, Execution Listeners, Connectors.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for all deployment mechanisms.
* Perform static analysis of process definitions before deployment to identify potentially malicious code.
* Consider disabling or restricting the use of scripting features if not strictly necessary.
* Implement a code review process for all process definitions.
* Use a secure deployment pipeline with automated checks.
* Regularly audit deployed process definitions.

## Threat: [Process Definition Tampering](./threats/process_definition_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., compromised administrative account) modifies existing, legitimate process definitions. They inject malicious logic or alter the workflow to their advantage, potentially redirecting sensitive data, triggering unauthorized actions, or disrupting business processes.

**Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access to resources, disruption of business operations, financial loss, and reputational damage. The attacker could subtly alter processes to exfiltrate data over time or cause significant operational failures.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Process Definition Management, REST API (Process Definition endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement granular access control for modifying process definitions, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
* Maintain an audit log of all changes made to process definitions, including who made the change and when.
* Implement version control for process definitions to track changes and allow for rollback.
* Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of process definitions.

## Threat: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities Exploitation](./threats/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities within the scripting engines used by Camunda (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) when executing embedded scripts in process definitions or during task completion. This could involve exploiting deserialization flaws or other code execution vulnerabilities within the scripting engine itself.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the Camunda server, potentially leading to full system compromise. The attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Camunda engine.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Script Task Execution, Execution Listeners.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Camunda and its scripting engine dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Consider using a more secure scripting language or avoiding scripting altogether if possible.
* Implement sandboxing or containerization for script execution to limit the impact of vulnerabilities.
* Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in used libraries.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Process Execution](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_process_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker deploys or triggers the execution of a process definition designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, database connections). This could involve infinite loops, excessive parallel execution, or resource-intensive service tasks.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the Camunda platform and dependent applications unavailable. This can disrupt business operations and lead to financial losses.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Process Instance Execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement safeguards against runaway processes, such as timeouts for tasks and process instances.
* Set limits on the number of concurrent process instances.
* Monitor resource usage of the Camunda platform and set up alerts for unusual activity.
* Implement mechanisms to terminate or suspend problematic process instances.
* Perform performance testing of process definitions before deployment.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Process Variables](./threats/data_exposure_through_process_variables.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data stored in process variables is accessed by unauthorized users or systems due to insufficient access controls or insecure logging practices. This could occur through the REST API or direct database access if not properly secured.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive business data, potential legal and regulatory repercussions.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Process Variable Management, REST API (Process Instance and Task endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement granular access control for accessing and modifying process variables based on user roles and permissions.
* Encrypt sensitive data stored in process variables at rest and in transit.
* Carefully configure logging to avoid capturing sensitive information in logs.
* Regularly review access control configurations.

## Threat: [Process Instance Manipulation](./threats/process_instance_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with unauthorized access to process instance management functions (e.g., through a compromised API key or session) manipulates running process instances. This could involve modifying variables, completing tasks out of order, cancelling instances, or injecting malicious data into the workflow.

**Impact:** Disruption of business processes, data corruption, unauthorized actions being performed, and potential financial loss.

**Affected Component:** BPMN Engine - Process Instance Management, REST API (Process Instance and Task endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all process instance management operations.
* Implement audit logging of all modifications to process instances.
* Use secure session management practices.
* Validate user inputs and data received from external systems before updating process variables.

## Threat: [REST API Vulnerabilities](./threats/rest_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Camunda REST API (beyond standard web API security concerns like injection flaws). This could include authentication bypasses, authorization flaws, or vulnerabilities in custom API extensions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to engine functionality, deployment of malicious processes, manipulation of process instances, and potential data breaches.

**Affected Component:** REST API - various endpoints (Process Definition, Process Instance, Task, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Camunda up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Carefully review and secure any custom REST API extensions.
* Enforce strong authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) and authorization for all API endpoints.
* Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
* Rate-limit API requests to mitigate denial-of-service attempts.

## Threat: [Integration Point Vulnerabilities](./threats/integration_point_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in systems that Camunda integrates with (e.g., through connectors or external tasks) are exploited to compromise the Camunda engine. This could involve insecure data exchange or lack of proper authentication between systems.

**Impact:** Data breaches and potential compromise of the Camunda engine itself.

**Affected Component:** Connectors, External Task Client.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the sensitivity of the integrated systems).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure all integration points with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Validate data exchanged with external systems to prevent injection attacks.
* Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for integration.
* Regularly review and update integration configurations.
* Implement error handling and logging for integration points.
