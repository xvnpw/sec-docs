Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Flink, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsecured or Weakly Secured JobManager REST API
    *   **Description:** The JobManager exposes a REST API for managing and monitoring Flink jobs and the cluster. Without proper authentication and authorization, this API can be accessed by unauthorized users.
    *   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's architecture inherently includes this REST API as a primary interface for interaction. The default configuration often lacks strong authentication, making it vulnerable if exposed.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use the API to submit a malicious job that consumes excessive resources, cancels legitimate jobs, or retrieves sensitive information about running applications.
    *   **Impact:**  Full control over the Flink cluster, denial of service, data manipulation, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and configure Flink's built-in authentication mechanisms (e.g., Kerberos, custom authentication).
        *   Implement strong authorization policies to restrict API access based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Ensure the REST API is not publicly accessible without proper network controls (firewalls, VPNs).
        *   Regularly review and update authentication and authorization configurations.

*   **Attack Surface:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Job Submission and Task Execution
    *   **Description:** Flink involves deserializing user-provided JAR files, serialized objects in state, and data during task execution. If untrusted data is deserialized, it can lead to remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's distributed nature and its reliance on serialization for data exchange between components and for state management create opportunities for deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could craft a malicious JAR file containing exploit code that gets executed when the JobManager or TaskManager attempts to deserialize it during job submission or task execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on JobManager and TaskManager nodes, potentially compromising the entire cluster and the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data that will be deserialized.
        *   Use secure serialization libraries and ensure they are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using alternative data serialization formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers).
        *   Implement security policies to restrict the sources from which JAR files and other serialized data can be loaded.

*   **Attack Surface:** Weak or Default Credentials on Web UI
    *   **Description:** Flink's Web UI provides a graphical interface for monitoring and managing the cluster. If default or weak credentials are used and not changed, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink provides a Web UI as a standard component. If authentication is enabled but default credentials are not changed, it creates an easily exploitable vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use default credentials (if known or easily guessed) to log into the Web UI and gain insights into running jobs, cluster configuration, and potentially perform administrative actions.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized monitoring, potential for malicious actions via the UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change default credentials for the Web UI upon deployment.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for Web UI users.
        *   Consider integrating the Web UI with an existing enterprise authentication system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory).
        *   Restrict access to the Web UI to authorized users and networks.

*   **Attack Surface:** Injection Vulnerabilities in Connector Configurations
    *   **Description:** When configuring connectors to external systems (e.g., Kafka, databases), improper sanitization of user-provided configuration parameters can lead to injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, SQL injection in connector metadata).
    *   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's flexibility in connecting to various external systems relies on user-provided configurations for these connectors. Insufficient validation can introduce risks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could provide a malicious database connection string that includes SQL injection payloads, which are then executed by the connector during initialization or operation.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of external systems connected to Flink, data breaches, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all connector configuration parameters.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with external databases.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring connector access to external systems.
