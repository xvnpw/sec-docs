### High and Critical Apache Flink Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Job Submission
    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a crafted Flink job containing malicious code or logic. This could involve using user-defined functions (UDFs) or connectors to execute arbitrary commands on the TaskManagers or access sensitive data. The attacker might aim to steal data, disrupt processing, or gain control of the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, denial of service, unauthorized access to resources, potential compromise of the underlying operating system on TaskManagers.
    *   **Affected Component:** JobManager (submission endpoint), TaskManagers (execution environment), User-Defined Functions (UDFs), Connectors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for job configurations and user-provided code.
        *   Enforce resource quotas and limits for submitted jobs.
        *   Utilize secure coding practices for UDFs and connectors, avoiding execution of external commands or access to sensitive system resources.
        *   Implement code review processes for submitted jobs.
        *   Consider using a secure execution environment or sandboxing for UDFs.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for job submission.

*   **Threat:** State Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the State Backend (as managed by Flink) and modifies the application's state. This could lead to incorrect processing, data corruption, or manipulation of application logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect application behavior, potential business logic flaws exploitation, data breaches if state contains sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** State Backend (Flink's state management), Checkpointing mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the State Backend (configuration and underlying storage).
        *   Encrypt state data at rest and in transit (Flink's state encryption features).
        *   Regularly back up state data.
        *   Monitor access to the State Backend for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Checkpoint Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Checkpoint Storage (as managed by Flink) and modifies checkpoint data. Upon recovery, the application could revert to a compromised state, potentially executing malicious logic or using corrupted data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application reverting to a malicious state, potential for persistent compromise, business logic flaws exploitation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Checkpoint Storage (Flink's checkpoint management), Checkpointing mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for the Checkpoint Storage (configuration and underlying storage).
        *   Encrypt checkpoint data at rest and in transit (Flink's checkpoint encryption features).
        *   Implement integrity checks for checkpoint data (e.g., checksums).
        *   Regularly back up checkpoint data.

*   **Threat:** Malicious User Code Injection via Connectors
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom or third-party connectors *used within the Flink application* to inject malicious code that gets executed within the TaskManagers. This could happen if connectors are not properly sandboxed or if they interact with external systems in an insecure manner.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on TaskManagers, data breaches through compromised external systems, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Connectors (source and sink implementations within Flink), TaskManagers (execution environment).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit third-party connectors used with Flink.
        *   Implement secure coding practices for custom connectors, avoiding execution of external commands or access to sensitive system resources.
        *   Utilize a secure execution environment or sandboxing for connectors (if available within Flink or through external tools).
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for data processed by connectors.

*   **Threat:** TaskManager Crash via Exploitable Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the TaskManager code or its dependencies to cause it to crash. Repeated crashes can lead to denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, job failures, potential data loss if not properly checkpointed.
    *   **Affected Component:** TaskManagers (core functionality, dependencies within the Flink distribution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Flink and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement robust error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms within the Flink application.
        *   Monitor TaskManager stability and set up alerts for crashes.
        *   Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing of the Flink deployment.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Connector Configuration Leading to Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** A Flink application is configured with connectors that have overly permissive access to external systems (e.g., databases, message queues). If the Flink application itself is compromised (through other Flink-specific vulnerabilities), the attacker can leverage these connectors to gain unauthorized access to the external systems.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches in connected external systems, unauthorized modification of external data, potential for further lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Component:** Connectors (configuration within Flink), Flink application code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring connectors within Flink.
        *   Restrict connector access to only the necessary resources and operations.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for connector connections (as configured within Flink).
        *   Regularly review connector configurations within the Flink application.

*   **Threat:** Internal Communication Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies communication between Flink components (e.g., JobManager and TaskManagers). This could lead to the execution of malicious commands, disruption of job execution, or the injection of false data.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect application behavior, denial of service, potential for remote code execution within the Flink cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** JobManager, TaskManagers (internal communication channels within Flink).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for all internal communication between Flink components (Flink's security configurations).
        *   Implement mutual authentication between Flink components (Flink's security configurations).
        *   Isolate the Flink cluster within a secure network segment.
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity within the Flink cluster's network.
