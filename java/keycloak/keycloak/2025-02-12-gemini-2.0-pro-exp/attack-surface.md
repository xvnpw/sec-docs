# Attack Surface Analysis for keycloak/keycloak

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Code Flow Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/authorization_code_flow_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the OAuth 2.0/OIDC authorization code flow implemented by Keycloak to gain unauthorized access or impersonate users.
    *   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak *is* the authorization server implementing the flow. Misconfigurations within Keycloak or improper handling of responses by client applications create the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts the authorization code due to a misconfigured `redirect_uri` in Keycloak (e.g., overly broad wildcard) and uses it to obtain an access token.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, user impersonation, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users/Admins:** Configure Keycloak to enforce PKCE.  Use *only* registered and *strictly validated* redirect URIs in Keycloak's client configuration (avoid wildcards). Regularly audit client configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Token Forgery/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/token_forgerymanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers create or modify JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) issued by Keycloak to bypass authentication or gain elevated privileges.
    *   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak *generates and signs* the JWTs.  Vulnerabilities could exist in Keycloak's token generation or signing process, or in how it handles key rotation.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in Keycloak's signing key management allows an attacker to obtain a private key and forge valid JWTs.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, unauthorized access to all resources, data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users/Admins:** Regularly rotate Keycloak's signing keys.  Use short-lived access tokens.  Monitor for suspicious token usage (e.g., tokens issued with unexpected claims). Ensure Keycloak is running on a secure, hardened server.

## Attack Surface: [Refresh Token Leakage/Abuse](./attack_surfaces/refresh_token_leakageabuse.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to refresh tokens issued by Keycloak and use them to obtain new access tokens, maintaining persistent unauthorized access.
    *   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak *issues and manages* refresh tokens.  The vulnerability lies in how Keycloak handles refresh token lifetimes, rotation, and revocation, and how clients store them.
    *   **Example:** Keycloak is configured with excessively long refresh token lifetimes, and an attacker obtains a leaked refresh token. They can then continuously obtain new access tokens, even if the user's password is changed.
    *   **Impact:** Long-term unauthorized access to resources, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users/Admins:** Configure Keycloak to use refresh token rotation.  Set *reasonable* refresh token lifetimes (not excessively long).  Enable offline access only when *absolutely necessary*.  Monitor for suspicious refresh token usage (e.g., multiple requests from different locations). Configure appropriate session idle and max timeouts.

## Attack Surface: [Admin Console Compromise](./attack_surfaces/admin_console_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the Keycloak administration console, allowing them to modify configurations, create users, and compromise the entire system.
    *   **Keycloak Contribution:** The admin console *is* the Keycloak management interface.  Weaknesses in its access controls or vulnerabilities in the console itself create the risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses a brute-force attack to guess the administrator password and gains access to the console.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users/Admins:**  *Immediately* change the default administrator password.  Enforce *strong* password policies.  Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* administrator accounts.  Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) within the admin console.  Limit network access to the admin console (e.g., using a VPN or firewall, restrict to specific IP ranges). Regularly audit administrator activity logs.

## Attack Surface: [SAML XML Signature Wrapping (if SAML is used)](./attack_surfaces/saml_xml_signature_wrapping__if_saml_is_used_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the structure of SAML assertions processed by Keycloak without invalidating the signature, potentially bypassing authentication.
    *   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak's *SAML implementation* is the vulnerable component.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `Subject` of a SAML assertion to impersonate another user, exploiting a vulnerability in Keycloak's XML signature validation logic.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, user impersonation, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users/Admins:** Keep Keycloak updated to the latest version to ensure any known SAML vulnerabilities are patched.  Monitor for security advisories related to SAML vulnerabilities. Ensure that the SAML metadata is obtained and validated securely.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Keycloak Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_keycloak_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in older versions of Keycloak.
    *   **Keycloak Contribution:**  The vulnerability exists *within Keycloak's codebase*.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a known remote code execution vulnerability in an outdated Keycloak version to gain control of the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to *complete system compromise*.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users/Admins:**  Keep Keycloak *up-to-date* with the latest security patches.  Subscribe to Keycloak security announcements.  Implement a robust and *prompt* patching process.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Authenticator/Provider Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_authenticatorprovider_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws introduced through custom-developed Keycloak extensions (authenticators, providers, etc.) that are loaded *into* Keycloak.
    *   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak *executes* the potentially vulnerable custom code.
    *   **Example:** A custom authenticator contains a SQL injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication or access the database *through Keycloak*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from authentication bypass to data breaches, and potentially compromise of Keycloak itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Follow *strict* secure coding practices when developing custom extensions. Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing and code review. Use secure coding libraries and frameworks. Sanitize *all* user inputs. Manage dependencies carefully and keep them up-to-date.
        *   **Users/Admins:** Thoroughly vet any third-party Keycloak extensions *before* deploying them. Regularly audit custom code for security vulnerabilities. If possible, have custom extensions reviewed by security experts.
