# Attack Tree Analysis for keycloak/keycloak

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to resources or data protected by the Keycloak-integrated application, or to disrupt the application's authentication/authorization services.

## Attack Tree Visualization

**High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **1. Compromise Keycloak Server**

    *   **1.1 Weak Admin Credentials:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Eff<seg_42>  
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers try to gain access to the Keycloak administration console using weak or default credentials. This is a common attack vector, especially if default credentials haven't been changed or if easily guessable passwords are used.  Success grants full control over the Keycloak instance.

    *   1.1.1. **Brute-Force Admin Login:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on password complexity and rate limiting)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Breakdown:** Automated tools are used to try many password combinations, often using common passwords and variations.  Success depends on the strength of the admin password and any rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms in place.

    *   1.1.2. **Dictionary Attack:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Breakdown:** Attackers use a list of common passwords or leaked credentials to try and gain access.  This is more targeted than a brute-force attack, focusing on known weak passwords.

*   2. **Exploit Misconfigurations**

    *   2.1 **Weak Realm/Client Secrets:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Breakdown:**  If client secrets or realm secrets are weak or easily guessable, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate client application, gaining unauthorized access to resources.

    *   2.1.1. **Hardcoded Secrets:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low (if source code is accessible) to High (if reverse engineering is needed)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Breakdown:**  Secrets embedded directly in application code or configuration files are vulnerable if the code is exposed (e.g., through a public repository, compromised server, or decompilation).

    *   2.1.2. **Insecure Client Authentication:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Breakdown:** Using "public" clients (no secret required) or weak authentication methods (e.g., basic authentication over HTTP) allows attackers to easily impersonate clients.

    *   2.1.3. **Insufficient Authorization Checks:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Breakdown:**  The application fails to properly verify user roles and permissions after authentication, allowing users to access resources they shouldn't. This often involves exploiting flaws in the application's authorization logic.

    *   2.2. **Default Credentials:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be changed during setup)
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Breakdown:**  Failing to change default administrator or client credentials after installation provides an easy entry point for attackers.

    *   2.2.1. **Use of Default Admin/Client Credentials:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be changed during setup)
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Breakdown:**  Attackers simply try the default username/password combinations, which are often publicly known.

    *   2.2.2. **Weak Password Reset Mechanism:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Rationale:**  If the password reset process is vulnerable (e.g., predictable tokens, easily guessable security questions), an attacker can take over accounts.

    *   2.2.3. **Overly Permissive Client Scopes:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Rationale:**  If a client is granted more permissions than it needs, a compromised client can access more resources than intended.  Principle of least privilege is violated.

    *   2.2.5. **Unvalidated Redirect URIs:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Rationale:**  Can be used in phishing attacks to redirect users to malicious sites after authentication, potentially stealing tokens or credentials.

*   3. **Leverage Keycloak Vulnerabilities**

    *   3.1 **Known CVEs:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on patching)
        *   **Impact:** High (depends on the CVE)
        *   **Effort:** Low to High (depends on exploit availability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to High (depends on exploit complexity)
        *   **Rationale:**  Publicly known vulnerabilities with available exploits are easier to target.  The likelihood depends on how quickly the system is patched.

    *   3.1.1. **Identify and Exploit Known CVE:**
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to High
        *   **Rationale:**  Same as 3.1.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Keycloak Server -> Weak Admin Credentials -> Brute-Force Admin Login](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_keycloak_server_-_weak_admin_credentials_-_brute-force_admin_login.md)

This is a classic and often successful attack path if strong passwords and rate limiting are not in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Keycloak Server -> Weak Admin Credentials -> Dictionary Attack](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_keycloak_server_-_weak_admin_credentials_-_dictionary_attack.md)

Similar to brute-force, but potentially faster if a good password list is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations -> Weak Realm/Client Secrets -> Hardcoded Secrets](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_-_weak_realmclient_secrets_-_hardcoded_secrets.md)

If secrets are exposed in code or configuration, this is a direct path to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations -> Weak Realm/Client Secrets -> Insecure Client Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_-_weak_realmclient_secrets_-_insecure_client_authentication.md)

Weak client authentication makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations -> Default Credentials -> Use of Default Admin/Client Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_-_default_credentials_-_use_of_default_adminclient_credentials.md)

This is the easiest path if defaults haven't been changed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations -> Default Credentials -> Weak Password Reset Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_-_default_credentials_-_weak_password_reset_mechanism.md)

Allows attackers to take over accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations -> Default Credentials -> Overly Permissive Client Scopes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_-_default_credentials_-_overly_permissive_client_scopes.md)

Allows attackers to access more resources than intended.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations -> Default Credentials -> Unvalidated Redirect URIs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_-_default_credentials_-_unvalidated_redirect_uris.md)

Allows attackers to redirect users to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Keycloak Vulnerabilities -> Known CVEs -> Identify and Exploit Known CVE](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_keycloak_vulnerabilities_-_known_cves_-_identify_and_exploit_known_cve.md)

Exploiting known, unpatched vulnerabilities is a common and effective attack vector.
