    GitHubRepo[("GitHub Repository")]
    GitHubActions[("GitHub Actions (CI/CD)")]
    Maven[("Maven")]
    SAST[("SAST Tools")]
    SCAT[("SCA Tools")]
    Linters[("Linters")]

    Maven -- Runs --> SCAT
    Maven -- Runs --> Linters
    Maven -- Runs --> Tests
    Maven -- Produces --> Artifacts
    GitHubActions -- Pushes images --> DockerHub

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the Keycloak GitHub repository.
2.  A push to the repository or a pull request triggers a build in GitHub Actions.
3.  GitHub Actions uses Maven to build the project.
4.  During the build process, various security checks are performed:
    *   SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools scan the project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Linters check the code for style and quality issues.
    *   Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure the code functions correctly.
5.  If all checks pass, Maven produces the build artifacts (JAR, WAR, ZIP files).
6.  GitHub Actions builds Docker images and pushes them to Docker Hub.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: SAST: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Keycloak codebase.
*   security control: SCA: Dependency scanning tools are used to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Linters: Code linters enforce coding standards and help prevent common coding errors.
*   security control: Automated Tests: Unit and integration tests help ensure the code functions as expected and can catch security-related bugs.
*   security control: Build Automation: GitHub Actions provides a consistent and automated build process, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Artifact Signing: Build artifacts could be signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity (not explicitly mentioned in the repository, but a recommended practice).
*   security control: Supply Chain Security: Measures to ensure the security of the build environment and dependencies (e.g., using trusted base images, verifying dependencies).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   User authentication and authorization: Keycloak is central to securing access to applications and services. Any disruption or compromise of Keycloak could lead to widespread access issues.
*   Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO is a critical feature for user convenience and productivity. Failure of SSO could disrupt user workflows.
*   User management: Keycloak manages user identities and their associated data. Compromise of this data could lead to identity theft and other security breaches.
*   Administration of Keycloak: The ability to manage and configure Keycloak securely is essential for maintaining the overall security posture.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Usernames and passwords (or password hashes): Highly sensitive. Must be protected with strong encryption and hashing algorithms.
*   Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Depending on the configuration and user attributes stored in Keycloak, PII may be present. This data is subject to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and must be protected accordingly.
*   Access tokens and refresh tokens: Highly sensitive. These tokens grant access to protected resources and must be protected from unauthorized access and use.
*   Client secrets: Highly sensitive. These secrets are used to authenticate applications to Keycloak and must be protected from disclosure.
*   Configuration data: Moderately sensitive. Keycloak's configuration data contains information about the system's security settings and should be protected from unauthorized modification.
*   Audit logs: Moderately to highly sensitive, depending on the level of detail logged. Audit logs can contain information about user activity, authentication events, and system configuration changes.
