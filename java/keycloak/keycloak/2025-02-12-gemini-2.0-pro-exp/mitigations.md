# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for keycloak/keycloak

## Mitigation Strategy: [Realm Isolation and Least Privilege for Administrators (Keycloak Roles & Realms)](./mitigation_strategies/realm_isolation_and_least_privilege_for_administrators__keycloak_roles_&_realms_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create Separate Realms:** For each distinct trust level (e.g., internal apps, external apps, partners), create a separate Keycloak realm. This isolates users, clients, and *all Keycloak configurations*.
2.  **Define Fine-Grained Roles (Realm-Level):** Within each realm, create custom Keycloak roles with the *minimum* necessary permissions.  Do *not* use the built-in Keycloak `admin` role for routine tasks.  Use Keycloak's role-based access control (RBAC) system. Examples: `manage-users-realm-A`, `view-clients-realm-B`.
3.  **Assign Roles to Administrators (Realm-Level):** Grant administrators only the specific Keycloak roles they need within their assigned realm(s) via Keycloak's user and group management.
4.  **Regularly Audit (Within Keycloak):** Periodically review realm administrator roles and permissions *within the Keycloak admin console* to ensure they remain appropriate.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Realm Compromise Propagation (High Severity):** A compromised realm (due to a Keycloak misconfiguration or compromised Keycloak admin account) does not affect other realms.  This is a *Keycloak-specific* isolation mechanism.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Realm Configuration (High Severity):** Limits Keycloak administrators' ability to modify settings or access data in realms they don't manage *within Keycloak*.
*   **Keycloak Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Smaller, isolated Keycloak realms are easier to configure correctly.
*   **Insider Threats (Keycloak Admins) (Medium Severity):** Limits the damage a malicious or compromised Keycloak administrator account can do *within Keycloak*.

**Impact:**
*   **Realm Compromise Propagation:** Risk significantly reduced (Keycloak-provided isolation).
*   **Unauthorized Access to Realm Configuration:** Risk significantly reduced (Keycloak RBAC).
*   **Keycloak Configuration Errors:** Risk moderately reduced (simpler Keycloak configurations).
*   **Insider Threats (Keycloak Admins):** Risk moderately reduced (limited Keycloak privileges).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Separate Keycloak realms exist for "Internal Applications" and "External Applications."
*   Custom Keycloak roles are defined for user management within the "Internal Applications" realm.
*   Administrators are assigned specific Keycloak roles within their respective realms.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Custom Keycloak roles are not yet fully defined for the "External Applications" realm.
*   Regular auditing of realm administrator roles within Keycloak is not yet a formalized process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Client Configuration (Within Keycloak)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_client_configuration__within_keycloak_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Client Type (Keycloak Setting):** Correctly configure each client as "confidential" or "public" *within Keycloak*.
2.  **Confidential Client Secrets (Keycloak-Managed):** For confidential clients, let Keycloak generate and manage secrets. If external secret management is used, ensure Keycloak is configured to integrate with it.
3.  **Public Client Configuration (Keycloak Settings):** For public clients:
    *   Set "Client Authentication" to "Off" in Keycloak.
    *   Enable "Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)" in Keycloak.  Set "PKCE Code Challenge Method" appropriately.
    *   Configure *strict* "Valid Redirect URIs" in Keycloak, avoiding wildcards.
    *   Limit "Allowed Grant Types" in Keycloak to only those necessary (e.g., `authorization_code`).
4.  **Client Scopes (Keycloak Configuration):**
    *   Define specific client scopes *within Keycloak* representing granular permissions.
    *   Assign only the necessary scopes to each client *within Keycloak*.
5.  **Web Origins (CORS - Keycloak Setting):** Configure the "Web Origins" setting for each client *in Keycloak* to specify the *exact* allowed origins. Avoid wildcards.
6.  **Token Lifetimes (Keycloak Settings):** Configure appropriate access token and refresh token lifetimes *within Keycloak's realm settings*.
7.  **Refresh Token Policies (Keycloak Settings):** Configure refresh token expiration, rotation, and one-time use *within Keycloak's realm settings*.
8. **Client Authentication Methods (Keycloak Settings):** For confidential clients, consider using client secret JWT or mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication *configured within Keycloak*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Client Secret Leakage (High Severity):** Keycloak-managed secrets (or integration with a secrets manager) reduce the risk.
*   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Strict redirect URI configuration *within Keycloak* prevents this.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Medium Severity):** PKCE (configured in Keycloak) and the `state` parameter prevent CSRF.
*   **Token Theft (High Severity):** Short access token lifetimes (Keycloak setting) and refresh token policies (Keycloak settings) mitigate the impact.
*   **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Proper "Web Origins" configuration *within Keycloak* prevents this.
*   **Client Impersonation (High Severity):** Stronger client authentication methods (JWT, mTLS) *configured in Keycloak* make impersonation harder.

**Impact:** (All impacts are related to Keycloak's configuration and enforcement)
*   All threats listed above are significantly reduced by correct Keycloak configuration.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Clients are correctly configured as "confidential" or "public" in Keycloak.
*   Public clients use PKCE (Keycloak setting).
*   Strict redirect URIs are configured in Keycloak.
*   Web Origins are configured in Keycloak, avoiding wildcards.
*   Short access token lifetimes are configured in Keycloak.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Refresh token rotation is not yet enabled in Keycloak.
*   Client scopes are not yet fully defined and enforced for all clients within Keycloak.
*   Not all confidential clients are using JWT or mTLS authentication configured in Keycloak.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust User Authentication (Keycloak Features)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_user_authentication__keycloak_features_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Brute-Force Protection (Keycloak Feature):** Enable and configure Keycloak's built-in brute-force detection *within Keycloak's realm settings*.
2.  **Strong Password Policies (Keycloak Settings):** Enforce strong password policies *within Keycloak's realm settings*:
    *   Minimum length.
    *   Complexity requirements.
    *   Password history.
    *   Select a strong password hashing algorithm (e.g., `pbkdf2-sha256`, `argon2`) *in Keycloak*.
3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA - Keycloak Feature):**
    *   Require MFA *using Keycloak's built-in MFA capabilities*.
    *   Configure appropriate MFA methods (OTP, WebAuthn) *within Keycloak*.
    *   Consider conditional MFA based on risk factors *using Keycloak's authentication flows*.
4.  **User Impersonation Control (Keycloak Permissions):** Restrict the Keycloak `impersonate` role to a small number of trusted administrators *within Keycloak's user/group management*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Keycloak's brute-force detection limits attempts.
*   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** Strong passwords (Keycloak policy) and MFA (Keycloak feature) mitigate this.
*   **Password Cracking (Medium Severity):** Strong password policies and hashing algorithms (Keycloak settings) make cracking harder.
*   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** MFA (Keycloak feature) adds a critical layer of protection.
*   **Unauthorized Access via Impersonation (High Severity):** Restricting the Keycloak `impersonate` role limits abuse.

**Impact:** (All impacts relate to Keycloak's features and configuration)
*   All threats listed above are significantly to moderately reduced by using Keycloak's built-in features.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Brute-force detection is enabled in Keycloak.
*   Strong password policies are enforced in Keycloak.
*   MFA is required for administrator accounts using Keycloak's MFA.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   MFA is not yet required for all regular user accounts via Keycloak.
*   The Keycloak `impersonate` role is not yet strictly limited.
*   Password history enforcement is not yet enabled in Keycloak.
*   The password hashing algorithm is not yet set to `argon2` in Keycloak.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protocol-Specific Security (OIDC/SAML - Keycloak Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/protocol-specific_security__oidcsaml_-_keycloak_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **OIDC (Keycloak Configuration):**
    *   **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE:** Enforce this for public clients *via Keycloak client settings*.
    *   **`nonce` Validation:** *Application code* must validate the `nonce` (Keycloak provides the value).
    *   **`aud` Claim Verification:** *Application code* must verify the `aud` claim (Keycloak provides the value).
    *   **`state` Parameter:** Use and validate the `state` parameter in *application code* (Keycloak supports this).
2.  **SAML (Keycloak Configuration):**
    *   **Assertion Validation:** *Application code* must validate SAML assertions (Keycloak acts as the IdP or SP).
        *   Signature verification (using Keycloak-provided keys/certificates).
        *   Issuer validation (against Keycloak's configuration).
        *   Audience restriction (against Keycloak's configuration).
    *   **Secure Bindings:** Use secure bindings (e.g., HTTP POST) *configured in Keycloak*.
    *   **XML Signature Wrapping Protection:** *Application code* must implement this (Keycloak provides the signed assertion).
    *   **Metadata Management:** Ensure proper configuration and secure exchange of SAML metadata *with Keycloak*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **OIDC Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** `nonce` validation (application-side, using Keycloak-provided data).
*   **OIDC Token Misuse (High Severity):** `aud` claim verification (application-side, using Keycloak-provided data).
*   **OIDC CSRF (Medium Severity):** `state` parameter (application-side, using Keycloak).
*   **SAML Assertion Forgery (High Severity):** Signature verification (application-side, using Keycloak-provided keys).
*   **SAML Assertion Replay (Medium Severity):** Validation and timestamp checks (application-side, using Keycloak-provided data).
*   **SAML XML Signature Wrapping (High Severity):** Application-side mitigations (using Keycloak-provided assertions).
*   **SAML Metadata Poisoning (High Severity):** Secure metadata exchange with Keycloak.

**Impact:**
*   OIDC and SAML-specific threats are significantly reduced through a combination of *Keycloak configuration* and *application-side validation* of data provided by Keycloak.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Public clients use Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Keycloak setting).
*   `state` parameter is used in OIDC flows (application and Keycloak).
*   SAML signature verification is implemented (application-side, using Keycloak).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `nonce` validation is not yet implemented (application-side).
*   `aud` claim verification is not yet implemented (application-side).
*   Specific mitigations for XML Signature Wrapping are not yet implemented (application-side).
*   SAML metadata exchange is not yet fully secured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging (Keycloak Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging__keycloak_feature_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Audit Logging:** Enable Keycloak's built-in audit logging *within Keycloak's server configuration*.
2.  **Configure Logging:** Configure logging to capture security-relevant events *within Keycloak*.  This includes login attempts (successes and failures), user creation/modification/deletion, role changes, client configuration changes, etc.
3.  **Review Logs:** Regularly review the audit logs generated *by Keycloak*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Lack of Visibility into Keycloak Security Events (Medium Severity):** Provides a record of actions performed within Keycloak, enabling detection and investigation of suspicious activity *related to Keycloak itself*.
*   **Auditing for Compliance (Varies):** Helps meet compliance requirements that mandate logging of security-relevant events.

**Impact:**
*   Significantly improves visibility into Keycloak's internal operations and security-related events.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Audit logging is enabled within Keycloak.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Regular review of Keycloak's audit logs is not yet a formalized process.
