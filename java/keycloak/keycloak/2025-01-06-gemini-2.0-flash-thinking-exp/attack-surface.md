# Attack Surface Analysis for keycloak/keycloak

## Attack Surface: [Redirect URI Manipulation in OAuth 2.0/OIDC Flows](./attack_surfaces/redirect_uri_manipulation_in_oauth_2_0oidc_flows.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate the `redirect_uri` parameter during the authorization flow to redirect users to a malicious site after successful authentication, potentially stealing authorization codes or access tokens.
*   **How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak handles the redirection logic in OAuth 2.0 and OIDC flows. Improper validation of redirect URIs opens this attack vector within Keycloak's core functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `redirect_uri` parameter in an authorization request to point to their phishing site. After the user authenticates with Keycloak, they are redirected to the attacker's site, which can then attempt to steal the authorization code.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, phishing attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict allowlisting of valid redirect URIs at the Keycloak client configuration level. Avoid wildcard or overly broad redirect URI patterns within Keycloak's client settings.
    *   **Developers:** Utilize Keycloak's built-in mechanisms for redirect URI validation and enforcement.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Keycloak Admin Console or Account Management](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_keycloak_admin_console_or_account_management.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the Keycloak Admin Console or user account management pages, which are then executed in the browsers of other administrators or users.
*   **How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak provides the web interface for administration and account management. Vulnerabilities within this Keycloak-provided interface allow for XSS attacks if input is not properly sanitized by Keycloak.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a user's profile field through the Keycloak account management interface. When an administrator views that user's profile in the Keycloak Admin Console, the script executes, potentially stealing the administrator's session cookie.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, privilege escalation within Keycloak, data theft, defacement of the admin interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Keycloak):** Ensure proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Keycloak codebase. Regularly update Keycloak to benefit from security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users (Configuration):**  Utilize Keycloak's Content Security Policy (CSP) settings to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources for the Keycloak web interface.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation on Keycloak REST APIs](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation_on_keycloak_rest_apis.md)

*   **Description:** Keycloak's REST APIs might not sufficiently validate user-supplied input, leading to vulnerabilities like injection attacks (e.g., within Keycloak's data layer or custom user storage providers) or unexpected behavior within Keycloak.
*   **How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak exposes REST APIs for administrative tasks and client management. Lack of proper validation in these Keycloak-provided APIs can be directly exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload in a request to the Keycloak Admin REST API to create a new user, potentially injecting SQL code if Keycloak's internal data access logic or a custom user storage provider lacks proper input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** Data breach within Keycloak's managed data, unauthorized access to Keycloak functionalities, denial of service against Keycloak.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Keycloak & Customizations):** Implement robust input validation on all Keycloak API endpoints. Sanitize and parameterize data before using it in database queries or other sensitive operations within Keycloak.
    *   **Developers (Customizations):**  Thoroughly review and test any custom user storage providers or extensions for input validation vulnerabilities that interact with Keycloak's core.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Keycloak](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_keycloak.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Keycloak's authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass Keycloak's security controls and gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities managed by Keycloak.
*   **How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak is the central authority for authentication and authorization. Vulnerabilities directly within Keycloak's core logic undermine the security of applications relying on it.
*   **Example:** A bug in Keycloak's token validation logic allows an attacker with a partially valid token generated by Keycloak to gain access to protected resources managed by Keycloak.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of protected applications and data managed by Keycloak.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Keycloak):** Stay up-to-date with Keycloak security advisories and apply patches promptly to address authentication and authorization flaws within Keycloak.
    *   **Users (Configuration):**  Carefully configure authentication flows and authorization policies within Keycloak, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and audit these Keycloak configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Secrets and Keys in Keycloak Configuration](./attack_surfaces/weak_secrets_and_keys_in_keycloak_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Using weak or default secrets for signing tokens, communicating with external services, or accessing Keycloak's internal database can be easily compromised.
*   **How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak relies on various secrets and keys for its internal operation and communication. Weaknesses in these Keycloak-managed secrets can lead to significant security breaches.
*   **Example:** The default secret for a Keycloak client is not changed, allowing an attacker to forge access tokens for that client directly within Keycloak.
*   **Impact:** Token forgery within Keycloak, unauthorized access to resources protected by Keycloak, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Users (Configuration):**  Generate strong, unique, and unpredictable secrets for all Keycloak components and clients. Rotate these secrets regularly within Keycloak's configuration. Securely store and manage these secrets. Avoid default secrets provided by Keycloak.

## Attack Surface: [SAML Assertion Manipulation (if Keycloak is acting as IdP or SP)](./attack_surfaces/saml_assertion_manipulation__if_keycloak_is_acting_as_idp_or_sp_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate SAML assertions to impersonate users or bypass authorization checks when Keycloak is involved in SAML-based authentication.
*   **How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak acts as an Identity Provider (IdP) or Service Provider (SP) in SAML flows. Vulnerabilities in Keycloak's assertion processing or generation can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies a SAML assertion generated by Keycloak (as an IdP) to change the user's roles or permissions before it is processed by the relying application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to applications relying on Keycloak for SAML authentication, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Users (Configuration):** Enforce strict signature validation for SAML assertions within Keycloak's configuration. Ensure proper configuration of trust relationships between Keycloak and relying parties.
    *   **Developers (Keycloak):** Ensure robust validation and secure generation of SAML assertions according to the SAML specification within the Keycloak codebase.
