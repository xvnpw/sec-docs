# Threat Model Analysis for keycloak/keycloak

## Threat: [Compromise of Keycloak Administrator Account](./threats/compromise_of_keycloak_administrator_account.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to an account with administrative privileges in Keycloak. This could be achieved through weak passwords, phishing *targeting Keycloak admin credentials*, or exploiting vulnerabilities *within Keycloak itself*.

**Impact:** A compromised administrator account grants the attacker full control over the Keycloak instance, allowing them to create or modify users, roles, clients, and configurations, potentially compromising all applications relying on Keycloak.

**Affected Component:** Admin Console UI, Authorization Management, User Management

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce strong passwords and MFA for all administrator accounts, restrict access to the Keycloak admin console to authorized personnel and networks, regularly audit administrative actions, implement role-based access control for admin functions, keep Keycloak updated with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_configuration.md)

**Description:** Keycloak is deployed with default settings that are not secure, such as weak default passwords for administrative accounts or overly permissive configurations *within Keycloak's settings*.

**Impact:** Attackers can exploit these insecure defaults to gain unauthorized access or control over the Keycloak instance.

**Affected Component:** Server Configuration, Realm Settings

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Review and harden default configurations upon deployment, change default passwords immediately, follow security best practices for configuring realms and clients, regularly review and update configurations.

## Threat: [Session Hijacking](./threats/session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker steals or intercepts a valid user session *managed by Keycloak* (e.g., through network sniffing or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Keycloak manages sessions). The attacker can then use this session to impersonate the legitimate user.

**Impact:** The attacker can perform actions as the compromised user, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized operations within applications secured by Keycloak.

**Affected Component:** Session Management, Authentication SPI

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication with Keycloak, use secure session management practices (e.g., HTTPOnly and Secure flags on cookies *set by Keycloak*), implement short session timeouts *within Keycloak's configuration*, consider token binding.

## Threat: [Insecure Token Storage or Handling](./threats/insecure_token_storage_or_handling.md)

**Description:** Refresh tokens or access tokens *issued by Keycloak* are stored insecurely on the client-side (e.g., in local storage without encryption) or are mishandled, making them vulnerable to theft.

**Impact:** Attackers can steal these tokens and use them to gain unauthorized access to resources even after the user has logged out or the original session has expired.

**Affected Component:** Token Management, OAuth 2.0/OIDC Protocol Implementation

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid storing refresh tokens in easily accessible locations like local storage, consider using secure browser storage mechanisms (e.g., IndexedDB with encryption), implement proper token revocation mechanisms *within Keycloak*, use short-lived access tokens *configured in Keycloak*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Keycloak Authentication Flows (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OIDC)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_keycloak_authentication_flows__e_g___oauth_2_0__oidc_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the implementation of authentication protocols *within Keycloak*, such as authorization code interception, insecure redirect URI handling *by Keycloak*, or token leakage *from Keycloak*.

**Impact:** Attackers can bypass authentication, impersonate users, or gain unauthorized access to resources.

**Affected Component:** OAuth 2.0 Endpoint, OpenID Connect Provider

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep Keycloak updated with the latest security patches, carefully review and configure OAuth 2.0/OIDC settings *within Keycloak*, enforce strict redirect URI whitelisting *in Keycloak client configurations*, utilize PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) where applicable, implement best practices for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC flows.

## Threat: [Insecure Customizations or Extensions](./threats/insecure_customizations_or_extensions.md)

**Description:** Custom Keycloak providers, themes, or event listeners are developed with security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection *within a custom provider accessing a database*, cross-site scripting *within a custom theme*).

**Impact:** These vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise the Keycloak instance or the applications relying on it.

**Affected Component:** Custom SPI Implementations, Theme Engine

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Follow secure coding practices when developing Keycloak extensions, perform security reviews and penetration testing of custom code, ensure proper input validation and output encoding in custom components.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Keycloak Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_keycloak_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Keycloak relies on various third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise Keycloak.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from denial of service to remote code execution *on the Keycloak server*.

**Affected Component:** Various Keycloak Modules (depending on the vulnerable dependency)

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium) - *Filtering for High/Critical*

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep Keycloak updated to benefit from dependency updates, regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like dependency-check, follow security advisories for Keycloak and its dependencies.
