## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application via Keycloak Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_via_keycloak_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal. Success in any of the sub-branches below leads to achieving this objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

This path involves directly exploiting security flaws within the Keycloak codebase.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Keycloak [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   Exploit known RCE vulnerability in Keycloak core: Attackers leverage publicly known or newly discovered vulnerabilities in Keycloak's core code to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
            *   Exploit RCE in a Keycloak extension or plugin:  Attackers target vulnerabilities within third-party extensions or plugins installed in Keycloak to gain remote code execution.
        *   **Authentication Bypass in Keycloak [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Exploit a flaw in Keycloak's authentication logic: Attackers find and exploit vulnerabilities in how Keycloak verifies user identities, allowing them to bypass the login process without valid credentials.
            *   Exploit a vulnerability in a supported authentication protocol (e.g., OpenID Connect, SAML) implementation within Keycloak: Attackers exploit weaknesses in Keycloak's implementation of standard authentication protocols to circumvent authentication.
        *   **Authorization Bypass in Keycloak [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Exploit a flaw in Keycloak's role-based access control (RBAC) implementation: Attackers find vulnerabilities in how Keycloak manages user roles and permissions, allowing them to gain access to resources they shouldn't have.
            *   Exploit a vulnerability in custom authorization policies or providers: If custom authorization logic is used, attackers can exploit flaws in this custom code to bypass access controls.
        *   **SQL Injection in Keycloak's database [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   Attackers inject malicious SQL queries into Keycloak's database interactions, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data, including user credentials and configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_configuration_weaknesses__high_risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on leveraging insecure configurations of Keycloak.
        *   **Default or Weak Credentials for Keycloak Admin Account [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Attackers use default or easily guessable passwords for the Keycloak administrator account to gain full control over the system.
        *   **Insecure Keycloak Configuration Settings [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Misconfigured CORS policies allowing unauthorized access: Attackers exploit overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings to make unauthorized requests to Keycloak.
            *   Exposed sensitive information in Keycloak configuration files: Attackers find configuration files containing sensitive data like database credentials or API keys, allowing them to further compromise the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Keycloak Features for Malicious Purposes [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_keycloak_features_for_malicious_purposes__high_risk_path_.md)

This path involves misusing legitimate Keycloak functionalities for malicious ends.
        *   **User Impersonation through Keycloak's features [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in Keycloak's impersonation functionality (if enabled): Attackers exploit flaws in Keycloak's user impersonation feature to gain access to other user accounts.
        *   **Account Takeover via Keycloak's Password Reset Mechanism [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Exploiting weaknesses in the password reset flow (e.g., predictable reset tokens, lack of rate limiting): Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the password reset process to gain control of user accounts.
        *   **Phishing attacks targeting Keycloak's login page [HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   Attackers create fake login pages that mimic Keycloak's, tricking users into entering their credentials, which are then stolen.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Keycloak's Underlying Infrastructure [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_keycloak's_underlying_infrastructure__high_risk_path_.md)

This path involves attacking the systems that Keycloak relies on.
        *   **Attacking the server hosting Keycloak [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   Attackers target vulnerabilities in the operating system, web server, or other software running on the server hosting Keycloak to gain access to the server itself, which inherently compromises Keycloak.
        *   **Compromising the database used by Keycloak [CRITICAL NODE]**
            *   Attackers target vulnerabilities in the database system used by Keycloak to store its data, allowing them to access or modify sensitive information, including user credentials and configurations.
