**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
* Use CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms to deter automated attacks.
* Enforce strong password policies and encourage users to use unique, complex passwords.
* Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity and implement alerting.
* Consider using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an added layer of security.

## Threat: [Credential stuffing attack.](./threats/credential_stuffing_attack.md)

**Description:** Attackers use lists of compromised usernames and passwords obtained from other data breaches to attempt to log in to Keycloak. They rely on the fact that many users reuse the same credentials across multiple services.

**Impact:** Successful credential stuffing attacks can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, similar to brute-force attacks.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Module, specifically the login form and authentication processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies and encourage users to use unique passwords.
* Implement account lockout policies.
* Monitor for suspicious login patterns and high volumes of failed login attempts from specific IPs.
* Consider using a password breach detection service to identify compromised credentials.
* Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Threat: [Password reset vulnerability.](./threats/password_reset_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in Keycloak's password reset mechanism to gain unauthorized access to accounts. This could involve predictable reset links, lack of proper verification, or the ability to trigger password resets for arbitrary users.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to reset user passwords and gain complete control over their accounts.

**Affected Component:** User Management Module, specifically the password reset functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure password reset links are unique, unpredictable, and time-limited.
* Implement strong verification processes, such as email or phone verification, before allowing password resets.
* Prevent the ability to trigger password resets for arbitrary users without proper authentication.
* Implement rate limiting on password reset requests to prevent abuse.

## Threat: [Privilege escalation through Keycloak vulnerability.](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_keycloak_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within Keycloak's authorization mechanisms to gain higher privileges than they are intended to have. This could involve manipulating tokens, exploiting flaws in policy enforcement, or bypassing access controls within Keycloak itself.

**Impact:** Attackers can gain administrative access within Keycloak, access sensitive data belonging to other users managed by Keycloak, or perform actions with elevated privileges, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Module, potentially including policy enforcement engine, token issuance, or access control mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Keycloak updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Follow security best practices for configuring Keycloak's authorization policies.
* Regularly review and test authorization configurations within Keycloak.
* Implement robust input validation within Keycloak to prevent manipulation of authorization requests.

## Threat: [Token manipulation.](./threats/token_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to tamper with tokens issued by Keycloak (e.g., JWTs) to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges. This could involve modifying claims within the token or bypassing signature verification if not properly implemented *within Keycloak*.

**Impact:** Successful token manipulation can allow attackers to impersonate users, bypass authorization checks enforced by Keycloak, or gain access to resources protected by Keycloak.

**Affected Component:** Token Issuance and Validation Module, specifically the JWT implementation and signature verification process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure tokens are signed using strong cryptographic algorithms within Keycloak.
* Properly implement token signature verification within Keycloak.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in tokens.
* Use short token expiration times.
* Implement token revocation mechanisms within Keycloak.

## Threat: [Session hijacking.](./threats/session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** An attacker steals a valid Keycloak session ID, allowing them to impersonate the user. This can happen through vulnerabilities *within Keycloak's session management*, or if the application doesn't properly protect session identifiers received from Keycloak.

**Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf within the application protected by Keycloak.

**Affected Component:** Session Management Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use HTTPS to encrypt communication and prevent session ID interception.
* Use secure cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags *configured by Keycloak*.
* Implement session timeouts and inactivity timeouts *within Keycloak*.

## Threat: [Account takeover through Keycloak vulnerability.](./threats/account_takeover_through_keycloak_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Keycloak's user management features to gain control of user accounts. This could involve bypassing authentication mechanisms, exploiting password reset flaws, or manipulating user account settings *within Keycloak*.

**Impact:** Attackers gain complete control over user accounts managed by Keycloak, allowing them to access sensitive data, perform unauthorized actions within applications relying on Keycloak, or potentially compromise the entire system.

**Affected Component:** User Management Module, including account creation, modification, and password reset functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Keycloak updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization controls for user management operations *within Keycloak*.
* Regularly audit user accounts and their permissions within Keycloak.

## Threat: [Unauthorized user creation or modification.](./threats/unauthorized_user_creation_or_modification.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Keycloak's administrative interface or APIs to create new user accounts or modify existing ones without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Attackers can create backdoor accounts for persistent access, modify user permissions to escalate privileges within Keycloak, or disrupt user access to applications relying on Keycloak.

**Affected Component:** Admin Console, User Management APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the Keycloak administrative console with strong authentication and authorization.
* Restrict access to user management APIs to authorized personnel or applications.
* Implement audit logging for user management operations within Keycloak.

## Threat: [Use of default or weak administrative credentials.](./threats/use_of_default_or_weak_administrative_credentials.md)

**Description:**  Administrators fail to change the default administrative credentials for Keycloak or use weak passwords.
