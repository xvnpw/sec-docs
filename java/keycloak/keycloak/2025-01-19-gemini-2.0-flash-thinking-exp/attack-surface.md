# Attack Surface Analysis for keycloak/keycloak

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force and Credential Stuffing Attacks](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_and_credential_stuffing_attacks.md)

**Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by trying numerous username/password combinations or using lists of compromised credentials against Keycloak's authentication mechanisms.

**How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak manages user authentication, making it the direct target for such attacks. Insufficient rate limiting or weak account lockout policies within Keycloak increase the risk.

**Example:** An attacker uses a botnet to repeatedly try common passwords against user accounts managed by Keycloak.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts managed by Keycloak, potentially leading to data breaches or further attacks on integrated applications.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enforce strong password policies within Keycloak.
*   Enable and properly configure account lockout policies after a defined number of failed login attempts in Keycloak.
*   Implement CAPTCHA or similar mechanisms within Keycloak's login flow to prevent automated attacks.
*   Consider using Keycloak's built-in event listeners to detect and respond to suspicious login activity.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) within Keycloak for an added layer of security.

## Attack Surface: [OAuth 2.0 Misconfigurations (e.g., Insecure Redirect URIs)](./attack_surfaces/oauth_2_0_misconfigurations__e_g___insecure_redirect_uris_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from improper configuration of OAuth 2.0 flows within Keycloak, particularly with redirect URIs. Attackers can manipulate the flow to gain unauthorized access tokens issued by Keycloak.

**How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Incorrectly configured clients or realms within Keycloak directly introduce these vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker registers a malicious OAuth client in Keycloak with a redirect URI they control. They then trick a legitimate user into initiating an OAuth flow, intercepting the authorization code from Keycloak and exchanging it for an access token to the legitimate application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data and application resources protected by Keycloak, potential account takeover.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strictly validate and whitelist redirect URIs for each OAuth client registered in Keycloak.
*   Avoid using wildcard redirect URIs in Keycloak client configurations.
*   Implement the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) extension for public OAuth clients within Keycloak.
*   Regularly review and audit OAuth client configurations within Keycloak.

## Attack Surface: [Keycloak Admin Console Vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF)](./attack_surfaces/keycloak_admin_console_vulnerabilities__e_g___xss__csrf_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Keycloak administration console itself that could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts or perform unauthorized actions within the Keycloak management interface.

**How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak provides the web-based admin console. Vulnerabilities in this console directly expose the entire Keycloak instance and its configurations.

**Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a field within the Keycloak admin console. When another administrator views this field, the script executes, potentially stealing their session cookie or performing administrative actions on Keycloak.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Keycloak instance, including the ability to create new users, modify security configurations, access sensitive information, and potentially compromise all applications relying on Keycloak.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Keycloak updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in the admin console.
*   Implement strong input validation and output encoding within the Keycloak admin console codebase.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks within the Keycloak admin console.
*   Implement anti-CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks against the Keycloak admin console.
*   Restrict network access to the Keycloak admin console to authorized networks or IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [Keycloak API Security Issues (e.g., Insecure Endpoints, Lack of Rate Limiting)](./attack_surfaces/keycloak_api_security_issues__e_g___insecure_endpoints__lack_of_rate_limiting_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the Keycloak REST APIs that could allow unauthorized access to Keycloak's functionalities, information disclosure about Keycloak's configuration or managed entities, or denial-of-service attacks against Keycloak itself.

**How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak exposes various REST APIs for management and interaction. Insecurely designed or configured APIs within Keycloak directly increase the attack surface.

**Example:** An attacker discovers an unauthenticated Keycloak API endpoint that exposes a list of all users in a realm. Alternatively, an attacker floods a public Keycloak API endpoint with requests, causing a denial of service against Keycloak.

**Impact:** Information disclosure about Keycloak's internal state, unauthorized modification of Keycloak configurations, or service disruption of Keycloak, impacting all relying applications.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure all sensitive Keycloak API endpoints require proper authentication and authorization.
*   Implement rate limiting on Keycloak API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   Carefully review Keycloak API documentation and access control configurations.
*   Avoid exposing sensitive information in Keycloak API responses unnecessarily.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Keycloak Server Configuration (e.g., Exposed Secrets, Weak TLS)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_keycloak_server_configuration__e_g___exposed_secrets__weak_tls_.md)

**Description:** Misconfigurations in the Keycloak server settings that directly weaken its security posture and expose it to various attacks.

**How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak's security relies heavily on its configuration. Insecure defaults or misconfigurations within Keycloak directly create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Keycloak is configured to use a weak TLS version or cipher suites, making it susceptible to downgrade or man-in-the-middle attacks. Alternatively, database credentials or other sensitive secrets are stored in plain text within Keycloak's configuration files.

**Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data stored within or managed by Keycloak, man-in-the-middle attacks against communication with Keycloak, unauthorized access to the Keycloak server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow Keycloak's official security hardening guidelines.
*   Configure Keycloak with strong TLS configurations, disabling outdated protocols and weak cipher suites.
*   Securely manage secrets used by Keycloak using environment variables, dedicated secret management tools, or Keycloak's built-in credential store.
*   Regularly review and audit Keycloak server configurations.
*   Disable unnecessary features and services within Keycloak to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [SAML Vulnerabilities (if used for federation with Keycloak)](./attack_surfaces/saml_vulnerabilities__if_used_for_federation_with_keycloak_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Keycloak's Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) implementation or configuration that could allow attackers to bypass authentication or impersonate users authenticating through Keycloak's SAML integration.

**How Keycloak Contributes:** Keycloak supports SAML for federated identity. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in Keycloak's SAML handling directly expose the system to these risks.

**Example:** An attacker exploits an XML Signature Wrapping vulnerability in Keycloak's SAML processing to manipulate a SAML assertion, allowing them to authenticate as another user within applications relying on Keycloak for SAML authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to applications relying on Keycloak for SAML authentication, potential account takeover, data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure proper and strict validation of SAML assertions, including cryptographic signatures, within Keycloak.
*   Securely manage the private keys used by Keycloak for signing SAML responses.
*   Implement measures within Keycloak to prevent assertion replay attacks.
*   Follow SAML security best practices and recommendations when configuring Keycloak for SAML federation.
*   Regularly update Keycloak to benefit from security patches related to SAML processing.
