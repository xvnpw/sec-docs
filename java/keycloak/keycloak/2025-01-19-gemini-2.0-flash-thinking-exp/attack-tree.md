## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Keycloak (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_keycloak__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful exploitation of Keycloak to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Keycloak Vulnerabilities (CVEs) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_keycloak_vulnerabilities__cves___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers scan for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific version of Keycloak being used.
*   They leverage readily available exploit code or tools to target these vulnerabilities.
*   Successful exploitation can grant attackers unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or the ability to execute arbitrary code on the Keycloak server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Keycloak Functionality (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_keycloak_functionality__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Token Theft (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/token_theft__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept tokens during transmission (e.g., MITM)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_tokens_during_transmission__e_g___mitm_.md)

*   Attackers position themselves between the user's browser and the Keycloak server (or the application server).
*   If HTTPS is not enforced or is improperly configured, they can intercept the communication and steal the access or refresh tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal tokens from client-side storage (e.g., XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/steal_tokens_from_client-side_storage__e_g___xss_.md)

*   Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application (Cross-Site Scripting).
*   These scripts can access the browser's storage (local storage, session storage, cookies) where tokens might be stored and send them to an attacker-controlled server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering targeting Keycloak Users (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_keycloak_users__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing for Keycloak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/phishing_for_keycloak_credentials.md)

*   Attackers create fake login pages that mimic the legitimate Keycloak login.
*   They trick users into entering their credentials on these fake pages, capturing usernames and passwords.
*   This can be done through emails, messages, or compromised websites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing against Keycloak (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/brute-forcecredential_stuffing_against_keycloak__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers attempt to guess user passwords by trying a large number of common passwords or passwords associated with known breaches (credential stuffing).
*   This is more likely to succeed if Keycloak has weak password policies or lacks sufficient rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Keycloak Misconfigurations (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_keycloak_misconfigurations__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Configuration Settings (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_configuration_settings__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Password Policies](./attack_tree_paths/weak_password_policies.md)

*   Keycloak is configured to allow simple or easily guessable passwords.
*   This makes brute-force and credential stuffing attacks more effective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disabled Security Features](./attack_tree_paths/disabled_security_features.md)

*   Important security features like rate limiting, account lockout after failed login attempts, or strong token signing algorithms are disabled or not properly configured.
*   This weakens the overall security posture and makes various attacks easier to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__high-risk_path_.md)

*   The default administrator or user credentials provided with Keycloak are not changed after installation.
*   Attackers can easily find these default credentials online and use them to gain full access to the Keycloak administration console.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Admin Interface (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_admin_interface__high-risk_path_.md)

*   The Keycloak administration console is accessible from the public internet or untrusted networks without proper authentication or authorization controls.
*   Attackers can attempt to log in using brute-force attacks or known vulnerabilities in the admin interface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Weaknesses (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Communication between Application and Keycloak (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_communication_between_application_and_keycloak__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of HTTPS enforcement](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_https_enforcement.md)

*   Communication between the application and Keycloak (e.g., during token exchange or user information retrieval) is not encrypted using HTTPS.
*   Attackers can intercept this unencrypted traffic and steal sensitive information, including access tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Token Handling by Application](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_token_handling_by_application.md)

*   The application does not properly validate the tokens received from Keycloak.
*   The application stores tokens insecurely (e.g., in local storage without proper protection).
*   The application logs tokens in plain text.
*   These practices can lead to token theft and unauthorized access even if Keycloak itself is secure.
