## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Known Keycloak CVEs -> Utilize Public Exploits](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_known_keycloak_cves_-_utilize_public_exploits.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers monitor public CVE databases and security advisories for Keycloak. If the application uses a vulnerable Keycloak version and patches are not applied, attackers can use readily available public exploits to compromise the system.
Example: A publicly disclosed Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Keycloak allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted request.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_d_a78dc50d.md)

Attack Vector: Keycloak relies on numerous third-party libraries (dependencies). Attackers identify known vulnerabilities in these dependencies. If Keycloak uses vulnerable versions of these libraries, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to various impacts depending on the dependency and vulnerability type.
Example: A vulnerable version of a logging library used by Keycloak is susceptible to a deserialization vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this to achieve RCE by injecting malicious serialized objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Insecure Authentication Flows -> Weak or Missing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) -> Target Accounts Without MFA Enabled](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_insecure_authentication_flows_-_weak_or_missing_multi-factor_aut_c8a9b8df.md)

Attack Vector: MFA is not enforced for all users, especially privileged accounts. Attackers use standard credential attacks (brute-force, credential stuffing, phishing) to compromise accounts that lack MFA.
Example: Attackers use a list of leaked credentials to attempt login to user accounts. Accounts without MFA are easily compromised if the leaked credentials are valid.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Insecure Password Policies -> Weak Password Complexity Requirements -> Brute-Force Weak Passwords](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_insecure_password_policies_-_weak_password_complexity_requiremen_6cee49a9.md)

Attack Vector: Password complexity requirements are weak (e.g., short passwords, no special character requirements). Attackers use brute-force attacks to guess weak passwords.
Example: Attackers use password cracking tools to try common passwords and variations against user accounts. Weak password policies make brute-forcing feasible.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Insecure Password Policies -> Lack of Account Lockout Policies -> Brute-Force Accounts Without Lockout](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_insecure_password_policies_-_lack_of_account_lockout_policies_-__4cbf9fa4.md)

Attack Vector: Account lockout policies are not implemented. Attackers can perform unlimited brute-force attempts against accounts without being blocked.
Example: Attackers continuously try different passwords against a target account without triggering any lockout mechanism, eventually guessing the password.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Insecure Authorization Policies -> Overly Permissive Role Mappings -> Exploit Overly Broad Role Assignments -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Resources](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_insecure_authorization_policies_-_overly_permissive_role_mapping_3426f144.md)

Attack Vector: Users or clients are assigned overly broad roles with excessive permissions. Attackers exploit these overly permissive roles to gain unauthorized access to application resources beyond their intended access level.
Example: A user is assigned a "developer" role that inadvertently grants them administrative privileges to sensitive application data. The attacker, using the "developer" account, accesses and exfiltrates this data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Insecure Client Configurations -> Misconfigured Redirect URIs -> Open Redirect Exploitation -> Redirect Users to Malicious Sites After Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_insecure_client_configurations_-_misconfigured_redirect_uris_-_o_05cb8ced.md)

Attack Vector: Redirect URIs for OAuth 2.0/OIDC clients are misconfigured (e.g., wildcard redirects, overly broad whitelisting). Attackers exploit open redirect vulnerabilities to redirect users to malicious sites after successful authentication, potentially stealing credentials or tokens.
Example: A client's redirect URI is set to `*.example.com`. Attackers craft a malicious link using `attacker.example.com` as the redirect URI. Users clicking this link are redirected to the attacker's site after authentication, potentially exposing their authorization code or tokens.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Insecure Client Configurations -> Misconfigured Redirect URIs -> Authorization Code Interception -> Intercept Authorization Codes via Open Redirect](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_insecure_client_configurations_-_misconfigured_redirect_uris_-_a_166bd5e6.md)

Attack Vector: Similar to open redirect exploitation, but specifically targets the authorization code in OAuth 2.0 flows. Attackers use open redirect to intercept the authorization code and exchange it for access tokens, gaining unauthorized access.
Example: Attackers exploit an open redirect to intercept the authorization code in the redirect URI. They then use this code to obtain access tokens and impersonate the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Exposed Admin Interfaces -> Publicly Accessible Admin Console -> Brute-Force Admin Credentials -> Attempt Default/Weak Admin Passwords](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_exposed_admin_interfaces_-_publicly_accessible_admin_console_-_b_3eec3363.md)

Attack Vector: The Keycloak Admin Console is publicly accessible. Attackers attempt to brute-force admin credentials, often starting with default or common passwords.
Example: Attackers scan the internet for publicly exposed Keycloak Admin Consoles. They then use lists of default usernames and passwords to attempt to log in as administrator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Exposed Admin Interfaces -> Publicly Accessible Admin Console -> Exploit Admin Console Vulnerabilities -> Target Vulnerabilities in Admin Console UI or API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_exposed_admin_interfaces_-_publicly_accessible_admin_console_-_e_9ba37d6b.md)

Attack Vector: The Keycloak Admin Console is publicly accessible and contains vulnerabilities in its UI or API. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious actions.
Example: An XSS vulnerability in the Admin Console allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code. An administrator visiting the console with this injected code could have their session hijacked or their actions manipulated.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> Insecure Protocol Configurations (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML) -> Weak or Disabled Security Features (e.g., PKCE, token encryption) -> Exploit Protocol Weaknesses -> Token Theft, Replay Attacks, etc.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_insecure_protocol_configurations__oauth_2_0__oidc__saml__-_weak__185096c0.md)

Attack Vector: Security features of authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML) are disabled or weakly configured. Attackers exploit these weaknesses to perform token theft, replay attacks, or other protocol-level attacks.
Example: PKCE is not enabled for public clients. Attackers can intercept the authorization code and exchange it for tokens, bypassing the intended security mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Keycloak Misconfiguration -> CORS Misconfiguration -> Overly Permissive CORS Policies -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via CORS Bypass -> Steal Tokens or Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_keycloak_misconfiguration_-_cors_misconfiguration_-_overly_permissive_cors_policies_-_cross-_c2dad265.md)

Attack Vector: CORS policies are overly permissive, allowing requests from untrusted origins. Attackers exploit this to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks from malicious websites, bypassing CORS restrictions and potentially stealing tokens or sensitive data.
Example: CORS policy allows requests from `*`. Attackers host a malicious website that makes JavaScript requests to the Keycloak server. Due to the permissive CORS policy, the browser allows these requests, and the attacker can steal tokens or session cookies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Keycloak Users/Administrators -> Phishing Attacks -> Target User Credentials -> Send Phishing Emails Mimicking Keycloak Login Pages](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_keycloak_usersadministrators_-_phishing_attacks_-_target_user_credentials_-_send__02480abb.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers send phishing emails that mimic legitimate Keycloak login pages to trick users into entering their credentials.
Example: Users receive emails that appear to be from their organization's IT department, requesting them to log in to Keycloak to verify their account. The link in the email leads to a fake login page controlled by the attacker, who captures the entered credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Keycloak Users/Administrators -> Phishing Attacks -> Target Admin Credentials -> Phish Admin Accounts for Elevated Access](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_keycloak_usersadministrators_-_phishing_attacks_-_target_admin_credentials_-_phis_15d243e4.md)

Attack Vector: Similar to user credential phishing, but specifically targets administrators with phishing emails designed to steal their elevated access credentials.
Example: Attackers send targeted phishing emails to Keycloak administrators, impersonating senior management or security teams, urging them to log in to the Admin Console for urgent security updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Keycloak Users/Administrators -> Credential Stuffing/Password Spraying -> Utilize Leaked Credentials -> Attempt Login with Credentials from Data Breaches](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_keycloak_usersadministrators_-_credential_stuffingpassword_spraying_-_utilize_lea_44d25ee8.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers obtain lists of leaked credentials from data breaches. They use these credentials to attempt login to Keycloak user accounts (credential stuffing).
Example: Attackers use automated tools to try leaked username/password combinations against the Keycloak login endpoint. If users reuse passwords, their accounts can be compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Keycloak Users/Administrators -> Credential Stuffing/Password Spraying -> Password Spraying Common Passwords -> Try Common Passwords Against Multiple Accounts](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_keycloak_usersadministrators_-_credential_stuffingpassword_spraying_-_password_sp_d84a7538.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers use lists of common passwords and spray them across multiple user accounts in an attempt to find accounts using weak passwords (password spraying).
Example: Attackers use tools to try a list of common passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "companyname") against a large number of usernames in Keycloak.
