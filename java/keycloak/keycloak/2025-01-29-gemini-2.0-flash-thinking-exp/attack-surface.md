# Attack Surface Analysis for keycloak/keycloak

## Attack Surface: [Brute-force Attacks on Authentication Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/brute-force_attacks_on_authentication_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different usernames and passwords against Keycloak's login endpoints.
*   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak provides the authentication endpoints that are the target of these attacks. Misconfiguration or lack of rate limiting in Keycloak directly contributes to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a script to try thousands of common passwords against a known username on the Keycloak login page.
*   **Impact:** Successful brute-force attacks can lead to account compromise, unauthorized access to applications and data, and potential data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Administrators:**
        *   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Configure Keycloak's built-in rate limiting features to restrict login attempts.
        *   **Account Lockout Policies:** Enable and configure account lockout policies in Keycloak.
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password complexity requirements and password rotation policies within Keycloak realms.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable and enforce MFA for users.
        *   **Monitor Login Attempts:** Implement logging and monitoring of failed login attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Password Reset Flow Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/password_reset_flow_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in the password reset process can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak's password reset functionality, if not properly configured or if vulnerabilities exist in its implementation, can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A password reset link sent via email contains a predictable token. An attacker guesses the token and resets the user's password.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to applications and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Administrators:**
        *   **Strong Reset Token Generation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for reset tokens.
        *   **Token Expiration:** Implement short expiration times for password reset tokens.
        *   **Secure Token Delivery:** Ensure password reset links are delivered over HTTPS.
        *   **Validate User Identity:** Implement additional verification steps during password reset.
        *   **Rate Limiting on Reset Requests:** Limit the number of password reset requests.

## Attack Surface: [Redirect URI Manipulation in OAuth/OIDC](./attack_surfaces/redirect_uri_manipulation_in_oauthoidc.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the `redirect_uri` parameter in OAuth 2.0 or OIDC flows to redirect users to attacker-controlled websites after successful authentication.
*   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak's OAuth 2.0 and OIDC implementation relies on `redirect_uri` validation. Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in this validation can lead to exploitation.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies the `redirect_uri` to a malicious site in the authorization request, potentially stealing authorization codes or tokens after user authentication.
*   **Impact:** Authorization code or token theft, account compromise, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Administrators:**
        *   **Strict Redirect URI Whitelisting:** Configure Keycloak clients with a strict whitelist of valid `redirect_uri` patterns.
        *   **Validate `redirect_uri` on the Server-Side:** Always validate the `redirect_uri` parameter on the server-side.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Client Registration (Dynamic Client Registration)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_client_registration__dynamic_client_registration_.md)

*   **Description:** If dynamic client registration is enabled in Keycloak and not properly secured, attackers can register malicious clients.
*   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak's dynamic client registration feature, if enabled without proper access controls, directly introduces this attack surface.
*   **Example:** Dynamic client registration is enabled without authentication, allowing an attacker to register a malicious client for phishing or impersonation.
*   **Impact:** Rogue clients can be used for phishing, data theft, and impersonation attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Administrators:**
        *   **Disable Dynamic Client Registration (if not needed):** Disable dynamic client registration if it's not required.
        *   **Secure Dynamic Client Registration Endpoint:** Secure the registration endpoint with authentication and authorization.
        *   **Client Review and Approval Process:** Implement a review and approval process for dynamically registered clients.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Admin Console](./attack_surfaces/exposed_admin_console.md)

*   **Description:** The Keycloak Admin Console, if accessible from the public internet without proper access controls, becomes a prime target for attackers.
*   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak provides the Admin Console, and its accessibility is a direct configuration concern.
*   **Example:** The Keycloak Admin Console is accessible on a public IP address without IP restrictions or strong authentication, making it vulnerable to attacks.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Keycloak instance, including user data and configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Administrators:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to the Admin Console to a private network or trusted IP ranges.
        *   **Strong Authentication for Admin Console:** Enforce strong authentication, including MFA, for Admin Console access.
        *   **Disable Public Access (if possible):** Disable public access and only allow access from internal networks or VPNs.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Keycloak's Codebase and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_keycloak's_codebase_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities in Keycloak's Java codebase or its third-party dependencies can be exploited by attackers.
*   **Keycloak Contribution:** Keycloak, like any software, is susceptible to vulnerabilities in its own code and the libraries it uses.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability (CVE) in a library used by Keycloak is exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute code on the Keycloak server.
*   **Impact:** Ranging from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution and full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers/Administrators:**
        *   **Regularly Update Keycloak:** Keep Keycloak updated to the latest stable version to patch vulnerabilities.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in Keycloak's dependencies.
        *   **Security Patch Management:** Promptly apply security patches released by the Keycloak project and its dependencies.
