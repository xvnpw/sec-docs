## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies (Keycloak Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies__keycloak_configuration_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce Strong Password Policies (Keycloak Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Keycloak Admin Console:** Log in to the Keycloak admin console with administrative privileges.
    2.  **Navigate to Realm Settings:** Select the realm for which you want to enforce password policies.
    3.  **Go to 'Authentication' Tab:** Click on the 'Authentication' tab in the realm settings.
    4.  **Select 'Password Policy':** Find the 'Password Policy' section.
    5.  **Configure Policy Rules within Keycloak:** Define the following rules directly in Keycloak's Password Policy settings:
        *   **Minimum Length:** Set a minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
        *   **Character Sets:** Require a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters using Keycloak's policy configuration.
        *   **Password History:** Prevent users from reusing recently used passwords (e.g., last 5 passwords) using Keycloak's history policy.
        *   **Password Expiration:** Set a password expiration period (e.g., 90 days) using Keycloak's expiration policy.
    6.  **Save Changes in Keycloak:** Save the updated password policy configuration within the Keycloak admin console.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (High Severity):** Strong passwords configured in Keycloak make it significantly harder for attackers to guess passwords through brute-force attempts against Keycloak's authentication endpoints.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High Severity):**  Reduces the effectiveness of credential stuffing attacks against Keycloak by requiring complex passwords.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Makes dictionary attacks against Keycloak less effective.
    *   **Weak Password Guessing (Medium Severity):** Prevents users from choosing easily guessable passwords when creating or changing passwords through Keycloak.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Weak Password Guessing:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, partially implemented in the Keycloak 'master' realm with a minimum length of 8 characters and character set requirements configured within Keycloak.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Password history policy is not currently enforced in Keycloak.
    *   Password expiration policy is not currently configured in Keycloak.
    *   Password policy needs to be consistently applied across all realms in Keycloak, including newly created realms.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Keycloak Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_multi-factor_authentication__mfa___keycloak_configuration_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Keycloak Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable MFA Providers in Keycloak:** In the Keycloak admin console, navigate to the realm settings and then the 'Authentication' tab. Ensure desired MFA providers (e.g., 'OTP Password Policy', 'WebAuthn Policy') are enabled within Keycloak.
    2.  **Configure MFA Requirement in Keycloak Authentication Flows:** Under the 'Flows' tab in 'Authentication', modify the 'Browser' flow (or relevant flow) within Keycloak to require MFA. This is done by adding 'OTP Form' or 'WebAuthn Authenticator' as a required execution in Keycloak's authentication flow configuration.
    3.  **User Enrollment via Keycloak Account Console:** Guide users to enroll in MFA through Keycloak's account console. Keycloak provides the UI and mechanisms for users to set up MFA.
    4.  **Enforce MFA for Roles/Groups in Keycloak (Optional):** Configure MFA to be mandatory for specific roles or groups within Keycloak using Required Actions or Authentication Flows configured in Keycloak.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   MFA is not enforced for all users or specific roles (e.g., administrators) within Keycloak. It is currently optional in Keycloak.
    *   WebAuthn is enabled in Keycloak but not actively promoted or used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Client and Role Configuration (Keycloak Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_client_and_role_configuration__keycloak_configuration_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Principle of Least Privilege for Client and Role Configuration (Keycloak Configuration)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Clients and Roles in Keycloak:** Audit all existing Keycloak clients and roles to understand their current permissions and scopes defined within Keycloak.
    2.  **Identify Necessary Permissions for Keycloak Clients:** For each client application registered in Keycloak, determine the *minimum* set of permissions and scopes required for its functionality within Keycloak.
    3.  **Restrict Client Scopes in Keycloak:**  For each client in Keycloak, configure its scopes to only include the necessary permissions within Keycloak's client configuration.
    4.  **Define Granular Roles in Keycloak:** Create specific roles within Keycloak that represent different levels of access.

    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):**  Restricts an attacker's ability to move laterally within the system after gaining initial access via Keycloak.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the scope of potential data breaches by limiting the access compromised accounts managed by Keycloak have to sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** Medium to High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**

        *   **Lockout Duration:** Define the duration for which the account will be locked (e.g., 30 minutes).
        *   **Wait Increment Seconds (Optional):** Configure increasing lockout durations after repeated lockouts.
        *   **Quick Login Check Milli Seconds (Optional):** Adjust quick login check settings for optimization.
    6.  **Save Changes in Keycloak:** Save the updated brute force detection and account lockout configuration in Keycloak.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

    3.  **Go to 'Login' Tab:** Click on the 'Login' tab in realm settings.
    4.  **Enable 'Login Theme' and Customize (If using Custom Theme):** If using a custom login theme, ensure error messages are generic in the theme templates.
    5.  **Review Default Keycloak Error Messages:** If using the default theme, review the default error messages in Keycloak's messages files (if customization is needed, which is less common for this specific mitigation).
    6.  **Ensure Generic Error Responses:** Verify that login error responses from Keycloak are generic and do not differentiate between "invalid username" and "invalid password". The goal is to return a single, generic "Invalid credentials" message for failed login attempts.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Enumeration (Medium Severity):** Generic error messages in Keycloak prevent attackers from easily determining if a username exists in the system during account enumeration attempts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Account Enumeration:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely implemented by default in Keycloak as standard security practice. Default Keycloak error messages are generally generic.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification needed to confirm that custom login themes (if used) do not inadvertently reveal account existence through specific error messages.
    *   Periodic review of Keycloak's error message configurations should be performed to ensure this mitigation remains in place.
