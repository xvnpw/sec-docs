*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Data Injection via Chart Data**
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input data that is used to generate the chart, leading to unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart directly renders the data provided to it. If the application doesn't sanitize or validate this data, the library will process and display potentially harmful content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides an extremely long string for a chart label, potentially causing a buffer overflow or memory exhaustion when MPAndroidChart attempts to render it.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service, unexpected UI behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data used to populate chart elements (labels, values, etc.).
        *   Limit the length of strings used for labels and other text elements.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided, unsanitized data for chart generation.

*   **Attack Surface: Using Outdated Versions with Known Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Using an outdated version of MPAndroidChart that has known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to those flaws.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** Older versions of the library might contain bugs or security weaknesses that have been identified and patched in newer releases.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of MPAndroidChart allows an attacker to craft specific data that causes a crash, which could be exploited for denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from minor issues to critical security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep MPAndroidChart updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor release notes and security advisories for MPAndroidChart to be aware of any reported vulnerabilities and their fixes.
        *   Implement a process for regularly updating third-party libraries.
