* **Attack Surface:** Code Injection via Groovy DSL
    * **Description:** Malicious code can be injected and executed during test runs if test code is dynamically generated or manipulated based on external, untrusted input.
    * **How Spock Contributes:** Spock's reliance on Groovy's dynamic nature and DSL for writing tests makes it susceptible if test code generation or manipulation isn't handled securely. Features like data tables or external configuration files used to build test scenarios can be attack vectors where malicious Groovy code could be injected and executed by Spock.
    * **Example:** A configuration file used to define test cases is compromised, and an attacker injects Groovy code within a string that is later used in a Spock specification. When Spock runs the test, this injected code executes.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the test environment, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service within the testing infrastructure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid generating Spock test code dynamically based on external, untrusted input.
        * Sanitize and validate any external data used to construct Spock test specifications before incorporating it into the test code.
        * Implement strict access controls for configuration files and other resources used by Spock tests.
        * Regularly review Spock test code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
