### High and Critical Dropwizard Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve Dropwizard components:

**1. Threat:** Plaintext Secrets in Configuration

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets if they are stored in plaintext within the application's YAML configuration file. This could happen through unauthorized access to the configuration file on the server, in version control systems, or during deployment processes.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** `"ConfigurationFactory"` (responsible for loading and parsing the YAML configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize environment variables to store sensitive information.
    *   Employ dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve secrets.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within the configuration file if environment variables or secret management are not feasible.
    *   Ensure proper file system permissions for configuration files, restricting access to authorized users and processes.
    *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control systems.

**2. Threat:** External Entity Expansion (XXE) in Configuration Parsing

*   **Description:** If the YAML parsing library used by Dropwizard is vulnerable to XXE attacks and processes external entities, an attacker could craft a malicious YAML configuration file. When the application parses this file, the attacker could potentially read local files on the server, cause denial-of-service, or even achieve remote code execution in some scenarios.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files), denial of service, potential remote code execution.
*   **Affected Component:**  Underlying YAML parsing library (e.g., SnakeYAML) used by `"ConfigurationFactory"`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the YAML parsing library is updated to the latest version with known XXE vulnerabilities patched.
    *   Disable the processing of external entities in the YAML parser configuration. Consult the documentation of the specific YAML library used by the Dropwizard version.
    *   Sanitize or validate configuration files before parsing if they originate from untrusted sources.

**3. Threat:** Vulnerable Dependencies

*   **Description:** Dropwizard relies on numerous third-party libraries. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application. This could involve exploiting flaws in libraries used for web serving, JSON processing, logging, or other functionalities. Attackers might leverage these vulnerabilities for remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, and privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:**  Various Dropwizard modules and the underlying libraries they depend on (e.g., `"dropwizard-core"`, `"dropwizard-jersey"`, `"dropwizard-jetty"`, libraries like Jackson, Guava, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Dropwizard and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Implement a process for monitoring and responding to newly discovered vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.

**4. Threat:** Insecure Deserialization

*   **Description:** If the application deserializes untrusted data (e.g., from API requests) without proper validation, an attacker could craft malicious serialized objects. When these objects are deserialized, they can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server. This is particularly relevant when using default Jackson settings without proper safeguards.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `"Jackson"` (the default JSON processing library used by Jersey in Dropwizard).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, implement strict validation of the data being deserialized.
    *   Consider using safer deserialization libraries or configurations that mitigate insecure deserialization risks.
    *   Disable default typing in Jackson and explicitly define the types to be deserialized.
    *   Implement input sanitization and validation before deserialization.

**5. Threat:** Jetty Version Vulnerabilities

*   **Description:** Using an outdated or vulnerable version of the embedded Jetty server can expose the application to known security flaws in Jetty itself. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform various attacks, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific Jetty vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, and information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** `"Jetty"` (the embedded web server).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Dropwizard, which will typically include updates to the embedded Jetty server.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Jetty and update promptly when vulnerabilities are announced.

**6. Threat:** Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration

*   **Description:**  Misconfigured TLS/SSL settings in the embedded Jetty server can leave the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or other cryptographic weaknesses. This includes using weak cipher suites, outdated protocols, or missing important security headers.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, man-in-the-middle attacks, and compromise of secure communication.
*   **Affected Component:** `"ServerConnector"` in `"Jetty"` (responsible for handling HTTPS connections).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure strong and modern cipher suites for HTTPS.
    *   Disable support for outdated TLS/SSL protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).
    *   Enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
    *   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to instruct browsers to only access the site over HTTPS.
    *   Ensure valid and up-to-date SSL/TLS certificates are used.
