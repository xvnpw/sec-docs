Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Dropwizard, with High and Critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposed Admin Interface without Proper Authentication
    *   **Description:** The Dropwizard admin interface (typically on port 8081) provides access to management endpoints like health checks, metrics, thread dumps, and log level manipulation. Without proper authentication and authorization, these endpoints are accessible to anyone who can reach the port.
    *   **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard provides this admin interface out-of-the-box, and if not explicitly configured with authentication, it defaults to being open.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses `http://<server-ip>:8081/metrics` and gains insight into the application's performance and internal state, potentially revealing sensitive information or aiding in planning further attacks.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the application's operational state, information disclosure, potential denial-of-service by manipulating log levels or triggering resource-intensive operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Authentication for the admin interface using basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, or other suitable mechanisms.
        *   Restrict access to the admin port using firewall rules or network segmentation to authorized networks or IP addresses.
        *   Disable unused admin endpoints through configuration if they are not required.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration via Default Files or Environment Variables
    *   **Description:** Dropwizard applications often rely on configuration files (e.g., `config.yml`) or environment variables to store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and internal service URLs. If these are not properly secured, attackers can gain access to this critical information.
    *   **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard uses configuration files and environment variables as standard mechanisms for application configuration.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the server's filesystem and reads the `config.yml` file, revealing database credentials.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the application and potentially related systems, data breaches, unauthorized access to external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Implement secure practices for managing environment variables, avoiding storing them in easily accessible locations.
        *   Utilize secure configuration management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage sensitive configuration data.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly in the application code.

*   **Attack Surface:**  Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Dropwizard relies on numerous third-party libraries (e.g., Jetty, Jackson, Guava). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly impact the security of the Dropwizard application.
    *   **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard bundles and relies on these dependencies.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability exists in the version of the Jackson library used by Dropwizard, allowing for remote code execution through deserialization.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial-of-service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Dropwizard and all its dependencies with the latest security patches.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Dropwizard and its dependencies.
