# Attack Surface Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Configured Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_configured_admin_interface.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Insecurely Configured Admin Interface
    - **Description:** The Dropwizard admin interface provides access to application metrics, health checks, and potentially other management functionalities. If not properly secured, it can be a direct entry point for attackers.
    - **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard provides a built-in admin interface that is enabled by default. If default settings are not changed or authentication/authorization is not implemented, it's vulnerable.
    - **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/metrics` endpoint on the admin port without authentication and gains insight into the application's internal state, potentially revealing sensitive information or performance bottlenecks.
    - **Impact:** Full control over the application's management functions, information disclosure, potential for denial of service by manipulating settings or triggering resource-intensive operations.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Enable authentication and authorization for the admin interface.
        - Change default ports for the admin interface.
        - Restrict access to the admin interface to specific IP addresses or networks.
        - Disable unnecessary admin interface features or endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Unsecured Metrics Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_unsecured_metrics_endpoint.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated or Unsecured Metrics Endpoint
    - **Description:** Dropwizard's metrics endpoint exposes valuable operational data about the application. If accessible without authentication, this information can be used for reconnaissance or to identify vulnerabilities.
    - **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard automatically collects and exposes metrics through a dedicated endpoint. By default, this endpoint might not require authentication.
    - **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/metrics` endpoint and observes database connection pool statistics, revealing the database type and potentially aiding in targeted attacks.
    - **Impact:** Information disclosure, aiding in reconnaissance, potential for identifying performance bottlenecks for denial of service attacks.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Enable authentication and authorization for the metrics endpoint.
        - Restrict access to the metrics endpoint to specific IP addresses or networks.
        - Carefully consider what metrics are exposed and whether sensitive information is included.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities via Jersey](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_via_jersey.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities via Jersey
    - **Description:** Dropwizard uses Jersey for its RESTful API implementation. If input is deserialized without proper validation, it can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities.
    - **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard's reliance on Jersey for handling request bodies means that applications need to be careful about how they deserialize data, especially from untrusted sources.
    - **Example:** An attacker sends a malicious serialized object in a request body that, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code on the server.
    - **Impact:** Remote code execution, full compromise of the server.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        - Use secure deserialization techniques and libraries.
        - Implement strict input validation before deserialization.
        - Consider using alternative data formats like JSON, which are generally less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Logging Sensitive Information](./attack_surfaces/logging_sensitive_information.md)

- **Attack Surface:** Logging Sensitive Information
    - **Description:** Dropwizard uses Logback for logging. If developers inadvertently log sensitive information, it can be exposed in log files.
    - **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard's logging framework provides a convenient way to log application events. However, developers need to be mindful of what data they are logging.
    - **Example:** An exception handler logs the full request body, which contains a user's password. This password is then stored in the application logs.
    - **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of user accounts or sensitive data.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement policies and guidelines for logging sensitive data.
        - Sanitize or mask sensitive information before logging.
        - Securely store and manage log files with appropriate access controls.
        - Regularly review log configurations and content.

## Attack Surface: [YAML Configuration Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/yaml_configuration_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Surface:** YAML Configuration Parsing Vulnerabilities
    - **Description:** Dropwizard uses YAML for configuration. Vulnerabilities in the YAML parsing library can potentially be exploited if malicious YAML is provided.
    - **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard relies on a YAML parsing library to load its configuration. If this library has vulnerabilities, the application is susceptible.
    - **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted YAML configuration file that exploits a vulnerability in the parsing library, leading to remote code execution.
    - **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution or other unexpected behavior.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Keep the Dropwizard and its dependencies, including the YAML parsing library, up to date.
        - Ensure configuration files are sourced from trusted locations and have appropriate access controls.
        - Consider alternative configuration formats if security concerns are high.
