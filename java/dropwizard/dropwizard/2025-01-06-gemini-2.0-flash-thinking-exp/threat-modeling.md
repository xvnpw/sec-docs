# Threat Model Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** Dropwizard's default configuration loading mechanisms or lack of strong security defaults might lead to sensitive configuration data (like database credentials or API keys) being easily accessible if not explicitly secured by the developer. An attacker could exploit insecure file permissions on the configuration file or potentially access configuration endpoints if not properly disabled or secured.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (access to sensitive data), unauthorized access to backend systems, potential for further attacks using the exposed credentials.
    *   **Affected Dropwizard Component:** Configuration loading mechanism, potentially the `ConfigurationFactory` and default file handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Utilize environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools.
        *   Ensure strict file system permissions are applied to configuration files to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   Disable or secure any endpoints that might inadvertently expose configuration details.

## Threat: [Unsecured Access to the Admin Interface](./threats/unsecured_access_to_the_admin_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Unsecured Access to the Admin Interface
    *   **Description:** Dropwizard's admin interface, which provides access to health checks, metrics, and other management functionalities, might be accessible without proper authentication or authorization by default. An attacker could exploit this by accessing the admin port and gaining insights into the application's internal state, potentially leading to information disclosure or the ability to manipulate the application if administrative actions are exposed without protection.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (internal application state, dependencies), potential for manipulation if the admin interface allows for actions without authorization, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Dropwizard Component:** Admin interface servlet, default authentication and authorization configurations for the admin interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable authentication and authorization for the admin interface. Configure a strong authentication mechanism.
        *   Restrict access to the admin interface to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Consider running the admin interface on a separate, non-publicly accessible network interface.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Bundled Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_bundled_libraries.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Bundled Libraries
    *   **Description:** Dropwizard bundles several libraries like Jetty and potentially others. If vulnerabilities are discovered in these specific versions of the bundled libraries, a Dropwizard application using those versions is inherently vulnerable. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests or data that target the known flaws in the bundled components.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Dropwizard Component:** The specific bundled libraries containing the vulnerability (e.g., the embedded Jetty server).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from High to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Dropwizard updated to the latest stable version to benefit from updates to its bundled libraries that include security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the specific versions of libraries used by Dropwizard and plan upgrades accordingly.
