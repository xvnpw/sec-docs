## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**YAML Injection [CRITICAL]:**
*   Attackers can inject malicious YAML code into configuration files.
*   This can occur if external input influences configuration loading without proper sanitization.
*   When the application parses the injected YAML, it can lead to:
    *   Remote code execution on the server.
    *   Manipulation of application behavior by altering configuration settings.
*   This exploits the YAML parser's ability to execute arbitrary code based on specific YAML syntax.

**Sensitive Data in Configuration Files [CRITICAL]:**
*   Developers might unintentionally store sensitive information directly in configuration files.
*   Examples of sensitive data include:
    *   API keys for external services.
    *   Database credentials (usernames, passwords).
    *   Encryption keys or other secrets.
*   If attackers gain access to these configuration files (due to misconfigured file permissions, insecure storage, or other vulnerabilities), they can directly retrieve these secrets.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Compromise of the application's data.
    *   Unauthorized access to connected services.
    *   Further exploitation of the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Admin Interface [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_admin_interface__high-risk_path_.md)

**Authentication Bypass on Admin Interface [CRITICAL]:**
*   Dropwizard provides an optional admin interface (`/admin`) for managing the application.
*   Attackers might attempt to circumvent the authentication mechanisms protecting this interface.
*   This could involve exploiting:
    *   Default or weak credentials.
    *   Flaws in the authentication logic.
    *   Bypass vulnerabilities in authentication filters or middleware.
*   Successful bypass grants unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.

**Authorization Vulnerabilities on Admin Interface [CRITICAL]:**
*   Even if authentication is in place, vulnerabilities in the authorization logic can be exploited.
*   This means an attacker might be able to access administrative functionalities they are not supposed to have access to, even after authenticating.
*   This can occur due to:
    *   Missing or incorrect authorization checks.
    *   Logic flaws in role-based access control.
    *   Exploitation of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
*   Successful exploitation allows attackers to perform actions beyond their intended permissions.

**Remote Code Execution via Admin Functionality [CRITICAL]:**
*   Certain administrative functionalities might be exploitable to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   This could involve:
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in features that allow uploading or modifying files.
    *   Injecting malicious code into configuration updates or diagnostic tools.
    *   Leveraging insecure deserialization within administrative features.
*   Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the server hosting the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jersey/REST API Integration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jerseyrest_api_integration__high-risk_path_.md)

**Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Jersey [CRITICAL]:**
*   Dropwizard uses Jersey for implementing RESTful APIs.
*   If the application accepts serialized objects (e.g., Java objects) as input to API endpoints, it's vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
*   Attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized by the application, can lead to:
    *   Remote code execution on the server.
    *   Denial of service by consuming excessive resources.
    *   Other unexpected behavior depending on the deserialization vulnerability.
*   This exploits the fact that deserialization can instantiate objects and execute code defined within the serialized data.
