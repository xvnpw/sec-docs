# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Dropwizard and Core Dependencies (Jetty, Jackson)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_dropwizard_and_core_dependencies__jetty__jackson_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor Dropwizard Releases:** Regularly check the official Dropwizard website, GitHub repository, and mailing lists for new releases and security advisories. Pay close attention to release notes detailing bug fixes, security patches, and dependency updates.
2.  **Update Dropwizard Version:** When a new stable Dropwizard version is released, plan and execute an upgrade. Follow the official Dropwizard upgrade guides to ensure a smooth transition and address any breaking changes.
3.  **Update Core Dependencies (Jetty, Jackson):** Dropwizard bundles Jetty and Jackson. When updating Dropwizard, ensure that the bundled versions of Jetty and Jackson are also updated to their latest stable and secure versions. If managing these dependencies separately (advanced users), track their releases and update accordingly.
4.  **Test Thoroughly After Upgrade:** After upgrading Dropwizard and its core dependencies, perform comprehensive testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) to verify application functionality and stability. Pay special attention to areas potentially affected by framework changes.
5.  **Establish Update Cadence:** Define a regular schedule for checking and applying Dropwizard updates (e.g., quarterly or based on security advisory severity).

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Vulnerable Dropwizard Framework (High Severity) - Exploitation of vulnerabilities directly within the Dropwizard framework code itself.
*   Vulnerable Core Dependencies (Jetty, Jackson) (High Severity) - Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Jetty (embedded web server) or Jackson (JSON processing), which are integral parts of Dropwizard.

**Impact:**
*   Vulnerable Dropwizard Framework: High risk reduction. Directly addresses vulnerabilities in the framework itself.
*   Vulnerable Core Dependencies (Jetty, Jackson): High risk reduction. Mitigates risks arising from vulnerable core components of Dropwizard.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Dropwizard version is updated manually every six months during major release cycles.
*   Implemented in: `pom.xml`, project's release process documentation.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More frequent Dropwizard updates (e.g., quarterly or monthly), especially for security releases.
*   Automated notifications for new Dropwizard releases and security advisories.
*   Dedicated testing procedures specifically for Dropwizard upgrades.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Externalize Configuration using Dropwizard's Configuration Mechanism](./mitigation_strategies/externalize_configuration_using_dropwizard's_configuration_mechanism.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Utilize `config.yml` and Environment Variables:** Leverage Dropwizard's built-in configuration system. Define application configuration in `config.yml` and use environment variable substitution (`${VARIABLE_NAME}`) for sensitive or environment-specific values.
2.  **Structure Configuration Classes:** Define configuration classes that map to the structure of your `config.yml` file. Use Dropwizard's `@Configuration` annotation and JSR-303 Bean Validation annotations for type safety and validation.
3.  **Inject Configuration:** Access configuration values in your application code by injecting the configuration classes using Dropwizard's dependency injection or by accessing the `Configuration` object passed to your `Application` class.
4.  **Secure `config.yml` Access:** Protect the `config.yml` file itself from unauthorized access using file system permissions.
5.  **Document Configuration:** Clearly document all configuration parameters, especially environment variables, for operational teams.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exposure of Secrets in `config.yml` (High Severity) - Prevents hardcoding sensitive information directly in the configuration file, reducing the risk of accidental exposure in version control or deployment artifacts.
*   Configuration Errors (Medium Severity) - Using Dropwizard's configuration validation helps catch configuration errors early during application startup, preventing misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or service disruptions.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of Secrets in `config.yml`: High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of secrets leakage through configuration files.
*   Configuration Errors: Medium risk reduction. Improves application robustness and reduces the likelihood of security issues caused by misconfiguration.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `config.yml` is used for application configuration. Environment variables are used for database credentials.
*   Implemented in: `config.yml`, configuration classes, application code.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of environment variables for *all* sensitive and environment-specific configurations.
*   Comprehensive validation rules defined in configuration classes using JSR-303 annotations.
*   Formal documentation of all configuration parameters and environment variables.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dropwizard Admin Interface](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dropwizard_admin_interface.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Authentication:** Configure authentication for the Dropwizard admin interface in `config.yml`. Choose an appropriate authentication mechanism supported by Dropwizard (e.g., HTTP Basic Authentication, custom authenticators).
2.  **Implement Authorization (Optional but Recommended):** If role-based access control is needed, implement authorization to restrict access to specific admin interface endpoints based on user roles. Use Dropwizard's security features to define roles and permissions.
3.  **Restrict Network Access:** Configure network firewalls or security groups to limit access to the admin interface port (default 8081) to trusted networks or IP ranges. Avoid exposing the admin interface to the public internet.
4.  **Use HTTPS for Admin Interface:** Enable HTTPS for the admin interface to encrypt communication and protect credentials in transit. Configure TLS/SSL settings in Dropwizard's `config.yml` for the admin connector.
5.  **Regularly Review Admin Access:** Periodically review and audit user accounts and access permissions for the admin interface. Rotate credentials as needed.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized users from accessing the Dropwizard admin interface, which provides administrative control and exposes sensitive operational data.
*   Information Disclosure via Admin Interface (Medium Severity) - Protects sensitive metrics, health check information, and other administrative data exposed through the admin interface from unauthorized viewing.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Admin Interface (Medium Severity) - Using HTTPS prevents eavesdropping and tampering with communication to the admin interface.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface: High risk reduction. Effectively secures the admin interface from unauthorized access.
*   Information Disclosure via Admin Interface: Medium risk reduction. Protects sensitive operational data.
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Admin Interface: Medium risk reduction. Secures communication to the admin interface.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   HTTP Basic Authentication is enabled for the admin interface.
*   Implemented in: `config.yml`, custom authenticator class.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Role-based authorization for admin interface endpoints.
*   HTTPS enabled for the admin interface.
*   Regular audits of admin interface user accounts and access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Dropwizard Metrics and Health Check Endpoints](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dropwizard_metrics_and_health_check_endpoints.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Exposed Information:** Carefully review the metrics and health checks exposed by your Dropwizard application. Identify if any expose sensitive operational details.
2.  **Implement Authentication/Authorization (If Needed):** If sensitive information is exposed, or if you want to restrict access, configure authentication and authorization for metrics and health check endpoints. You can reuse the admin interface security or configure separate security.
3.  **Separate Public and Private Health Checks (Using Dropwizard Features):** Utilize Dropwizard's ability to define different health check endpoints. Create a public, lightweight health check for load balancers (unauthenticated) and a more detailed, private health check for internal monitoring (authenticated).
4.  **Rate Limit Health Check Endpoints (Using Jetty/Dropwizard Features):** Configure rate limiting for health check endpoints using Jetty's features or Dropwizard's request filters to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attempts.
5.  **Minimize Metric Exposure:**  Refine the metrics collected and exposed by Dropwizard to avoid unnecessary or overly detailed information that could be exploited.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Information Disclosure via Metrics/Health Checks (Medium Severity) - Exposure of sensitive operational details through publicly accessible metrics or health check endpoints provided by Dropwizard.
*   Denial of Service via Health Check Abuse (Medium Severity) - Overloading Dropwizard's health check endpoints to cause service disruption.

**Impact:**
*   Information Disclosure via Metrics/Health Checks: Medium risk reduction. Limits potential information leakage through Dropwizard's monitoring endpoints.
*   Denial of Service via Health Check Abuse: Medium risk reduction. Reduces the impact of DoS attacks targeting Dropwizard's health check functionality.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic health check endpoint (`/health`) is public. Metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) is behind admin authentication.
*   Implemented in: Dropwizard application code (health checks), `config.yml` (admin security).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Separation of public and private health check endpoints using Dropwizard's endpoint configuration.
*   Rate limiting on public health check endpoints using Jetty or Dropwizard features.
*   Review and refinement of exposed metrics to minimize sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Dropwizard Logging Securely](./mitigation_strategies/configure_dropwizard_logging_securely.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Logback Configuration (Dropwizard's Default):** Examine your Logback configuration file (used by Dropwizard for logging) to understand what information is being logged and where logs are stored.
2.  **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Configure Logback and application code to prevent logging sensitive information (passwords, API keys, PII) in logs. Use parameterized logging and avoid string concatenation of sensitive data into log messages.
3.  **Implement Log Scrubbing (If Necessary):** If sensitive data might inadvertently be logged, implement log scrubbing or masking techniques within Logback or a separate log processing pipeline to redact sensitive information before logs are stored.
4.  **Secure Log Storage:** Protect log files generated by Dropwizard from unauthorized access. Use appropriate file system permissions and access controls on log directories and files. Consider using centralized logging systems with robust security features.
5.  **Regularly Audit Logging Configuration:** Periodically review and audit your Logback configuration and logging practices to ensure they remain secure and compliant with security policies.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Exposure of Sensitive Data in Dropwizard Logs (High Severity) - Accidental logging of sensitive information by Dropwizard application, leading to potential data breaches if logs are compromised.
*   Compliance Violations (Medium Severity) - Logging PII can violate data privacy regulations.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of Sensitive Data in Dropwizard Logs: High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data leakage through Dropwizard logs.
*   Compliance Violations: Medium risk reduction. Helps in meeting data privacy compliance requirements related to logging.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic guidelines for developers to avoid logging passwords and API keys. Logback is configured to write logs to files.
*   Implemented in: `logback.xml` (Logback configuration), developer guidelines.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Automated log scrubbing or masking within the Logback configuration or logging pipeline.
*   Centralized logging system with access controls and audit trails for Dropwizard logs.
*   Regular automated audits of Dropwizard logging configuration and practices.
