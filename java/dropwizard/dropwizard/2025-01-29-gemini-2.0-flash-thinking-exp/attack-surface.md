# Attack Surface Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposed_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Dropwizard applications rely on configuration files (typically YAML) that can contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and internal network details. If these files are accessible to unauthorized users, it can lead to significant security breaches.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard heavily utilizes YAML configuration files for application setup. Mismanagement of these files directly exposes the application's configuration attack surface.
*   **Example:** A `config.yml` file containing database credentials is accidentally committed to a public Git repository or left readable by world on the deployment server. An attacker gains access to the repository or server and retrieves the configuration file, obtaining database credentials and compromising the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to backend systems, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access permissions.
    *   **Environment Variables/Secrets Management:**  Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in configuration files. Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage sensitive credentials.
    *   **Configuration File Encryption:** Encrypt configuration files at rest and in transit if necessary.
    *   **Version Control Exclusion:** Ensure configuration files containing sensitive information are excluded from version control systems or are encrypted within the repository.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Dropwizard is built upon numerous third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly impact the security of Dropwizard applications.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard bundles and relies on libraries like Jetty, Jersey, Jackson, Logback, and others.  Vulnerabilities in these libraries become vulnerabilities in Dropwizard applications.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability is discovered in the version of Jackson used by a Dropwizard application. An attacker exploits this vulnerability by sending a crafted JSON payload to a vulnerable endpoint, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, various other attacks depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools (like Maven or Gradle) to track and manage dependencies.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Dropwizard and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools (like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Patching and Remediation:**  Promptly patch or remediate identified vulnerabilities by updating dependencies or applying security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured or Unauthenticated Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_or_unauthenticated_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposing API endpoints without proper authentication and authorization allows unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard, using Jersey, makes it easy to create RESTful APIs. Developers might inadvertently forget to implement or correctly configure authentication and authorization for all endpoints.
*   **Example:** A `/admin/users` endpoint that lists all user accounts is exposed without any authentication. An attacker can access this endpoint and retrieve sensitive user information.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, system compromise, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed endpoints)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Authentication:**  Enforce authentication for all sensitive endpoints. Use established authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0, JWT, or basic authentication.
    *   **Implement Authorization:** Implement robust authorization mechanisms to control access based on user roles and permissions. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Secure Endpoint Design:** Design APIs with security in mind. Avoid exposing sensitive operations or data through public endpoints without proper access controls.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct penetration testing and security audits to identify and address unsecured endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Jackson Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jackson_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Jackson, the JSON processing library used by Dropwizard, has had known deserialization vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious JSON payloads if default typing is enabled or vulnerable configurations are used.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard uses Jackson for JSON serialization and deserialization. If developers are not aware of Jackson's deserialization risks or use vulnerable configurations, applications can become susceptible.
*   **Example:** A Dropwizard application uses Jackson's default typing feature. An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload containing malicious code disguised as a serialized object. Jackson deserializes this payload, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, system compromise, complete server takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Default Typing:** Disable Jackson's default typing feature unless absolutely necessary and understand the risks.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Configurations:** Use safer deserialization configurations and limit the classes that Jackson is allowed to deserialize.
    *   **Jackson Updates:** Keep Jackson and Dropwizard updated to the latest versions to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation (for JSON):** Validate the structure and content of incoming JSON payloads to detect and reject potentially malicious payloads.
