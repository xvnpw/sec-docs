# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Goal: To provide a robust, efficient, and developer-friendly framework for building RESTful web services in Java.
  - Priority: Ease of development and operation, focusing on convention over configuration to accelerate development cycles.
  - Priority: Production readiness, including built-in support for metrics, logging, configuration management, and operational tools.
  - Priority: Performance and scalability for handling web service requests.
  - Priority: Stability and reliability of the framework itself and applications built with it.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the framework or its dependencies could compromise applications built with Dropwizard.
  - Risk: Operational issues due to misconfiguration or lack of understanding of Dropwizard's features.
  - Risk: Performance bottlenecks in applications if not properly designed or configured within the Dropwizard framework.
  - Risk: Compatibility issues with newer Java versions or other libraries over time if the framework is not actively maintained.
  - Risk: Adoption risk if developers find the framework too opinionated or lacking in specific features compared to alternative frameworks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Management: Dropwizard uses Maven for dependency management, allowing for control over included libraries and versions. (Implemented in pom.xml)
  - security control: Secure Defaults: Dropwizard aims to provide secure defaults for configurations, reducing the likelihood of common security misconfigurations. (Described in documentation and framework design)
  - security control: Logging: Integrated logging framework (Logback) allows for security event logging and auditing. (Implemented in Dropwizard core and application configuration)
  - security control: Metrics: Integrated metrics framework (Micrometer) can be used to monitor application behavior and detect anomalies that might indicate security issues. (Implemented in Dropwizard core and application configuration)
  - security control: HTTPS Support: Dropwizard supports configuring Jetty to use HTTPS for secure communication. (Described in documentation and Jetty configuration)
  - security control: Input Validation: Encourages input validation within application code, although not enforced by the framework itself. (Best practice, application developer responsibility)
  - security control: Authentication and Authorization: Provides building blocks and guidance for implementing authentication and authorization within applications. (Described in documentation and examples)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Libraries: Dropwizard depends on numerous third-party libraries, inheriting their vulnerabilities and requiring ongoing monitoring and updates.
  - accepted risk: Developer Security Awareness: Security of applications built with Dropwizard heavily relies on the security awareness and practices of the developers using the framework.
  - accepted risk: Configuration Security: Misconfiguration of Dropwizard applications can lead to security vulnerabilities, requiring careful configuration management.
  - accepted risk: Application-Level Security: Dropwizard provides the foundation, but application-specific security measures (like business logic security, data protection) are the responsibility of the application developers.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning: Implement automated scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities as part of the build process.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build pipeline to identify potential security flaws in the application code.
  - security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Perform DAST on deployed Dropwizard applications to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Security Code Reviews: Conduct regular security code reviews to identify and address security issues in application code.
  - security control: Security Training for Developers: Provide security training to developers using Dropwizard to promote secure coding practices.
  - security control: Penetration Testing: Perform periodic penetration testing of deployed Dropwizard applications to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support for various authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic Auth) should be easily implementable within Dropwizard applications.
    - Requirement: Framework should provide clear guidance and examples for implementing secure authentication.
    - Requirement: Consider integration with existing identity providers for centralized authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Support for role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) should be easily implementable within Dropwizard applications.
    - Requirement: Framework should provide clear guidance and examples for implementing secure authorization.
    - Requirement: Authorization decisions should be consistently enforced across the application.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Framework should encourage and facilitate input validation at all application boundaries.
    - Requirement: Provide mechanisms to easily validate request parameters, headers, and request bodies.
    - Requirement: Protect against common input validation vulnerabilities like injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Support for secure storage of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) using strong encryption algorithms.
    - Requirement: Support for secure communication using TLS/SSL.
    - Requirement: Provide libraries or integrations for common cryptographic operations (e.g., hashing, encryption, digital signatures).
    - Requirement: Guidance on proper key management practices within Dropwizard applications.

```

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits code changes to the Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
  - CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered automatically on code commits or pull requests.

    - Dependency Check: Scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzes the application source code for potential security flaws.
  - Vulnerability Feedback Loop: If vulnerabilities are found during security scans, the pipeline fails, and feedback is provided to the developer to fix the issues.
  - Container Image Build Stage: If no vulnerabilities are found, a Docker container image is built, packaging the application artifact and necessary runtime environment.
  - Container Registry Stage: The built container image is pushed to a Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) for storage and distribution.
  - Deployment Pipeline: The container image from the registry is then used by the deployment pipeline to deploy the application to target environments (e.g., Kubernetes cluster).

  - security control: Container Image Scanning: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
  - security control: Secure Container Registry: Using a secure container registry with access controls and vulnerability scanning capabilities.
  - security control: Code Signing: Signing build artifacts and container images to ensure integrity and authenticity.
  - security control: Build Artifact Integrity Checks: Verifying the integrity of build artifacts and container images during deployment.
