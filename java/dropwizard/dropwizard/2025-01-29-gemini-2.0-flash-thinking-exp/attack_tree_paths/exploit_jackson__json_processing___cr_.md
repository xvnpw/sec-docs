#### 4.1. Exploit Jackson (JSON Processing) [CR]

**Description:** This is the root node of the attack path, indicating a critical risk associated with exploiting Jackson, the JSON processing library used by Dropwizard. Jackson's role in handling JSON serialization and deserialization for REST APIs and other data exchange makes it a crucial component from a security perspective. Any vulnerability in Jackson can have significant consequences for the application.

**Risk Level:** Critical [CR] -  Compromising JSON processing can lead to severe security breaches, including data breaches, service disruption, and complete system compromise.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data manipulation, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Mitigation:**  Prioritize secure configuration of Jackson, keep Jackson libraries up-to-date, and implement robust input validation and sanitization.

#### 4.2. Jackson Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High Risk) [HR]

**Description:** This node highlights the inherent high risk associated with deserialization vulnerabilities in Jackson. Deserialization, the process of converting JSON data back into objects, is a complex operation that, if not handled securely, can be exploited by attackers to manipulate application behavior.

**Risk Level:** High Risk [HR] - Deserialization vulnerabilities are often categorized as high risk due to their potential for severe impact, including RCE.

**Impact:**  Deserialization vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, bypass security controls, and gain unauthorized access.

**Mitigation:**  Avoid unsafe deserialization configurations, implement strict type validation during deserialization, and regularly update Jackson libraries.

#### 4.3. Unsafe Deserialization Configuration [CR]

**Description:** This node focuses on the critical risk introduced by insecure Jackson configurations.  Specifically, configurations that enable polymorphic deserialization without proper type validation are highly vulnerable.

**Risk Level:** Critical Risk [CR] -  Unsafe deserialization configurations directly expose the application to severe vulnerabilities, making exploitation significantly easier.

**Impact:**  Enabling unsafe deserialization configurations can directly lead to RCE vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to take complete control of the server.

**Mitigation:**  Avoid using `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()` or similar methods that enable polymorphic deserialization without strict type validation. If polymorphic deserialization is necessary, implement robust type validation and whitelisting.

#### 4.3.1. Polymorphic Deserialization without Type Validation [HR]

**Description:** Polymorphic deserialization allows Jackson to deserialize JSON into objects of different classes based on type information embedded in the JSON.  However, if type validation is not strictly enforced, attackers can manipulate this type information to instantiate arbitrary classes, including malicious ones.

**Risk Level:** High Risk [HR] -  Polymorphic deserialization without validation is a well-known attack vector and significantly increases the attack surface.

**Impact:**  Attackers can leverage polymorphic deserialization to instantiate and manipulate objects in the application's classpath, potentially leading to RCE.

**Mitigation:**
* **Avoid `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`:**  This method is a common source of unsafe polymorphic deserialization.
* **Use Type Information Carefully:** If polymorphic deserialization is required, use `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` annotations with explicit whitelisting of allowed classes.
* **Implement Strict Type Validation:**  Validate the expected types during deserialization and reject any unexpected or malicious types.

#### 4.3.1.1. Enabling polymorphic deserialization without strict type validation (e.g., `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`) allows attackers to craft malicious JSON payloads that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code on the server (RCE). Gadget Chains Exploitation (e.g., via `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`) [HR]

**Description:** This node details the specific mechanism of exploitation: by enabling `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()` (or similar unsafe configurations), attackers can inject malicious JSON payloads containing type information that instructs Jackson to deserialize into classes that are part of "gadget chains."

**Gadget Chains:** Gadget chains are sequences of method calls within the application's classpath that, when chained together, can achieve a desired malicious outcome, such as RCE.  Attackers leverage known gadget chains present in common libraries (e.g., libraries often found in Java applications) to execute arbitrary code.

**Example of `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()` vulnerability:**

Consider the following vulnerable code snippet:

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL); // Vulnerable configuration

String jsonPayload = "[\"java.net.URL\", {\"val\" : \"http://malicious-server.com\"}]"; // Example malicious payload

try {
    Object obj = mapper.readValue(jsonPayload, Object.class); // Deserialization of malicious payload
    // ... further processing of obj ... (vulnerability triggered during deserialization itself in many gadget chains)
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping(ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL)` enables polymorphic deserialization for non-final classes. The malicious JSON payload `["java.net.URL", {"val" : "http://malicious-server.com"}]` instructs Jackson to deserialize into a `java.net.URL` object.  Depending on the classpath and available gadget chains, this can be exploited to achieve RCE.  Common gadget chains often involve classes like `java.net.URL`, `org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `org.apache.commons.collections.functors.InvokerTransformer`, etc.

**Risk Level:** High Risk [HR] -  Gadget chain exploitation through unsafe deserialization is a highly effective and dangerous attack vector.

**Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) - Attackers can gain complete control of the server, execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, and disrupt services.

**Mitigation:**
* **Completely Disable `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`:**  This is the most effective mitigation if polymorphic deserialization is not strictly required.
* **If Polymorphic Deserialization is Necessary:**
    * **Use `ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.NON_FINAL` with EXTREME CAUTION:**  If you must use `NON_FINAL`, implement very strict whitelisting of allowed classes and thorough input validation. This is generally discouraged due to the complexity and risk of bypasses.
    * **Prefer `ObjectMapper.DefaultTyping.OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE` with Whitelisting:**  This option is slightly safer but still requires careful whitelisting of allowed base classes and concrete implementations.
    * **Use Custom Deserializers:**  Implement custom deserializers to have fine-grained control over the deserialization process and enforce strict type validation.
    * **Consider Alternatives to Polymorphic Deserialization:**  Re-evaluate the need for polymorphic deserialization and explore alternative approaches, such as using different endpoints for different object types or using a more explicit type identification mechanism.
* **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep Jackson and all other libraries in your Dropwizard application up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities in gadget chains and Jackson itself.
* **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization:**  While not a direct mitigation for deserialization vulnerabilities, robust input validation can help detect and block malicious payloads before they reach the deserialization process.

#### 4.4. Exploiting Known Jackson CVEs [HR]

**Description:** Outdated versions of Jackson may contain known deserialization vulnerabilities (CVEs) that attackers can exploit.  These CVEs often arise from bugs in Jackson's deserialization logic or vulnerabilities in gadget chains that Jackson can trigger.

**Risk Level:** High Risk [HR] -  Exploiting known CVEs is a common and effective attack method, especially against applications that are not regularly patched.

**Impact:**  Depending on the specific CVE, exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or other security breaches.

**Mitigation:**
* **Keep Jackson Libraries Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update Jackson libraries to the latest stable versions to patch known CVEs. Dropwizard typically manages Jackson dependencies, so ensure you are using a recent and supported Dropwizard version.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify outdated libraries and known CVEs in your dependencies.
* **Dependency Management:**  Use a robust dependency management system (like Maven or Gradle) to easily manage and update dependencies.
* **Security Monitoring:**  Monitor security advisories and CVE databases for newly discovered vulnerabilities in Jackson and related libraries.
