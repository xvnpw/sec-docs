### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Jetty (Embedded Web Server) [CR]

#### 4.1. Introduction to Jetty in Dropwizard

Dropwizard applications embed Jetty as their web server. This means Jetty is responsible for:

* **Handling HTTP requests:** Receiving and processing incoming HTTP requests from clients.
* **Serving application content:** Delivering web pages, APIs, and other resources to clients.
* **Managing network connections:** Establishing and maintaining network connections with clients.
* **Implementing web server functionalities:** Providing features like TLS/SSL, HTTP/2 support, request routing, and more.

Because Jetty is the entry point for external interactions with the Dropwizard application, any vulnerability or misconfiguration in Jetty can directly expose the application to significant security risks.

#### 4.2. Potential Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations in Jetty

Exploiting Jetty can stem from various sources, including:

* **Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):**
    * **Outdated Jetty Version:** Using an outdated version of Jetty is a primary risk. Older versions are likely to have known and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that attackers can readily exploit. Examples include vulnerabilities related to HTTP/2, request smuggling, or denial-of-service attacks.
    * **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Jetty relies on various libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Jetty's security.
* **Misconfigurations:**
    * **Default Configurations:**  Using default Jetty configurations without proper hardening can leave the server vulnerable. This might include default ports, weak TLS/SSL configurations, or overly permissive access controls.
    * **Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration:** Weak cipher suites, outdated TLS protocols, or improper certificate management can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of communication.
    * **Exposed Management Interfaces:**  If Jetty's management interfaces (e.g., JMX, web administration consoles) are exposed without proper authentication and authorization, they can be exploited for unauthorized access and control.
    * **Insufficient Input Validation:** While Dropwizard handles application-level input validation, vulnerabilities in Jetty's request parsing or handling could bypass these checks and lead to exploits.
    * **Directory Traversal/Path Traversal:** Misconfigurations in resource handling or static content serving could potentially allow attackers to access files outside the intended web root.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) Configurations:**  Improperly configured request limits, connection timeouts, or resource management settings can make Jetty susceptible to DoS attacks.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors

Attackers can exploit Jetty vulnerabilities and misconfigurations through various attack vectors:

* **Network-Based Attacks:**
    * **Direct Exploitation of Network Services:** Targeting exposed Jetty ports (typically 8080 or 8443) with exploits for known vulnerabilities. This could involve sending crafted HTTP requests to trigger vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, request smuggling, or remote code execution.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Flooding Jetty with requests to exhaust resources and make the application unavailable.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** If TLS/SSL is misconfigured or weak, attackers could intercept and decrypt communication between clients and the server.
* **Application-Level Attacks (Indirectly Targeting Jetty):**
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard Application Code:** While not directly targeting Jetty, vulnerabilities in the Dropwizard application code itself (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) could be used to indirectly compromise the server or gain access to sensitive data served by Jetty.
    * **Dependency Confusion Attacks:** If Dropwizard or Jetty dependencies are not managed securely, attackers could potentially introduce malicious dependencies that are loaded by Jetty.
* **Configuration Exploitation:**
    * **Accessing Exposed Management Interfaces:** If Jetty's management interfaces are accessible without proper authentication, attackers can use them to reconfigure the server, deploy malicious applications, or gain administrative access.
    * **Exploiting Default Credentials:**  If default credentials for management interfaces are not changed, attackers can easily gain unauthorized access.

#### 4.4. Impact of Exploiting Jetty

A successful exploit of Jetty can have severe consequences, including:

* **Confidentiality Breach:**
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data served by the Dropwizard application, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, and business secrets.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities could allow attackers to hijack user sessions and impersonate legitimate users.
* **Integrity Compromise:**
    * **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify data stored or processed by the application, leading to data corruption or manipulation of business logic.
    * **Application Defacement:** Attackers could alter the application's web pages or content, causing reputational damage.
    * **Malware Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious code into the application or server, potentially infecting users or other systems.
* **Availability Disruption:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could render the application unavailable to legitimate users, causing business disruption and financial losses.
    * **System Crash:**  Exploiting certain vulnerabilities could lead to Jetty crashing or becoming unstable, requiring manual intervention to restore service.
* **Complete System Compromise:**
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In the most severe cases, exploiting Jetty vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining complete control over the system. This could lead to data breaches, malware installation, and further attacks on internal networks.

**Justification for "Critical Risk" (CR) Rating:**

The "Exploit Jetty" attack path is rated as "Critical Risk" because:

* **Direct Exposure:** Jetty is the primary entry point for external interactions with the Dropwizard application. Compromising Jetty directly compromises the application's core web serving capabilities.
* **High Impact Potential:** As outlined above, successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences across all aspects of the CIA triad, including data breaches, service disruption, and complete system compromise.
* **Likelihood of Exploitation:** Known vulnerabilities in Jetty are actively targeted by attackers. Misconfigurations are also common, making exploitation relatively likely if proper security measures are not in place.
* **Foundation of Application:** Jetty is fundamental to the operation of the Dropwizard application. Its compromise undermines the security of the entire application stack.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

To mitigate the risks associated with exploiting Jetty, the following strategies and recommendations should be implemented:

* **Keep Jetty Up-to-Date:**
    * **Regularly Update Dropwizard and Dependencies:**  Ensure that Dropwizard and all its dependencies, including Jetty, are updated to the latest stable versions. This is crucial for patching known vulnerabilities.
    * **Automated Dependency Management:** Implement automated dependency management tools and processes to track and update dependencies regularly.
* **Harden Jetty Configuration:**
    * **Review and Harden Default Configurations:**  Avoid using default Jetty configurations. Review and harden all configuration settings based on security best practices and organizational security policies.
    * **Secure TLS/SSL Configuration:**
        * **Use Strong Cipher Suites:** Configure Jetty to use strong and modern cipher suites.
        * **Enforce Strong TLS Protocols:**  Disable outdated TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) and enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.
        * **Proper Certificate Management:**  Ensure proper generation, installation, and renewal of TLS/SSL certificates.
        * **Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):**  Enforce HTTPS connections to prevent downgrade attacks.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Features and Modules:**  Disable any Jetty features or modules that are not required for the application's functionality to reduce the attack surface.
    * **Restrict Access to Management Interfaces:**  If management interfaces are necessary, restrict access to them based on IP address whitelisting and strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication). Avoid exposing them to the public internet.
    * **Implement Rate Limiting and Request Limits:**  Configure Jetty to limit request rates and enforce connection limits to mitigate DoS attacks.
    * **Configure Error Handling:**  Customize error pages to avoid revealing sensitive information in error responses.
* **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**
    * **Implement Robust Input Validation in Dropwizard Application:** While Jetty handles basic request parsing, ensure that the Dropwizard application itself performs thorough input validation to prevent application-level vulnerabilities that could indirectly affect Jetty.
    * **Use Output Encoding:**  Properly encode output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* **Security Headers:**
    * **Implement Security Headers:** Configure Jetty to send security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Referrer-Policy` to enhance client-side security.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct Regular Security Audits:**  Perform periodic security audits of Jetty configurations and the Dropwizard application to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
    * **Perform Penetration Testing:**  Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities in Jetty and the application.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**
    * **Implement Security Monitoring:**  Monitor Jetty logs and application logs for suspicious activity and potential attacks.
    * **Centralized Logging:**  Centralize logs for analysis and security incident response.
    * **Alerting:**  Set up alerts for critical security events and anomalies.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Consider Deploying a WAF:**  In front of the Dropwizard application to provide an additional layer of security by filtering malicious traffic and protecting against common web attacks targeting Jetty.
