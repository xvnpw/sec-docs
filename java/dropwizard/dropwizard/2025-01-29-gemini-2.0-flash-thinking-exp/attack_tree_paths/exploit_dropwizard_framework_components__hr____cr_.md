* **Understand the attack vectors** that could be used to exploit these weaknesses.
* **Assess the potential impact** of successful exploitation on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the application and its data, considering the High Risk [HR] and Critical Risk [CR] designations.
* **Develop actionable mitigation strategies and security best practices** to reduce the likelihood and impact of attacks targeting these components.
* **Provide recommendations** to the development team for strengthening the security posture of the Dropwizard application against this specific attack path.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is scoped to focus on the following core components of the Dropwizard framework, as mentioned in the attack path description:

* **Jetty:** The embedded servlet container.
* **Jersey:** The JAX-RS (RESTful Web Services) implementation.
* **Jackson:** The JSON processing library.
* **Metrics:** The metrics collection and reporting library.
* **Logging (Logback):** The logging framework.
