## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dropwizard Application [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dropwizard_application__cr_.md)

This is the ultimate attacker goal. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or disruption of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dropwizard Framework Components [HR], [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dropwizard_framework_components__hr____cr_.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the core components bundled with Dropwizard, such as Jetty, Jersey, Jackson, Metrics, Logging, Configuration, and Validation. Compromising these components can have widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jetty (Embedded Web Server) [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jetty__embedded_web_server___cr_.md)

Jetty is the foundation of the Dropwizard application. Exploiting Jetty vulnerabilities or misconfigurations directly compromises the application's web serving capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Jetty Vulnerabilities [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_jetty_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

Outdated Jetty Version (CVEs) [CR]: Using an outdated Dropwizard version may bundle a vulnerable Jetty version. Attackers can exploit publicly known CVEs in Jetty for Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other critical impacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Jetty Misconfiguration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/jetty_misconfiguration__hr_.md)

Insecure TLS Configuration [HR]: Weak Ciphers, Outdated Protocols [CR]:  Using weak ciphers or outdated TLS protocols in Jetty's TLS configuration allows for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, data interception, and downgrade attacks. Exposed Admin Port [HR]: Default Admin Port (8081) Accessible [CR]:  The Dropwizard admin port (default 8081) provides access to metrics, health checks, and potentially more. If exposed publicly without authentication, it allows attackers to gather sensitive information and potentially control application aspects.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jersey (JAX-RS Implementation):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jersey__jax-rs_implementation_.md)

Misconfiguration of Jersey Features: Lack of Input Validation in JAX-RS Resources [HR]:  Despite Dropwizard encouraging validation, developers might fail to implement proper input validation in JAX-RS resource methods. This can lead to injection vulnerabilities (SQL, Command, etc.), data corruption, and Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jackson (JSON Processing) [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jackson__json_processing___cr_.md)

Jackson handles JSON serialization and deserialization, critical for REST APIs. Jackson deserialization vulnerabilities are a high-risk category. Jackson Deserialization Vulnerabilities (High Risk) [HR]: Unsafe Deserialization Configuration [CR]: Polymorphic Deserialization without Type Validation [HR]: Enabling polymorphic deserialization without strict type validation (e.g., using `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`) allows attackers to craft malicious JSON payloads that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code on the server (RCE). Gadget Chains Exploitation (e.g., via `ObjectMapper.enableDefaultTyping()`) [HR]: Attackers can leverage known "gadget chains" (sequences of classes in the classpath) to achieve RCE through unsafe deserialization configurations. Exploiting Known Jackson CVEs [HR]:  Outdated Jackson versions may contain known deserialization vulnerabilities (CVEs) that attackers can exploit for RCE or DoS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Metrics (Dropwizard Metrics):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_metrics__dropwizard_metrics_.md)

Exposure of Sensitive Metrics Data [HR]: Unsecured Metrics Endpoint [CR]: Metrics Endpoint Accessible Without Authentication [HR]: If the metrics endpoint (often `/metrics`) is accessible without authentication, it can expose internal application details, performance characteristics, and potentially sensitive data embedded in custom metrics, aiding reconnaissance and potentially leaking sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logging (Logback):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logging__logback_.md)

Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs [HR]: Logging Sensitive Data (PII, Secrets) [CR]:  Accidentally logging sensitive data (Personally Identifiable Information - PII, secrets, API keys, passwords) into application logs can lead to data breaches if logs are compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Management (YAML, Jackson) [CR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_management__yaml__jackson___cr_.md)

Configuration files manage application settings. Insecure handling of configuration, especially secrets, is a critical risk. Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data [HR]: Unencrypted Secrets in Configuration Files [CR]: Configuration Files Publicly Accessible (e.g., misconfigured deployments) [HR]: Misconfigured deployments might expose configuration files (e.g., `.yml` files) publicly, allowing attackers to access sensitive information, including unencrypted secrets. Unencrypted Secrets in Configuration Files [HR]: Storing secrets (passwords, API keys, database credentials) in plain text within configuration files is a major vulnerability. If configuration files are accessed (even internally), secrets are immediately compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Validation (Hibernate Validator):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_validation__hibernate_validator_.md)

Bypass Input Validation [HR]: Incomplete or Incorrect Validation Rules [HR]:  If validation rules implemented using Hibernate Validator are insufficient, flawed, or don't cover all necessary input scenarios, attackers can craft input that bypasses validation and leads to vulnerabilities like injection or data corruption. Client-Side Validation Only (No Server-Side Enforcement) [HR]: Relying solely on client-side validation (e.g., JavaScript validation in the browser) is fundamentally insecure. Attackers can easily bypass client-side validation by disabling JavaScript or manipulating HTTP requests directly, leading to validation bypass and potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dropwizard Dependencies (Beyond Bundled Components) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dropwizard_dependencies__beyond_bundled_components___hr_.md)

Dropwizard applications rely on third-party libraries beyond the core bundled components. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a significant risk. Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries [HR]: Outdated Dependencies with Known CVEs [CR]: Transitive Dependencies Vulnerabilities [HR]: Using outdated third-party libraries, including transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies), with known CVEs exposes the application to those vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities for RCE, DoS, data breaches, or other impacts depending on the specific vulnerability. Transitive dependencies are often overlooked in dependency management, increasing the risk.
