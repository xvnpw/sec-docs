# Threat Model Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

### Description:
Dropwizard relies on numerous dependencies (Jetty, Jersey, Jackson, etc.). Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities within these dependencies if Dropwizard applications are not kept up-to-date. This can be achieved by sending crafted requests targeting vulnerable components or exploiting vulnerabilities in data processing by these libraries. Exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to fully compromise the application and server.

### Impact:
Remote Code Execution (RCE), full server compromise, data breaches, Denial of Service (DoS).

### Affected Dropwizard Component:
Dependency Management, underlying libraries (Jetty, Jersey, Jackson, etc.).

### Risk Severity:
Critical

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Proactive Dependency Updates:** Regularly update Dropwizard and *all* its dependencies to the latest stable versions. Utilize dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle) to simplify this process.
*   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Tools can identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies before deployment.
*   **Security Monitoring and Patching:** Subscribe to security advisories for Dropwizard and its dependencies. Establish a process for promptly applying security patches when vulnerabilities are announced.
*   **Dependency Tree Analysis:** Regularly analyze the dependency tree to understand both direct and transitive dependencies and their potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Unprotected Admin Interface Access](./threats/unprotected_admin_interface_access.md)

### Description:
The Dropwizard Admin interface, a powerful tool for monitoring and managing the application, can be enabled in production environments. If left unprotected (without authentication and authorization), attackers can gain unauthorized access. This allows them to view sensitive metrics, health checks, thread dumps, and potentially interact with custom admin endpoints, leading to system compromise or denial of service.

### Impact:
Unauthorized access to administrative functions, information disclosure, potential for Denial of Service (DoS) through admin endpoints, and in severe cases, system compromise if custom admin endpoints are vulnerable.

### Affected Dropwizard Component:
Admin Interface Module.

### Risk Severity:
High

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Disable in Production (Recommended):**  **Strongly consider disabling the Admin interface entirely in production environments** if it's not absolutely necessary for operational monitoring.
*   **Strong Authentication and Authorization (If Enabled):** If the Admin interface *must* be enabled in production:
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0) for the Admin interface.
    *   Configure robust authorization to restrict access to admin functionalities based on roles and permissions.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the Admin interface to specific trusted IP addresses or internal networks using firewall rules. Do not expose it to the public internet.
*   **Regular Auditing:**  Regularly audit access logs for the Admin interface to detect and investigate any suspicious or unauthorized activity.

## Threat: [Insecure Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

### Description:
Developers may inadvertently or carelessly log sensitive data (passwords, API keys, Personally Identifiable Information - PII) in plain text using Dropwizard's logging framework (Logback). If attackers gain access to log files (through misconfiguration, vulnerabilities in log management systems, or compromised servers), this sensitive information is exposed, leading to data breaches and compliance violations.

### Impact:
Information disclosure, data breaches, compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), reputational damage.

### Affected Dropwizard Component:
Logging Configuration (Logback integration).

### Risk Severity:
High

### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Strictly avoid logging sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII, secrets) in application logs.
*   **Data Redaction/Masking:** If sensitive data *must* be logged for debugging purposes, implement robust redaction or masking techniques to remove or obscure the sensitive parts before logging.
*   **Secure Log Storage and Access Control:** Store log files in secure locations with appropriate access controls. Restrict access to logs to only authorized personnel.
*   **Log Rotation and Retention:** Implement proper log rotation and retention policies to minimize the window of exposure and comply with data retention regulations.
*   **Consider Log Encryption:** For highly sensitive environments, consider encrypting log files at rest to protect them from unauthorized access even if storage is compromised.
