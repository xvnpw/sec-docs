# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Admin Interface Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_admin_interface_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Admin Interface Security Hardening
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication and Authorization:** Configure authentication (e.g., basic authentication, form-based authentication) and authorization for the Dropwizard admin interface. This is configured within your Dropwizard application's `config.yml` file under the `admin` section, specifying realms, authenticators, and authorizers. Use strong passwords or consider certificate-based authentication.
    2.  **Restrict Network Access:** Use firewall rules or network segmentation to restrict access to the Dropwizard admin interface's port (typically configured separately from the application port in `config.yml`). Limit access to specific IP addresses or networks (e.g., internal management network). Avoid exposing it to the public internet.
    3.  **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure that all communication with the Dropwizard admin interface is over HTTPS. Configure Jetty within Dropwizard to enforce HTTPS for the admin port. This is configured in the `admin` section of `config.yml` by specifying TLS/SSL settings.
    4.  **Regularly Review Endpoints:** Periodically review the endpoints exposed by the Dropwizard admin interface (defined by Dropwizard and potentially custom health checks or metrics). Assess their security implications and ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed.
    5.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any Dropwizard admin interface features or endpoints that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface. This might involve customizing health checks or metrics reporters to remove sensitive details.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface (High Severity):**  If the Dropwizard admin interface is not properly secured, attackers could gain unauthorized access to manage the application, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Admin Endpoints (Medium Severity):**  Unsecured Dropwizard admin endpoints might expose sensitive system information or application details that could be used for further attacks.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** If HTTPS is not enforced for the Dropwizard admin interface, communication could be intercepted and manipulated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Admin Interface:** High risk reduction. Authentication, authorization, and network restrictions significantly limit unauthorized access to the Dropwizard admin interface.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Admin Endpoints:** Medium risk reduction. Regular review and endpoint security minimize information leakage through the Dropwizard admin interface.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Medium risk reduction. HTTPS encryption protects communication confidentiality and integrity for the Dropwizard admin interface.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Status:** Partially implemented.
    *   **Location:** Basic authentication is enabled for the Dropwizard admin interface via `config.yml`. HTTPS is configured for the main application port but not explicitly enforced for the admin port in `config.yml`. Network access is somewhat restricted by firewall rules, but could be more granular.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for the Dropwizard admin interface port by configuring TLS in the `admin` section of `config.yml`.
    *   Implement more granular network access control specifically for the Dropwizard admin interface port, ideally restricting it to a dedicated management network.
    *   Conduct a thorough review of Dropwizard admin interface endpoints and disable any unnecessary features or custom endpoints that might expose sensitive data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Metrics and Health Check Endpoints](./mitigation_strategies/secure_metrics_and_health_check_endpoints.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Metrics and Health Check Endpoint Security
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Sensitivity of Information:** Evaluate the information exposed by Dropwizard's default metrics and health check endpoints, as well as any custom ones you've added. Determine if they reveal sensitive internal system details or application logic.
    2.  **Authentication and Authorization (If Necessary):** If Dropwizard's metrics or health check endpoints expose sensitive information, consider adding authentication and authorization. While Dropwizard doesn't directly offer built-in authentication for these specific endpoints *out-of-the-box*, you can achieve this by:
        *   **Custom Jersey Filters:** Implement custom Jersey filters to intercept requests to `/metrics` and `/healthcheck` paths and enforce authentication and authorization.
        *   **Reverse Proxy Authentication:** Place a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) in front of your Dropwizard application and configure authentication and authorization at the proxy level for these paths.
    3.  **Restrict Network Access (If Necessary):** If authentication is not feasible or sufficient, restrict network access to Dropwizard's metrics and health check endpoints to internal monitoring networks or specific IP ranges using firewall rules. This is done at the network level, outside of Dropwizard configuration itself.
    4.  **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Data:**  Refrain from including highly sensitive or confidential data in custom Dropwizard health checks or metrics reporters. Review the default metrics exposed by Dropwizard and consider disabling or customizing reporters to remove sensitive details if necessary.
    5.  **Rate Limiting (If Publicly Accessible):** If Dropwizard's metrics endpoints are publicly accessible for monitoring services, implement rate limiting. This would typically be done at a reverse proxy level in front of Dropwizard, as Dropwizard itself doesn't have built-in rate limiting for these endpoints.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Metrics/Health Checks (Medium Severity):**  Exposing sensitive internal details through Dropwizard's metrics and health check endpoints can aid attackers in reconnaissance and planning further attacks.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Metrics Endpoints (Medium Severity):** Publicly accessible Dropwizard metrics endpoints can be targeted with DoS attacks, potentially impacting monitoring capabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via Metrics/Health Checks:** Medium risk reduction. Authentication, authorization, and data minimization reduce the risk of sensitive information leakage through Dropwizard's endpoints.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Metrics Endpoints:** Medium risk reduction. Rate limiting (if implemented via proxy) mitigates the impact of DoS attempts against Dropwizard's metrics endpoints.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.
    *   **Location:** Dropwizard's metrics and health check endpoints are currently publicly accessible without authentication or network restrictions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Assess the sensitivity of information exposed by Dropwizard's metrics and health check endpoints.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization for these endpoints if deemed necessary, potentially using custom Jersey filters or a reverse proxy.
    *   Restrict network access to these endpoints to internal monitoring systems using firewall rules.
    *   Consider implementing rate limiting for publicly accessible metrics endpoints using a reverse proxy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS Configuration for Jetty (Dropwizard Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/https_configuration_for_jetty__dropwizard_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS for Jetty within Dropwizard
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure TLS/SSL in `config.yml`:** Configure Jetty to use TLS/SSL for secure communication directly within your Dropwizard application's `config.yml` file.  Specify the path to your TLS/SSL certificate and private key in the `server` section of the configuration.
    2.  **Enforce HTTPS Redirection (Optional but Recommended):** While Dropwizard doesn't have built-in HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection, you can implement this using a Jersey filter or a reverse proxy in front of Dropwizard. This ensures all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
    3.  **HSTS Configuration (Optional but Recommended):** Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) in Jetty. You can configure HSTS headers within your Dropwizard application, typically using a Jersey filter or by customizing Jetty's response headers.
    4.  **Strong TLS/SSL Configuration in `config.yml`:**  Within the `config.yml` file, configure Jetty to use strong TLS/SSL configurations. While direct cipher suite configuration might be limited in basic Dropwizard configuration, ensure you are using up-to-date TLS versions (TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3) which are generally supported by modern Jetty versions used in Dropwizard.
    5.  **Regularly Review TLS/SSL Settings:** Periodically review and update TLS/SSL configurations, especially when updating Dropwizard or Jetty versions, to ensure you are benefiting from the latest security best practices.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Without HTTPS configured in Dropwizard/Jetty, communication is in plain text and vulnerable to interception and manipulation.
    *   **Data Confidentiality Breach (High Severity):**  Plain text communication exposes sensitive data transmitted between clients and the Dropwizard server.
    *   **Session Hijacking (Medium Severity):**  Unencrypted sessions are more susceptible to hijacking when HTTPS is not configured in Dropwizard.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** High risk reduction. HTTPS encryption and HSTS (if implemented) effectively mitigate MITM attacks against the Dropwizard application.
    *   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** High risk reduction. HTTPS ensures data confidentiality during transmission to and from the Dropwizard application.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Medium risk reduction. HTTPS strengthens session security for the Dropwizard application.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Status:** Partially implemented.
    *   **Location:** HTTPS is configured for the application port in `config.yml` with TLS certificates specified.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement HTTPS redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, potentially using a Jersey filter or reverse proxy.
    *   Enable and configure HSTS headers, potentially using a Jersey filter or reverse proxy.
    *   Explicitly review and configure TLS/SSL settings within the `config.yml` as much as Dropwizard configuration allows, ensuring strong TLS versions are in use.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS/SSL settings when updating Dropwizard versions.
