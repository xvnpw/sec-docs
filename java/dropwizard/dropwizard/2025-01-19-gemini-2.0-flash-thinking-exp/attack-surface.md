# Attack Surface Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Bundled and Transitive Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_bundled_and_transitive_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Dropwizard bundles numerous libraries (Jetty, Jersey, Jackson, Metrics, etc.) and relies on transitive dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these components can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard's dependency management directly includes these libraries. Using outdated or vulnerable versions within Dropwizard exposes the application.
    *   **Example:** A known remote code execution vulnerability exists in the specific version of Jackson bundled with Dropwizard.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency management tools (like Maven or Gradle) to keep Dropwizard and its dependencies updated.
        *   Regularly review dependency vulnerability reports and apply patches by updating Dropwizard and its dependencies.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable dependencies within the Dropwizard ecosystem.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Dropwizard might have default configurations for its components that are not secure out-of-the-box, requiring manual hardening.
    *   **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard provides default settings for components like Jetty, metrics endpoints, and the admin interface. Weak defaults directly create potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** The admin interface is accessible without strong authentication by default in a specific Dropwizard version, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or administrative functions, potential for system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and harden all default configurations provided by Dropwizard.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the admin interface as a mandatory step.
        *   Configure secure TLS settings for the embedded Jetty server, overriding insecure defaults.
        *   Disable or restrict access to unnecessary default endpoints or features provided by Dropwizard.

## Attack Surface: [Weaknesses in Admin Interface Security](./attack_surfaces/weaknesses_in_admin_interface_security.md)

*   **Description:** Dropwizard provides an admin interface for managing the application. If this interface lacks proper security measures, it can be a significant attack vector.
    *   **How Dropwizard Contributes:** Dropwizard provides the framework and default setup for the admin interface and its endpoints. The inherent security of this interface is directly tied to Dropwizard's design and default configurations.
    *   **Example:** The admin interface allows restarting the application with only basic authentication enabled by default in an older Dropwizard version, leading to a potential denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, potential for system compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication (e.g., username/password with strong password policies, multi-factor authentication) for the admin interface. This is a critical step beyond Dropwizard's defaults.
        *   Implement robust authorization to control access to different admin functionalities provided by Dropwizard.
        *   Ensure all admin interface endpoints provided by Dropwizard are protected against CSRF attacks.
        *   Restrict access to the admin interface to specific IP addresses or networks as a configuration within Dropwizard or the underlying infrastructure.
