## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities (AND)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities__and_.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks targeting the application's configuration. Success in exploiting configuration vulnerabilities often leads to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Access Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__access_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

Attackers aim to read configuration files or intercept configuration data in transit to obtain sensitive information like credentials, API keys, and internal network details.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Read Unsecured Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__read_unsecured_configuration_files.md)

Attackers directly access configuration files that are stored in default locations or have overly permissive file permissions. This is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Modify Configuration to Gain Control](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__modify_configuration_to_gain_control.md)

Attackers attempt to alter the application's configuration to gain unauthorized control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Configuration Values](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_configuration_values.md)

Attackers inject malicious values into configuration files, exploiting parsing vulnerabilities or overriding secure settings. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or disabling security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Management Interface Vulnerabilities (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_management_interface_vulnerabilities__or_.md)

This category focuses on exploiting weaknesses in the Dropwizard admin interface, which provides powerful management capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Access Unsecured Admin Interface](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__access_unsecured_admin_interface.md)

Attackers attempt to gain access to the admin interface without proper authentication or authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_default_credentials.md)

Attackers use default usernames and passwords that were not changed after deployment to access the admin interface. This is a highly prevalent and easily exploitable vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Missing Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_missing_authenticationauthorization.md)

Attackers access the admin interface or its endpoints because authentication or authorization mechanisms are either missing or improperly implemented.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Abuse Management Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__abuse_management_endpoints.md)

Once authenticated (or if authentication is bypassed), attackers leverage exposed management endpoints to trigger dangerous actions, modify application state, or deploy malicious artifacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (OR)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__or_.md)

This involves exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Dropwizard relies on.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_dropwizard_dependencies.md)

Attackers identify and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the application's dependencies. This is a significant risk due to the complexity of dependency management and the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if used)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_insecure_deserialization__if_used_.md)

If the application uses deserialization of untrusted data, attackers can inject malicious payloads that, upon deserialization, lead to remote code execution. This is a highly critical vulnerability, although its likelihood depends on the application's specific implementation.
