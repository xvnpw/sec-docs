# Threat Model Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Threat: [Exposed Admin Interface with Default Credentials](./threats/exposed_admin_interface_with_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use default credentials (e.g., admin/password) to log into the Dropwizard admin interface if it's enabled and the default credentials haven't been changed. This allows them to access sensitive information and potentially manipulate the application.

**Impact:** Full control over the application, including viewing metrics, threads, health checks, and potentially reconfiguring the application or shutting it down.

**Affected Component:** Dropwizard Admin Interface

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Disable the admin interface in production environments if not required.
*   Change the default credentials for the admin interface to strong, unique passwords immediately upon deployment.
*   Implement network access controls (e.g., firewall rules) to restrict access to the admin interface to authorized networks or IP addresses.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Admin Interface](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** If the Dropwizard admin interface is enabled without any authentication mechanism, any user with network access can access it.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application information and administrative functions, potentially leading to application compromise.

**Affected Component:** Dropwizard Admin Interface

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enable authentication for the admin interface. Dropwizard supports basic authentication out of the box.
*   Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 if required.
*   Implement network access controls to restrict access to the admin interface.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Included Jersey Version](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_included_jersey_version.md)

**Description:** Dropwizard uses Jersey for implementing JAX-RS. Vulnerabilities in the specific Jersey version included in Dropwizard could be exploited.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Dropwizard Jersey Integration

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep Dropwizard updated to benefit from patched Jersey versions.
*   Monitor security advisories for Jersey vulnerabilities and upgrade Dropwizard if necessary.

## Threat: [Logging of Sensitive Information](./threats/logging_of_sensitive_information.md)

**Description:** If developers inadvertently log sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) using Logback, this information could be exposed if the logs are compromised.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive data leading to potential misuse or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Dropwizard Logging (Logback)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement secure logging practices and avoid logging sensitive information.
*   Review log configurations and ensure sensitive data is masked or excluded.
*   Secure access to log files and log management systems.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in User-Provided Input (if applicable)](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_user-provided_input__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If the application accepts serialized objects as input (e.g., via Jersey), and doesn't properly sanitize or validate them, it could be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. This is directly relevant to how Dropwizard handles requests if using object serialization.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Potentially Dropwizard Jersey Integration if handling serialized input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid accepting serialized objects from untrusted sources if possible.
*   If necessary, use secure deserialization mechanisms or alternative data formats like JSON.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Use of Outdated or Vulnerable Bundles](./threats/use_of_outdated_or_vulnerable_bundles.md)

**Description:** If the application uses third-party Dropwizard bundles that contain known vulnerabilities or are outdated, the application could be at risk.

**Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability within the bundle, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Dropwizard Bundles

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly review and update the dependencies of your Dropwizard application, including bundles.
*   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in the bundles you are using.
*   Only use trusted and well-maintained bundles.
