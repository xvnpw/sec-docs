    * **Data breaches:** Access to sensitive application data or user information.
    * **Unauthorized access to external services:**  Using compromised API keys.
    * **Privilege escalation:**  If database credentials with elevated privileges are exposed.
* **Example Scenarios:**
    * A developer commits the `config.yml` file containing database credentials to a public Git repository.
    * An attacker exploits a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability to read the `config.yml` file.
    * A misconfigured backup process exposes configuration files.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Never store sensitive information directly in configuration files.**
    * **Utilize environment variables for sensitive data.** Dropwizard supports accessing environment variables for configuration.
    * **Employ secrets management solutions:** Integrate with tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and retrieve secrets.
    * **Encrypt sensitive data at rest:** If storing encrypted secrets in configuration, ensure proper key management.
    * **Implement robust access controls:** Restrict access to configuration files and directories.

**4.2 Insecure Default Configurations:**

* **Vulnerability:** Relying on default configuration settings that are insecure or overly permissive.
* **Impact on Dropwizard:**
    * **Weak authentication/authorization:** Default settings might have weak password policies or allow anonymous access to certain endpoints.
    * **Exposure of sensitive endpoints:**  Debug or administrative endpoints might be enabled by default.
    * **Insecure TLS/SSL configuration:**  Using outdated protocols or weak ciphers.
* **Example Scenarios:**
    * The default administrative interface for Dropwizard is left enabled without proper authentication.
    * The default CORS configuration allows requests from any origin.
    * The application uses default logging levels that expose excessive debugging information in production.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Review and harden all default configurations.**
    * **Disable unnecessary features and endpoints.**
    * **Enforce strong password policies.**
    * **Configure secure TLS/SSL settings.**
