# Attack Surface Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Attack Surface: [Admin Interface Exposure](./attack_surfaces/admin_interface_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The Dropwizard admin interface provides access to internal application state and administrative tasks.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard *provides* this built-in admin interface, often on a separate port (default 8081), making it a readily available target if not properly secured. This is a *direct* contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses `http://example.com:8081/threads` to obtain a thread dump, revealing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, potential remote code execution (if custom tasks are vulnerable).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if exposed to the public internet), **High** (if exposed to a less-trusted internal network).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Strictly limit network access. *Never* expose it publicly.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and fine-grained authorization. Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Disable Unused Features:** Disable unnecessary admin features.
    *   **Monitoring & Auditing:** Log and monitor all access.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Vulnerabilities (Specific Aspect)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_vulnerabilities__specific_aspect_.md)

*   **Description:**  *Specifically*, the way Dropwizard *loads* and *uses* configuration can be a direct vulnerability if not handled carefully. This goes beyond just *storing* the file.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard's configuration loading mechanism, particularly its handling of environment variables and the potential for overriding values, is a *direct* contribution to this attack surface.  If the application uses Dropwizard's features to dynamically load or modify configuration based on external input *without proper validation*, this is a Dropwizard-specific issue.
*   **Example:** An attacker sets an environment variable that Dropwizard uses to override a database connection string, pointing the application to a malicious database server. This relies on Dropwizard's configuration loading behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of sensitive data, potential for code injection or other attacks depending on how the configuration is used.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (potential for significant impact if configuration is misused).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement *strict* validation of *all* configuration values, *especially* those sourced from environment variables or other external inputs, using Dropwizard's built-in validation or custom logic. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks that leverage Dropwizard's configuration system.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Configuration):**  Ensure that the application only has access to the configuration values it absolutely needs. Avoid overly broad configuration access.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Configuration Loading from Untrusted Sources:** If possible, avoid loading configuration values dynamically from sources that could be manipulated by an attacker.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Dropwizard's Core Dependencies)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__dropwizard's_core_dependencies_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard's *core* dependencies (Jetty, Jersey, Jackson) that are *essential* to Dropwizard's operation.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard *directly* relies on these specific versions of these libraries. While all applications have dependencies, the *tight coupling* with these core components makes this a Dropwizard-specific concern.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the specific version of Jetty bundled with a particular Dropwizard release allows for remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Dropwizard Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation. Updating Dropwizard updates its core dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Scanning (Focus on Core):** While general dependency scanning is good, prioritize scanning and addressing vulnerabilities in Dropwizard's core components (Jetty, Jersey, Jackson).

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Deserialization (Jackson)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_deserialization__jackson_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to unsafe deserialization of JSON data using Jackson.
*   **Dropwizard Contribution:** Dropwizard *uses* Jackson as its *default* and *integrated* JSON processing library. This *direct* integration makes Jackson vulnerabilities particularly relevant.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted JSON payload that exploits a Jackson deserialization vulnerability, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Polymorphic Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The best mitigation.
    *   **Safe Default Typing:** If necessary, use a safe configuration.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Types:** Explicitly whitelist allowed classes.
    *   **Keep Jackson Updated:** Via Dropwizard updates or, if necessary, by overriding the Jackson version (with careful testing).
    *   **Security Manager (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments.
