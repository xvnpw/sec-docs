# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of the Admin Port](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_the_admin_port.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Network Restrictions:** Configure firewall rules (e.g., AWS Security Groups, network ACLs, `iptables`) to *completely block* external access to the Dropwizard admin port (default: `8081`).  Allow access *only* from trusted internal networks or specific IP addresses (e.g., build server, monitoring systems).  This leverages Dropwizard's built-in separate admin port.
    2.  **Authentication:** Enable authentication for the admin interface *using Dropwizard's built-in support* for basic authentication, OAuth2, or other supported mechanisms.  Configure strong passwords or use secure authentication tokens.  This utilizes Dropwizard's authentication features.
    3.  **Authorization (if needed):** If different users/roles require different levels of access to the admin interface, implement authorization rules *using Dropwizard's authorization features* or custom code integrated with Dropwizard's security context.
    4.  **Disable Unused Endpoints:** In the Dropwizard configuration file (e.g., `config.yml`), *disable any Dropwizard-provided admin endpoints* that are not actively used.  For example, if you don't need the thread dump endpoint, disable it. This directly modifies Dropwizard's configuration.
    5.  **Port and Interface Change:** Change the default admin port to a non-standard port *within the Dropwizard configuration*.  Consider binding the admin interface to a specific network interface (e.g., `localhost` if only local access is needed) *using Dropwizard's server configuration*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Dropwizard Admin Interface (Severity: Critical):** Attackers gaining access to the admin interface could view sensitive metrics, trigger actions (e.g., thread dumps, garbage collection), or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the admin interface itself. This is *specifically* about the Dropwizard admin port.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Dropwizard Admin (Severity: High):**  Exposure of sensitive information (e.g., system metrics, configuration details) through the Dropwizard-provided admin interface.
    *   **Denial of Service via Dropwizard Admin (Severity: Medium to High):**  Attackers could potentially trigger resource-intensive operations through the Dropwizard admin interface, leading to a denial of service.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduction: Very High (95-99%).  Proper network restrictions and Dropwizard-configured authentication make unauthorized access extremely difficult.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: High (80-90%).  Limiting access and disabling unused Dropwizard endpoints significantly reduces the exposed information.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduction: Moderate (50-70%).  Authentication and authorization can help, but specific DoS protections might be needed.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: AWS Security Group restricts access to port 8081 to a specific bastion host IP address.  Dropwizard's basic authentication is enabled with strong passwords.]
    *   [Example: Dropwizard admin interface bound to `localhost` only via Dropwizard server configuration.  Accessed via SSH port forwarding.]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: No authentication configured for the Dropwizard admin interface.]
    *   [Example: Dropwizard admin port is exposed to the entire internal network, not just specific trusted hosts.]
    *   [Example: Unused Dropwizard admin endpoints are not disabled in the `config.yml`.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Configuration Secrets (Dropwizard-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_configuration_secrets__dropwizard-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Variables with Dropwizard Substitution:**  Store sensitive configuration values as environment variables on the server.  *Utilize Dropwizard's built-in support for substituting environment variables into the configuration file* (e.g., `${DATABASE_PASSWORD}`). This is a Dropwizard-specific feature.
    2.  **Dropwizard Bundles for Secret Management (Recommended):** If using a secrets management service (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), *use a Dropwizard bundle specifically designed for integration with that service*.  This ensures proper integration with Dropwizard's lifecycle and configuration. If no suitable bundle exists, write custom code that integrates cleanly with Dropwizard's startup process.
    3. **Configuration file encryption:** If you must store secrets within configuration file, encrypt whole file or sensitive parts of it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Secret Exposure in Version Control (Severity: Critical):**  Hardcoded secrets in configuration files checked into version control are easily exposed. Dropwizard's environment variable substitution helps avoid this.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Logs or Backups (Severity: High):**  Secrets in plain text in configuration files can be logged or backed up. Dropwizard's features, combined with a secrets manager, mitigate this.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets (Severity: High):**  Attackers gaining server access could read plain text secrets. Dropwizard integration with secrets managers provides better protection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Secret Exposure in Version Control:** Risk reduction: Very High (99%).  Dropwizard's environment variable substitution prevents secrets from being stored in version control.
    *   **Secret Exposure in Logs/Backups:** Risk reduction: High (90%).  Dropwizard features, combined with a secrets manager, reduce this risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Secrets:** Risk reduction: High (80-90%).  Secrets management services, integrated via Dropwizard bundles, provide strong access control.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: All database credentials and API keys are stored as environment variables, and Dropwizard's substitution is used in `config.yml`.]
    *   [Example: Application uses the `dropwizard-vault` bundle to retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault at startup.]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: Some API keys are still hardcoded in the `config.yml` file, bypassing Dropwizard's substitution mechanism.]
    *   [Example: No centralized secrets management solution is used; environment variables are managed manually, and no Dropwizard-specific integration is in place.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Minimize Dropwizard Bundles](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_minimize_dropwizard_bundles.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory:** Create a list of all *Dropwizard bundles* currently used in the project.
    2.  **Justification:** For each *Dropwizard bundle*, document the specific functionality it provides and why it's necessary.
    3.  **Removal:** Remove any *Dropwizard bundles* that are not strictly required or whose functionality can be achieved through other, more secure means.
    4.  **Updates:** Keep all remaining *Dropwizard bundles* updated to their latest versions, just like Dropwizard itself.
    5.  **Security Review:** Before adding any *new Dropwizard bundle*, research its security implications and any known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard Bundles (Severity: Variable):**  Third-party Dropwizard bundles can introduce their own vulnerabilities.
    *   **Unnecessary Attack Surface (Severity: Low to Medium):**  Using Dropwizard bundles that are not needed exposes the application to potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Bundles:** Risk reduction: Variable, depends on the specific vulnerabilities in the removed bundles.
    *   **Unnecessary Attack Surface:** Risk reduction: Low to Moderate.  Reduces complexity and potential attack vectors.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   [Example: A list of all used Dropwizard bundles is maintained in the project documentation, with justifications.]
    *   [Example: Regular reviews of Dropwizard bundle usage are conducted.]

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   [Example: No formal process for reviewing and justifying Dropwizard bundle usage.]
    *   [Example: Several Dropwizard bundles are included but not actively used.]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management (Focus on Dropwizard and its Transitive Dependencies)](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management__focus_on_dropwizard_and_its_transitive_dependencies_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Regular Dropwizard Updates:** Stay on a supported, recent version of *Dropwizard* itself. This ensures you get security patches for both Dropwizard and its bundled dependencies.
    2. **SCA Tooling:** Use an SCA tool (as described before), but the focus here is on how it interacts with *Dropwizard's dependency management*. The tool must be able to analyze the dependencies *brought in by Dropwizard*.
    3. **Explicit Dependency Overrides (with caution):** If a vulnerability is found in a dependency *managed by Dropwizard*, and a Dropwizard update isn't immediately available, consider *explicitly* declaring a newer, patched version in your project's build file. This *overrides Dropwizard's choice*, and requires *very careful testing* for compatibility.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard's Dependencies (Severity: High to Critical):** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in libraries that Dropwizard uses (Jackson, Jetty, Jersey, etc.).
    * **Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard Itself (Severity: High to Critical):** Although less frequent, Dropwizard itself can have vulnerabilities.

* **Impact:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Risk reduction: Significant (80-95%). Regular updates and SCA scanning, focused on Dropwizard's dependency tree, are crucial.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Dropwizard:** Risk reduction: Very High (95-99%). Staying on a supported Dropwizard version is the primary mitigation.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * [Example: Project is on Dropwizard 2.1.x, with updates applied every two months. OWASP Dependency-Check is used, and its reports are reviewed.]
    * [Example: A process exists for overriding Dropwizard-managed dependencies in case of critical vulnerabilities, including a mandatory code review and extensive testing.]

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * [Example: Project is on an unsupported version of Dropwizard (e.g., 1.x).]
    * [Example: SCA tool is used, but it's not configured to deeply analyze Dropwizard's transitive dependencies.]
    * [Example: No process exists for overriding Dropwizard-managed dependencies; updates are only applied when a new Dropwizard version is released.]
