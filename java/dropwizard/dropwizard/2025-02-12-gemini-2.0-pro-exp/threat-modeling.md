# Threat Model Analysis for dropwizard/dropwizard

## Threat: [YAML Configuration Injection](./threats/yaml_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** YAML Configuration Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits malicious input designed to be interpreted as part of the Dropwizard YAML configuration file.  This could occur if configuration values are dynamically generated from user input without proper sanitization, or if an attacker gains write access to the configuration file. The attacker could inject settings that disable security features, expose sensitive data, or potentially lead to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (database credentials, API keys), denial of service, bypass of authentication/authorization, potential for remote code execution (RCE) via deserialization gadgets or misconfigured components.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dropwizard's configuration loading mechanism (primarily `ConfigurationSourceProvider` and related classes that handle YAML parsing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Never directly incorporate user-supplied input into the YAML configuration.
        *   **Configuration Templating (Safe):** If dynamic configuration is needed, use a secure templating engine that *escapes* output appropriately and prevents code injection. Avoid string concatenation.
        *   **File System Permissions:** Restrict write access to the configuration file to the absolute minimum.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Store sensitive configuration values in a dedicated secrets management system.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Use a YAML schema validator to enforce a strict schema.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Admin Interface](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_admin_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated Access to Admin Interface

    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses the Dropwizard admin interface (typically on a separate port) without authentication. This interface exposes application metrics, configuration details, and potentially allows administrative actions.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application information (metrics, configuration), potential for denial of service (by triggering administrative actions), and potential for further exploitation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dropwizard's `AdminServlet` and the associated connector configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to the admin port using firewall rules or network ACLs.
        *   **Authentication:** Enable and enforce strong authentication for the admin interface.
        *   **Disable if Unnecessary:** If the admin interface is not strictly required, disable it.
        *   **Reverse Proxy Configuration:** Ensure any reverse proxy is configured to restrict access and enforce authentication.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization (Jackson/Jersey)](./threats/insecure_deserialization__jacksonjersey_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization (Jackson/Jersey)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted JSON input to a Dropwizard endpoint that uses Jackson (for JSON processing). The crafted input exploits a deserialization vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution. *While not unique to Dropwizard, Dropwizard's common use of Jersey and Jackson for REST APIs makes this a prominent threat.*
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Affected Component:** Dropwizard's integration with Jersey (for REST endpoints) and Jackson (for JSON processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization:** Minimize deserialization of untrusted data.
        *   **Whitelist Classes:** Use a whitelist-based approach for allowed classes during deserialization.
        *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input *before* deserialization.
        *   **Update Libraries:** Keep Jackson and related libraries up to date.
        *   **Secure Deserialization Configuration:** Use secure deserialization settings and libraries.

## Threat: [Unprotected JMX Access](./threats/unprotected_jmx_access.md)

* **Threat:** Unprotected JMX Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker connects to the Java Management Extensions (JMX) port, which Dropwizard may expose (especially if `metrics-jmx` is enabled).  If JMX is unsecured, the attacker can invoke methods on managed beans (MBeans), leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or even code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Varies; can range from information disclosure to denial of service to remote code execution (if vulnerable MBeans are exposed).
    *   **Affected Component:** Dropwizard's `metrics-jmx` module (if enabled) and the underlying JVM's JMX implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable JMX if Unnecessary:** If JMX is not required, disable it.
        *   **Secure JMX:** If JMX is needed, configure it with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   **Network Restrictions:** Restrict network access to the JMX port.
        *   **Use a Secure Connector:** Consider a JMX connector that supports SSL/TLS.
