# Threat Model Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Threat: [Malicious Process Definition Deployment](./threats/malicious_process_definition_deployment.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Process Definition Deployment
    *   **Description:** An attacker with deployment privileges uploads a crafted BPMN 2.0 process definition directly to the Activiti engine. This process could contain logic to execute arbitrary code within the Activiti engine's context (e.g., using embedded scripts), manipulate data within Activiti's database, or cause a denial of service by consuming excessive engine resources.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the Activiti engine, data breaches within Activiti, disruption of all managed business processes, potential for lateral movement if Activiti has access to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Engine, Deployment Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict authentication and authorization for process deployment. Only highly trusted administrators should have deployment privileges.
        *   Establish a mandatory review and approval process for all process definitions before deployment, focusing on security implications and potential malicious logic.
        *   Disable or severely restrict the use of script tasks (Groovy, JavaScript) within process definitions. If absolutely necessary, implement robust sandboxing or use externalized decision engines with strict input/output validation.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools specifically designed for BPMN to scan process definitions for potential security vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Threat: [Unvalidated Process Input leading to Script Injection within Activiti](./threats/unvalidated_process_input_leading_to_script_injection_within_activiti.md)

*   **Threat:** Unvalidated Process Input leading to Script Injection within Activiti
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input through user task forms or API calls that is then directly used within a process definition's script tasks or execution listeners within the Activiti engine. If this input is not properly sanitized, the Activiti engine's scripting capabilities (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) can interpret it as executable code, leading to arbitrary code execution within the engine's JVM.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Activiti engine, potential data breaches within Activiti, ability to manipulate or disrupt any running process, potential for further exploitation of underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Engine, Task Service, Scripting Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before it is used within process definitions, especially in scripting contexts. Employ allow-listing and reject any input that doesn't conform to the expected format.
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into script tasks or execution listeners. If dynamic data is required, use parameterized approaches or secure data transformation techniques outside of the scripting engine.
        *   Enforce strict data type validation for process variables to prevent unexpected data from being passed to scripting components.

## Threat: [REST API Authentication Bypass in Activiti](./threats/rest_api_authentication_bypass_in_activiti.md)

*   **Threat:** REST API Authentication Bypass in Activiti
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within Activiti's REST API authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints. This could involve exploiting default credentials, flaws in authentication filters, or vulnerabilities in how Activiti integrates with authentication providers.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive process data, ability to manipulate process instances and tasks, potential for privilege escalation if administrative API endpoints are exposed.
    *   **Affected Component:** REST API, potentially Identity Service integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the Activiti REST API, such as OAuth 2.0 or secure API key management, and ensure they are correctly configured.
        *   Regularly audit and update authentication configurations.
        *   Disable or securely configure any default API accounts.
        *   Implement rate limiting and IP-based access restrictions to mitigate brute-force attacks.

## Threat: [REST API Authorization Vulnerability in Activiti](./threats/rest_api_authorization_vulnerability_in_activiti.md)

*   **Threat:** REST API Authorization Vulnerability in Activiti
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in Activiti's REST API authorization logic to perform actions they are not authorized for. This could involve manipulating API requests to bypass authorization checks or exploiting misconfigurations in role-based access control within Activiti.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of process instances, tasks, or data; ability to escalate privileges within the Activiti engine, potentially leading to complete control over managed processes.
    *   **Affected Component:** REST API, Authorization Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained authorization controls for all REST API endpoints based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   Thoroughly test authorization rules for all API endpoints, ensuring that users can only access resources and perform actions they are explicitly permitted to.
        *   Regularly review and update role and permission configurations within Activiti.

## Threat: [Weak Activiti Administrator Credentials](./threats/weak_activiti_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak Activiti Administrator Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Activiti administrator account by exploiting weak, default, or compromised credentials. This could be through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or social engineering.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Activiti engine, including the ability to deploy malicious processes, modify configurations, access all process data, and potentially compromise integrated systems if Activiti manages their credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** Identity Service, Authentication Service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all Activiti accounts, especially administrator accounts, requiring complex passwords and regular changes.
        *   Change all default administrator credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrator accounts to add an extra layer of security.
        *   Monitor login attempts and implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Threat: [Exposed Activiti Management Interfaces](./threats/exposed_activiti_management_interfaces.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposed Activiti Management Interfaces
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Activiti's management interfaces (e.g., Activiti Admin) if they are accessible without proper authentication and authorization from untrusted networks or the internet.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the Activiti engine, allowing the attacker to deploy malicious processes, modify critical configurations, access sensitive process data, and potentially disrupt all business processes managed by Activiti.
    *   **Affected Component:** Activiti Admin UI, potentially underlying web server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to Activiti management interfaces to authorized internal networks or specific IP addresses only. Use firewall rules or network segmentation to enforce this.
        *   Enforce strong authentication for accessing management interfaces, ideally using MFA.
        *   Consider disabling management interfaces in production environments if they are not actively required for monitoring or administration. If necessary, access should be through a secure VPN.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Activiti Components](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_activiti_components.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Activiti Components
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities present in the third-party libraries and dependencies used by the Activiti engine and its components.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution within the Activiti engine, denial of service, information disclosure, or other forms of compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core Activiti Engine, all modules and dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Maintain an up-to-date version of Activiti and its dependencies by regularly applying security patches and upgrades.
        *   Implement a process for monitoring and tracking known vulnerabilities in Activiti's dependencies using vulnerability scanning tools.
