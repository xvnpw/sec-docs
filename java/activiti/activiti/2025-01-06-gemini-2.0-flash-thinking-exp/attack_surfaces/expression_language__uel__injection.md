## Deep Dive Analysis: Expression Language (UEL) Injection in Activiti

This document provides a deep analysis of the Expression Language (UEL) Injection attack surface within the Activiti workflow engine. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the risks, potential impacts, and necessary mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Core Vulnerability:**

The root of the UEL Injection vulnerability lies in the dynamic evaluation of expressions within Activiti. Activiti leverages the Unified Expression Language (UEL), a standard for accessing and manipulating data within Java EE applications. This powerful feature allows for flexible and dynamic behavior in workflows, but it becomes a significant security risk when user-controlled data is directly incorporated into these expressions without proper sanitization.

**Deconstructing How Activiti Contributes:**

Activiti's architecture relies heavily on UEL for various functionalities:

* **Conditional Sequence Flows:**  Deciding which path a workflow takes based on data. For example, `#{order.amount > 100}`.
* **Task Assignments:** Dynamically assigning tasks to users or groups based on data. For example, `#{userManagementService.findUser(taskAssigneeVariable)}`.
* **Data Mapping:** Transforming data between process variables and task form fields. For example, mapping a form field `customerName` to a process variable `customer`.
* **Execution Listeners:** Triggering custom logic at specific points in the workflow execution.
* **Timer Events:**  Setting up timers based on expressions.
* **Service Task Implementation:**  Invoking Java methods or Spring beans based on expressions.

In all these scenarios, if the data used within the UEL expression originates from user input (directly or indirectly) and is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious code that will be evaluated by the Activiti engine.

**Elaborating on the Example:**

The provided example of a conditional gateway is a common and illustrative case:

Imagine a process where an approval step is required for orders exceeding a certain amount. The conditional gateway might use an expression like: `#{order.amount > threshold}`.

If the `threshold` is somehow derived from user input (e.g., a configuration setting editable by an administrator, or even indirectly through a data source influenced by a user), a malicious user could manipulate this input.

**Attack Scenario:**

1. **Vulnerable Input:** The application allows an administrator to set the approval threshold.
2. **Malicious Input:** The attacker sets the threshold to something like: `100 or Runtime.getRuntime().exec("rm -rf /tmp/*")`.
3. **UEL Evaluation:** When the conditional gateway is evaluated, the expression becomes: `#{order.amount > 100 or Runtime.getRuntime().exec("rm -rf /tmp/*")}`.
4. **Code Execution:** The Activiti engine evaluates this expression. Due to the `or` condition, even if `order.amount > 100` is false, the right-hand side of the expression will be evaluated, leading to the execution of the malicious command.

**Expanding on the Impact:**

The impact of UEL injection goes beyond simply bypassing business logic. It can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As demonstrated in the example, if the UEL context allows access to Java runtime functionalities, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Activiti. This is the most critical impact.
* **Data Breaches:** Attackers could manipulate UEL expressions to access sensitive data stored in process variables, databases, or other connected systems.
* **Data Manipulation:**  Malicious expressions could modify process variables, leading to incorrect data processing and potentially corrupting business data.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers could inject expressions that consume excessive resources, causing the Activiti engine or the entire application to become unresponsive.
* **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating task assignments or conditional logic, attackers might be able to gain access to functionalities they are not authorized to use.
* **Workflow Manipulation:** Attackers could alter the flow of processes, leading to incorrect execution and potentially disrupting business operations.

**Deep Dive into Attack Vectors:**

Understanding where user input can influence UEL expressions is crucial for identifying potential attack vectors:

* **Task Form Fields:** Input provided by users through task forms that is directly used in UEL expressions for subsequent logic.
* **Process Variables:**  If process variables are populated with user-provided data and then used in UEL expressions.
* **Configuration Settings:**  If configuration parameters used in UEL expressions can be modified by users (e.g., through an administrative interface).
* **Data Sources:** If UEL expressions access external data sources that can be influenced by attackers (e.g., a database where data can be manipulated).
* **REST API Parameters:**  If API calls to Activiti include parameters that are directly incorporated into UEL expressions.
* **Event Listeners:**  If custom event listeners utilize UEL expressions with user-controlled data.
* **Custom Activiti Extensions:**  Any custom code extending Activiti that uses UEL and incorporates user input.

**Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

The following mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing UEL injection vulnerabilities:

* **Prioritize Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Strict Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters, formats, and values for all user inputs. Reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Contextual Encoding:** Encode user input appropriately based on where it will be used (e.g., HTML encoding for display, URL encoding for URLs). Crucially, understand that standard HTML encoding is **not sufficient** to prevent UEL injection.
    * **Regular Expression Validation:** Use robust regular expressions to enforce specific patterns and prevent the inclusion of potentially harmful characters or sequences.
    * **Input Length Limits:** Restrict the length of input fields to prevent excessively long or complex expressions.
* **Parameterization and Predefined Functions:**
    * **Favor Parameterized Expressions:** Instead of dynamically constructing expressions with user input, use placeholders or parameters that are filled in with sanitized data. Activiti supports this to some extent.
    * **Utilize Predefined Functions:** Leverage built-in Activiti functions or create custom functions that encapsulate safe logic and avoid direct evaluation of user input.
* **Secure UEL Context Management:**
    * **Minimize Available Objects and Methods:**  Restrict the objects and methods accessible within the UEL context. Avoid exposing dangerous classes like `Runtime` or `ProcessBuilder`. This might involve customizing the `ExpressionManager` or using a secure sandbox environment (though this can be complex).
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to the Activiti engine and the user accounts interacting with it.
* **Code Review and Static Analysis:**
    * **Thorough Code Reviews:**  Specifically review all instances where UEL expressions are used, paying close attention to the source of the data within the expressions.
    * **Static Analysis Tools:** Employ static analysis tools that can identify potential UEL injection vulnerabilities by analyzing the codebase for patterns of unsanitized user input being used in expression evaluation.
* **Security Testing:**
    * **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing, specifically targeting potential UEL injection points.
    * **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to provide unexpected and potentially malicious input to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Security Headers and Configuration:**
    * **Implement Security Headers:** Configure appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy) to mitigate potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be a precursor to UEL injection.
    * **Secure Activiti Configuration:** Review and harden the Activiti configuration to minimize the attack surface.
* **Regular Updates and Patching:**
    * **Stay Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Activiti to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
* **Developer Training:**
    * **Educate Developers:** Train developers on the risks of UEL injection and secure coding practices for preventing it.

**Detection Strategies:**

Even with preventative measures, it's important to have strategies for detecting potential UEL injection attempts:

* **Input Validation Logging:** Log all instances of input validation failures. Suspicious patterns or repeated failures from the same source could indicate an attack attempt.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor Activiti logs for unusual patterns in UEL expression evaluation, such as attempts to access restricted objects or methods.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Activiti logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and identify potential attacks.
* **Runtime Monitoring:** Implement runtime monitoring to detect unexpected behavior or errors during UEL expression evaluation.

**Developer-Focused Recommendations:**

* **Treat all user input as potentially malicious.**  Never assume input is safe.
* **Explicitly sanitize and validate user input before using it in UEL expressions.**
* **Prefer parameterized expressions and predefined functions whenever possible.**
* **Clearly document the source of data used in all UEL expressions.**
* **Conduct thorough testing, including security testing, for all workflows and processes.**
* **Be aware of the available objects and methods within the UEL context and avoid exposing sensitive or dangerous functionalities.**

**Conclusion:**

UEL injection is a serious vulnerability in Activiti that can lead to significant security breaches. By understanding the mechanisms of this attack, potential attack vectors, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk. A proactive and security-conscious approach to development is crucial for building secure Activiti applications. This analysis serves as a starting point for a continuous effort to identify and address potential UEL injection vulnerabilities. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and regular review and updates are essential.
