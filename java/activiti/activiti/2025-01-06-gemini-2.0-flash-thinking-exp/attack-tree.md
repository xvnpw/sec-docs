## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Activiti **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_activiti__critical_node_.md)

**Compromise Application via Activiti (CRITICAL NODE):** This represents the attacker's ultimate goal and serves as the root for all potential attack vectors leveraging Activiti. A successful compromise at this level signifies a significant breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Process Definition Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)** **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_process_definition_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Process Definition Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** This critical node represents a significant weakness. Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious logic directly into the application's workflows, leading to persistent and potentially widespread control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script/Code in Process Definition (BPMN XML) **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_scriptcode_in_process_definition__bpmn_xml___high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious Script/Code in Process Definition (BPMN XML) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers aim to embed harmful code within the BPMN XML definition itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Expression Language Injection **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_expression_language_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

**Leverage Expression Language Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Activiti's use of expression languages (like UEL) can be exploited. If input is not properly sanitized, attackers can inject arbitrary code that the engine executes. Example: `#{Runtime.getRuntime().exec("malicious command")}` within a condition or script task. This allows for direct code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload Malicious Process Definition **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/upload_malicious_process_definition__high-risk_path_.md)

**Upload Malicious Process Definition (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers attempt to upload a completely crafted malicious process definition.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Validation Checks **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_validation_checks__high-risk_path_.md)

**Bypass Validation Checks (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If the application lacks sufficient validation on uploaded process definitions, malicious XML containing harmful code or logic can be accepted and deployed. This grants the attacker control over process execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Process Variables **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_process_variables__high-risk_path_.md)

**Manipulate Process Variables (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers target the data associated with running process instances to influence their behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data leading to Code Execution in Service Tasks **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_leading_to_code_execution_in_service_tasks__high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Malicious Data leading to Code Execution in Service Tasks (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If service tasks rely on process variables without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious data that leads to code execution when the service task processes it. This could involve SQL injection if a variable is used in a database query or other forms of command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Activiti Engine Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)** **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_activiti_engine_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Activiti Engine Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):** This critical node focuses on weaknesses within the Activiti engine itself. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Known Vulnerabilities in Activiti Version **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/known_vulnerabilities_in_activiti_version__high-risk_path_.md)

**Known Vulnerabilities in Activiti Version (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Older, unpatched versions of Activiti may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Publicly Disclosed CVEs **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_publicly_disclosed_cves__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Publicly Disclosed CVEs (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers can leverage publicly available information about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to exploit the application if it uses a vulnerable Activiti version. Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configurations **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

**Insecure Default Configurations (HIGH-RISK PATH):** The default settings of Activiti might not be secure, leaving the application vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication Settings **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication_settings__high-risk_path_.md)

**Weak Authentication Settings (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Default usernames and passwords or weak authentication mechanisms, if not changed, can be easily exploited to gain unauthorized access to the Activiti engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Management Endpoints **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_management_endpoints__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exposed Management Endpoints (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If management endpoints are not properly secured, attackers can gain administrative access to the Activiti engine, allowing them to control and manipulate the entire system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws within Activiti **(CRITICAL NODE)** **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_within_activiti__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):** This critical node highlights weaknesses in how the application integrates with Activiti, creating potential attack surfaces.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Service Task Implementation **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_service_task_implementation__high-risk_path_.md)

**Malicious Service Task Implementation (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Service tasks are custom code executed by the Activiti engine, and vulnerabilities here can be critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Code into Custom Service Tasks **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_code_into_custom_service_tasks__high-risk_path_.md)

**Inject Code into Custom Service Tasks (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If the application allows users to define or upload service tasks, attackers could inject malicious code directly into these custom components, leading to code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Service Tasks **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_service_tasks__high-risk_path_.md)

**Exploit Dependencies of Service Tasks (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Vulnerabilities in the libraries or dependencies used by custom service tasks can be exploited to compromise the application. This often involves leveraging known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

**Exploiting Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Data Transfer (HIGH-RISK PATH):** If data is serialized and deserialized during communication between the application and Activiti, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a particularly dangerous class of vulnerability.
