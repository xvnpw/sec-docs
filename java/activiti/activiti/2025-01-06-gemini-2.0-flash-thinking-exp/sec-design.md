    *   **Description:** Responsible for managing user tasks within running process instances.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Creating and assigning tasks to users or groups based on process definitions and business rules.
        *   Providing mechanisms for users to query, claim, and complete their assigned tasks.
        *   Managing task lifecycle events (e.g., creation, assignment, completion).
    *   **Technology:** Java-based service within the Activiti engine.
    *   **Data Storage:** Task-related data (e.g., assignee, due date, priority) is persisted in the database. Access control to task data is crucial.
    *   **Security Considerations:** Improper access control could allow unauthorized users to view or manipulate tasks.

*   **3.4 Form Management Service:**
    *   **Description:** Handles the rendering and submission of forms associated with user tasks, enabling user interaction within processes.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Retrieving form definitions associated with tasks (can be embedded in process definitions or stored separately).

**5. Security Considerations (Detailed for Threat Modeling)**

*   **5.1 Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:** Brute-force attacks on login credentials, credential stuffing, unauthorized access due to weak or default credentials, privilege escalation.
    *   **Considerations:**  Enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication, securely store password hashes, utilize established authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, SAML), implement robust role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles. Ensure proper authorization checks are in place for all API endpoints and internal service calls.
*   **5.2 Input Validation:**
    *   **Threats:** Injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, XML injection), cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    *   **Considerations:**  Implement strict input validation on all data received via the REST API and within process definitions. Sanitize user-provided data before using it in database queries or rendering it in web pages. Utilize parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Implement CSRF protection mechanisms.
*   **5.3 Data Protection:**
    *   **Threats:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data, data tampering, loss of confidentiality.
    *   **Considerations:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database (e.g., using database encryption features or application-level encryption). Use HTTPS for all communication between clients and the REST API gateway to protect data in transit. Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive data based on the principle of least privilege.
*   **5.4 Access Control:**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized access to process definitions, modification of running process instances, unauthorized task manipulation, access to sensitive historical data.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement granular access control policies for process definitions, process instances, tasks, and historical data. Ensure that only authorized users can deploy, start, modify, or view specific processes and data.
*   **5.5 Logging and Auditing:**
    *   **Threats:** Failure to detect security incidents, difficulty in forensic analysis, lack of accountability.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement comprehensive logging of security-relevant events, including authentication attempts, authorization failures, data access, and modifications. Securely store audit logs and protect them from tampering. Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity.
*   **5.6 Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threats:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks.
    *   **Considerations:** Maintain an inventory of all dependencies used by Activiti and the embedding application. Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement a vulnerability scanning process for dependencies.
*   **5.7 Process Definition Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Deployment of malicious process definitions that could compromise the system or access sensitive data.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement mechanisms to validate and verify process definitions before deployment. Restrict who can deploy process definitions. Consider static analysis of process definitions for potential security risks.
*   **5.8 Event Handling Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Tampering with event data, unauthorized subscription to sensitive events, injection of malicious events.
    *   **Considerations:** Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of events. Control which components can publish and subscribe to specific events.
