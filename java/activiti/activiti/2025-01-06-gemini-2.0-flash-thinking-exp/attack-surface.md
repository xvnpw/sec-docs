# Attack Surface Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Process Definitions (BPMN)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_process_definitions__bpmn_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys a crafted BPMN 2.0 process definition containing malicious elements.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti's core functionality involves deploying and executing process definitions. It parses and interprets BPMN XML, including embedded scripts and service task configurations.
*   **Example:** A process definition includes a Groovy script task that executes a system command to delete critical files on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial-of-service, server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls for deploying process definitions. Only authorized personnel should have this capability.
    *   Implement a review process for all process definitions before deployment, focusing on embedded scripts and service task configurations.
    *   Disable or restrict the use of embedded scripting languages (Groovy, JavaScript, UEL) if not strictly necessary.
    *   If scripting is required, implement robust sandboxing and security policies for the scripting engine.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan process definitions for potential security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the scripting engines (Groovy, JavaScript, UEL) used by Activiti for embedded scripts and expressions.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti provides the capability to embed scripts within process definitions and use expressions for data manipulation. It relies on external scripting engines to execute this code.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a UEL expression within a task form that, when evaluated, allows access to sensitive system properties or executes arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the scripting engine libraries (Groovy, JavaScript, UEL implementations) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data used in process variables, task forms, and REST API calls, especially before using it in UEL expressions or passing it to scripting engines.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when configuring scripting engine permissions.
    *   Consider using more secure alternatives to scripting if possible, or limit the functionality available within scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Language (UEL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/expression_language__uel__injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Injecting malicious code into UEL expressions that are evaluated by the Activiti engine.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti uses UEL for evaluating expressions in various contexts, such as conditional sequence flows, task assignments, and data mapping. If user input is directly incorporated into UEL expressions without sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A malicious user provides input to a task form field that is directly used in a UEL expression for a conditional gateway, allowing them to bypass intended logic or trigger unintended actions.
*   **Impact:**  Bypassing business logic, unauthorized data access, potentially remote code execution depending on the available functions in the UEL context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never directly incorporate unsanitized user input into UEL expressions.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
    *   Use parameterized expressions or predefined functions where possible, rather than dynamically constructing expressions with user input.
    *   Carefully review all uses of UEL expressions for potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Input Validation in REST API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_input_validation_in_rest_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:**  Activiti's REST API endpoints lack proper validation of input parameters, allowing attackers to send malicious or unexpected data.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti exposes a REST API for interacting with the process engine. Vulnerabilities in these endpoints are directly introduced by Activiti's API implementation.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted request to the `/runtime/process-instances` endpoint with malicious data in a variable, leading to an error that exposes sensitive information or potentially triggers a vulnerability in the underlying data processing.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, denial-of-service, potential for injection attacks if input is used in database queries or scripts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation on all REST API endpoints, including data type, format, and range checks.
    *   Sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Use a well-defined API schema and enforce it on the server-side.
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Regularly audit the REST API implementation for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in REST API](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_rest_api.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the authentication and authorization mechanisms protecting Activiti's REST API allow unauthorized access or the ability to perform actions without proper permissions.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti's security configuration and implementation for its REST API determine who can access and manipulate resources. Weaknesses here are specific to Activiti's API security model.
*   **Example:**  A misconfigured security rule allows anonymous users to start new process instances or access sensitive process variable data through the REST API.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of process instances, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication for all REST API endpoints.
    *   Implement fine-grained authorization controls based on roles and permissions.
    *   Regularly review and audit the security configuration of the REST API.
    *   Ensure that default credentials are changed and strong passwords are used.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Web Applications (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_web_applications__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**  Activiti web applications (like Activiti Admin or Task) expose internal object identifiers directly in URLs or request parameters without proper authorization checks.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** The design of Activiti's web applications and how they handle object references can introduce IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  The URL to view a task is `.../task/view?taskId=123`. An attacker could try changing the `taskId` to other values to access tasks they are not authorized to see.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential for data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid exposing internal object identifiers directly.
    *   Use indirect object references (e.g., mapping IDs to temporary tokens).
    *   Implement robust authorization checks before granting access to resources based on provided identifiers.
    *   Use session-specific or user-specific identifiers where appropriate.
