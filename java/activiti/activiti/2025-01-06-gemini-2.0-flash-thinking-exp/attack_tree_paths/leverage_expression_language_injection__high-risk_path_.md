## Deep Analysis: Leverage Expression Language Injection in Activiti

This document provides a deep dive into the "Leverage Expression Language Injection" attack path within an Activiti application. This is identified as a **HIGH-RISK PATH** due to its potential for complete system compromise. We will break down the mechanics of the attack, its potential impact, mitigation strategies, and detection methods.

**Understanding the Vulnerability: Expression Language Injection**

Activiti, like many workflow engines, relies on expression languages (primarily Unified Expression Language - UEL, often implemented by libraries like JUEL or Spring Expression Language - SpEL) to provide dynamic behavior within process definitions. These languages allow developers to embed logic within process variables, conditions, script tasks, and other elements.

The core vulnerability arises when user-controlled input is directly incorporated into an expression that is subsequently evaluated by the Activiti engine. If this input is not properly sanitized or escaped, an attacker can inject malicious code disguised as a valid expression.

**How the Attack Works (Technical Deep Dive):**

1. **Attacker Identifies Injection Points:** Attackers will look for areas where user input influences the evaluation of expressions. Common injection points include:
    * **Form Data:** Input fields in user tasks that are used in subsequent expressions.
    * **Process Variables:** Values set by users or external systems that are later used in conditions or scripts.
    * **Task Assignments:** Expressions used to dynamically assign tasks to users or groups.
    * **Gateway Conditions:** Expressions that determine the flow of the process based on variable values.
    * **Script Tasks:** While developers write the initial script, input used within the script can be a vector.
    * **Event Listeners:** Expressions used in event listeners to trigger actions.

2. **Crafting the Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts an expression that, when evaluated, will execute arbitrary code. The provided example, `#{Runtime.getRuntime().exec("malicious command")}`, is a classic example using Java reflection to access the runtime environment and execute a system command.

3. **Injecting the Payload:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through one of the identified injection points. This could be done through:
    * **Manipulating Form Data:** Submitting malicious input in a form field.
    * **Modifying API Requests:** Sending requests to the Activiti REST API with malicious values for process variables.
    * **Exploiting External System Integrations:** If an external system feeds data into Activiti, compromising that system could allow injection.

4. **Expression Evaluation and Code Execution:** When Activiti encounters the injected expression, its expression engine evaluates it. Because the input was not properly sanitized, the malicious code within the expression is executed with the privileges of the Activiti engine process.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Example Payload: `#{Runtime.getRuntime().exec("malicious command")}`**

* **`#{ ... }`:** This syntax typically denotes an expression to be evaluated by the expression language engine.
* **`Runtime.getRuntime()`:** This is a standard Java method that returns the current runtime environment.
* **`.exec("malicious command")`:** This method of the `Runtime` object executes the provided string as a system command.

**Consequences and Impact (Why it's HIGH-RISK):**

Successful exploitation of Expression Language Injection can have catastrophic consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Activiti engine. This is the most severe outcome.
* **Data Breach:**  Attackers can access sensitive data stored within the application's database, file system, or other connected systems.
* **System Compromise:**  Attackers can gain full control of the server, potentially installing backdoors, creating new user accounts, or launching further attacks.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can execute commands that consume system resources, leading to the application becoming unavailable.
* **Lateral Movement:**  If the Activiti engine has access to other internal systems, the attacker can use it as a stepping stone to compromise other parts of the infrastructure.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Legal and Compliance Issues:** Data breaches can lead to significant legal and regulatory penalties.

**Real-World Scenarios and Attack Vectors:**

Consider these scenarios where Expression Language Injection could be exploited:

* **Loan Application Process:** A user submits a loan application with a malicious expression in the "income" field. This expression is later used in a gateway condition to automatically approve the loan.
* **Task Assignment Based on User Input:** The assignee of a task is determined by an expression that includes a user-provided username. A malicious username could inject code.
* **Dynamic Scripting:** A script task uses a process variable derived from user input to perform calculations. A malicious input could inject code into the script execution.
* **Approvals Workflow:** The condition for an approval task is based on a value provided by the requester. A malicious requester could inject code to bypass approval.

**Mitigation Strategies (How to Prevent the Attack):**

Preventing Expression Language Injection requires a multi-layered approach:

1. **Input Sanitization and Validation (Crucial):**
    * **Treat all user input as untrusted.**
    * **Implement strict input validation:** Define expected formats, data types, and ranges for all input fields. Reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Output Encoding/Escaping:** When displaying user-provided data, encode it appropriately for the context (e.g., HTML encoding). This prevents the interpretation of special characters.
    * **Blacklisting is Insufficient:** Relying solely on blacklisting known malicious patterns is ineffective as attackers can easily bypass them. **Focus on whitelisting acceptable input.**

2. **Parameterized Expressions (Highly Recommended):**
    * **Avoid directly concatenating user input into expressions.**
    * **Use parameterized expressions where possible.** This involves defining the expression structure separately and then providing the user input as parameters. Activiti supports this to some extent, but it might require careful implementation depending on the context.

3. **Secure Expression Evaluators (Consider Alternatives):**
    * **Explore alternative expression evaluators or configurations that offer better security controls or sandboxing capabilities.**  While UEL is common, some implementations might offer ways to restrict access to sensitive Java classes and methods.
    * **Consider using a more restrictive scripting language for certain tasks if the full power of UEL is not required.**

4. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Run the Activiti engine with the minimum necessary privileges.** This limits the damage an attacker can cause even if they achieve code execution.
    * **Restrict access to sensitive Java classes and methods within the expression language engine's configuration.** This can be complex but significantly reduces the attack surface.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Conduct regular security audits of your Activiti process definitions and code.** Look for potential injection points and ensure proper input handling.
    * **Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities.**

6. **Keep Activiti and Dependencies Up-to-Date:**
    * **Regularly update Activiti and its dependencies (including the expression language implementation) to patch known vulnerabilities.**

7. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * While not a direct mitigation for server-side injection, CSP can help prevent client-side attacks that might be a precursor to server-side exploitation.

8. **Developer Training:**
    * **Educate developers about the risks of Expression Language Injection and secure coding practices.**

**Detection and Monitoring:**

Even with preventative measures, it's important to have mechanisms for detecting potential attacks:

* **Logging:**
    * **Log all expression evaluations, especially those involving user-provided data.**
    * **Monitor logs for suspicious patterns, such as attempts to access sensitive Java classes (e.g., `Runtime`, `ProcessBuilder`, `ClassLoader`).**
    * **Log errors and exceptions related to expression evaluation.**

* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**
    * **Integrate Activiti logs with a SIEM system to correlate events and detect suspicious activity.**
    * **Set up alerts for patterns indicative of expression injection attempts.**

* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):**
    * **Consider using RASP solutions that can monitor application behavior in real-time and detect and block malicious expression evaluations.**

**Developer Guidelines:**

As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, emphasize these guidelines:

* **Treat all input as potentially malicious.**
* **Never directly embed user input into expressions without thorough validation and sanitization.**
* **Favor parameterized expressions whenever possible.**
* **Understand the power and potential risks of the expression language being used.**
* **Implement robust input validation on both the client-side and server-side.**
* **Regularly review and test process definitions for security vulnerabilities.**
* **Stay informed about the latest security best practices for Activiti and expression languages.**

**Conclusion:**

Leveraging Expression Language Injection is a critical security risk in Activiti applications. By understanding the mechanics of the attack, its potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation. A proactive, security-conscious approach throughout the development lifecycle is essential to protect the application and its users. This analysis provides a foundation for building a more secure Activiti application. Remember that security is an ongoing process, requiring continuous vigilance and adaptation.
