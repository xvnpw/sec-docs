*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a malicious BPMN XML file that exploits vulnerabilities in the XML parser used by Activiti during deployment. This can include XML External Entity (XXE) attacks to read arbitrary files on the server or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), or XSLT injection to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If validation is weak or absent) / Low (If robust validation is in place)
*   **Impact:** High (Can lead to RCE, data exfiltration)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of XML vulnerabilities)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by intrusion detection systems, but sophisticated attacks might evade detection)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable external entity processing in the XML parser.
    *   Use a secure XML parser that is not vulnerable to XXE or XSLT injection.
    *   Implement strict XML schema validation (XSD).
