# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict BPMN XML Validation and Sanitization (Activiti-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_bpmn_xml_validation_and_sanitization__activiti-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Activiti's Parsing API Securely:**  When programmatically interacting with BPMN XML (e.g., deploying process definitions), use Activiti's API (`RepositoryService`) in a secure manner.  *Do not* bypass Activiti's built-in parsing mechanisms by directly manipulating XML files on the filesystem.
    2.  **Configure Activiti's XML Parser:**  Within Activiti's configuration (`activiti.cfg.xml` or equivalent), explicitly configure the XML parser settings:
        *   `enableSafeBpmnXml`: Set this to `true` (this is usually the default, but verify). This enables some basic security checks within Activiti's parser.
        *   Disable DTD processing and external entity resolution *within Activiti's configuration* if possible.  This supplements the external validator.
    3.  **Sanitize User Input in Activiti Expressions:**  Focus on expressions *within the context of Activiti's execution*.  Use Activiti's provided mechanisms for handling expressions (e.g., `ExpressionManager`) and ensure that any user-provided data passed to these mechanisms is properly sanitized and escaped *before* being used in an expression.  Prioritize parameterized expressions where available.
    4. **Audit Activiti Process Definitions:** Regularly audit deployed process definitions, specifically looking for:
        *   Potentially dangerous expressions.
        *   Use of external scripts or resources.
        *   Hardcoded values that should be parameters or configuration settings.
        *   Any deviations from established secure coding guidelines for BPMN.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks (within Activiti's parser):** (Severity: High) - Although an external validator is primary, this adds a layer of defense.
    *   **XML Bomb (Denial-of-Service) (within Activiti's parser):** (Severity: High) - Similar to XXE, this provides defense-in-depth.
    *   **Expression Language Injection (within Activiti's execution context):** (Severity: High) - Attackers can inject malicious code into expressions evaluated by Activiti.
    *   **BPMN Logic Manipulation (specific to Activiti features):** (Severity: Medium-High) - Attackers can alter the process flow by exploiting vulnerabilities in Activiti's handling of specific BPMN elements.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XXE (Activiti Parser):** Risk reduced (defense-in-depth).
    *   **XML Bomb (Activiti Parser):** Risk reduced (defense-in-depth).
    *   **Expression Language Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with proper sanitization).
    *   **BPMN Logic Manipulation:** Risk reduced from Medium-High to Low (with auditing and secure coding practices).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `enableSafeBpmnXml` is likely set to `true` (needs verification).
    *   Basic expression handling is done through `ExpressionManager`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit configuration to disable DTD and external entities *within Activiti's configuration*.
    *   Comprehensive, centralized expression sanitization strategy specifically tailored to Activiti's expression context.
    *   Formal, regular audit process for BPMN process definitions focusing on Activiti-specific security concerns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Activiti Service Task and Delegate Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_activiti_service_task_and_delegate_implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Service Task and Delegate Code:**  Thoroughly review the Java code of all service tasks and Java delegates *specifically for Activiti-related vulnerabilities*.
    2.  **Secure Data Handling within Activiti Context:**  When accessing or modifying process variables within service tasks or delegates, use Activiti's API (`RuntimeService`, `TaskService`) securely.  Avoid directly manipulating the underlying data structures.
    3.  **Validate Data from Activiti:**  Even though data *should* be validated before entering the process, validate data retrieved from Activiti's process variables *again* within service tasks and delegates.  This provides defense-in-depth.
    4.  **Avoid Unnecessary Database Access:** If a service task or delegate needs to interact with a database, use Activiti's persistence layer (if appropriate) rather than directly accessing the database.  This helps maintain consistency and leverages Activiti's transaction management. If direct database access is unavoidable, ensure it's done securely, following all database security best practices, and *avoid* using data from process variables without proper validation and escaping in database queries.
    5. **Limit Execution Time:** Implement timeouts for service tasks and delegates to prevent long-running or infinite loops from blocking the Activiti engine. Use Activiti's asynchronous job executor for long-running tasks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Code Injection (via process variables):** (Severity: High) - Attackers can inject malicious code into process variables that are then executed by service tasks or delegates.
    *   **Data Corruption:** (Severity: Medium-High) - Incorrectly manipulating process variables can lead to data inconsistencies.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** (Severity: High) - Long-running or blocking service tasks can make the Activiti engine unresponsive.
    *   **SQL Injection (if direct database access is used):** (Severity: High) - If service tasks interact directly with the database, unsanitized process variables could be used in SQL queries.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with validation and secure coding).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced from Medium-High to Low (with proper API usage).
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced from High to Medium (with timeouts and asynchronous execution).
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with proper validation and escaping, or by using Activiti's persistence layer).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Service tasks and delegates use Activiti's API for basic process variable access.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review of all service task and delegate code for Activiti-specific security vulnerabilities.
    *   Consistent validation of data retrieved from Activiti process variables within service tasks and delegates.
    *   Strict adherence to using Activiti's persistence layer whenever possible, avoiding direct database access unless absolutely necessary and fully secured.
    *   Implementation of timeouts for all service tasks and delegates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Activiti Engine Configuration (Activiti-Specific Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_activiti_engine_configuration__activiti-specific_settings_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`historyLevel`:** Set the `historyLevel` to the minimum required level.  Higher history levels store more data, increasing the potential impact of a data breach.  If you don't need full audit trails, use a lower level (e.g., `activity` or `audit`).
    2.  **`enableEventDispatcher`:** If you are *not* using Activiti's event dispatcher, disable it (`enableEventDispatcher="false"`).
    3.  **`jobExecutorActivate`:** If you are *not* using asynchronous jobs, disable the job executor (`jobExecutorActivate="false"`).
    4.  **`mailServer` Configuration:** If using Activiti's email capabilities, configure the `mailServer` settings securely:
        *   Use a secure connection (SMTPS).
        *   Use strong authentication.
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials; use environment variables or a secure configuration mechanism.
    5.  **`expressionManager`:** Review and configure the `expressionManager` to restrict the available functions and classes within expressions, if possible. This can limit the potential damage from expression injection attacks.
    6. **`enableDatabaseEventLogging`:** If using database event logging, ensure the database is secured according to best practices.
    7. **Custom Event Listeners:** If you have implemented custom event listeners, review their code carefully for security vulnerabilities. Ensure they do not introduce any security risks.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach (History Data):** (Severity: Medium) - Excessive history data increases the amount of information exposed in a breach.
    *   **Exploitation of Unused Features (Event Dispatcher, Job Executor):** (Severity: Medium) - Unused components can still contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Email Spoofing/Relaying:** (Severity: Medium) - Misconfigured mail server settings can be abused.
    *   **Expression Injection (via `expressionManager` restrictions):** (Severity: High) - Limiting available functions reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Custom Event Listeners:** (Severity: Variable) - Custom code can introduce new security risks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach (History):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (by minimizing stored data).
    *   **Exploitation of Unused Features:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Email Spoofing:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with secure mail server configuration).
    *   **Expression Injection:** Risk reduced (by limiting available functions).
    *   **Custom Event Listener Vulnerabilities:** Risk addressed through code review.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `activiti.cfg.xml` configuration is in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and optimization of `historyLevel`.
    *   Verification and disabling of `enableEventDispatcher` and `jobExecutorActivate` if not used.
    *   Secure configuration of `mailServer` settings (if email is used).
    *   Review and potential restriction of functions/classes available in `expressionManager`.
    *   Security review of any custom event listeners.
