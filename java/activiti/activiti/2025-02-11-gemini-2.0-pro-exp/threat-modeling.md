# Threat Model Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Threat: [Process Definition Tampering (Injection)](./threats/process_definition_tampering__injection_.md)

*   **Threat:** Process Definition Tampering (Injection)

    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to deploy process definitions (BPMN XML files) modifies an existing definition or uploads a new one containing malicious logic.  This could involve injecting script tasks with malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, Groovy), altering task assignments to unauthorized users, modifying decision conditions to bypass security checks, or adding service tasks that call external malicious services.  The attacker leverages Activiti's scripting and process execution capabilities to achieve their goals.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution on the server (RCE).
        *   Unauthorized access to data and resources.
        *   Bypass of security controls and business rules.
        *   Data corruption or deletion.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Activiti Component Affected:**
        *   `RepositoryService` (deployment of process definitions)
        *   `ProcessEngineConfiguration` (scripting engine configuration)
        *   BPMN elements: `scriptTask`, `serviceTask`, `userTask`, expressions, listeners.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Limit deployment privileges to trusted administrators. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for process definition management.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate BPMN XML files against a strict schema before deployment.  Reject definitions containing potentially dangerous elements or scripts if not absolutely necessary.
        *   **Scripting Sandboxing:** If scripting is required, use a secure, sandboxed scripting engine (e.g., a restricted JavaScript environment) that limits access to system resources and prevents malicious code execution.  Avoid using powerful scripting languages like Groovy unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   **Code Review:**  Mandatory code review of all process definitions before deployment, focusing on security aspects.
        *   **Digital Signatures:**  Digitally sign process definitions to ensure integrity and authenticity. Verify signatures before deployment.
        *   **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to process definitions and enable rollback to previous versions.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Employ static analysis tools to automatically scan BPMN XML files for potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, insecure configurations).

## Threat: [Process Instance Data Manipulation](./threats/process_instance_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Process Instance Data Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Activiti database or, *more directly*, uses the Activiti API (`RuntimeService`, `TaskService`) to modify process instance variables or execution state.  This is a direct attack on Activiti's core functionality for managing running processes.  The attacker leverages the API to bypass intended workflow logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized modification of business data.
        *   Bypass of workflow controls and approvals.
        *   Data corruption or inconsistency.
        *   Fraudulent transactions.
        *   Violation of compliance requirements.
    *   **Activiti Component Affected:**
        *   `RuntimeService` (manipulation of running process instances)
        *   `TaskService` (manipulation of tasks)
        *   Activiti database (direct access is less direct, but still a risk)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **API Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong authentication and authorization for *all* Activiti API calls.  Ensure that users can only modify process instances and tasks they are authorized to access. This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate all data submitted to the Activiti engine through the API or user tasks.  Prevent injection of malicious data.
        *   **Data Encryption:**  Encrypt sensitive process variables at rest and in transit.
        *   **Auditing:**  Enable detailed auditing of all process instance modifications.  Track who made changes, when, and what was changed.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Process Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_process_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Process Flooding

    *   **Description:** An attacker *directly* exploits Activiti's `RuntimeService` and `TaskService` to start a large number of process instances or create a large number of tasks.  This is a direct attack on Activiti's core functionality, aiming to overwhelm the engine.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unavailability.
        *   Loss of service.
        *   Business disruption.
        *   Potential data loss (if the system crashes).
    *   **Activiti Component Affected:**
        *   `RuntimeService` (starting process instances)
        *   `TaskService` (creating tasks)
        *   `ProcessEngine` (overall resource management)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on process instantiation and task creation *specifically within the Activiti API calls*.  Limit the number of requests per user or IP address.
        *   **Resource Limits:**  Configure resource limits for the Activiti engine (e.g., maximum number of active process instances, maximum number of threads, database connection pool size).
        *   **Asynchronous Processing:**  Use asynchronous tasks and message queues to handle long-running or resource-intensive operations, preventing them from blocking the main thread.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, database connections) and set up alerts for unusual activity *related to Activiti*.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

* **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization

    * **Description:** Activiti uses Java serialization for various purposes, including storing process instance data and communicating between components. If untrusted data is deserialized without proper validation, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code. This is a direct threat to how Activiti handles data internally.
    * **Impact:**
        * Remote code execution (RCE)
        * Denial of service
        * Data manipulation
    * **Activiti Component Affected:**
        * `RuntimeService` (process instance data)
        * `HistoryService` (historical data)
        * Any component using Java serialization for communication or data storage.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:** If possible, avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources. This is the best mitigation.
        * **Use a Safe Deserialization Library:** If deserialization is necessary, use a library that provides secure deserialization features, such as whitelisting allowed classes or using look-ahead deserialization.
        * **Input Validation:** Validate all data before deserialization, even if it comes from a seemingly trusted source.
        * **Monitor for Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Stay informed about known deserialization vulnerabilities in Java and related libraries.

## Threat: [Unpatched Activiti Vulnerabilities (Direct Exploitation)](./threats/unpatched_activiti_vulnerabilities__direct_exploitation_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unpatched Activiti Vulnerabilities (Direct Exploitation)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *known vulnerability within the Activiti engine itself* (or a tightly coupled dependency) to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code. This is distinct from general application vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise (RCE).
    *   **Activiti Component Affected:**
        *   Potentially any component of the Activiti engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability), but potentially Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep Activiti and all its *direct* dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.  Subscribe to security advisories from Activiti and its dependency providers.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities *specifically within Activiti and its core dependencies*.
