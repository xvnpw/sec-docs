# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Process Definitions (Activiti Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_process_definitions__activiti_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization for Process Definitions (Activiti Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Activiti Schema Validation:** Leverage Activiti's configuration options (if available, or implement custom extensions) to enforce strict validation of BPMN 2.0 process definition XML files against a defined schema *during deployment to the Activiti engine*. This ensures only well-formed and structurally sound definitions are accepted by Activiti.
    2.  **Sanitize Input in Activiti Process Definition Elements:** Within the BPMN XML, focus on sanitizing inputs *within Activiti-specific elements* like:
        *   `activiti:scriptTask` scripts: Sanitize data used *within scripts executed by Activiti's script engine*.
        *   `activiti:serviceTask` expressions: Sanitize parameters passed to service tasks *invoked by Activiti*.
        *   `activiti:formProperty` default values and validators: Sanitize default values and validate user input *handled by Activiti's form engine*.
    3.  **Restrict BPMN Elements in Activiti Configuration:** If possible, configure Activiti (or extend it) to restrict the usage of certain BPMN elements or attributes *within process definitions deployed to Activiti*. This could involve creating custom BPMN parse listeners or validators within Activiti.
    4.  **Automated Validation in Activiti Deployment Process:** Integrate schema validation and sanitization checks *directly into the Activiti deployment process*. This could be a custom deployment listener or a pre-deployment step using Activiti's API.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (High Severity):**  By validating against a strict schema *during Activiti deployment*, XXE injection vulnerabilities in process definitions are mitigated within the Activiti engine.
    *   **Script Injection (High Severity):** Sanitizing input in script tasks and other scripting contexts *within Activiti processes* prevents malicious scripts from being injected and executed by the Activiti engine.
    *   **Process Definition Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Schema validation *enforced by Activiti* helps ensure the integrity of process definitions within the engine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XXE Injection:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Script Injection:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Process Definition Manipulation:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic BPMN schema validation is *partially used in the Activiti deployment process*.
    *   Input sanitization within script tasks *in Activiti processes* is not consistently implemented.
    *   Restriction of BPMN elements *within Activiti configuration* is not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enhance schema validation *within Activiti deployment* to be more comprehensive.
    *   Implement consistent input sanitization practices *in Activiti process definitions*, especially in script tasks, service tasks, and form properties.
    *   Explore and implement restrictions on BPMN elements *directly within Activiti configuration or extensions*.
    *   Fully automate sanitization checks as part of the *Activiti deployment pipeline*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Scripting in Activiti Engine](./mitigation_strategies/disable_scripting_in_activiti_engine.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Scripting in Activiti Engine
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Assess Scripting Usage in Activiti Processes:** Review all deployed process definitions *within Activiti* and identify if scripting features (script tasks, execution listeners using scripts, form validators using scripts) are truly necessary for the business logic *executed by Activiti*.
    2.  **Refactor Activiti Processes (If Possible):** If scripting is used for simple logic, explore alternative Activiti elements like service tasks (calling Java services), business rule tasks (using DMN), or expression language (UEL) *within Activiti processes*.
    3.  **Disable Scripting Engines in Activiti Configuration:** Configure the Activiti engine *directly* to disable scripting engines (e.g., JavaScript, Groovy). This is done in Activiti's configuration files (e.g., `activiti.cfg.xml` or Spring configuration) by modifying properties related to script engine initialization. Refer to Activiti documentation for specific configuration properties.
    4.  **Remove Scripts from Activiti Process Definitions:** If scripting is deemed unnecessary, conduct a review of all process definitions *deployed to Activiti* and remove any script tasks, script-based execution listeners, and script-based form validators.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Script Injection (High Severity):** Disabling scripting in the *Activiti engine* completely eliminates the risk of script injection vulnerabilities *within Activiti processes*.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Scripting (High Severity):**  If scripting engines are disabled in *Activiti*, RCE vulnerabilities associated with script execution *within Activiti* are also eliminated.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Scripting (Medium Severity):**  Scripting *in Activiti* can be used to access and potentially leak sensitive information. Disabling scripting reduces this risk *within Activiti processes*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Script Injection:** High Risk Reduction (Eliminated)
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** High Risk Reduction (Eliminated)
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Scripting is currently enabled in the *Activiti engine configuration*.
    *   No systematic assessment of scripting necessity *in Activiti processes* has been performed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a thorough assessment of scripting usage across all *Activiti processes*.
    *   Refactor *Activiti processes* to minimize or eliminate scripting where possible.
    *   Configure *Activiti* to disable scripting engines if scripting is deemed unnecessary after assessment and refactoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Script Execution Environment (Sandboxing) in Activiti](./mitigation_strategies/secure_script_execution_environment__sandboxing__in_activiti.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Script Execution Environment (Sandboxing) in Activiti
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Sandboxing Solution for Activiti Scripting:** Research and select a suitable sandboxing solution for the scripting language used *within Activiti* (e.g., for JavaScript, consider secure JavaScript engines or sandboxing libraries; for Groovy, explore Groovy sandbox features or external sandboxing solutions). The solution must be compatible with Activiti's scripting integration.
    2.  **Configure Activiti Script Engine Factory for Sandboxing:** Configure the Activiti engine's script engine factory *directly* to use the chosen sandboxing solution. This might involve providing a custom `ScriptEngineFactory` implementation that wraps the standard engine with sandboxing capabilities and registering it with Activiti.
    3.  **Define Security Policies for Activiti Sandboxing:** Configure the sandboxing environment with strict security policies that limit the capabilities of scripts *executed by Activiti*. This includes:
        *   Restricting access to Java classes and APIs *from Activiti scripts*: Prevent scripts from accessing sensitive Java classes or APIs that could be used maliciously within the Activiti context.
        *   Limiting file system access *from Activiti scripts*: Restrict or deny file system access.
        *   Restricting network access *from Activiti scripts*: Prevent network connections.
        *   Limiting CPU and memory usage *for Activiti scripts*: Implement resource limits.
    4.  **Testing and Validation within Activiti:** Thoroughly test the sandboxed script execution environment *within Activiti processes* to ensure it restricts script capabilities while allowing legitimate process logic to function correctly *within Activiti*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Scripting (High Severity):** Sandboxing *within Activiti* significantly reduces RCE risk by limiting script capabilities *within Activiti processes*.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Scripting (Medium Severity):** Sandboxing can restrict scripts' ability to access sensitive data *within Activiti's execution context*, reducing information disclosure risk.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Scripting (Medium Severity):** Resource limits in sandboxing can help prevent DoS attacks caused by malicious scripts *within Activiti* consuming excessive resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Standard scripting engines are used by Activiti *without sandboxing*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Research and select a sandboxing solution compatible with Activiti scripting.
    *   Configure Activiti to use the sandboxed script execution environment.
    *   Define and implement security policies for Activiti's sandboxing.
    *   Thoroughly test and validate the sandboxed environment *within Activiti*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption of Sensitive Process Variables in Activiti](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_of_sensitive_process_variables_in_activiti.md)

        *   Activiti's built-in variable encryption features (if available in your Activiti version and suitable).
        *   External encryption libraries integrated *with Activiti's variable persistence mechanism* (e.g., custom variable serializers or interceptors).
    3.  **Implement Encryption Logic in Activiti:** Implement logic to encrypt sensitive process variables *before they are persisted by the Activiti engine*. This could involve:
        *   Custom variable serializers registered with Activiti.
        *   Activiti variable interceptors or listeners to automatically encrypt variables based on naming conventions or metadata *within Activiti's variable lifecycle*.
    4.  **Implement Decryption Logic in Activiti:** Implement corresponding decryption logic to decrypt sensitive process variables *when they are retrieved by Activiti*. This should be handled by the same custom serializers or interceptors used for encryption, ensuring seamless decryption within Activiti processes.
    5.  **Secure Key Management for Activiti Encryption:** Implement secure key management practices for encryption keys used by Activiti. Keys should be securely stored and accessed by Activiti, avoiding hardcoding.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach - Process Variable Exposure (High Severity):** Encryption protects sensitive data stored in Activiti process variables from unauthorized access in case of a database breach or unauthorized access to the *Activiti engine's data store*.
    *   **Information Disclosure in Activiti Logs and Monitoring (Medium Severity):** Encrypting sensitive variables can prevent sensitive data from being exposed in *Activiti engine logs*, monitoring systems, or debugging outputs that might capture process variable values.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach - Process Variable Exposure:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Information Disclosure in Activiti Logs and Monitoring:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Activiti](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__in_activiti.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Activiti
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles and Permissions within Activiti:** Define clear roles *specifically within the context of Activiti* (e.g., process initiator, task assignee, process administrator, auditor) and associate specific permissions with each role. Permissions should control access to *Activiti functionalities*:
        *   Starting processes *in Activiti*
        *   Claiming tasks *in Activiti*
        *   Completing tasks *in Activiti*
        *   Viewing process instances *in Activiti*
        *   Modifying process instances *in Activiti*
        *   Deploying process definitions *to Activiti*
        *   Managing users and groups *within Activiti's identity service*
    2.  **Integrate Authentication with Activiti Identity Service:** Ensure Activiti's identity service is integrated with your application's authentication system. User authentication should be enforced *by Activiti* before any access to Activiti functionalities.
    3.  **Implement RBAC using Activiti Authorization Service:** Configure Activiti's authorization service *directly* to enforce permissions based on roles. This involves:
        *   Using Activiti's identity service to manage users, groups, and roles *within Activiti*.
        *   Configuring Activiti's authorization service to enforce permissions *on Activiti resources*.
        *   Defining authorization policies that map roles to specific permissions on processes, tasks, and other Activiti resources *using Activiti's authorization mechanisms*.
    4.  **Enforce RBAC through Activiti API:** When interacting with Activiti programmatically, always use Activiti's API in a way that respects and enforces the configured RBAC. Ensure that API calls are made in the context of an authenticated and authorized user *as managed by Activiti*.
    5.  **Regular Role and Permission Review in Activiti:** Periodically review roles and permissions defined *within Activiti* to ensure they remain appropriate.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Processes and Tasks (High Severity):** RBAC *in Activiti* prevents unauthorized users from accessing, starting, modifying, or completing processes and tasks *managed by Activiti*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** RBAC *within Activiti* helps prevent privilege escalation by ensuring users only have necessary permissions *within the Activiti engine*.
    *   **Data Breach - Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity):** By controlling access to processes and tasks *within Activiti*, RBAC indirectly helps protect sensitive data processed within those processes from unauthorized viewing or modification *through Activiti*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Processes and Tasks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breach - Unauthorized Data Access:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic authentication is integrated with Activiti, but RBAC *within Activiti's authorization service* is not fully enforced.
    *   User roles are defined in the application, but not consistently mapped to permissions *within Activiti*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Define a comprehensive RBAC model with clear roles and permissions *specifically for Activiti functionalities*.
    *   Configure Activiti's identity and authorization services to fully enforce RBAC.
    *   Ensure all interactions with Activiti API respect the configured RBAC.
    *   Implement a process for regular review and update of roles and permissions *within Activiti*.
