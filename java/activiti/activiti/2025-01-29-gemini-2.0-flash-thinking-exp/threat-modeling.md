# Threat Model Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Threat: [Identity Spoofing of Activiti Users](./threats/identity_spoofing_of_activiti_users.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to gain access credentials of a legitimate Activiti user and impersonate them. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as initiating processes, claiming tasks, or accessing sensitive data within Activiti.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to processes and data, potential data breaches, disruption of workflows, unauthorized actions performed under the guise of a legitimate user.
*   **Affected Activiti Component:** Identity Service, Authentication Mechanism
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    *   Integrate with strong Identity Providers (LDAP/AD, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Enforce strong password policies.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions within Activiti.
    *   Monitor for suspicious login attempts to Activiti.

## Threat: [Tampering with Process Definitions](./threats/tampering_with_process_definitions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Activiti repository and modify deployed BPMN XML files. This allows them to alter process logic, inject malicious script tasks that execute arbitrary code within Activiti, or disable critical workflow steps.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of business processes managed by Activiti, execution of malicious code within the Activiti engine, data corruption, potential system compromise if malicious scripts are injected.
*   **Affected Activiti Component:** Repository Service, Deployment Process
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access control to the Activiti Repository Service.
    *   Utilize version control for process definitions and track changes.
    *   Implement a secure deployment pipeline with code review and automated security checks for process definitions.
    *   Digitally sign process definitions to ensure integrity and detect tampering.
    *   Regularly audit deployed process definitions for unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Process Variables and History](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_process_variables_and_history.md)

*   **Description:** Process variables and historical process data within Activiti might contain sensitive information. If access controls to Activiti's Runtime and History Services are weak or misconfigured, unauthorized users could gain access to this sensitive data through Activiti APIs or UI interfaces.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, potential identity theft or financial loss for individuals whose data is exposed through Activiti.
*   **Affected Activiti Component:** Runtime Service, History Service, API Access Control, UI Components interacting with Activiti data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Activiti to restrict access to process variables and history data based on user roles and process context.
    *   Consider data masking or anonymization techniques for sensitive data stored in Activiti process variables and history.
    *   Encrypt sensitive process variables at rest and in transit within Activiti's data storage.
    *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored in Activiti process variables and history whenever possible.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Exploiting Activiti Permissions and Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_exploiting_activiti_permissions_and_roles.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with low-level user privileges within Activiti could exploit vulnerabilities in Activiti's permission model or role management to gain higher privileges, potentially reaching administrator roles. This allows them to bypass authorization checks and perform administrative actions within Activiti, leading to full control over the workflow engine.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise of the Activiti engine, unauthorized administrative access, data breaches, disruption of all workflows managed by Activiti, potential for long-term damage to the application and underlying systems.
*   **Affected Activiti Component:** Identity Service, Authorization Mechanism, Role Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a robust and well-defined Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model within Activiti, ensuring least privilege principle is followed.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions within Activiti to ensure they are appropriate and secure.
    *   Securely configure the Activiti Identity Service and ensure proper enforcement of authorization policies.
    *   Keep Activiti and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation.
    *   Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing of Activiti's permission and role management mechanisms.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through Script Task Code Injection](./threats/privilege_escalation_through_script_task_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If process definition deployment within Activiti is not properly secured, an attacker could inject malicious code into script tasks within a process definition. When this process is executed by the Activiti engine, the injected code could run with the privileges of the Activiti engine itself, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Activiti or gain elevated privileges on the system.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise of the server hosting Activiti, arbitrary code execution, data breaches, complete control over the Activiti engine and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Affected Activiti Component:** Script Task Execution, Process Engine, Repository Service
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control who can deploy process definitions to Activiti and implement a highly secure deployment pipeline with mandatory code review and security scanning.
    *   Disable or restrict the use of script tasks in Activiti process definitions if they are not absolutely necessary for business logic.
    *   If script tasks are required, carefully review and sanitize any external inputs used within scripts to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a secure scripting engine sandbox to limit the capabilities of script tasks and prevent them from accessing sensitive system resources or executing arbitrary commands.
    *   Implement strong input validation and output encoding within script tasks to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Regularly perform security audits of process definitions, especially those containing script tasks, to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
