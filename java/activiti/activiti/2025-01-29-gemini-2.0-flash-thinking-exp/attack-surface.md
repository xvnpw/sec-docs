# Attack Surface Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the scripting engines (e.g., JavaScript, Groovy, JUEL) that Activiti uses for expressions, listeners, and service tasks. This can allow attackers to bypass security sandboxes or execute arbitrary code on the Activiti server.
*   **Activiti Contribution:** Activiti's core functionality includes executing scripts within process definitions for dynamic behavior. This integration with scripting engines directly introduces the risk if these engines or their usage are vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known sandbox escape vulnerability in the Groovy scripting engine integrated with Activiti. By crafting a malicious Groovy script within a process definition's script task, they can break out of the sandbox and execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting Activiti.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS), Unauthorized Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Scripting Practices:** Minimize the use of scripting within process definitions. If scripting is necessary, use the least privileged scripting engine and language suitable for the task.
    *   **Sandbox Hardening:** Ensure the scripting engine sandbox is properly configured and hardened according to security best practices. Regularly review and update sandbox configurations.
    *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep scripting engine dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all scripts used in process definitions for potential security issues and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Scripting Engines:** If certain scripting engines are not required by your application, disable them in Activiti configuration to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Process Definition Injection](./attack_surfaces/process_definition_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into process definitions (BPMN XML or programmatic definitions) that are deployed to Activiti. This can lead to the execution of unintended code or actions within the process engine, effectively manipulating the process flow and system behavior.
*   **Activiti Contribution:** Activiti's design allows for dynamic deployment of process definitions. If the application allows process definitions to be uploaded or created based on external or user-controlled data without proper validation, it becomes vulnerable to injection.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a crafted BPMN XML file containing an embedded JavaScript within a service task definition. When this process definition is deployed and a process instance is started, the malicious JavaScript code is executed by the Activiti engine during the service task execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS), Unauthorized Access, Process Manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation of all process definitions before deployment. Use schema validation for BPMN XML files to ensure they conform to the expected structure and do not contain malicious elements. For programmatic definitions, validate the logic and components being used.
    *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize process definition content, especially when constructed dynamically. Remove or neutralize potentially harmful elements like embedded scripts if not strictly necessary and securely managed.
    *   **Secure XML Parsing:** Use secure XML parsing libraries and disable features like XML External Entity (XXE) processing to prevent XXE injection vulnerabilities when parsing BPMN XML.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the users and applications that are authorized to deploy process definitions. Implement strong access control to restrict deployment capabilities to trusted entities only.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Language Injection (JUEL/UEL)](./attack_surfaces/expression_language_injection__jueluel_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious expressions into JUEL (Unified Expression Language) or UEL, which Activiti uses for evaluating expressions within process definitions, forms, and listeners. This can lead to unintended code execution or unauthorized data access by manipulating the expression evaluation context.
*   **Activiti Contribution:** Activiti's expression language functionality is deeply integrated into process definitions and forms for dynamic data handling and decision making. If user-provided input or external data is incorporated into expressions without proper sanitization, it creates a direct injection vulnerability point within Activiti.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious JUEL expression and injects it into a form field's default value or a process variable definition. When Activiti evaluates this expression during form rendering or process execution, the malicious expression is executed, potentially leading to remote code execution if the expression is crafted to invoke system commands.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service (DoS), Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs and external data that are used in or contribute to expression construction. Avoid directly using unsanitized input within JUEL/UEL expressions.
    *   **Expression Validation:** Validate expressions to ensure they conform to expected patterns and do not contain potentially harmful functions or syntax. Implement a whitelist of allowed functions and operators if possible.
    *   **Restrict Expression Context:** Limit the objects and methods accessible within the expression evaluation context to only those strictly necessary for the intended functionality. Implement a secure expression resolver that restricts access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize the use of dynamic expressions based on user input. Favor static configurations or controlled data sources for expression evaluation whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Activiti REST API Security](./attack_surfaces/activiti_rest_api_security.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the Activiti REST API, specifically related to authentication and authorization bypass, and API parameter injection. These vulnerabilities can allow unauthorized access to Activiti functionalities and data, or enable manipulation of the process engine through malicious API requests.
*   **Activiti Contribution:** Activiti provides a REST API as a primary interface for interacting with the process engine. Weaknesses in the API's security mechanisms directly expose Activiti's core functionalities and data to potential attacks.
*   **Example:** The Activiti REST API is deployed with default or weak authentication configurations. An attacker can bypass authentication or authorization checks and gain unauthorized access to API endpoints, allowing them to start processes, manage tasks, or retrieve sensitive process data without proper credentials.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Process Manipulation, Potential for Escalation to other attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, or strong API Keys) for the REST API. Enforce fine-grained authorization to control access to API endpoints based on user roles and permissions. Ensure proper configuration of Activiti's security features for the REST API.
    *   **API Parameter Validation:** Validate all API parameters to prevent injection attacks. Sanitize input and use secure coding practices in API handlers to avoid vulnerabilities like expression injection through API parameters.
    *   **Secure API Configuration:** Review and harden REST API configuration settings. Disable unnecessary API endpoints and features to reduce the attack surface. Ensure proper HTTPS configuration to protect API communication.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the Activiti REST API to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in its implementation and configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Event Listener Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/event_listener_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Description:** Security risks introduced by misconfigured or insecurely implemented Activiti Event Listeners.  If event listeners execute custom code in response to process engine events without proper security considerations, they can become a point of exploitation.
*   **Activiti Contribution:** Activiti's event listener mechanism allows developers to extend process engine behavior by executing custom code on specific process events. If these listeners are not developed and configured securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities directly into the Activiti engine's execution flow.
*   **Example:** A developer creates an Event Listener that, upon a task completion event, executes a system command based on task variables without proper input sanitization. An attacker can manipulate task variables during process execution to inject malicious commands that are then executed by the vulnerable event listener on the Activiti server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Manipulation, Unauthorized Actions within the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Event Listener Implementation:** Thoroughly review and secure the code of all custom Event Listeners. Follow secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and principle of least privilege.
    *   **Input Validation in Listeners:** Validate and sanitize any input received by Event Listeners, especially data originating from process variables, task variables, or external sources, before using it in any operations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Event Listeners only the necessary permissions and access to resources required for their intended functionality. Avoid granting excessive privileges that could be exploited.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits and error handling within Event Listeners to prevent resource exhaustion or uncontrolled failures that could lead to denial of service.
    *   **Code Review and Testing:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing of Event Listener implementations to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
