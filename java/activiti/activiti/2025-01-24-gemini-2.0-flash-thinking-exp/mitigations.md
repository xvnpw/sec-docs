# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Process Definition Deployment](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_process_definition_deployment.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Process Definition Deployment

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Activiti Roles:** Define specific roles within Activiti's identity management (or integrated identity service) that should be authorized to deploy process definitions (e.g., "processDeployer").
        2.  **Configure Activiti Permissions:** Utilize Activiti's API or configuration files (e.g., Spring Security configuration if integrated) to map these roles to the permission required to deploy process definitions. This typically involves controlling access to Activiti's deployment API endpoints.
        3.  **Enforce Deployment Authorization:** Ensure that before any process definition deployment operation (via API or UI), Activiti checks if the user initiating the deployment has the necessary "processDeployer" role.
        4.  **Test with Activiti API:** Use Activiti's REST API or Java API to test deployment attempts with users assigned and not assigned the "processDeployer" role to verify enforcement.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Process Deployment via Activiti API (High Severity):**  Attackers or unauthorized users exploiting Activiti's deployment API to inject malicious process definitions.
        *   **Accidental Process Deployment Errors via Activiti UI/API (Medium Severity):**  Unintentional deployment of flawed processes by users who shouldn't have deployment permissions within Activiti.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Process Deployment via Activiti API:** High Risk Reduction. Directly prevents unauthorized deployments through Activiti's mechanisms.
        *   **Accidental Process Deployment Errors via Activiti UI/API:** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces accidental errors by controlling deployment access within Activiti.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. General application RBAC is in place, but specific Activiti role-based permissions for deployment are not fully configured within Activiti itself.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Defining and configuring "processDeployer" role within Activiti's identity management.
        *   Mapping this role to Activiti's deployment permissions using Activiti's security configuration.
        *   Testing and verifying RBAC enforcement specifically through Activiti's deployment API.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Process Definition Validation using Activiti API](./mitigation_strategies/process_definition_validation_using_activiti_api.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Process Definition Validation using Activiti API

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Utilize Activiti Process Engine Validation:** Leverage Activiti's built-in process engine validation during deployment. Activiti automatically validates process definition XML against its schema.
        2.  **Extend Validation with Activiti Listeners/Behaviors:**  Implement custom validation logic using Activiti's execution listeners or behavior extensions. This allows for programmatic checks within the process definition deployment lifecycle.
        3.  **Automate Validation in Deployment Pipeline:** Integrate Activiti's deployment API into a CI/CD pipeline.  Use the API to deploy process definitions and check for deployment errors returned by Activiti, indicating validation failures.
        4.  **Review Activiti Deployment Logs:**  Monitor Activiti's deployment logs for validation errors reported by the process engine during deployment attempts.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Deployment of Invalid Process Definitions in Activiti (Medium Severity):**  Deploying process definitions with XML syntax errors or structural issues that could cause Activiti engine failures or unexpected behavior.
        *   **Logic Errors in Process Definitions Deployed to Activiti (Medium Severity):**  Deploying processes with logical flaws that might not be caught by basic XML validation but could lead to incorrect process execution within Activiti.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Deployment of Invalid Process Definitions in Activiti:** Medium Risk Reduction. Prevents deployment of syntactically incorrect process definitions that Activiti can detect.
        *   **Logic Errors in Process Definitions Deployed to Activiti:** Medium Risk Reduction. Custom validation can catch some logic errors, improving process reliability within Activiti.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Activiti's default XML schema validation is active during deployment.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implementing custom validation logic using Activiti listeners or behaviors to enforce security-specific rules.
        *   Integrating Activiti's deployment API and error handling into the CI/CD pipeline for automated validation feedback.
        *   Setting up monitoring for Activiti deployment logs to proactively identify validation issues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Access Control for Process Instance Operations via Activiti API](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_access_control_for_process_instance_operations_via_activiti_api.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Access Control for Process Instance Operations via Activiti API

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Utilize Activiti API Security:**  When accessing and manipulating process instances, always use Activiti's API (RuntimeService, TaskService, HistoryService) and leverage its security context.
        2.  **Implement Authorization Checks in Application Code:** In your application code that interacts with Activiti API, implement authorization checks before calling Activiti API methods.  These checks should determine if the current user is authorized to perform the requested operation on the specific process instance based on your application's RBAC and business logic.
        3.  **Leverage Activiti Identity Service (or Integration):** If using Activiti's Identity Service or integrating with an external identity provider, ensure user authentication and authorization are correctly configured for API access.
        4.  **Test Activiti API Access:**  Thoroughly test API access to process instances with different user roles and permissions to verify that Activiti API calls are correctly authorized by your application logic.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Process Instance Manipulation via Activiti API (High Severity):** Attackers or unauthorized users directly calling Activiti API endpoints to manipulate process instances without proper authorization checks in the application layer.
        *   **Data Breaches through Activiti API Access (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized access to process instance data (variables, execution history) via Activiti API, potentially exposing sensitive information.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Process Instance Manipulation via Activiti API:** High Risk Reduction. Prevents direct API exploitation by enforcing authorization at the application level before interacting with Activiti.
        *   **Data Breaches through Activiti API Access:** Medium Risk Reduction. Limits unauthorized data access by controlling API interactions.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic authorization checks exist in the application layer, but might not be consistently applied to all Activiti API interactions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematically reviewing and enforcing authorization checks for all application code paths that interact with Activiti API for process instance operations.
        *   Implementing more fine-grained authorization logic based on process instance context and user roles when using Activiti API.
        *   Automated tests to verify authorization for various Activiti API calls related to process instances.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of Activiti Connectors and Service Tasks](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_activiti_connectors_and_service_tasks.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Configuration of Activiti Connectors and Service Tasks

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Externalize Connector/Service Task Configuration:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive configuration (URLs, credentials) directly within Activiti process definitions for connectors and service tasks.
        2.  **Use Activiti Properties or Application Configuration:**  Externalize configuration to Activiti properties files or your application's configuration management system. Access these configurations programmatically within service tasks or connector implementations.
        3.  **Secure Credential Management for Connectors/Service Tasks:**  If connectors or service tasks require credentials, use secure secrets management practices. Retrieve credentials dynamically from secure vaults or configuration services within service task implementations or connector logic, rather than embedding them in process definitions or Activiti configuration files directly.
        4.  **HTTPS for Connector/Service Task Endpoints:**  Always configure connectors and service tasks to communicate with external systems over HTTPS to ensure data in transit is encrypted. Configure Activiti connectors to enforce HTTPS.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Credential Exposure in Activiti Process Definitions (High Severity):** Hardcoding credentials in process definitions or Activiti configuration files, leading to potential credential theft if process definitions are compromised.
        *   **Insecure Communication with External Systems via Activiti Connectors/Service Tasks (Medium Severity):**  Using unencrypted communication (HTTP) for connectors and service tasks, exposing data in transit to interception.
        *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities in Activiti Connectors/Service Tasks (Medium Severity):**  Misconfigured connectors or service tasks due to hardcoded or insecure configuration, potentially leading to vulnerabilities in integrations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Credential Exposure in Activiti Process Definitions:** High Risk Reduction. Prevents credential exposure by externalizing and securely managing credentials.
        *   **Insecure Communication with External Systems via Activiti Connectors/Service Tasks:** Medium Risk Reduction. Ensures encrypted communication for sensitive data exchange with external systems.
        *   **Configuration Vulnerabilities in Activiti Connectors/Service Tasks:** Medium Risk Reduction. Improves configuration security by promoting externalization and secure management.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some configurations are externalized, but secure credential management for Activiti connectors and service tasks is not fully implemented. HTTPS is generally used, but not consistently enforced for all Activiti integrations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implementing secure credential management for Activiti connectors and service tasks, integrating with a secrets management system.
        *   Enforcing HTTPS configuration for all Activiti connector and service task integrations.
        *   Reviewing and refactoring existing process definitions to remove any hardcoded sensitive configurations for connectors and service tasks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation for Script Tasks and Expressions in Activiti](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_for_script_tasks_and_expressions_in_activiti.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation for Script Tasks and Expressions in Activiti

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Validate Inputs in Script Tasks:** Within Activiti script tasks, implement input validation for any data used in the script, especially data originating from process variables or external sources. Use scripting language features to perform data type checks, format validation, and range checks.
        2.  **Sanitize Inputs in Script Tasks:** Sanitize and escape user-provided input before using it in scripts to prevent script injection vulnerabilities. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by the scripting language.
        3.  **Restrict Scripting Language Features (If Possible):** If Activiti allows configuration of scripting engine features, restrict access to potentially dangerous functionalities or APIs within scripts to minimize the attack surface.
        4.  **Review Process Definitions with Scripts:**  Thoroughly review process definitions that contain script tasks for potential input validation and injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Script Injection in Activiti Script Tasks (High Severity):**  Malicious input injected into script tasks through process variables or external sources, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code within the Activiti engine context.
        *   **Data Manipulation through Script Vulnerabilities in Activiti (Medium Severity):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in scripts within Activiti to manipulate process data or engine state in unintended ways.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Script Injection in Activiti Script Tasks:** High Risk Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of script injection by validating and sanitizing inputs within Activiti scripts.
        *   **Data Manipulation through Script Vulnerabilities in Activiti:** Medium Risk Reduction. Mitigates some risks of data manipulation by securing script execution.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some basic input validation might be present in certain script tasks, but systematic and comprehensive input validation and sanitization are missing.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Implementing systematic input validation and sanitization for all script tasks within Activiti process definitions.
        *   Defining guidelines and best practices for secure scripting within Activiti for developers.
        *   Performing security reviews of all process definitions containing script tasks to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
