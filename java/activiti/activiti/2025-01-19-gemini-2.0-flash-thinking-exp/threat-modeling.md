# Threat Model Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Threat: [Malicious Process Definition Deployment](./threats/malicious_process_definition_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., `activiti-admin`) deploys a crafted process definition (BPMN 2.0 XML file) containing malicious elements *within Activiti*. This could involve embedding scripts (like Groovy or JavaScript) that execute arbitrary code on the server *when the Activiti engine processes the definition*. The attacker might aim to gain shell access, read sensitive files *accessible by the Activiti process*, or disrupt the service *managed by Activiti*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Activiti server, potentially leading to data breaches *within Activiti's scope*, service disruption of *Activiti-managed processes*, and unauthorized access to other systems on the network *if Activiti has those permissions*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Engine - Deployment Service, specifically the parsing and execution of embedded scripts within BPMN 2.0 process definitions *by the Activiti engine*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control for deploying process definitions *within Activiti*. Only authorized and trusted users should have the `activiti-admin` role or equivalent permissions *within Activiti*.
        *   Perform static analysis and validation of process definitions before deployment *to Activiti* to identify potentially malicious scripts or constructs.
        *   Consider disabling or restricting the use of embedded scripting languages within process definitions *in Activiti* if not strictly necessary.
        *   Implement a secure deployment pipeline with automated checks and approvals *for Activiti deployments*.
        *   Use a dedicated environment for testing process definitions before deploying them to production *within Activiti*.

## Threat: [Expression Language Injection](./threats/expression_language_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the expression language (e.g., Unified EL or JUEL) used within process definitions *in Activiti*. If user-controlled input is directly incorporated into expressions without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious code that gets executed by the *Activiti* engine. This could occur in conditions, task assignments, or other areas where expressions are evaluated *by Activiti*. The attacker might aim to execute arbitrary Java code or access sensitive data *managed by Activiti*.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the Activiti server, leading to data breaches *of Activiti data*, service disruption *of Activiti processes*, or unauthorized access *to resources managed by Activiti*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Engine - Expression Evaluation, specifically the components responsible for evaluating expressions within process definitions *by the Activiti engine*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly using user input in expression language evaluations *within Activiti process definitions*.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data used in expressions *evaluated by Activiti*.
        *   Consider using parameterized expressions or safer alternatives where possible *within Activiti*.
        *   Regularly update Activiti to the latest version to benefit from security patches *in the expression evaluation engine*.
        *   Enforce strict coding standards and conduct security reviews to identify potential injection points *within Activiti process definitions*.

## Threat: [Java Delegate/Listener Vulnerabilities](./threats/java_delegatelistener_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Process definitions can define Java delegates and event listeners, which are custom Java classes executed *by the Activiti engine*. If these custom classes contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection if they interact with a database *used by the delegate*, insecure file handling, or logic flaws), an attacker can exploit them through process execution *within Activiti*. The attacker might manipulate process variables or trigger specific execution paths *within Activiti* to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the delegate/listener. Could lead to data breaches *accessible by the delegate within the Activiti context*, unauthorized data modification *within Activiti's scope*, denial of service *affecting Activiti processes*, or even remote code execution if the delegate interacts with external systems insecurely *from the Activiti server*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Engine - Execution Service, specifically the execution of Java delegates and event listeners defined in process definitions *by the Activiti engine*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of all custom Java delegates and listeners *used within Activiti*.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing delegates and listeners, including input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling *within the context of Activiti*.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in delegates and listeners *used by Activiti*.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for delegates and listeners, limiting their access to resources and functionalities *within the Activiti environment*.
        *   Regularly update dependencies used by delegates and listeners to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure REST API Usage](./threats/insecure_rest_api_usage.md)

*   **Description:** Activiti provides a REST API for interacting with the engine. If this *Activiti* API is not properly secured, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities. This could involve missing authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to process data or engine functionalities *within Activiti*. An attacker might be able to start processes, claim tasks, modify process variables, or even deploy malicious process definitions if authentication is weak or non-existent *on the Activiti API*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive process data *managed by Activiti*, manipulation of process instances *within Activiti*, and potential for deploying malicious processes *into Activiti*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Activiti REST API, specifically the endpoints responsible for process management, task management, and deployment *provided by Activiti*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Activiti REST API. Use strong authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
        *   Enforce role-based access control to restrict API access based on user roles and permissions *within Activiti*.
        *   Secure API endpoints using HTTPS to protect data in transit *to and from the Activiti API*.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for all API requests to prevent injection attacks *targeting the Activiti API*.
        *   Regularly review and update API security configurations *for the Activiti API*.

## Threat: [Data Serialization/Deserialization Issues](./threats/data_serializationdeserialization_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Activiti serializes and deserializes process variables and other data *within its engine*. If insecure serialization mechanisms are used or if untrusted data is deserialized without proper validation *by Activiti*, it can lead to vulnerabilities. An attacker might be able to craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized *by Activiti*, executes arbitrary code on the server (deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability).
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the Activiti server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Engine - Variable Handling, specifically the components responsible for serializing and deserializing process variables *within Activiti*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data *within Activiti processes*.
        *   If deserialization of external data is necessary *within Activiti*, use secure serialization libraries and implement strict validation of deserialized objects.
        *   Consider using allow-lists for allowed classes during deserialization to prevent the instantiation of malicious classes *by Activiti*.
        *   Keep serialization libraries updated to the latest versions *used by Activiti*.

## Threat: [Default Credentials and Configurations](./threats/default_credentials_and_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Using default credentials for administrative accounts *within Activiti* or leaving default configurations in place can create easy targets for attackers. If default usernames and passwords are not changed, attackers can gain administrative access to the Activiti engine and perform malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Activiti engine.
    *   **Affected Component:** Activiti Core Configuration, specifically user management and security settings *within Activiti*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change all default passwords for administrative accounts *in Activiti* immediately after installation.
        *   Review and harden default configurations *of Activiti*, disabling unnecessary features or services.
        *   Implement strong password policies *for Activiti users*.

## Threat: [Scripting Engine Vulnerabilities](./threats/scripting_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Activiti supports scripting languages within process definitions. Vulnerabilities in the scripting engine itself *used by Activiti* or in the way scripts are handled *by Activiti* can be exploited. Similar to expression language injection, unsanitized user input used in scripts can lead to arbitrary code execution *within the Activiti environment*.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the Activiti server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Process Engine - Scripting Support, specifically the integration and execution of scripting languages within process definitions *by the Activiti engine*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the use of scripting languages *within Activiti* if possible.
        *   If scripting is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization for script inputs *processed by Activiti*.
        *   Keep the scripting engine *used by Activiti* updated to the latest secure version.
        *   Consider sandboxing the scripting environment *within Activiti* to limit the impact of malicious scripts.
