# Attack Surface Analysis for activiti/activiti

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Process Definition Deployment](./attack_surfaces/malicious_process_definition_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers deploy crafted BPMN 2.0 XML files containing malicious elements.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti's core functionality involves parsing and executing BPMN 2.0 XML. If not properly validated, malicious XML can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Deploying a process definition with a service task containing an embedded Groovy script that executes arbitrary system commands.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls for deploying process definitions, limiting it to authorized personnel.
    *   Perform thorough validation and sanitization of uploaded BPMN 2.0 XML files before deployment.
    *   Disable or restrict the use of embedded scripting languages (like Groovy or JavaScript) within process definitions if not absolutely necessary.
    *   Implement a review process for all process definitions before deployment, focusing on security aspects.
    *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan process definitions for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Scripting Engine Exploitation within Process Execution](./attack_surfaces/scripting_engine_exploitation_within_process_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the scripting engines (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) used within Activiti processes.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti allows the execution of scripts within service tasks, execution listeners, and other process elements. This introduces the risk of scripting engine vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A process definition uses a Groovy script that is vulnerable to sandbox escapes, allowing the script to execute arbitrary code outside the intended scope.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the scripting engine libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for any data used within scripts.
    *   Consider using more secure alternatives to embedded scripting where possible.
    *   Implement robust security policies for script execution, potentially using sandboxing techniques (though Activiti's built-in sandboxing might have limitations).
    *   Regularly audit process definitions for potentially dangerous script usage.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Language (UEL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/expression_language__uel__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Unified Expression Language (UEL) expressions used within process definitions.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti heavily relies on UEL for evaluating expressions in various parts of process definitions (e.g., conditions, variable assignments). Improper handling of user input in UEL expressions can lead to injection.
*   **Example:** A task form allows users to input data that is directly used in a UEL expression to determine the next assignee, allowing an attacker to inject code to assign the task to themselves or execute other actions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, potential code execution depending on the context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid directly incorporating user-provided data into UEL expressions.
    *   If user input is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious UEL syntax.
    *   Use parameterized expressions or safer alternatives where possible.
    *   Regularly review process definitions for potential UEL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure REST API Endpoints (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_rest_api_endpoints__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposed REST API endpoints without proper authentication or authorization controls.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti provides a REST API for interacting with the process engine. If not secured, this API becomes a direct attack vector.
*   **Example:** An unauthenticated REST API endpoint allows any user to start new process instances or retrieve sensitive process data.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to process data, manipulation of process instances, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all REST API endpoints.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.
    *   Securely configure the REST API to prevent unauthorized access from external networks.
    *   Regularly audit the exposed REST API endpoints and their security configurations.
    *   Consider using API gateways for enhanced security and management.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Event Listener Implementations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_event_listener_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** Custom event listeners with security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Activiti Contributes:** Activiti allows developers to register custom event listeners to react to process events. If these listeners are not implemented securely, they can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An event listener that executes system commands based on process variables without proper validation, allowing an attacker to trigger arbitrary command execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom event listeners.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data processed within event listeners.
    *   Avoid performing sensitive operations directly within event listeners if possible, and delegate to secure services.
    *   Regularly review and audit custom event listener code for potential vulnerabilities.
