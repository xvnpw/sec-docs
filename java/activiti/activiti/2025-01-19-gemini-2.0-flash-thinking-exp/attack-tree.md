## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Process Definition Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_process_definition_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* Exploit Process Definition Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):
    * Inject Malicious Code via Process Definition (High-Risk Path, Critical Node) [CRITICAL]:
        * Gain Access to Deploy Process Definitions: An attacker gains the ability to deploy new or modified process definitions. This could be through:
            * Compromised Admin Account: Obtaining credentials of an administrator with deployment privileges.
            * Insecure API Endpoint: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Activiti API that allow unauthorized deployment.
        * Craft and Deploy Malicious Process Definition: The attacker crafts a process definition containing malicious elements:
            * Using Script Tasks: Embedding scripts (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript) that execute arbitrary code on the server.
            * Service Tasks with Vulnerable Integrations: Configuring service tasks to interact with external systems in a way that exploits vulnerabilities in those systems or the integration itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Process Instance Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_process_instance_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* Exploit Process Instance Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):
    * Manipulate Process Variables to Gain Unauthorized Access or Privilege Escalation: An attacker manipulates process variables to bypass authorization checks or gain elevated privileges:
        * Exploit Insecure Variable Handling in Custom Code or Listeners: Custom code or event listeners might use process variables in security-sensitive ways without proper validation, allowing manipulation to bypass checks.
        * Directly Modify Process Variables (if API access is insecure): If the Activiti API lacks proper authorization, an attacker could directly modify process variables to alter the process flow or gain access to data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit User and Group Management Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_user_and_group_management_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* Exploit User and Group Management Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):
    * Gain Unauthorized Access by Compromising User Accounts: An attacker gains access to legitimate user accounts:
        * Exploit Weak Password Policies or Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication in Activiti User Management: Brute-forcing weak passwords or exploiting the absence of MFA.
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom User Management Integration: If user management is integrated with an external system, vulnerabilities in that integration could be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):
    * Compromise External Systems via Service Tasks: An attacker uses Activiti's service tasks to attack integrated systems:
        * Exploit Insecure Configuration of Service Task Connectors: Misconfigured connectors might use default credentials or lack proper authentication, allowing unauthorized access to external systems.
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Integrated Systems: Service tasks might interact with vulnerable endpoints in external systems, allowing the attacker to exploit those vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities (Activiti REST API) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities__activiti_rest_api___high-risk_path_.md)

* Exploit API Vulnerabilities (Activiti REST API) (High-Risk Path):
    * Bypass Authentication and Authorization: An attacker circumvents the API's security measures:
        * Exploit Weaknesses in API Authentication Mechanisms (e.g., default credentials, insecure tokens): Using default API keys or tokens, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the token generation or validation process.
        * Exploit Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities in API Endpoints: Finding API endpoints that lack proper authorization checks, allowing access to sensitive data or actions.
    * Exploit Injection Vulnerabilities in API Parameters (High-Risk Path, Critical Node) [CRITICAL]: An attacker injects malicious code or commands through API parameters:
        * Command Injection via API Parameters: Injecting operating system commands into API parameters that are not properly sanitized, leading to command execution on the server.
        * Expression Language (UEL) Injection via API Parameters (if used): If Activiti uses Expression Language and API parameters are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious EL expressions that execute arbitrary code.
