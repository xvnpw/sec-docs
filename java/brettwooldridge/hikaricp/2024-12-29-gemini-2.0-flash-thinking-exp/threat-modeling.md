*   **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials in Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to configuration files (e.g., `application.properties`, `application.yml`) or environment variables where database credentials (username, password) used by HikariCP are stored in plain text or easily reversible formats. The attacker can then extract these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `HikariConfig` (configuration class).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure credential management practices such as environment variables (with proper access controls), dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
        *   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the application code.
        *   Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files.

*   **Threat:** Connection Leaks Leading to Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** An attacker can trigger scenarios (either intentionally or through exploiting application logic flaws) that cause the application to fail to properly close database connections after use. This leads to connection leaks, eventually exhausting the HikariCP connection pool and preventing the application from acquiring new connections.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, inability to process database requests, and potential for cascading failures.
    *   **Affected Component:** HikariCP's connection management logic (`PoolBase`, `ConcurrentBag`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust connection management practices using try-with-resources blocks (in Java) or similar mechanisms to ensure connections are always closed in `finally` blocks.
        *   Utilize connection leak detection features provided by HikariCP (`leakDetectionThreshold`).
        *   Monitor connection pool usage and implement alerts for potential leaks.
        *   Thoroughly test the application under various load conditions to identify potential connection leak scenarios.

*   **Threat:** Connection Starvation Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker can send a large number of requests or trigger slow, resource-intensive database queries that consume a significant number of connections from the HikariCP pool and hold them for an extended period. This can starve legitimate requests of connections, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, slow response times for legitimate users, application unresponsiveness.
    *   **Affected Component:** HikariCP's connection acquisition and allocation mechanisms (`PoolBase`, `ConcurrentBag`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Properly size the connection pool based on anticipated load and performance testing.
        *   Optimize database queries to minimize connection holding time.
        *   Implement connection timeout mechanisms to prevent indefinite waiting for connections.
        *   Implement request queuing or throttling mechanisms to prevent overwhelming the application and the connection pool.
