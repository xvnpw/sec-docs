### High and Critical Kafka Threats

Here's a list of high and critical security threats directly involving Apache Kafka components:

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Topic Production
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to producer credentials or exploits a vulnerability to send malicious or unintended messages to a Kafka topic. This directly leverages Kafka's producer API and broker topic management.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, disruption of consumer applications, injection of malicious payloads, and resource exhaustion on brokers.
    *   **Affected Component:** Producer API, Kafka Broker (topic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for producers (SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM, mutual TLS).
        *   Utilize Kafka ACLs to restrict producer access to specific topics.
        *   Securely manage producer credentials and API keys.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in producer applications.
        *   Monitor producer activity for anomalies.

*   **Threat:** Message Tampering in Transit (Producer to Broker)
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between a producer and a Kafka broker and modifies the message content before it reaches the broker. This directly targets the communication channel secured by Kafka's TLS configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, leading to consumers processing incorrect or malicious data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication between Producer and Broker.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all communication between producers and brokers.
        *   Implement message signing or hashing at the producer level for integrity verification.
        *   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Topic Consumption
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to consumer credentials or exploits a vulnerability to read messages from a Kafka topic they are not authorized to access. This directly targets Kafka's consumer API and broker topic access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality of data within the topic is breached, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Consumer API, Kafka Broker (topic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for consumers (SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM, mutual TLS).
        *   Utilize Kafka ACLs to restrict consumer access to specific topics and consumer groups.
        *   Securely manage consumer credentials.
        *   Monitor consumer activity for unauthorized access attempts.

*   **Threat:** Message Tampering on Broker
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kafka broker's storage and directly modifies messages stored on disk. This is a direct attack on Kafka's data storage mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity is severely compromised, leading to consumers processing incorrect or malicious data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kafka Broker (storage layer).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and security measures for the Kafka broker servers and storage.
        *   Encrypt data at rest on the broker's storage.
        *   Regularly monitor file system integrity.
        *   Implement intrusion detection systems.

*   **Threat:** Broker Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Kafka broker with a large number of requests or malicious messages, causing it to become unavailable. This directly targets Kafka's ability to handle requests and manage resources.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of the application's functionality, data loss if producers cannot send messages, and potential cascading failures.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kafka Broker.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the broker.
        *   Configure appropriate resource limits for the broker (CPU, memory, disk).
        *   Implement network security measures to prevent DDoS attacks.
        *   Monitor broker performance and resource utilization.

*   **Threat:** ZooKeeper/Kafka Raft Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ZooKeeper ensemble (or Kafka Raft quorum) responsible for managing the Kafka cluster. This is a direct attack on Kafka's core coordination and management infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of control over the Kafka cluster, potential data loss or corruption, and the ability for the attacker to disrupt or shut down the entire Kafka deployment.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZooKeeper, Kafka Raft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to ZooKeeper/Raft.
        *   Secure the servers hosting ZooKeeper/Raft with appropriate access controls and security hardening.
        *   Regularly patch and update ZooKeeper/Raft.
        *   Monitor ZooKeeper/Raft for suspicious activity.
        *   Isolate ZooKeeper/Raft on a secure network segment.

*   **Threat:** Kafka Connect Malicious Connector
    *   **Description:** An attacker deploys a malicious Kafka Connector to the Kafka Connect framework. This directly leverages Kafka Connect's functionality to extend Kafka's capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, compromise of external systems integrated with Kafka, and potential for further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Kafka Connect.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict controls over who can deploy connectors to Kafka Connect.
        *   Implement a review process for all connectors before deployment.
        *   Run Kafka Connect in a secure environment with appropriate resource isolation.
        *   Monitor connector activity for suspicious behavior.
