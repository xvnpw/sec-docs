Here's the updated list of high and critical threats directly involving `eugenp/tutorials`:

* **Threat:** Use of Vulnerable Dependency
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in a library or framework used in a tutorial code snippet that has been directly incorporated into the application. The vulnerability is inherent in the code provided by the tutorial.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, or other forms of system compromise depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Affected Component:** Any module or component of the target application that utilizes the vulnerable dependency directly introduced from the tutorial (e.g., a specific service, controller, or data access layer).
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Before incorporating code, check the dependencies used in the tutorial against known vulnerability databases.
        * If using a dependency from the tutorial, immediately update to the latest stable and patched version.
        * Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor dependencies.

* **Threat:** Insecure Default Configuration
    * **Description:** An attacker could leverage default or example configurations directly copied from the tutorials that have weak security settings (e.g., disabled authentication, open ports, default passwords). The insecurity originates from the tutorial's example.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the application or its data, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration files or settings directly derived from the tutorial's examples (e.g., security configuration files, database connection settings files).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never directly copy configuration files from tutorials into production.
        * Always review and harden configurations based on security best practices, not just tutorial examples.
        * Enforce secure configuration management practices.

* **Threat:** Lack of Input Validation Leading to Injection Attacks
    * **Description:** Tutorial code might omit input validation for simplicity, and if this *exact* code is copied, it leaves the application directly vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection) due to the tutorial's lack of validation.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, session hijacking, defacement of the application, or remote code execution.
    * **Affected Component:** Any function or module that processes user input using the code snippet directly taken from the tutorial without adding proper validation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never use tutorial code that handles user input without implementing robust validation and sanitization.
        * Always add input validation layers to any code copied from tutorials that processes external data.
        * Educate developers on the importance of input validation, even if it's omitted in examples.

* **Threat:** Hardcoded Secrets or Credentials
    * **Description:** Tutorials might include placeholder or example credentials directly within the code. If developers copy this code verbatim, attackers could easily gain unauthorized access using these exposed credentials. The vulnerability is directly introduced by the tutorial's example.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and its associated data.
    * **Affected Component:** Any part of the code where hardcoded secrets from the tutorial were directly copied (e.g., database connection strings, API keys within the code).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never copy code containing hardcoded secrets from tutorials.
        * Implement secure secret management solutions and replace any hardcoded values immediately.
        * Utilize code scanning tools to detect hardcoded secrets before deployment.

* **Threat:** Overly Permissive Authorization Rules
    * **Description:** Tutorials demonstrating authorization might use overly permissive rules for simplicity, and if these *exact* rules are copied into the application, attackers could gain access to resources or functionalities they shouldn't have due to the tutorial's lax rules.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or system manipulation.
    * **Affected Component:** Authorization logic or security rules directly copied from the tutorial examples (e.g., Spring Security configurations, access control lists).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid directly copying authorization rules from tutorials.
        * Always implement the principle of least privilege when defining authorization rules.
        * Thoroughly review and adjust any authorization logic inspired by tutorials to meet the application's specific security requirements.
