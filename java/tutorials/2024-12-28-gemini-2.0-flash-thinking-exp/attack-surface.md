### Key Attack Surface List (High & Critical, Directly Involving Tutorials)

*   **Attack Surface:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** The application becomes vulnerable due to security flaws in third-party libraries used by the tutorials.
    *   **How Tutorials Contributes:** The `eugenp/tutorials` repository utilizes various libraries (e.g., Spring, Hibernate). If the application directly uses code or examples from the tutorials, it might inadvertently include vulnerable versions of these dependencies.
    *   **Example:** The tutorials use an outdated version of the `jackson-databind` library with a known deserialization vulnerability. If the application includes this dependency through tutorial code, it becomes susceptible to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly scan the application's dependencies, including those introduced by the tutorials, for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
        *   Keep all dependencies, including those from the tutorials, up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Isolate dependencies used by the tutorial code from the main application dependencies if possible (e.g., through containerization or separate modules).
        *   Thoroughly review the dependency tree introduced by incorporating tutorial code.

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Tutorial Content
    *   **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the application through content originating from the tutorials, which are then executed in users' browsers.
    *   **How Tutorials Contributes:** If the application directly renders or displays content (e.g., code snippets, explanations) from the `eugenp/tutorials` repository without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Example:** A tutorial example contains a code snippet with `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`. If the application displays this snippet directly on a webpage, the script will execute in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize any tutorial content (code snippets, text) before rendering it in the application using appropriate encoding and escaping techniques.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   Avoid directly rendering untrusted content. If necessary, use a sandboxed environment or a dedicated rendering engine.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Code Practices from Tutorial Examples
    *   **Description:** The application adopts insecure coding practices by directly copying and using code snippets from the tutorials without understanding the security implications.
    *   **How Tutorials Contributes:** Tutorials are primarily for educational purposes and might not always adhere to the strictest security best practices. Examples might contain simplified or insecure implementations.
    *   **Example:** A tutorial demonstrates a simple authentication mechanism that is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. If the application directly uses this code, it inherits the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Various security vulnerabilities depending on the insecure practice (e.g., authentication bypass, SQL injection if database interaction is involved).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat tutorial code as a learning resource, not production-ready code.
        *   Conduct thorough security reviews and code analysis of any tutorial code before integrating it into the application.
        *   Educate developers on secure coding principles and best practices.
        *   Refactor and adapt tutorial code to meet the application's security requirements.
