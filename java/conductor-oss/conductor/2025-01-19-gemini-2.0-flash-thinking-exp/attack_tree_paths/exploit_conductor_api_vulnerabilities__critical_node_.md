        * **Insecure Session Management:** Hijacking or manipulating session tokens to impersonate legitimate users.
        * **Authorization Flaws:** Exploiting logic errors that allow unauthorized access to specific API endpoints or resources.
    * **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive workflow data, ability to create, modify, or delete workflows, potentially disrupting critical business processes.

* **4.2. Injection Attacks:**
    * **Vulnerability:** Failure to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied input passed to the Conductor API.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **API Query Language Injection (e.g., GraphQL Injection if applicable):**  Manipulating API queries to extract unauthorized data or perform unintended actions.
        * **Command Injection:** Injecting malicious commands into API parameters that are executed on the server.
        * **NoSQL Injection (if Conductor uses a NoSQL database):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the API interacts with the underlying NoSQL database.
    * **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution on the Conductor server.

* **4.3. Data Exposure:**
    * **Vulnerability:**  The API returns more data than necessary or fails to properly filter sensitive information.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Mass Assignment:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities where API endpoints allow modification of unintended object properties.
        * **Verbose Error Messages:**  Leaking sensitive information through detailed error responses.
        * **Insecure API Responses:**  Including sensitive data in API responses that should be filtered or masked.
    * **Potential Impact:** Exposure of confidential workflow data, API keys, internal system details, and potentially Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

* **4.4. Rate Limiting and Resource Exhaustion:**
    * **Vulnerability:**  Lack of proper rate limiting or resource management on API endpoints.
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Flooding the API with requests to exhaust resources and make it unavailable.
        * **API Abuse:**  Making excessive requests to consume resources and potentially incur costs.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Disruption of workflow execution, impacting application functionality and availability.

* **4.5. Known Vulnerabilities in Conductor:**
