# Attack Surface Analysis for conductor-oss/conductor

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Conductor exposes API endpoints for managing workflows, tasks, and metadata. If these are not properly secured, anyone can interact with them.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** Conductor's core functionality relies on these APIs for all interactions, making them a central point of control.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use an unauthenticated API endpoint to create a workflow that executes a malicious script on worker nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization for all Conductor API endpoints.
        *   Utilize API keys or other strong authentication mechanisms.
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
        *   Regularly review and update API access policies.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in API Requests](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_api_requests.md)

*   **Description:**  Insufficient validation of data sent to Conductor's API can allow attackers to inject malicious payloads.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** Workflow and task definitions, as well as parameters, are often passed through the API, creating opportunities for injection.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious code into a workflow definition that gets executed by a worker, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on all data received by Conductor's API.
        *   Sanitize and escape user-provided data before processing or storing it.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
        *   Enforce data type and format validation for workflow and task definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Workflow and Task Definitions](./attack_surfaces/insecure_workflow_and_task_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**  Workflow and task definitions can contain logic that, if not carefully controlled, can be exploited.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** Conductor executes these definitions, and if they allow arbitrary code execution or external command invocation, it becomes a risk.
    *   **Example:** A workflow definition could include a task that executes a shell command with unsanitized input, allowing command injection.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and audit all workflow and task definitions for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   Restrict the use of scripting languages or external command execution within task definitions.
        *   Implement sandboxing or containerization for task execution to limit the impact of malicious code.
        *   Use a "least privilege" approach for task worker permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Task Workers](./attack_surfaces/compromised_task_workers.md)

*   **Description:** If task workers are compromised, they can be used to execute malicious tasks or access sensitive data.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** Conductor relies on external task workers to perform the actual work in workflows, making their security crucial.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could compromise a task worker and use it to exfiltrate data processed by the workflow or to attack other internal systems.
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the environment where task workers are deployed.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for task workers connecting to Conductor.
        *   Regularly patch and update task worker dependencies.
        *   Monitor task worker activity for suspicious behavior.
        *   Consider using ephemeral or isolated environments for task execution.
