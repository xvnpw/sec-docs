## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Conductor [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_conductor__critical_node_.md)

Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access to application data, disrupt application functionality, or execute arbitrary code within the application's environment by leveraging vulnerabilities in the Conductor workflow orchestration engine.

Inject malicious code or commands within workflow definitions (e.g., using Groovy scripts).
            * Attackers craft malicious workflow definitions, embedding executable code (e.g., Groovy scripts) that can be executed by the Conductor engine or task workers, potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Task Definition Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/task_definition_injection__high-risk_path_node_.md)

Inject malicious code or commands within task definitions.
            * Similar to workflow definition injection, attackers inject malicious code into task definitions, which gets executed when the task is processed by a task worker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Workflow/Task Definition Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_workflowtask_definition_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

Attackers leverage vulnerabilities arising from the design or execution of workflows and tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Workflow Design [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_workflow_design__high-risk_path_node_.md)

Design workflows that exploit application logic vulnerabilities.
            * Attackers create workflows that intentionally exploit flaws or weaknesses in the application's business logic when the workflow is executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Task Worker Compromise [HIGH-RISK PATH START] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/task_worker_compromise__high-risk_path_start___critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to gain control over the processes that execute tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Task Worker Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_task_worker_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_node_.md)

Compromise a task worker process to execute arbitrary code within the application's environment.
                * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the task worker application itself, its dependencies, or the environment it runs in to gain control and execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Conductor's Internal Communication [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_conductor's_internal_communication__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target the communication channels used by Conductor components.

Inject crafted messages into Conductor's internal message queue (e.g., Kafka, Redis) to influence workflow execution.
                * Attackers insert specially crafted messages into the message queue to trigger unintended workflow executions or manipulate data flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tamper with Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/tamper_with_messages__high-risk_path_node_.md)

Modify messages in the queue to alter workflow behavior or data.
                * Attackers intercept and modify messages within the queue to change the behavior of workflows or the data being processed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Conductor's Persistence Layer [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_conductor's_persistence_layer__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target the database used by Conductor to store its data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Database Access (if exposed) [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/direct_database_access__if_exposed___high-risk_path_start_.md)

Attackers attempt to directly access the Conductor database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Database Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_database_credentials__high-risk_path_node_.md)

Obtain database credentials and directly access/modify Conductor's data.
                * Attackers obtain valid credentials for the Conductor database and use them to directly access, modify, or exfiltrate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (if applicable in custom queries) [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__if_applicable_in_custom_queries___high-risk_path_node_.md)

Exploit potential SQL injection vulnerabilities if the application uses custom queries against Conductor's database.
                * If the application uses custom SQL queries against the Conductor database without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Conductor's Operational Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_conductor's_operational_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

Attackers exploit misconfigurations or deficiencies in how Conductor is deployed and managed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Proper Security Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_proper_security_configuration__high-risk_path_start_.md)

Conductor is deployed with insecure settings or insufficient access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Settings [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_settings__high-risk_path_node_.md)

Exploit overly permissive access controls within Conductor.
                * Attackers exploit overly broad permissions granted to users or services within Conductor, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Monitoring and Logging Deficiencies [CRITICAL NODE - Enabling Other Attacks]](./attack_tree_paths/monitoring_and_logging_deficiencies__critical_node_-_enabling_other_attacks_.md)

Lack of adequate monitoring and logging hinders detection and response to attacks.
