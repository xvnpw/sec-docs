# Threat Model Analysis for conductor-oss/conductor

## Threat: [Workflow Definition Injection](./threats/workflow_definition_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the Conductor workflow definition parsing or storage mechanisms to inject malicious code or logic into a workflow definition. This could involve crafting a workflow definition with embedded scripts or commands that are executed when the workflow is processed by Conductor or its workers.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on the Conductor server or worker nodes, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Workflow Definition Parser, Workflow Execution Engine, potentially the underlying data store for workflow definitions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for workflow definitions.
* Enforce a schema for workflow definitions and validate against it.
* Consider using a secure workflow definition language or a sandboxed execution environment for tasks.
* Implement strong access controls on who can create and modify workflow definitions.
* Regularly audit workflow definitions for suspicious content.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Workflow Modification](./threats/unauthorized_workflow_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to modify existing workflow definitions within Conductor. This could be through compromised credentials, API vulnerabilities in Conductor, or insecure access controls within Conductor. The attacker could alter the workflow logic to manipulate data, disrupt processes, or introduce malicious steps.

**Impact:** Disruption of business processes orchestrated by Conductor, data corruption within workflows, unauthorized access to resources managed by workflows, or introduction of malicious functionality into running workflows.

**Affected Component:** Workflow Definition API (provided by Conductor), Workflow Definition Storage (managed by Conductor).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing and modifying workflow definitions within Conductor.
* Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) within Conductor to restrict access based on user roles.
* Implement audit logging within Conductor to track all changes to workflow definitions.
* Regularly review user permissions and access controls within Conductor.

## Threat: [Rogue Worker Registration and Execution](./threats/rogue_worker_registration_and_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker registers a malicious worker process with Conductor. This rogue worker, interacting directly with Conductor's worker registration mechanisms, could then be assigned legitimate tasks and execute malicious code, potentially exfiltrating data, manipulating task outcomes, or causing denial of service by consuming resources managed by Conductor.

**Impact:** Data breaches from tasks processed by the rogue worker, manipulation of workflow results managed by Conductor, denial of service by overwhelming Conductor's task assignment mechanisms, or compromise of systems the worker interacts with as part of Conductor workflows.

**Affected Component:** Worker Registration API (provided by Conductor), Task Assignment Logic (within Conductor).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for worker registration within Conductor.
* Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) to verify the identity of worker processes connecting to Conductor.
* Implement a mechanism within Conductor to verify the integrity and authenticity of worker code.
* Monitor worker activity reported to Conductor for suspicious behavior.
* Implement resource limits for worker processes managed by Conductor.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Conductor relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the Conductor instance itself.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on the Conductor server, denial of service of the Conductor service, or other security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability in Conductor's dependencies.

**Affected Component:** All Conductor components relying on vulnerable dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Conductor and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Implement vulnerability scanning for Conductor's dependencies and address identified issues promptly.
* Use dependency management tools to track and manage Conductor's dependencies.
