# Threat Model Analysis for conductor-oss/conductor

## Threat: [Malicious Workflow Definition Injection](./threats/malicious_workflow_definition_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (or through a vulnerability in the workflow definition creation process *within Conductor*) crafts a workflow definition containing malicious tasks or logic. This could involve tasks that execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt the system *through Conductor's execution mechanisms*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, denial of service on worker nodes, potential compromise of the Conductor server itself if the malicious workflow exploits server-side vulnerabilities *within Conductor*.
*   **Affected Component:** Workflow Definition Engine (within the Conductor server)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access control and authorization for creating and modifying workflow definitions *within Conductor*.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization for workflow definitions to prevent injection of malicious code or configurations *within Conductor*.
    *   Consider a review process for workflow definitions before deployment, especially for sensitive workflows.
    *   Employ a "least privilege" approach for tasks, limiting their access to necessary resources.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Worker Registration](./threats/unauthorized_worker_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a rogue worker with the Conductor server without proper authorization *through Conductor's worker registration process*. This rogue worker could be used to intercept tasks intended for legitimate workers, potentially stealing sensitive data or manipulating workflow execution *managed by Conductor*.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, manipulation of workflow execution, potential denial of service by claiming all available tasks *within Conductor*.
*   **Affected Component:** Worker Registration Module (within the Conductor server)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for worker registration *within Conductor*.
    *   Use secure secrets or certificates for worker authentication *with the Conductor server*.
    *   Implement a mechanism to verify the identity and legitimacy of workers before accepting tasks *within Conductor*.
    *   Monitor worker registration activity for unauthorized attempts.

## Threat: [API Access Control Bypass](./threats/api_access_control_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication or authorization checks on Conductor's REST APIs, gaining unauthorized access to manage workflows, tasks, or other administrative functions *within Conductor*. This could be due to flaws in the API implementation or misconfiguration *of Conductor's API security*.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the workflow engine, allowing for malicious workflow creation, task manipulation, and potential denial of service *within the Conductor ecosystem*.
*   **Affected Component:** Conductor REST API
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for all Conductor API endpoints (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys).
    *   Enforce granular authorization controls based on user roles and permissions *within Conductor's API security framework*.
    *   Regularly review and audit API access controls.
    *   Follow secure coding practices to prevent common API vulnerabilities *in Conductor's API implementation*.

## Threat: [Insecure Persistence Layer Access](./threats/insecure_persistence_layer_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying database or storage mechanism used by Conductor to store workflow definitions, task data, and other sensitive information *managed by Conductor*. This could be due to weak database credentials, misconfigurations *in Conductor's database connection*, or vulnerabilities in the database system.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential compromise of the entire Conductor system.
*   **Affected Component:** Conductor Persistence Layer (integration with database/storage)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the underlying database or storage system with strong authentication and authorization.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the persistence layer *used by Conductor*.
    *   Regularly patch and update the database system.
    *   Restrict network access to the database server.

## Threat: [Configuration File Exposure](./threats/configuration_file_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Conductor configuration files containing sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys *used by Conductor*) are exposed due to insecure storage or access controls.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially leading to compromise of the Conductor system or connected resources.
*   **Affected Component:** Conductor Server Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions *integrated with Conductor*.
    *   Implement proper file system permissions to protect configuration files.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files if necessary.
