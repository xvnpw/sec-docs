# Attack Surface Analysis for conductor-oss/conductor

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Conductor API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_conductor_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Conductor API Endpoints
    *   **Description:**  Conductor API endpoints that lack proper authentication or use weak authentication mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** Conductor exposes various API endpoints for managing workflows, tasks, and retrieving system information. If these endpoints are not secured correctly *within Conductor's configuration*, they become entry points for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use an unauthenticated Conductor API endpoint to trigger a workflow that performs malicious actions or retrieve sensitive workflow definitions stored *within Conductor*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by Conductor, manipulation of workflows orchestrated by Conductor, denial of service to Conductor services, and potential compromise of the underlying system *hosting Conductor*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Enforce authentication for all sensitive Conductor API endpoints. Utilize Conductor's built-in security features for API authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0). Regularly review and update Conductor's API authentication configurations. Implement strong authorization controls *within Conductor* to restrict access based on roles and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Conductor API](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_conductor_api.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Conductor API
    *   **Description:**  Conductor API endpoints failing to properly validate user-provided input, leading to vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** Conductor accepts various inputs through its API, such as workflow definitions, task parameters, and search queries. Lack of proper validation *within Conductor's API handling* can allow attackers to inject malicious code or commands.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious code into a workflow definition submitted via the Conductor API that gets executed by Conductor or a worker, potentially leading to remote code execution *within the Conductor environment or on worker nodes interacting with Conductor*. Another example is NoSQL injection if Conductor uses a NoSQL database and input received by the Conductor API is not sanitized before being used in queries.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Conductor server or worker nodes managed by Conductor, data corruption within Conductor's persistence layer, unauthorized data access to information managed by Conductor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation on all Conductor API endpoints. Sanitize and escape user-provided data *received by the Conductor API* before using it in database queries or executing commands. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements *when Conductor interacts with its database*. Follow secure coding practices *when developing Conductor integrations or extensions*.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Conductor UI](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_conductor_ui.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Conductor UI
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the Conductor UI that allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** Conductor UI displays data related to workflows and tasks *managed by Conductor*, potentially including user-provided information stored within Conductor. If this data is not properly sanitized before rendering *by the Conductor UI*, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject a malicious script into a workflow definition description stored in Conductor. When another user views this workflow in the Conductor UI, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on their behalf *within the context of the Conductor application*.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking of Conductor UI users, cookie theft related to the Conductor application, defacement of the Conductor UI, redirection to malicious websites from the Conductor interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for all user-provided data displayed in the Conductor UI. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources *within the Conductor UI*. Regularly update UI dependencies *used by the Conductor UI* to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Default or Weak Credentials for Conductor Components](./attack_surfaces/default_or_weak_credentials_for_conductor_components.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Default or Weak Credentials for Conductor Components
    *   **Description:**  Using default or easily guessable credentials for Conductor's administrative interfaces or internal components.
    *   **How Conductor Contributes:** If Conductor or its directly managed underlying components (e.g., its internal authentication system) are deployed with default credentials, attackers can easily gain unauthorized access *to Conductor itself*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could access the Conductor UI or internal administrative interfaces using default credentials, allowing them to control the entire Conductor system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Conductor instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure *hosting Conductor*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Users:** Immediately change all default credentials for Conductor components and related infrastructure upon deployment. Enforce strong password policies for all accounts *managing or accessing Conductor*. Regularly review and update credentials *used by Conductor*.
