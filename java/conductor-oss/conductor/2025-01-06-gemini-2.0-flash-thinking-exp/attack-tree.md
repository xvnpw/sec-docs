## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Workflow Definition Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_workflow_definition_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code into Workflow Definition
    *   Description: An attacker crafts a malicious workflow definition containing code that will be executed by Conductor or task workers.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Workflow Definition API
        *   Description: The Conductor API does not properly validate input when creating or updating workflow definitions, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads.
        *   Mitigation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all Conductor API endpoints related to workflow definitions.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability in Workflow Definition Parsing
        *   Description: Conductor uses an insecure deserialization mechanism when parsing workflow definitions, allowing an attacker to inject malicious objects that execute code upon deserialization.
        *   Mitigation: Ensure Conductor and its dependencies are up-to-date and patched against known deserialization vulnerabilities. Use secure serialization methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Task Definition Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_task_definition_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Code into Task Definition
    *   Description: An attacker crafts a malicious task definition containing code that will be executed by task workers.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Task Definition API
        *   Description: The Conductor API does not properly validate input when creating or updating task definitions, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads.
        *   Mitigation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all Conductor API endpoints related to task definitions.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability in Task Definition Parsing
        *   Description: Conductor uses an insecure deserialization mechanism when parsing task definitions, allowing an attacker to inject malicious objects that execute code upon deserialization.
        *   Mitigation: Ensure Conductor and its dependencies are up-to-date and patched against known deserialization vulnerabilities. Use secure serialization methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure API Endpoints](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_api_endpoints.md)

*   Attack Vector: Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Conductor APIs
    *   Description: An attacker leverages weaknesses in Conductor's authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions.
    *   Critical Node: Bypass Authentication to Access Sensitive APIs
        *   Description: The Conductor API fails to properly authenticate requests, allowing an attacker to access sensitive API endpoints without valid credentials.
        *   Mitigation: Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) for all Conductor API endpoints.
    *   Critical Node: Exploit Authorization Vulnerabilities to Perform Unauthorized Actions
        *   Description: The Conductor API does not properly enforce authorization rules, allowing an authenticated attacker to perform actions they are not permitted to perform.
        *   Mitigation: Implement granular role-based access control (RBAC) for Conductor APIs.
