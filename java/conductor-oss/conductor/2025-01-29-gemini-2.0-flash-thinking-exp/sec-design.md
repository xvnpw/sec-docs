# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Conductor, aims to provide a robust and scalable workflow orchestration engine. The primary business priority is to enable developers to build and manage complex, distributed applications by simplifying the orchestration of tasks and microservices. The goal is to increase development velocity, improve application resilience, and enhance observability of complex processes.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of workflow execution failures leading to business process disruptions.
- Risk of data integrity issues within workflows, potentially causing incorrect business outcomes.
- Risk of unauthorized access to workflow definitions and execution data, leading to data breaches or manipulation.
- Risk of performance bottlenecks in the workflow engine impacting application responsiveness and scalability.
- Risk of vendor lock-in if the project becomes heavily reliant on specific cloud provider services.

# SECURITY POSTURE

  - Requirement: Authorization should be enforced for all API endpoints and UI functionalities.
  - Requirement: Granular permissions should be configurable for workflow definitions, execution, and administrative tasks.
- Input validation:
  - Requirement: All user inputs, including workflow definitions, API requests, and UI inputs, must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
  - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.
  - Requirement: Use of parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest (e.g., workflow definitions, execution logs, secrets) must be encrypted.
  - Requirement: Secure communication channels (HTTPS) must be used for all API and UI traffic.
  - Requirement: Consider encryption of data in transit between Conductor components if communication happens over untrusted networks.
  - Requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.

    style C fill:#fcc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code, make changes, and commit them to a version control system.
2. Version Control System (GitHub):  GitHub hosts the source code repository. Code changes are pushed to GitHub, and pull requests are created for code review and merging.
3. CI/CD System (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used as the CI/CD system. Upon code push or pull request events, automated workflows are triggered.
4. Build, Test, Scan: The CI/CD pipeline performs the following steps:
    - Build: Compiles the code and builds the necessary artifacts (e.g., container images, binaries).
    - Test: Executes automated unit tests, integration tests, and other tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Scan: Performs security scans, including:
        - Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzes source code for potential vulnerabilities.
        - Dependency Scanning: Checks for known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
        - Container Image Scanning: Scans container images for vulnerabilities.
        - Code linters and formatters: Enforce code quality and style guidelines.
5. Build Artifacts (Container Images, Binaries):  The build process produces build artifacts, typically container images for microservices and binaries for other components.
6. Artifact Registry (Container Registry): Build artifacts are pushed to a secure artifact registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google GCR). This registry stores and manages container images and other build artifacts.
7. Deployment Environment (Kubernetes): The deployment process pulls container images from the artifact registry and deploys them to the Kubernetes cluster.
