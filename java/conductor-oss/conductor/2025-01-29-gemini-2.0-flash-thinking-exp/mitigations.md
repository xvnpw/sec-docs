## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Workflow Definition Validation and Review Process](./mitigation_strategies/implement_workflow_definition_validation_and_review_process.md)

### 1. Implement Workflow Definition Validation and Review Process

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Workflow Definition Validation and Review Process (Conductor Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Conductor's Workflow Definition Schema Validation (if available and configurable):** Check if Conductor offers built-in schema validation for workflow definitions. If so, configure and enforce it to ensure definitions adhere to a predefined structure.
    2.  **Develop Custom Validation Logic (if needed):** If Conductor's built-in validation is insufficient, develop custom validation logic that can be integrated into your workflow deployment pipeline. This logic should check for potentially insecure patterns or configurations within workflow definitions specific to Conductor's features (e.g., usage of specific task types, script tasks, or HTTP tasks).
    3.  **Establish a Security Review Process for Workflow Definitions (Conductor Context):**  Focus the security review process specifically on Conductor workflow definitions. Reviewers should understand Conductor's task types, expression language (if used), and potential security implications of different workflow constructs within Conductor.
    4.  **Version Control Workflow Definitions in Conductor's Context:** Manage workflow definitions as code within your version control system, treating them as critical application components within the Conductor ecosystem.
    5.  **Use Pull Requests for Workflow Definition Changes (Conductor Focused Review):**  When using pull requests for workflow definition changes, ensure reviewers are specifically looking for security issues related to Conductor workflows and their interactions with tasks and external systems *via Conductor*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Workflow Definition Injection via Conductor (High Severity):** Malicious actors injecting harmful code or logic into workflow definitions *within Conductor*, potentially leading to command execution by task workers orchestrated by Conductor, data breaches through Conductor workflows, or service disruption of Conductor-managed workflows.
    *   **Logic Flaws in Conductor Workflows (Medium Severity):** Unintentional errors or vulnerabilities in workflow logic *defined in Conductor* that could be exploited to bypass security controls *within the workflow orchestration*, manipulate data processed by Conductor, or cause unexpected behavior in Conductor-managed processes.
    *   **Unauthorized Workflow Modifications in Conductor (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized users modifying workflow definitions *directly within Conductor's management system* to introduce malicious changes or disrupt operations of workflows managed by Conductor.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Workflow Definition Injection via Conductor:** High risk reduction. Validation and review focused on Conductor-specific aspects significantly reduce the likelihood of injecting malicious code through workflow definitions managed by Conductor.
    *   **Logic Flaws in Conductor Workflows:** Medium risk reduction. Review process, when focused on Conductor workflow logic, helps identify potential flaws, but relies on reviewer expertise in Conductor and workflow security.
    *   **Unauthorized Workflow Modifications in Conductor:** High risk reduction. Version control and pull requests, applied to Conductor workflow definitions, ensure auditability and controlled changes within the Conductor environment.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Workflow definitions are stored in Git (Version Control - Conductor Context).
    *   Basic schema validation is in place for syntax correctness (Schema Validation - partially, needs Conductor focus).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized Security Review Process specifically for Conductor workflow definitions.
    *   Comprehensive and strict Workflow Definition Schema enforcing security best practices *relevant to Conductor features*.
    *   Automated Schema Validation integrated into the deployment pipeline *for Conductor workflows*.
    *   Pull Request requirement for all workflow definition changes *within the Conductor management process*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Workflow Definition Management (Conductor RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_workflow_definition_management__conductor_rbac_.md)

### 2. Restrict Access to Workflow Definition Management (Conductor RBAC)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Conductor Workflow Definition Management
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Conductor's Built-in RBAC (if available):** Explore and implement Conductor's built-in RBAC features, if any, to control access to workflow definition management functionalities within the Conductor UI and APIs.
    2.  **Integrate with External RBAC System (if Conductor supports):** If Conductor allows integration with external RBAC systems (like Keycloak, LDAP, or similar), leverage this to manage access to Conductor's workflow definition features centrally within your organization's identity and access management infrastructure.
    3.  **Define Conductor-Specific Roles:** Create roles specifically tailored to Conductor workflow management needs (e.g., "Conductor Workflow Viewer," "Conductor Workflow Editor," "Conductor Workflow Admin"). These roles should map to permissions within Conductor's workflow definition management features.
    4.  **Assign Roles to Users/Groups for Conductor Access:** Assign these Conductor-specific roles to users and groups based on their responsibilities related to workflow management *within Conductor*. Apply the principle of least privilege for access to Conductor's workflow definition features.
    5.  **Audit Conductor Access Logs:** Regularly review Conductor's access logs, specifically focusing on actions related to workflow definition management, to detect and investigate any unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities *within the Conductor platform*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Workflow Modifications via Conductor UI/API (Medium Severity):**  Users without proper authorization modifying or deleting workflow definitions *through Conductor's interfaces*, potentially causing disruption or introducing malicious changes to workflows managed by Conductor.
    *   **Insider Threats Exploiting Conductor Access (Medium Severity):** Malicious insiders with excessive privileges *within Conductor* abusing their access to manipulate workflows for malicious purposes *via Conductor's workflow management features*.
    *   **Accidental Workflow Corruption via Conductor UI (Low Severity):**  Accidental modifications by users without sufficient understanding of workflow definitions *using Conductor's UI*, leading to operational issues in Conductor-managed workflows.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Workflow Modifications via Conductor UI/API:** High risk reduction. RBAC within Conductor effectively prevents unauthorized users from making changes to workflow definitions *through Conductor's interfaces*.
    *   **Insider Threats Exploiting Conductor Access:** Medium risk reduction. RBAC within Conductor limits the potential damage an insider can cause by restricting their privileges *within the Conductor system*, but doesn't eliminate the insider threat entirely.
    *   **Accidental Workflow Corruption via Conductor UI:** Medium risk reduction. RBAC in Conductor reduces the likelihood of accidental changes by limiting editing access *within Conductor's UI* to trained personnel.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Basic user authentication is in place for Conductor UI (Conductor UI Authentication).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fine-grained RBAC for workflow definition management *within Conductor itself*.
    *   Clearly defined Conductor-specific roles and permissions for workflow management *within Conductor*.
    *   Integration with an external RBAC system for centralized user and role management *for Conductor access*.
    *   Auditing of workflow definition access and modification events *within Conductor's logs*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate Workflow Inputs (Conductor Workflow Context)](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate_workflow_inputs__conductor_workflow_context_.md)

### 3. Sanitize and Validate Workflow Inputs (Conductor Workflow Context)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization and Validation in Conductor Workflows
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Input Schemas for Conductor Workflows and Tasks (within Conductor):**  Utilize Conductor's features (if available) to define input schemas directly within workflow and task definitions *in Conductor*. This makes input expectations explicit within the workflow orchestration itself.
    2.  **Implement Input Validation at Conductor Workflow Start:**  Leverage Conductor's capabilities (e.g., pre-processing tasks, input transformers) to implement input validation *at the very beginning of each workflow execution within Conductor*. Reject workflow executions with invalid inputs *as determined by Conductor's validation mechanisms*.
    3.  **Implement Input Sanitization within Conductor Tasks (if applicable):** If Conductor offers features for input transformation or pre-processing within task definitions, use these to sanitize inputs *as they are passed to tasks by Conductor*. This could involve using Conductor's expression language or built-in functions to sanitize data.
    4.  **Avoid Passing Unsanitized User Inputs Directly to Task Workers from Conductor:**  Design workflows so that Conductor itself handles initial input validation and sanitization before passing data to task workers. This reduces the burden on individual task workers to perform redundant input handling and centralizes input security within the workflow orchestration layer.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection via Conductor Workflow Inputs (High Severity):**  Attackers injecting malicious commands into workflow inputs that are then passed by Conductor to task workers and executed, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control of systems *orchestrated by Conductor*.
    *   **Script Injection via Conductor Workflow Inputs (High Severity):** Attackers injecting malicious scripts into workflow inputs that are passed by Conductor to task workers and executed, leading to similar consequences as command injection *within the Conductor-managed workflow execution*.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Conductor Workflows (Medium Severity):**  Invalid or malformed inputs passed to Conductor workflows causing unexpected behavior, data corruption *within the workflow execution flow managed by Conductor*, or application errors *within the Conductor-orchestrated process*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection via Conductor Workflow Inputs:** High risk reduction. Input validation and sanitization *at the Conductor workflow level* are crucial in preventing command injection attacks originating from workflow inputs managed by Conductor.
    *   **Script Injection via Conductor Workflow Inputs:** High risk reduction. Similar to command injection, input validation and sanitization *within Conductor workflows* are effective in mitigating script injection threats originating from workflow inputs handled by Conductor.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Conductor Workflows:** Medium risk reduction. Input validation *enforced by Conductor* ensures data conforms to expected formats as it enters workflows, reducing the likelihood of data integrity problems *within Conductor-managed processes*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Some basic input validation is performed in certain tasks (Input Validation - partially, needs to be moved to Conductor level).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive input schemas defined for all workflows and tasks *within Conductor definitions*.
    *   Automated input validation *at Conductor workflow start*, leveraging Conductor's features.
    *   Robust input sanitization implemented *within Conductor workflow definitions* where possible.
    *   Workflow design focused on Conductor handling initial input validation before passing data to workers.

### 4. Secure Task Input and Output Handling (Conductor Context)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Task Input/Output Handling via Conductor
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Sensitive Data in Task Outputs Visible in Conductor UI/API:** Configure Conductor workflows and tasks to avoid including sensitive information in task outputs that are directly visible through Conductor's UI or API. Redact or mask sensitive data in task outputs *before they are stored or displayed by Conductor*.
    2.  **Control Access to Task Output Logs within Conductor (if applicable):** If Conductor provides access to task output logs, implement RBAC to restrict access to these logs *within the Conductor platform*. Only authorized personnel should be able to view logs containing potentially sensitive information *accessible through Conductor*.
    3.  **Encrypt Sensitive Data Passed as Task Inputs/Outputs via Conductor (if applicable):** If Conductor offers features for encrypting data passed between workflow steps or to task workers, utilize these features to encrypt sensitive data in transit *within the Conductor orchestration flow*.
    4.  **Secure Storage for Task Outputs Managed by Conductor (if applicable):** If Conductor manages the storage of task outputs, ensure that this storage is secure, with appropriate access controls and encryption *as configured within Conductor or its storage backend*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Task Outputs/Logs via Conductor UI/API (Medium to High Severity):** Sensitive information inadvertently exposed in task outputs or logs *accessible through Conductor's UI or API*, potentially leading to data breaches or compliance violations due to information visible within Conductor.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data via Conductor UI/API (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive data stored in task outputs or logs *through Conductor's interfaces* due to inadequate access controls *within Conductor*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure in Task Outputs/Logs via Conductor UI/API:** High risk reduction. Minimizing sensitive data in Conductor-visible outputs, redacting, and controlling access *within Conductor* significantly reduces exposure risk through Conductor's interfaces.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data via Conductor UI/API:** High risk reduction. RBAC *within Conductor* prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data accessible through Conductor's UI and API.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   HTTPS is used for communication to Conductor API (Encryption in Transit - partially, needs to be leveraged within Conductor workflows if possible).
