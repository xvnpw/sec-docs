# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for conductor-oss/conductor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Workflow Definition Schema Validation](./mitigation_strategies/workflow_definition_schema_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a JSON Schema:** Create a comprehensive JSON schema that precisely defines the allowed structure, data types, and constraints for your workflow definitions within Conductor. This schema should cover all aspects of workflow definitions, including tasks, inputs, outputs, and workflow logic as understood by Conductor.
    2.  **Integrate Validation Library:** Incorporate a JSON schema validation library (e.g., ajv, jsonschema) into your application's workflow definition ingestion process that interacts with Conductor. This library will be used to programmatically validate definitions before they are sent to Conductor.
    3.  **Implement Validation Check:**  Before submitting any new or updated workflow definition to Conductor, execute a validation check using the chosen library and your defined schema.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Definitions:** If a workflow definition fails validation against the schema, reject it *before* sending it to Conductor. Provide informative error messages to the user or system attempting to upload the definition, detailing the validation failures. Log these rejections for audit purposes.
    5.  **Schema Versioning and Updates:** Implement a versioning system for your workflow definition schema used for Conductor.  When updating the schema, ensure backward compatibility or provide a migration path for existing workflows within Conductor. Regularly review and update the schema to reflect evolving workflow requirements and security considerations relevant to Conductor.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Workflow Injection (High Severity):** Attackers injecting malicious code or logic by crafting workflow definitions with unexpected structures or data types that Conductor might misinterpret or execute in unintended ways.
        *   **Workflow Definition Tampering (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized modification of workflow definitions leading to unexpected or harmful behavior within Conductor due to schema deviations.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Workflows processed by Conductor using incorrect or unexpected data types due to malformed definitions, potentially leading to application errors or security vulnerabilities within the Conductor environment and downstream systems.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Workflow Injection:** High Reduction - Significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing injection of unexpected code through workflow definitions processed by Conductor.
        *   **Workflow Definition Tampering:** Medium Reduction - Makes it harder to tamper with definitions in a way that bypasses intended structure and logic within Conductor.
        *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium Reduction - Improves data integrity by ensuring workflow definitions processed by Conductor adhere to expected data types and structures.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented. Basic schema validation is in place for core workflow parameters in the workflow definition API endpoint using a custom validation function. This validation is performed before interacting with Conductor.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to migrate to a robust JSON schema validation library for comprehensive validation before interacting with Conductor.
        *   Schema validation needs to be extended to cover task definitions, complex workflow logic, and input/output specifications within definitions that are understood and processed by Conductor.
        *   Automated schema update and enforcement process is not fully implemented; schema updates are currently manual and need to be consistently applied to validation processes interacting with Conductor.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Digitally Sign Workflow Definitions](./mitigation_strategies/digitally_sign_workflow_definitions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Signing Process:**  Implement a process for digitally signing workflow definitions after they are created and approved, before they are submitted to Conductor. This process should involve using a private key to generate a digital signature for the workflow definition content.
    2.  **Store Signatures Securely:** Store the digital signatures alongside the workflow definitions, ideally in a secure and tamper-proof manner, before they are ingested by Conductor. Consider storing signatures in a separate, auditable storage location.
    3.  **Implement Signature Verification:**  Before Conductor processes a workflow definition, implement a verification step. This step uses the corresponding public key to verify the digital signature against the workflow definition content *before* Conductor attempts to execute it.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Signatures:** If the signature verification fails, reject the workflow definition *before* it reaches Conductor's execution engine. Log the verification failure and prevent the workflow from being executed by Conductor.
    5.  **Key Management:** Implement secure key management practices for the private key used for signing and the public key used for verification of workflow definitions intended for Conductor. Rotate keys periodically and protect the private key from unauthorized access.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Workflow Definition Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification of workflow definitions after they are approved, ensuring integrity of workflows executed by Conductor.
        *   **Workflow Definition Spoofing (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers injecting completely fabricated workflow definitions into Conductor by verifying the origin and authenticity.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Workflow Definition Tampering:** High Reduction -  Provides strong assurance of workflow definition integrity for workflows processed by Conductor, making tampering easily detectable.
        *   **Workflow Definition Spoofing:** Medium Reduction -  Significantly increases the difficulty of injecting spoofed workflows into Conductor by requiring a valid signature.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to design and implement a digital signature generation and verification process for workflow definitions intended for Conductor.
        *   Secure key management infrastructure needs to be established for signing and verification keys used in conjunction with Conductor.
        *   Integration with the workflow definition API and Conductor processing engine is required to enforce signature verification before workflow execution within Conductor.

    3.  **Restrict Access:**  Grant users and systems only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles when interacting with Conductor's workflow definitions. For example, developers might have "Workflow Creator" role, while only designated personnel have "Workflow Approver" or "Workflow Admin" roles within the context of Conductor.  Read-only access to Conductor workflow definitions should be granted where appropriate.
    4.  **Regularly Review Access:** Periodically review user roles and permissions related to Conductor workflow definition management to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Revoke access to Conductor workflow management features when it is no longer needed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to extend RBAC to fully cover Conductor's API endpoints related to workflow definition management.
        *   Fine-grained permissions need to be defined for different workflow definition operations within Conductor (create, read, update, delete).
        *   Integration with a centralized identity and access management (IAM) system is needed for consistent user and role management when interacting with Conductor.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   HTTPS is enabled for API communication with Conductor, but TLS/SSL may not be consistently enforced for all internal communication channels between Conductor components. TLS configuration may not be using the strongest cipher suites for Conductor communication.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to enforce TLS/SSL for all internal communication channels between Conductor servers, databases, message queues, and task workers when related to Conductor data and operations.
        *   Review and strengthen TLS configuration to use only strong cipher suites and protocols across all Conductor-related channels.
        *   Implement automated certificate renewal and management processes for all TLS certificates used for Conductor communication.
        *   Evaluate and potentially implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for highly sensitive communication channels involving Conductor.
