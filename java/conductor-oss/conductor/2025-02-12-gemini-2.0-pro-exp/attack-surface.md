# Attack Surface Analysis for conductor-oss/conductor

## Attack Surface: [1. Workflow Definition Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__workflow_definition_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to create, modify, or delete workflow definitions *via the Conductor API or persistence layer*.
*   **Conductor Contribution:** Conductor's core functionality is defining and executing workflows. The API and persistence layer are *provided by Conductor* for managing these definitions.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Conductor API and creates a workflow that executes a shell script (within a *poorly configured* worker - but the ability to *create* the workflow is the Conductor issue). Alternatively, they modify an existing workflow to exfiltrate data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary code execution (indirectly, via malicious workflows).
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Business logic bypass.
    *   System compromise (indirectly).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust authentication (OAuth 2.0, API keys with *fine-grained* permissions) and authorization (RBAC) for the Conductor API.  MFA for administrative access. This is *Conductor's* API.
    *   **Input Validation:**  *Conductor itself* should strictly validate all workflow definitions. Use schema validation (JSON Schema) to enforce structure and content. Reject non-conforming definitions.
    *   **Audit Logging:**  *Conductor* should log all changes to workflow definitions, including who made the change and when.
    *   **Least Privilege (Conductor Server):** The Conductor server process should run with minimal privileges. It should not have root/admin access.
    *   **Immutability (Consideration):** Explore making workflow definitions immutable after deployment, preventing modifications without a formal process.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unauthorized Task Execution](./attack_surfaces/2__unauthorized_task_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers directly trigger the execution of tasks *via the Conductor API*, bypassing workflow logic.
*   **Conductor Contribution:** Conductor's API *provides* endpoints for direct task manipulation and execution.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a Conductor API endpoint that allows starting a task directly. They use this to bypass workflow controls.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Bypass of business logic and security controls.
    *   Unauthorized actions.
    *   Potential data issues (depending on the task).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **API Authentication & Authorization:**  Strictly control access to *Conductor's* API endpoints for task manipulation. Use strong authentication and authorization (as above).
    *   **Rate Limiting:** *Conductor* should implement rate limiting on task execution API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [3. Unauthenticated/Unauthorized API Access](./attack_surfaces/3__unauthenticatedunauthorized_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers access the *Conductor API* without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Conductor Contribution:** Conductor *provides* the REST API. Its security is a direct Conductor responsibility.
*   **Example:** The Conductor API is deployed without authentication. An attacker can directly access the API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete control over Conductor.
    *   All impacts of workflow manipulation and unauthorized task execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication:**  Enforce authentication for *all* Conductor API endpoints. No unauthenticated access.
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Use OAuth 2.0, JWT, or strong API keys.
    *   **Authorization (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to restrict API access based on roles.
    *   **TLS/SSL:**  Always use TLS/SSL (HTTPS) for the *Conductor API*.
