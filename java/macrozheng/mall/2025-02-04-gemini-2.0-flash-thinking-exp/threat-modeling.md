Successful access grants full administrative control.
*   **Impact:** Full platform compromise, data breaches (customer, product, order data), financial fraud, website defacement, denial of service, complete loss of business operation control.
*   **Affected Component:** Admin Panel Module, Authentication System (specifically admin authentication within `mall`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately change default admin credentials upon deployment.
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts.
    *   Mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin accounts.
    *   Implement robust account lockout policies after failed login attempts to the admin panel.
    *   Regular security audits focusing on admin panel access controls.
    *   Consider IP address whitelisting for admin panel access.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in User Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_user_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit weaknesses in `mall`'s user authentication implementation, such as flawed password hashing, session management vulnerabilities (specific to `mall`'s code), or lack of account lockout for user accounts. Exploitation methods could include credential stuffing, phishing attacks targeting `mall` users, or exploiting coding errors in `mall`'s authentication logic.
*   **Impact:** Widespread user account takeover, unauthorized access to user data (personal information, order history, potentially payment details if mishandled by `mall`), fraudulent orders placed using compromised accounts, significant reputational damage and loss of customer trust.
*   **Affected Component:** User Registration Module, Login Module, Session Management (specifically user authentication within `mall`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize strong and salted password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) within `mall`'s user authentication.
    *   Implement secure session management practices, including HTTP-only and Secure flags for cookies, and session ID regeneration after login within `mall`.
    *   Generate cryptographically secure, unpredictable session IDs specific to `mall`.
    *   Implement account lockout policies after failed login attempts for user accounts.
    *   Consider rate limiting login attempts to protect against brute-force attacks.
    *   Encourage users to adopt strong, unique passwords.
    *   Offer and promote multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization Checks in E-commerce Workflows](./threats/insufficient_authorization_checks_in_e-commerce_workflows.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could bypass authorization checks within `mall`'s application code to access or modify resources or perform actions beyond their authorized scope. This might involve manipulating API requests specific to `mall`'s API structure, URL parameters in `mall`'s web application, or exploiting logic flaws in `mall`'s authorization implementation to access sensitive e-commerce data or functions. For example, accessing another user's order details or manipulating order status if authorization is not correctly enforced in `mall`'s code.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive e-commerce data (other users' orders, personal information, potentially admin-level data if authorization is broadly flawed), ability to perform unauthorized actions (e.g., modifying orders, accessing admin-like functions if authorization is weak across `mall`'s modules), business logic bypass leading to financial loss or data corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Order Management Module, User Profile Module, Shopping Cart Module, API Endpoints (specifically authorization logic within `mall`'s components)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization checks at every layer of `mall`'s application (controller, service, data access layers).
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when defining roles and permissions within `mall`.
    *   Thoroughly validate user roles and permissions before granting access to any resource or action within `mall`.
    *   Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing specifically focused on authorization logic within `mall`.
    *   Utilize a well-defined and tested authorization framework or library within the `mall` project.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Customer Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_customer_data.md)

*   **Description:** If attackers gain unauthorized access to the database or storage systems used by `mall`, they could access sensitive customer data if it is not adequately secured within `mall`'s data storage implementation. This could result from a lack of encryption at rest in `mall`'s database setup, weak access controls to the database specifically within `mall`'s infrastructure, or vulnerabilities in how `mall` manages database connections and credentials.
*   **Impact:** Large-scale data breaches, severe privacy violations, significant regulatory fines (GDPR, CCPA, etc.), major reputational damage, legal liabilities, identity theft affecting a large customer base.
*   **Affected Component:** Database (specifically how `mall` interacts with and stores data in the database), User Data Storage, Order Data Storage, Customer Profile Module (data handling within `mall` modules)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong encryption for sensitive data at rest within `mall`'s database and storage systems (database-level encryption, file system encryption if applicable).
    *   Enforce strict access controls to the database and storage systems, limiting access based on the principle of least privilege, specifically for `mall`'s database access.
    *   Regularly audit access to sensitive data stored by `mall`.
    *   Mask or pseudonymize sensitive data in non-production environments and logs related to `mall`.
    *   Ensure full compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) in how `mall` handles and stores data.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Payment Information (if directly handled by mall)](./threats/insecure_handling_of_payment_information__if_directly_handled_by_mall_.md)

*   **Description:** If `macrozheng/mall` is designed to directly handle payment card details (which is strongly discouraged and a major design flaw for an e-commerce platform), vulnerabilities in this handling process within `mall`'s code could lead to the exposure of highly sensitive payment information. This could stem from insecure storage of payment data by `mall`, logging of payment details by `mall`, or vulnerabilities in `mall`'s payment processing code itself.
*   **Impact:** Catastrophic financial loss, devastating reputational damage, severe legal liabilities, PCI DSS compliance violations leading to significant penalties and inability to process payments, complete erosion of customer trust and business viability.
*   **Affected Component:** Payment Processing Module (if directly handled by `mall` code), Order Processing Module (payment flow within `mall`)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolutely avoid direct handling of payment card details within `mall`'s code.**
    *   **Mandatory integration with PCI DSS compliant payment gateways and completely offload payment processing to these secure third-party services.**
    *   If, against best practices, direct handling is attempted, implement extremely strict PCI DSS compliant security controls throughout `mall`'s payment processing flow.
    *   Never store sensitive payment data persistently within `mall`'s systems unless absolutely unavoidable and then only with extremely strong encryption and security measures exceeding industry best practices.
    *   Conduct extremely rigorous and frequent security audits of any payment processing components within `mall` if direct handling is attempted.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through API Endpoints](./threats/data_leakage_through_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit poorly designed or insecurely implemented API endpoints exposed by `mall` to extract sensitive data. This could be due to excessive data exposure in API responses from `mall`'s APIs, lack of proper authorization on API endpoints specific to `mall`'s API design, API enumeration vulnerabilities in `mall`'s API structure, or insecure API design patterns used within `mall`.
*   **Impact:** Large-scale data breaches, privacy violations, unauthorized access to business-critical information (product data, sales data, customer behavior data, etc.), competitive disadvantage due to leaked business intelligence, potential for further attacks based on leaked information.
*   **Affected Component:** API Endpoints (design and implementation of `mall`'s APIs), API Gateway (if used by `mall`), Backend Services (data retrieval and exposure logic within `mall`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization and authentication for all API endpoints exposed by `mall`.
    *   Adhere to secure API design principles, including the principle of least privilege for data exposure in API responses from `mall`.
    *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting `mall`'s API endpoints.
    *   Implement rate limiting and thorough input validation for all API requests to `mall`.
    *   Utilize API gateways to manage, monitor, and secure `mall`'s APIs.
    *   Regularly review and minimize the amount of sensitive data exposed through API responses.
