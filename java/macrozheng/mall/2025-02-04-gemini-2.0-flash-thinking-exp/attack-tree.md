## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Web Application Vulnerabilities (Mall Core Application):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_web_application_vulnerabilities__mall_core_application_.md)

*   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**
    *   Weak Password Policies and Brute-Force Attacks: Attackers attempt to guess user passwords due to weak password requirements or lack of account lockout mechanisms.
    *   Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in API endpoints: Attackers manipulate API parameters to access resources belonging to other users, such as order details or personal information, due to insufficient authorization checks.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to gain administrative privileges from a regular user account, allowing them to control the entire application.

*   **Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
    *   SQL Injection: Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete database takeover. This can occur in product search, order processing, user management, or any other area interacting with the database.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored or Reflected: Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application that are executed in users' browsers. Stored XSS occurs when the script is permanently stored (e.g., in product descriptions), while reflected XSS is triggered by malicious links or forms. XSS can lead to account hijacking, session theft, or defacement.

*   **API Vulnerabilities (Mall APIs for frontend and potentially external integrations):**
    *   Insecure API Endpoints: Attackers access API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization, allowing them to bypass security controls and access sensitive data or functionalities.
    *   Parameter Tampering: Attackers manipulate API request parameters to bypass security checks or alter application behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Backend System Vulnerabilities (Databases, Caches, Message Queues, Search):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_backend_system_vulnerabilities__databases__caches__message_queues__search_.md)

*   **Database Vulnerabilities (MySQL):**
    *   SQL Injection (Direct Database Access): If the database is directly accessible (e.g., due to misconfiguration or network exposure), attackers can directly attempt SQL injection attacks.
    *   Weak Database Credentials: Attackers gain access to the database using default or easily guessable passwords for database accounts.
    *   Unauthenticated Access to Database: If MySQL is exposed without proper firewall rules or access controls, attackers can connect directly without authentication.

*   **Redis Vulnerabilities (Caching Layer):**
    *   Unauthenticated Access to Redis: Attackers connect to Redis instances that are not configured with authentication, allowing them to read, modify, or delete cached data, potentially impacting application behavior or session management.

*   **Elasticsearch Vulnerabilities (Search Functionality):**
    *   Unauthenticated Access to Elasticsearch: Attackers access Elasticsearch clusters that are not configured with authentication, allowing them to access indexed data, potentially leading to data breaches or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Configuration and Deployment Weaknesses (Related to Mall Setup):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_configuration_and_deployment_weaknesses__related_to_mall_setup_.md)

*   **Default Credentials:**
    *   Using default passwords for database, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, admin panels: Attackers exploit default usernames and passwords that are not changed during deployment for critical systems, gaining unauthorized access.

*   **Exposed Admin Panels or Debug Interfaces:** Attackers discover and access administrative panels or debug interfaces that are unintentionally exposed to the internet or internal networks without proper authentication, granting them control over the application or system.

*   **Outdated Software Versions:**
    *   Outdated Software Versions (Spring Boot, libraries, backend systems with known vulnerabilities): Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Spring Boot, libraries, or backend systems that are not regularly patched and updated.

*   **Insecure Deployment Practices:**
    *   Exposing backend services (MySQL, Redis, etc.) directly to the internet: Attackers directly access backend services like databases or caches that are mistakenly exposed to the internet without proper network segmentation or access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Libraries used by Mall):](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__libraries_used_by_mall_.md)

*   **Vulnerable Spring Boot Version:**
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the specific Spring Boot version used by `mall`: Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Spring Boot used by the `mall` project if it is outdated and vulnerable.

*   **Vulnerable Dependency Libraries:**
    *   Identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in other libraries used by `mall`: Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in other third-party libraries used by the `mall` project that are outdated or have known security flaws.

*   **Outdated or Unpatched Libraries:**
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated versions of libraries that have known patches available: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in outdated versions of libraries for which security patches are already available but have not been applied to the `mall` application.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Business Logic Flaws (Specific to E-commerce Functionality):](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_business_logic_flaws__specific_to_e-commerce_functionality_.md)

*   **Price Manipulation:**
    *   Modifying product prices during checkout: Attackers manipulate requests during the checkout process to alter product prices to their advantage, potentially by intercepting and modifying network traffic or API requests.
    *   Exploiting discounts or promotions logic to gain unauthorized discounts: Attackers abuse flaws in the discount or promotion logic to obtain discounts they are not entitled to, potentially by manipulating parameters, guessing codes, or exploiting logic errors.

*   **Coupon/Promotion Abuse:**
    *   Generating or guessing valid coupon codes without authorization: Attackers attempt to generate or guess valid coupon codes if the code generation logic is predictable or brute-forceable, allowing them to obtain unauthorized discounts.
    *   Using coupons beyond their intended limits or conditions: Attackers bypass or exploit weaknesses in the coupon usage limits or conditions, allowing them to use coupons more times than intended or under unauthorized circumstances.

*   **Gift Card/Voucher Fraud:**
    *   Generating or guessing valid gift card codes: Attackers attempt to generate or guess valid gift card codes if the code generation logic is predictable or brute-forceable, allowing them to obtain unauthorized funds or discounts.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in gift card redemption logic: Attackers exploit flaws in the gift card redemption process to redeem gift cards multiple times, bypass redemption limits, or manipulate the redemption value.
