#### 4.2 Potential Vulnerabilities and Attack Scenarios

Within each component identified above, several types of business logic flaws can arise. Here are some potential vulnerabilities and corresponding attack scenarios:

**4.2.1 Product Price Management Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Negative Price Manipulation:**  Lack of proper validation allowing administrators or attackers (if access control is compromised) to set negative product prices.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits an admin panel vulnerability or a misconfiguration to set a negative price for a product. When a user "purchases" this product, the system might incorrectly calculate a negative order total, potentially leading to the attacker receiving funds from the platform.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Incorrect Tiered Pricing Logic:** Flaws in the logic implementing tiered pricing, leading to incorrect price application based on quantity.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits a flaw in tiered pricing logic. For example, buying a large quantity might unintentionally trigger a lower price tier meant for even larger quantities, resulting in a significantly reduced price.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Currency Conversion Errors:**  Incorrect handling of currency conversion rates or rounding errors leading to price discrepancies.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits currency conversion errors. For example, by manipulating the currency selection during checkout, they might be able to purchase products at a lower price due to incorrect conversion calculations.

**4.2.2 Discount Management Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Discount Stacking/Abuse:**  Lack of proper controls allowing multiple discounts to be stacked in unintended ways, leading to excessive discounts.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker finds a way to combine multiple discount codes or promotions that were not intended to be used together. This could result in extremely low prices or even free products. For example, combining a percentage discount, a fixed amount discount, and a category discount on the same item.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Bypass Discount Requirements:**  Flaws in the logic that checks if discount requirements (e.g., minimum purchase amount, specific products) are met.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker bypasses discount requirements. For example, they might manipulate API requests or browser data to trick the system into applying a discount even if the minimum purchase amount is not reached or the required products are not in the cart.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Expired Discount Exploitation:**  Failure to properly deactivate or enforce expiration dates for discounts.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits expired discounts. They might find a way to reactivate expired discount codes or manipulate timestamps to make the system believe a discount is still valid, even after its intended expiration date.

**4.2.3 Coupon Code Management Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Multiple Coupon Redemption:**  Lack of proper enforcement of single-use coupon codes, allowing attackers to redeem the same coupon multiple times.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker redeems a single-use coupon code multiple times. This could be achieved by using different accounts, manipulating session data, or exploiting race conditions in the coupon redemption process.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Coupon Code Guessing/Brute-forcing:**  Weak coupon code generation algorithms making it possible to guess or brute-force valid coupon codes.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker attempts to guess or brute-force coupon codes. If the coupon code generation algorithm is predictable or uses a small keyspace, an attacker might be able to generate valid coupon codes without legitimate access.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Coupon Code Parameter Manipulation:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how coupon code parameters (e.g., discount value, target products) are processed.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker manipulates coupon code parameters. For example, they might modify API requests to change the discount value associated with a coupon code, effectively increasing the discount beyond its intended value.

**4.2.4 Promotional Campaign Management Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Promotion Overlap Exploitation:**  Unintended interactions or overlaps between different promotional campaigns leading to excessive discounts or unintended free items.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits promotion overlaps. For example, they might find a combination of promotions that, when applied together, result in products being offered for free or at a significantly reduced price due to unintended interactions between promotion rules.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Time-Based Promotion Bypass:**  Circumventing time-based restrictions on promotional campaigns.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker bypasses time-based promotion restrictions. They might manipulate their system clock or exploit time zone discrepancies to access promotional offers outside of their intended valid hours.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Promotion Rule Manipulation via Admin Panel:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the admin panel to modify promotion rules in a way that benefits the attacker.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker compromises administrator credentials or exploits an admin panel vulnerability to modify promotion rules. They might change promotion conditions to make them overly generous or apply them to unintended products, benefiting themselves or other attackers.

**4.2.5 Shopping Cart and Checkout Logic Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Client-Side Price Manipulation:**  Reliance on client-side calculations for price and discount application, allowing attackers to manipulate prices in their browser.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker manipulates client-side price calculations. If the system relies on client-side JavaScript to calculate prices and apply discounts, an attacker can modify the code in their browser to alter the displayed price and potentially bypass server-side validation if it is insufficient.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Race Conditions in Discount Application:**  Race conditions in the process of applying discounts or coupons, leading to inconsistent or incorrect price calculations.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits race conditions in discount application. By sending concurrent requests during the checkout process, they might be able to trigger race conditions that lead to discounts being applied multiple times or in unintended ways, resulting in a lower price.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Inconsistent Price Persistence:**  Discrepancies between the price displayed in the cart/checkout and the price stored with the final order, potentially allowing attackers to pay a lower price than intended.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker exploits inconsistent price persistence. They might manipulate the price displayed in the cart or checkout, and if the server-side validation is weak or inconsistent, the system might incorrectly persist the manipulated price with the order, allowing the attacker to purchase the product at a lower price.

**4.2.6 Administrative Interface Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Vulnerability:** **Weak Authentication and Authorization:**  Compromised administrator credentials or insufficient access controls in admin panels allowing unauthorized access to pricing and promotion settings.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the admin panel due to weak authentication or authorization vulnerabilities. Once inside, they can directly manipulate pricing rules, discount codes, and promotional campaigns to their advantage.
*   **Vulnerability:** **Input Validation Failures in Admin Panels:**  Lack of proper input validation in admin panels allowing administrators to enter invalid or malicious data that leads to business logic flaws.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker (or even a negligent administrator) enters invalid data into admin panels due to lack of input validation. For example, entering extremely high discount percentages, negative prices, or malformed promotion rules can create business logic flaws that can be exploited.
