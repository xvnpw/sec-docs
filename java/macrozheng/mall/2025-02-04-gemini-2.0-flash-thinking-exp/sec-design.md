# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, "mall", is an e-commerce platform. The primary business goal is to enable online sales of products. This involves several key business priorities:

- Provide a user-friendly online shopping experience for customers.
- Efficiently manage product inventory and orders.
- Securely process payments.
- Ensure reliable and scalable platform operation.
- Protect customer data and privacy.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

- Data breaches leading to loss of customer data and financial information.
- System downtime resulting in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
- Fraudulent transactions causing financial losses and reputational damage.
- Supply chain disruptions impacting product availability and delivery.
- Regulatory non-compliance leading to fines and legal issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: HTTPS is likely used for communication, protecting data in transit. (Assumed based on common web application practices)
- security control: User authentication and authorization mechanisms are likely implemented within the application. (Assumed based on e-commerce platform functionality)
- security control: Database security measures are likely in place, such as access control and encryption at rest. (Assumed based on standard database security practices)

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies. (Common risk in software development, especially with extensive dependencies)
- accepted risk: Risk of insider threats, although mitigated by access controls. (Inherent risk in any organization with employees)
- accepted risk: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks impacting platform availability. (Common risk for public-facing web applications)

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
- security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools into the development pipeline.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for security monitoring and incident response.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and throttling to mitigate brute-force attacks and DDoS attempts.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism for customers and administrators.
    - requirement: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative accounts.
    - requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to resources.
    - requirement: Principle of least privilege applied to all users and services.
    - requirement: Secure API authorization to protect backend services.
- Input validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
    - requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to mitigate output-based vulnerabilities.
    - requirement: Validation of file uploads to prevent malicious file uploads.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - requirement: Secure key management practices for cryptographic keys.
    - requirement: Use of strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- Online product sales and order processing.
- Payment processing and financial transactions.
- Customer account management and personal data handling.
- Product catalog management and inventory control.
- Platform availability and operational continuity.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
    - Sensitivity: High. Includes names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, order history, and potentially payment information. Requires strict confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls to comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Payment Card Information (PCI):
    - Sensitivity: Critical. Includes credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVV codes. Requires the highest level of security controls to comply with PCI DSS standards and prevent financial fraud.
- Product Catalog Data:
    - Sensitivity: Medium. Includes product descriptions, images, prices, and inventory levels. Requires integrity and availability controls to ensure accurate product information and prevent data manipulation.
- Order Data:
    - Sensitivity: Medium. Includes order details, shipping addresses, and order history. Requires integrity and availability controls for order fulfillment and customer service.
- System Logs and Audit Trails:
    - Sensitivity: Medium. Includes system events, access logs, and audit trails. Requires integrity and availability controls for security monitoring, incident response, and compliance auditing.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the platform?
- What are the specific regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS)?
- What is the organization's risk appetite and security budget?
- Are there any existing security policies or standards that need to be followed?
- What are the specific third-party integrations required beyond payment gateway, inventory, logistics, search, and analytics?
- What is the expected team size and skill set for development and operations?
- What is the preferred cloud provider or deployment environment?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is online sales, and platform reliability and security are high priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security controls like HTTPS and user authentication are assumed to be in place. The organization is concerned about data breaches, system downtime, and compliance.
- DESIGN: The platform is designed as a microservices-based architecture, deployed in a cloud environment using Kubernetes. A typical CI/CD pipeline is used for build and deployment automation.
