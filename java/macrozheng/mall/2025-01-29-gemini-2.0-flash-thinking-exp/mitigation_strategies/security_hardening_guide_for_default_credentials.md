*   **Security Scanning and Auditing (Complementary):**  Recommend or integrate security scanning tools that can detect the use of default credentials in deployed `mall` instances, providing users with proactive feedback.
*   **Default Credentials Removal (Ideal but Potentially Disruptive):**  Ideally, components should not ship with default credentials at all. However, this might be a significant change for existing components and could break backward compatibility or initial setup processes. This is a long-term goal.

**Recommendation:** The Security Hardening Guide should be the primary mitigation strategy due to its feasibility and effectiveness. Complementary strategies like automated password generation and configuration management examples can be considered for further enhancing security and user experience.
