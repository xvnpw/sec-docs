**Affected Component:** `mall`'s Customer API Endpoints, `mall`'s API Gateway (if implemented as part of `mall`), `mall`'s Data Access Layer, `mall`'s Logging and Monitoring (if logs expose data due to `mall`'s logging practices).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization *for all `mall` API endpoints*.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing `mall` API responses (return only necessary data).
* Regularly audit `mall` API endpoints for security vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on data exposure.
* Use secure coding practices *within `mall` development* to prevent data leaks through APIs.

## Threat: [Insecure Admin Panel Access to `mall` Backend](./threats/insecure_admin_panel_access_to__mall__backend.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the admin panel of `mall` due to weak or default admin credentials *set up for `mall`*, lack of MFA *in `mall`'s admin login*, or publicly accessible admin panel URLs *due to `mall`'s deployment configuration*. This is specifically about securing the admin interface provided by `mall`. Once in, the attacker can perform administrative actions within `mall`, potentially compromising the entire e-commerce platform, including accessing sensitive data, modifying system configurations, and disrupting `mall` operations.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the `mall` platform, data breach of all data (customer, merchant, system) managed by `mall`, system downtime of the `mall` platform, reputational damage to the `mall` platform, significant financial loss for the `mall` platform operators and merchants.

**Affected Component:** `mall`'s Admin Panel Authentication, `mall`'s Admin Panel Authorization, `mall`'s Admin Panel Functionality, `mall`'s Backend System.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for admin accounts *within `mall`*.
* Mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin logins *to `mall`'s admin panel*.
* Restrict access to the `mall` admin panel to authorized IP addresses or networks *at the deployment level, but guided by `mall`'s architecture*.
* Regularly audit admin user accounts and permissions *within `mall`*.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems for `mall` admin panel access.
* Use a non-default and hard-to-guess URL for the `mall` admin panel *during deployment and configuration of `mall`*.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in `mall` Admin Panel Functionality](./threats/sql_injection_in__mall__admin_panel_functionality.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities in input fields within the `mall` admin panel. This is due to insufficient input sanitization or lack of parameterized queries *in the code of `mall`'s admin panel functionalities*. Successful SQL injection can allow the attacker to bypass authentication *in `mall`*, access or modify database data *managed by `mall`*, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server *underlying `mall`*. This is a direct vulnerability in `mall`'s code.

**Impact:** Data breach of data stored in `mall`'s database, data manipulation within `mall`'s system, potential system compromise of the server hosting `mall`, privilege escalation within `mall`, denial of service of the `mall` platform.
