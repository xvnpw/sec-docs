# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Hardening Guide for Default Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/security_hardening_guide_for_default_credentials.md)

### 1.  Provide Security Hardening Guide for Default Credentials

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Security Hardening Guide for Default Credentials
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Document Default Credentials Clearly:**  Within the `mall` project documentation, create a dedicated section explicitly listing all components that use default credentials in a standard `mall` deployment. This should include databases (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.), message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka), caching systems (Redis, Memcached), admin panels, and any other relevant services.
    2.  **Step-by-Step Password Change Instructions:** For each component listed, provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to change the default password. Include specific commands, configuration file locations, and UI paths where applicable.
    3.  **Emphasize Strong Password Practices:**  Stress the importance of using strong, unique passwords and recommend using password managers. Explain the risks of using default credentials.
    4.  **Make Guide Prominent:**  Ensure the security hardening guide is easily discoverable within the documentation, ideally linked from the main README and installation instructions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Default credentials are publicly known, allowing attackers to gain immediate access to sensitive systems.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Compromised systems can lead to data breaches, exposing customer and business data.
    *   **System Compromise (High Severity):** Attackers can gain control of servers and infrastructure.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for Unauthorized Access, Data Breach, and System Compromise. Makes it significantly easier for users to secure their deployments against a common vulnerability.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely **Partially Implemented**.  Basic documentation might exist, but a dedicated, comprehensive security hardening guide specifically for default credentials is probably missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Dedicated Security Hardening Guide Section:**  A clearly defined section in the documentation focused solely on security hardening, with a prominent subsection on default credentials.
    *   **Automated Password Change Scripts (Optional):**  Consider providing optional scripts or configuration examples to automate the password changing process for common components, making it even easier for users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Scanning Integration Guidance](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_scanning_integration_guidance.md)
