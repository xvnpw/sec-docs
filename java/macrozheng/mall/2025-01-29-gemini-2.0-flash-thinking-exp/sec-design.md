# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Primary goal is to establish and operate a successful online e-commerce platform (mall).
 - Key priorities include:
  - Attracting and retaining customers.
  - Providing a reliable and user-friendly shopping experience.
  - Processing transactions securely and efficiently.
  - Managing product inventory and orders effectively.
  - Scaling the platform to handle increasing traffic and sales volume.
 - For a fresh startup, the initial focus might be on rapid growth and market penetration, potentially accepting higher risks to achieve speed.
 - For an established Fortune 500 company, the focus would likely be on brand reputation, regulatory compliance, and minimizing risks, even if it means slower growth.

- Most Important Business Risks:
 - Data breach and loss of customer data (PII, payment information) leading to financial and reputational damage.
 - Platform unavailability or performance issues resulting in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
 - Fraudulent transactions and chargebacks impacting revenue and profitability.
 - Security vulnerabilities exploited by attackers leading to system compromise and data theft.
 - Supply chain disruptions affecting inventory and order fulfillment.
 - Regulatory non-compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) leading to fines and legal issues.
 - Brand damage due to negative security incidents or poor user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: HTTPS is likely used for communication encryption, although not explicitly stated in the repository description. (Assumed based on common web application practices).
 - security control: Input validation is likely implemented to some extent in the application code to prevent basic injection attacks. (Assumed based on common web application practices).
 - security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to manage user access and roles. (Assumed based on the nature of an e-commerce platform).

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies. (Common risk in software development, especially with large dependency trees).
 - accepted risk: Risk of insider threats, although specific controls are not mentioned. (General risk in any organization).
 - accepted risk: Some level of risk associated with cloud infrastructure if used, depending on the cloud provider's security posture and configuration. (Common risk when using cloud services).

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks (OWASP Top 10).
 - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.

  - Requirement: Support for strong passwords and potentially multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Requirement: Protection against brute-force attacks and account takeover attempts.
  - Requirement: Secure session management to maintain user sessions after successful authentication.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to resources.
  - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to limit user access to only necessary resources and functionalities.
  - Requirement: Secure API authorization to protect backend services from unauthorized access.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Comprehensive input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.).
  - Requirement: Input sanitization and encoding to neutralize potentially malicious input.
  - Requirement: Use of secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities related to input handling.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit (e.g., customer PII, payment information, passwords).
  - Requirement: Secure key management practices for cryptographic keys.
  - Requirement: Use of strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
