# Attack Surface Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application inputs, which is then executed by the database.
*   **Mall Contribution:** `mall`'s core functionality relies heavily on database interactions for product catalogs, user management, orders, and more. User inputs across the platform, from search bars to order forms, are potential injection points.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious product search query to bypass authentication and access admin panels or extract sensitive customer data from the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (customer PII, product information, admin credentials), data modification (price manipulation, order alteration), denial of service, potential server compromise leading to full system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Enforce the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements across the entire codebase for all database interactions.
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before database queries. Use whitelisting and context-aware escaping.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Access:** Configure database user accounts with minimal necessary permissions, limiting the impact of successful SQL injection.
        *   **Automated Security Scanning and Regular Penetration Testing:** Integrate automated static and dynamic security analysis tools into the development pipeline and conduct regular professional penetration testing to proactively identify and remediate SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts execute in the victim's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
*   **Mall Contribution:** `mall`'s e-commerce nature involves significant user-generated content like product reviews, forum discussions, user profiles, and potentially seller product descriptions. These are prime locations for XSS injection if not handled with strict security measures.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a product review. When other users view this product page, the script executes, stealing their session cookies and allowing the attacker to hijack their accounts.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, theft of sensitive user data (session cookies, personal information, payment details if improperly handled client-side), website defacement impacting brand reputation, potential malware distribution to customers.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Comprehensive Output Encoding:** Implement context-aware output encoding for all user-generated content displayed on the website. Use appropriate encoding methods (HTML entity encoding, JavaScript encoding, URL encoding) based on the output context.
        *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement and rigorously configure CSP headers to tightly control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, effectively mitigating many types of XSS attacks.
        *   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization (though output encoding is primary defense):** While output encoding is key, also implement input validation to reject or sanitize potentially malicious script inputs at the point of entry.
        *   **Regular Security Code Reviews and Penetration Testing:** Conduct thorough security code reviews focusing on XSS prevention and regular penetration testing to identify and remediate XSS vulnerabilities in all user-content areas.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_references__idor_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate predictable identifiers (like database IDs or file paths) to access resources they are not authorized to access.
*   **Mall Contribution:** `mall` manages numerous resources using IDs, including user orders, profiles, product details, shopping carts, and admin functionalities. Predictable IDs coupled with insufficient authorization checks create IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies the order ID in a URL from `order/123` to `order/124` and gains unauthorized access to another user's complete order details, including shipping address, purchased items, and payment information.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data (order history, personal details, payment information), potential data modification (order manipulation, profile changes), privilege escalation if admin resources are vulnerable.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Mandatory Server-Side Authorization Checks:** Implement strict and consistent server-side authorization checks *before* granting access to *any* resource based on user roles and permissions. Never rely on client-side checks.
        *   **Use Non-Predictable Object References (UUIDs/GUIDs):** Replace sequential, predictable IDs with universally unique identifiers (UUIDs or GUIDs) to make resource guessing significantly harder.
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation:** Implement a robust RBAC system to manage user permissions and enforce access control policies across all application resources.
        *   **Comprehensive Security Testing for Authorization Flaws:** Conduct thorough security testing specifically focused on identifying and fixing IDOR vulnerabilities and authorization bypass issues across all application functionalities.
