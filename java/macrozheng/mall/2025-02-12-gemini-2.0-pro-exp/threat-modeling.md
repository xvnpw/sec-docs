# Threat Model Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Threat: [Rogue Microservice Registration](./threats/rogue_microservice_registration.md)

*   **Threat:** Rogue Microservice Registration

    *   **Description:** An attacker registers a malicious microservice with the service discovery mechanism (e.g., Eureka, Consul) to intercept legitimate traffic intended for `mall` services. The attacker could steal data (order details, customer information), manipulate responses (change prices, confirm fake orders), or cause a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, loss of customer trust, financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Service Discovery (Eureka/Consul), Spring Cloud Gateway, all `mall` microservices (e.g., `mall-order`, `mall-product`, `mall-auth`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) between all `mall` microservices.
        *   Secure the service discovery mechanism itself: strong passwords, network segmentation (separate network for internal services), strict access control.
        *   Implement service-to-service authentication using JWTs or other secure tokens, verifying the identity of each microservice.
        *   Regularly audit service registrations and configurations within Eureka/Consul.

## Threat: [Malicious Message Injection (RabbitMQ)](./threats/malicious_message_injection__rabbitmq_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Message Injection (RabbitMQ)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the RabbitMQ message broker used by `mall` and injects malicious messages. These messages could trigger unintended actions within `mall`'s microservices, such as creating fraudulent orders, canceling legitimate orders, manipulating inventory data, or triggering unauthorized promotions.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss, data corruption (order database, inventory database), operational disruption, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** RabbitMQ, `mall-order`, `mall-promotion`, `mall-inventory`, and any other `mall` microservice consuming messages from RabbitMQ.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, unique passwords for RabbitMQ users specifically configured for `mall`.
        *   Implement message signing and verification (e.g., using digital signatures) within the `mall` microservices to ensure message authenticity and integrity.  This requires code changes in message producers and consumers.
        *   Use dedicated RabbitMQ queues with appropriate access controls (ACLs) for different message types and `mall` microservice consumers.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization for all message handlers *within* the `mall` microservices.
        *   Monitor RabbitMQ queues used by `mall` for unusual activity (high message rates, unexpected message types).

## Threat: [JWT Forgery](./threats/jwt_forgery.md)

*   **Threat:** JWT Forgery

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the JWT secret key used by `mall-auth` or finds a vulnerability in the JWT library used by `mall`. This allows them to forge JWT tokens, granting them unauthorized access to `mall`'s resources or allowing them to impersonate other `mall` users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data (customer data, order data), privilege escalation, account takeover, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mall-auth`, Spring Security, all `mall` microservices relying on JWT authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use a strong, randomly generated, and long JWT secret key specific to the `mall` deployment.
        *   Store the secret key securely *outside* of the `mall` codebase (e.g., using a secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or environment variables securely injected at runtime).  *Never* commit the secret key to the code repository.
        *   Implement short token expiration times (e.g., 15-30 minutes) and use refresh tokens for longer sessions within `mall-auth`.
        *   Consider using asymmetric keys (public/private key pairs) for JWT signing within `mall-auth`.
        *   Validate the JWT signature and claims (issuer, audience, expiration) on *every* request within each `mall` microservice.
        *   Regularly rotate the JWT secret key.

## Threat: [Elasticsearch Data Tampering](./threats/elasticsearch_data_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Elasticsearch Data Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the Elasticsearch cluster used by `mall` and modifies indexed data (product details, prices, search results). This could lead to misinformation, price manipulation, or denial of service by corrupting the `mall-search` index.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, financial loss (due to incorrect pricing), reputational damage, service disruption (search functionality).
    *   **Affected Component:** Elasticsearch, `mall-search`, `mall-product`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Elasticsearch security features (authentication, authorization, TLS) for the cluster used by `mall`.
        *   Restrict network access to the Elasticsearch cluster (firewall, security groups), allowing access only from authorized `mall` microservices.
        *   Use strong passwords and role-based access control (RBAC) within Elasticsearch, limiting `mall-search`'s access to only necessary indices and operations.
        *   Implement data validation and sanitization *before* indexing data within `mall-product` and `mall-search`.
