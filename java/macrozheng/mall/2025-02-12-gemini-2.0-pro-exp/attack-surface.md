# Attack Surface Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Attack Surface: [1. JWT Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/1__jwt_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks targeting the JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication and authorization mechanism.
    *   **How `mall` Contributes:** `mall` uses JWT extensively for user authentication and session management.  The entire security model relies on the correct implementation and handling of JWTs within `mall`'s codebase.
    *   **Example:** An attacker forges a JWT with an administrator role by exploiting a weak signing key hardcoded within `mall` or a vulnerability in `mall`'s JWT validation logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, unauthorized access to all data and functionality, potential data breaches, and financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use a well-vetted and up-to-date JWT library (e.g., `jjwt`).
            *   Implement *strict* validation of *all* standard JWT claims (signature, `exp`, `nbf`, `iss`, `aud`) within `mall`'s authentication filters and related code.
            *   Use strong, randomly generated secrets (HS256 or stronger) and store them securely (e.g., environment variables, a secrets vault, *never* hardcoded in `mall`'s repository).
            *   Implement robust secret rotation procedures within `mall`.
            *   Consider short token lifetimes (e.g., 15-30 minutes) and use refresh tokens for longer sessions.  Implement refresh token revocation within `mall`.
            *   Thoroughly test all authentication and authorization flows within `mall`, including edge cases and error handling.
            *   Implement rate limiting and account lockout within `mall`'s login and password reset functionality to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Attack Surface: [2. RBAC Implementation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/2__rbac_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect or incomplete Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configuration or logic within `mall`.
    *   **How `mall` Contributes:** `mall` implements a custom RBAC system to manage access to different administrative functions and resources.  The correctness of this implementation *within `mall`'s code* is crucial.
    *   **Example:** A user with a "product manager" role is able to access order management functions due to a misconfigured permission assignment within `mall`'s code.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potential data modification or deletion, disruption of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege within `mall`'s code.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each role.
            *   Thoroughly review and test the RBAC implementation within `mall`, including all permission assignments and checks in the code.
            *   Use a well-defined and documented authorization framework (Spring Security is used, but its configuration *within `mall`* is key).
            *   Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests within `mall` to verify RBAC enforcement.
            *   Regularly audit the RBAC configuration and user roles as defined within `mall`.

## Attack Surface: [3. Order Management Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/3__order_management_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**  Attacks that attempt to modify order details (quantities, prices, addresses) after placement, potentially exploiting race conditions or insufficient validation within `mall`.
    *   **How `mall` Contributes:**  The core functionality of `mall` revolves around order processing.  This makes order management, as implemented *in `mall`'s code*, a prime target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts an order update request and modifies the quantity of an item to a negative value, potentially causing a system error or financial loss, exploiting a vulnerability in `mall`'s order processing logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Financial loss, fraud, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement *strong* server-side validation of *all* order data *before* processing any changes within `mall`'s order management services.  This includes validating quantities, prices, addresses, and any other relevant parameters.
            *   Use atomic operations or database transactions within `mall`'s code to prevent race conditions during order updates.
            *   Maintain a detailed audit log of all order modifications within `mall`, including the user who made the change, the timestamp, and the old and new values.
            *   Implement input sanitization and output encoding within `mall`'s order processing code to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [4. Database Interactions (Beyond Generic SQLi)](./attack_surfaces/4__database_interactions__beyond_generic_sqli_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities related to how `mall` interacts with its databases, focusing on data exposure through APIs and potential ORM-specific issues *within `mall`'s code*.
    *   **How `mall` Contributes:** `mall` uses multiple databases and relies heavily on database interactions for its core functionality.  MyBatis is used as the ORM, and its usage *within `mall`* is the key concern.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint within `mall` intended to return a list of products inadvertently exposes internal database IDs or other sensitive information.  A MyBatis dynamic SQL statement *within `mall`* is vulnerable to a subtle injection attack.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized data access, potential system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Design APIs *within `mall`* to expose only the *minimum* necessary data.  Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to control the shape of API responses and avoid exposing internal database structures.
            *   Implement strict authorization checks for *all* API endpoints *within `mall`*, ensuring that users can only access data they are authorized to see.
            *   Avoid using dynamic SQL in MyBatis *within `mall`* where possible.  If dynamic SQL is necessary, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
            *   Thoroughly review all MyBatis XML mapper files *within `mall`* for potential injection vulnerabilities.
            *   Regularly audit database queries and API responses generated by `mall` for sensitive data exposure.
