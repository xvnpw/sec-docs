# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Parameterized Queries in MyBatis](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_parameterized_queries_in_mybatis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review All MyBatis Mappers:** Examine all XML mapper files (`.xml`) and Java code using MyBatis annotations (`@Select`, `@Update`, etc.) within the `mall` project.
    2.  **Identify String Concatenation:** Locate any instances where SQL queries are built using string concatenation, especially involving user-supplied input. This includes direct concatenation (`+` in Java, string interpolation in XML) and the use of `${}` in MyBatis.
    3.  **Replace with Parameterized Placeholders:** Replace all instances of string concatenation with parameterized placeholders. In MyBatis XML, use `#{parameterName}`. In Java annotations, pass parameters as method arguments and use `#{parameterName}` in the SQL string.
    4.  **Pass Parameters Correctly:** Ensure that parameters are passed to MyBatis as Java objects, Maps, or primitive types. MyBatis will then handle the proper escaping and type conversion.
    5.  **Dynamic SQL Handling:** For dynamic SQL sections (using `<if>`, `<choose>`, `<where>`, `<foreach>`) within `mall`'s MyBatis mappers, ensure that *no* user input is directly embedded within the SQL fragments. All user-supplied values *must* be passed as parameters using `#{}`.
    6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all database interactions within `mall`, including edge cases and invalid input, to confirm that SQL injection is not possible.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code to access, modify, or delete data within the `mall` database.
    *   **Data Breach:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Directly related to SQL Injection, preventing unauthorized access to `mall`'s customer data.
    *   **Application Takeover:** (Severity: **Critical**) - In severe cases, SQL injection can lead to complete takeover of the `mall` application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced to **Near Zero** if implemented correctly and consistently within `mall`.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced, directly proportional to the reduction in SQL injection risk within `mall`.
    *   **Application Takeover:** Risk significantly reduced, as SQL injection is a common pathway to full control of `mall`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Parameterized queries are *sometimes* used within `mall`'s MyBatis mappers, but inconsistencies and potential vulnerabilities likely exist, especially in dynamic SQL.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Dynamic SQL Sections:** The dynamic SQL sections of `mall`'s MyBatis mappers are the most likely areas for missing implementation.
    *   **Consistency Across All Mappers:** A project-wide audit of `mall` is needed to ensure *all* mappers adhere to the parameterized query approach.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Comprehensive XSS Protection in `mall`](./mitigation_strategies/implement_comprehensive_xss_protection_in__mall_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input Points:** Identify all locations within `mall` where user input is accepted (e.g., product descriptions, reviews, search fields, user profiles).
    2.  **Input Validation (Whitelist):** For each input field in `mall`, define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns. Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.
    3.  **Output Encoding (Context-Specific):** Before displaying *any* user-supplied data within `mall`, encode it appropriately for the context:
        *   **HTML Context:** Use `Encode.forHtml()` from OWASP Java Encoder.
        *   **JavaScript Context:** Use `Encode.forJavaScript()`.
        *   **URL Context:** Use `Encode.forUriComponent()`.
        *   **Attribute Context:** Use `Encode.forHtmlAttribute()`.
    4.  **Rich Text Sanitization (if applicable):** If `mall` allows rich text (HTML) input, use a library like OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer to remove dangerous tags and attributes.
    5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test all areas within `mall` where user input is displayed, using various XSS payloads.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript into the `mall` application.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** (Severity: **High**) - XSS is often used to steal session cookies, leading to account takeover within `mall`.
    *   **Website Defacement:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Attackers can use XSS to alter the appearance of the `mall` website.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** (Severity: **High**) - XSS can be used to redirect `mall` users to malicious websites or display fake login forms.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced, approaching **Low** with comprehensive implementation within `mall`.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced, as XSS is a primary attack vector within `mall`.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Risk significantly reduced for `mall`.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced for `mall`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Likely Partially Implemented:** Some output encoding might be present in `mall`, but it's unlikely to be comprehensive and context-specific. Input validation likely exists but may not be strict (whitelist).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent Output Encoding:** A project-wide review of `mall` is needed to ensure *all* output is properly encoded.
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Whitelist):** Input validation in `mall` needs to be strengthened, moving towards a whitelist approach.
    *   **Rich Text Sanitization:** If `mall` allows rich text, a sanitization library needs to be integrated.

    2.  **Data Masking:** Mask or sanitize sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) before logging within `mall`.  This requires modifying `mall`'s logging configuration and potentially custom log appenders.
    3.  **Custom Error Handling:**
        *   Implement custom error handlers within `mall` to display generic error messages to users.
        *   Avoid exposing stack traces or internal error details in production deployments of `mall`.
        *   Use Spring's `@ControllerAdvice` within `mall` for centralized error handling.
    4.  **Log Review:** Regularly review `mall`'s application logs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
