## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Business Logic Flaws in "mall" [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_business_logic_flaws_in_mall__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 Order Manipulation [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **1.1.1 Bypass Quantity/Price Validation [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker manipulates input parameters related to order quantities and prices to bypass server-side validation. This could involve submitting negative quantities, zero prices, or extremely large values to cause unexpected behavior.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  Identify input fields for quantity and price during the order process.
            2.  Craft malicious input (e.g., negative quantity, zero price).
            3.  Submit the order with the manipulated input.
            4.  Observe the application's response. If validation is weak, the order might be processed incorrectly.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust server-side validation of all order parameters. Check for negative values, zero values, and excessively large values. Use appropriate data types and consider range checks.
        *   **Example:** An attacker could try to order -10 items, potentially leading to a negative order total or unexpected inventory changes.

    *   **1.1.3 Exploit Coupon/Promotion Logic [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to use coupons or promotions in unintended ways, such as applying expired coupons, using single-use coupons multiple times, or combining coupons that should not be combinable.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  Identify available coupons and promotions.
            2.  Attempt to apply coupons in ways that violate their intended usage (e.g., after expiration, multiple times).
            3.  Observe the application's response. If validation is weak, the attacker might receive unauthorized discounts.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement strict server-side validation of coupon usage. Check expiration dates, usage limits, product restrictions, and prevent multiple uses of single-use coupons.
        *   **Example:** An attacker could try to repeatedly use a single-use coupon code, or apply a coupon intended for a specific product to a different product.

*   **1.2 Account Takeover via "mall"-Specific Features**
    *    **1.2.1 Exploit Weak Password Reset/Recovery in "mall" (if custom implementation exists) [CRITICAL]**
        *    **Description:** If "mall" implements its own password reset/recovery mechanism (instead of relying on a well-vetted library), the attacker exploits weaknesses in this mechanism to gain access to user accounts.
        *    **Attack Steps:**
            1. Initiate password reset/recovery process.
            2. Analyze the reset process for vulnerabilities:
                * Predictable reset tokens.
                * Lack of rate limiting (allowing brute-force attacks).
                * Information leakage (e.g., revealing whether an email address is registered).
            3. Exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the account.
        *    **Mitigation:** If a custom password reset mechanism is used, ensure it follows security best practices. Use strong, unpredictable tokens, implement rate limiting, and avoid information leakage.  Strongly consider using a well-vetted library for password management.
        *    **Example:** An attacker might be able to guess a password reset token if it's based on easily predictable information (e.g., user ID, timestamp).

*   **1.3 Information Disclosure via "mall"-Specific Endpoints**
    *   **1.3.1 Leaking Sensitive Data through Unintended API Endpoints [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker discovers and accesses API endpoints that were not intended for public access or that inadvertently expose sensitive data.
        *   **Attack Steps:**
            1.  Explore the application and identify potential API endpoints (e.g., by inspecting network traffic, JavaScript code).
            2.  Send requests to these endpoints, trying different parameters and methods.
            3.  Analyze the responses for sensitive data (e.g., user details, internal IDs, database information).
        *   **Mitigation:**  Review all API endpoints and ensure that only intended data is returned. Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to control the shape of API responses and avoid exposing internal data structures. Implement proper authorization checks.
        *   **Example:** An attacker might find an API endpoint that returns a list of all users, including their email addresses and password hashes, without requiring authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in "mall"'s Dependencies [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_mall's_dependencies__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Outdated Spring Framework/Spring Boot Versions [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of the Spring Framework or Spring Boot. These vulnerabilities can range from denial-of-service to remote code execution (RCE).
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Identify the version of Spring Framework/Spring Boot being used (e.g., through server headers, error messages, or publicly available information).
        2.  Search for known vulnerabilities affecting that version (e.g., using CVE databases, security advisories).
        3.  If a suitable exploit is found, use it to attack the application.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Regularly update Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and all related dependencies to the latest stable versions. Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies. Monitor security advisories for Spring components.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might use a publicly available exploit for a known RCE vulnerability in an older version of Spring to gain control of the server.

*   **2.2 Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries (e.g., MyBatis, Redis, RabbitMQ) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by "mall." The impact depends on the specific library and vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Identify the third-party libraries used by "mall" (e.g., using dependency management files, inspecting the codebase).
        2.  Search for known vulnerabilities affecting those libraries (e.g., using CVE databases, security advisories).
        3.  If a suitable exploit is found, use it to attack the application.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerable third-party libraries. Update vulnerable libraries to patched versions. Consider using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability in an outdated version of a logging library to inject malicious code or gain access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit "mall"'s Integration with External Services](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_mall's_integration_with_external_services.md)

*   **3.3 Insecure Handling of Webhooks/Callbacks from External Services [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits weaknesses in how "mall" handles webhooks or callbacks from external services (e.g., payment gateways, shipping providers). This could involve forging requests, replaying requests, or injecting malicious data.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  Identify endpoints that handle webhooks or callbacks.
        2.  Analyze the expected format and authentication mechanisms of these requests.
        3.  Craft malicious requests that bypass authentication or inject malicious data.
        4.  Send the malicious requests to the application.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement proper authentication and validation of incoming webhook requests. Use signatures or tokens to verify the authenticity of the sender. Validate the data received in the webhook payload. Implement idempotency checks to prevent replay attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might forge a webhook request from a payment gateway to falsely indicate that a payment has been successful, allowing them to receive goods without paying.
