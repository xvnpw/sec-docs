## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws Specific to mall [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_authenticationauthorization_flaws_specific_to_mall__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path represents a direct threat to the application's access control mechanisms. Successful exploitation grants attackers unauthorized access, potentially with administrative privileges.

    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Default Admin Account (If Not Changed):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default credentials (e.g., "admin"/"password", "administrator"/"admin123") that might be present in the application for initial setup or as a fallback.
        *   **Impact:**  If successful, the attacker gains full administrative access to the application, allowing them to control all aspects of the system, including user data, product information, and potentially the underlying server.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** This is often the easiest entry point for attackers, requiring minimal effort and skill. Default credentials are a well-known weakness in many systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities Introduced by mall's Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_mall's_code__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path targets vulnerabilities in how the application handles data, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation, or remote code execution.

    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit SQL Injection in Custom Queries/Repositories:**
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Inject malicious SQL through search parameters in product listings:** Attackers craft search queries containing SQL code that, when executed by the database, performs unintended actions like retrieving sensitive data or modifying database entries.
            *   **Inject malicious SQL through user input fields in order processing:** Attackers insert SQL code into fields like order notes, shipping addresses, or payment details, which are then processed by the application's database queries.
            *   **Inject malicious SQL through API endpoints specific to mall's features:** Attackers send specially crafted requests to API endpoints, embedding SQL code within parameters that are not properly sanitized before being used in database queries.
        *   **Impact:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data (user credentials, customer information, financial details), modify or delete data, and in some cases, even execute operating system commands on the database server.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** SQL injection is a prevalent vulnerability in web applications, especially when developers don't follow secure coding practices. It can have a devastating impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure File Uploads in Product Management/User Profile (If Implemented) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            *   **Upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) through product image upload:** Attackers bypass file type restrictions or lack of proper validation to upload executable files (like PHP scripts) disguised as images. Once uploaded, these files can be accessed directly, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of insecure file uploads can lead to remote code execution, granting the attacker complete control over the web server. This allows them to install malware, steal data, deface the website, or use the server for further attacks.
        *   **Why it's High-Risk:** Remote code execution is one of the most severe vulnerabilities. It provides attackers with the highest level of control over the compromised system.
