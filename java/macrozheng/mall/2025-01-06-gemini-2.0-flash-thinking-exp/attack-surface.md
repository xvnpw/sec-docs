# Attack Surface Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Password Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_password_storage.md)

**Description:** Passwords are not stored securely, making them vulnerable to compromise if the database is accessed.

**How Mall Contributes:** If `mall`'s backend code uses weak or outdated hashing algorithms (like MD5 or SHA1 without salting) or stores passwords in plaintext in the database.

**Example:** A database breach exposes user credentials in plaintext, allowing attackers to log in to user accounts.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data breaches, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strong, salted, and iterated hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for password storage. Avoid storing passwords in plaintext or using easily reversible encryption.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Input Validation on Order Placement Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_input_validation_on_order_placement_endpoint.md)

**Description:** The API endpoint responsible for placing orders does not properly validate user-supplied data.

**How Mall Contributes:** If `mall`'s backend API for order creation doesn't sanitize and validate input fields like product IDs, quantities, shipping addresses, or payment details.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates the request to include a negative quantity for a product, potentially leading to inventory issues or financial discrepancies.

**Impact:** Business logic flaws, inventory manipulation, potential financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation on all API endpoints, especially those handling critical business logic. Use whitelisting and sanitization techniques.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) on User Profile Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__on_user_profile_access.md)

**Description:** The application allows access to user profiles or resources by directly referencing their IDs without proper authorization checks.

**How Mall Contributes:** If `mall` uses predictable or sequential user IDs in URLs or API requests to access user profile information and doesn't verify if the logged-in user has permission to access that specific ID.

**Example:** An attacker changes the user ID in the URL (e.g., `/user/profile/123` to `/user/profile/456`) to access and view another user's profile information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, potential for data modification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement proper authorization checks on all resource access endpoints. Use non-sequential or UUIDs for resource identifiers.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerability in Product Search Functionality](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerability_in_product_search_functionality.md)

**Description:** User-provided input in the product search functionality is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**How Mall Contributes:** If `mall`s custom search functionality directly incorporates user input into SQL queries without using parameterized queries or proper escaping.

**Example:** An attacker enters a malicious SQL payload in the search bar (e.g., `' OR '1'='1`) to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data from the database.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to the database, potential for complete system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that handles input sanitization to prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Rate Limiting on Login Attempts](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_rate_limiting_on_login_attempts.md)

**Description:** The application does not limit the number of failed login attempts.

**How Mall Contributes:** If `mall`'s authentication system allows an unlimited number of login attempts from the same IP address or user account within a short period.

*   **Example:** An attacker can perform brute-force attacks to guess user passwords by repeatedly trying different combinations.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts based on IP address or user account. Implement account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of failed attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads for Product Images](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads_for_product_images.md)

**Description:** The application allows users (e.g., administrators or sellers) to upload files (product images) without proper validation.

*   **How Mall Contributes:** If `mall` allows uploading product images and doesn't adequately validate the file type, size, and content.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image, which can then be executed on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict file upload validation, including checking file extensions, MIME types, and file content. Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate domain or using a content delivery network (CDN).

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Product Review Comments](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_product_review_comments.md)

**Description:** The application does not properly sanitize user-generated content, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.

*   **How Mall Contributes:** If `mall` allows users to submit product reviews and doesn't sanitize the input before displaying it on the product page.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a product review. When other users view the product page, the script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to malicious sites.
*   **Impact:** Account hijacking, malware distribution, defacement of the website.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust output encoding and sanitization for all user-generated content displayed on the website. Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
