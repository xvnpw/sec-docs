# Threat Model Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Threat: [Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](./threats/lack_of_multi-factor_authentication__mfa_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use compromised credentials (obtained through phishing, credential stuffing, or data breaches) to log into user accounts without a second factor of authentication. This is a direct consequence of `mall`'s authentication implementation not enforcing MFA.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches, financial losses due to fraudulent activities, damage to reputation and trust.

**Affected Component:** User Authentication Module, potentially affecting all user-facing modules and administrative interfaces.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement mandatory MFA for all users, especially administrative accounts. Support multiple MFA methods (e.g., TOTP, SMS, email). Educate users on the importance of strong passwords and avoiding phishing attempts.

## Threat: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanism](./threats/insecure_password_reset_mechanism.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in `mall`'s password reset process, such as predictable reset tokens, lack of account lockout after multiple failed attempts, or insecure email delivery, to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This directly involves the code and logic within `mall` for handling password resets.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, potential data breaches, account takeover, ability to perform actions as the compromised user.

**Affected Component:** User Authentication Module, Password Reset Functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Generate strong, unpredictable, and time-limited password reset tokens. Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed reset attempts. Ensure secure delivery of reset links (HTTPS). Consider using email verification before allowing password resets.

## Threat: [Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Enforcement](./threats/insufficient_role-based_access_control__rbac__enforcement.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially a malicious insider or an external attacker who has compromised a low-privilege account, could exploit flaws in `mall`'s RBAC implementation to access functionalities or data they are not authorized to access. This is a direct issue with how `mall` manages user permissions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform administrative actions, potential for data manipulation or deletion, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Module, Admin Panels, API Endpoints related to administrative functions, potentially affecting various modules depending on the specific RBAC flaw.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement a robust and well-defined RBAC system. Enforce the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and audit access control configurations. Ensure proper validation of user roles before granting access to resources or functionalities.

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in Order Management](./threats/insecure_direct_object_references__idor__in_order_management.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate order IDs or other identifiers in API requests or URLs within `mall` to access or modify orders belonging to other users. This vulnerability resides in how `mall` handles order access and authorization.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive order information, potential for order modification or cancellation, privacy violations.

**Affected Component:** Order Management Module, API Endpoints for viewing and managing orders.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement authorization checks within `mall` to ensure users can only access their own orders. Use non-sequential, unpredictable identifiers (UUIDs) for orders. Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in URLs or API requests.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Payment Gateway Integration](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_payment_gateway_integration.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how `mall` integrates with payment gateways could lead to vulnerabilities such as improper handling of transaction responses, insecure storage of temporary payment data within `mall`, or the ability to manipulate transaction amounts through `mall`'s interface. This directly involves the code within `mall` responsible for payment processing.

**Impact:** Financial losses for the platform and users, potential exposure of sensitive payment information, reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Payment Processing Module, Integration with specific payment gateway APIs within `mall`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Follow the best practices and security guidelines provided by the payment gateway. Securely handle API keys and secrets within `mall`. Implement proper error handling and logging for payment transactions within `mall`. Avoid storing sensitive payment information locally within `mall`. Use HTTPS for all communication with the payment gateway initiated by `mall`.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of File Uploads for Product Images](./threats/insecure_handling_of_file_uploads_for_product_images.md)

**Description:** If `mall` allows users or administrators to upload product images without proper validation, an attacker could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) that could be executed on the server hosting `mall`, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This is a direct vulnerability in `mall`'s file upload functionality.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete system compromise, data breaches, website defacement.

**Affected Component:** Product Management Module, File Upload Functionality within `mall`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Validate file types and extensions within `mall`. Sanitize file names. Store uploaded files outside the webroot of `mall`. Implement virus scanning on uploaded files. Resize and optimize images on the server-side. Use a dedicated storage service for uploaded files.
