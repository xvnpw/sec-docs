# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for macrozheng/mall

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for E-commerce Roles](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_e-commerce_roles.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define E-commerce Specific Roles:**  Identify roles unique to an online mall, such as:
        *   `Customer`: Browsing, ordering, account management.
        *   `Seller`: Product listing, order fulfillment for their products, store management.
        *   `Admin`: Platform-wide management (users, products across sellers, system settings, reporting).
        *   `Product Manager`:  Catalog management, category setup, potentially global product attributes.
        *   `Order Manager`:  Handling platform-wide order issues, refunds, disputes.
    2.  **Granular Permissions for E-commerce Functions:** Define permissions tailored to e-commerce operations. For example:
        *   Seller:  "Create Product Listing," "Edit Own Product Listing," "View Own Orders," "Manage Store Profile."
        *   Admin: "Manage All Products," "Manage All Orders," "Manage Users," "Configure Payment Gateways," "View Sales Reports."
    3.  **Enforce RBAC in Mall Application Code:** Implement checks in the backend services and API endpoints of the "mall" application to enforce these role-based permissions. Ensure that sellers can only manage *their own* products and orders, and admins have platform-wide control.
    4.  **RBAC for Admin Panel and Seller Dashboards:** Secure the admin panel and seller dashboards using RBAC.  Ensure only authorized users can access specific sections and functionalities within these interfaces.
    5.  **Regularly Audit E-commerce Roles and Permissions:** Review and update roles and permissions as the "mall" application evolves and new features are added (e.g., new seller features, marketing tools, etc.).

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Seller Access to Other Sellers' Data (High Severity) - Sellers accessing or modifying products, orders, or data belonging to other sellers on the platform.
    *   Unauthorized Customer Access to Seller or Admin Functions (High Severity) - Customers gaining access to seller dashboards or admin panels.
    *   Admin Privilege Escalation by Sellers (High Severity) - Sellers exploiting vulnerabilities to gain admin-level privileges and platform control.
    *   Data Breach of Seller or Customer Data due to Admin Account Misuse (High Severity) -  Unauthorized actions by compromised or rogue admin accounts leading to data breaches.
    *   Unauthorized Modification of Product Catalog by Customers or Sellers (Medium Severity) -  Customers or sellers manipulating product listings they shouldn't have access to.
    *   Unauthorized Order Management by Customers or Sellers (Medium Severity) - Customers or sellers viewing or modifying order details beyond their authorized scope.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Seller Access to Other Sellers' Data: High Risk Reduction - Prevents sellers from competing unfairly or maliciously accessing competitor data.
    *   Unauthorized Customer Access to Seller or Admin Functions: High Risk Reduction - Protects sensitive seller and admin functionalities from customer access.
    *   Admin Privilege Escalation by Sellers: High Risk Reduction - Makes privilege escalation significantly harder by enforcing strict role boundaries.
    *   Data Breach of Seller or Customer Data due to Admin Account Misuse: High Risk Reduction - Limits the scope of damage even if an admin account is compromised.
    *   Unauthorized Modification of Product Catalog by Customers or Sellers: Medium Risk Reduction - Maintains product data integrity and prevents unauthorized changes.
    *   Unauthorized Order Management by Customers or Sellers: Medium Risk Reduction - Protects order information and prevents unauthorized order manipulation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented -  Likely basic roles (customer, seller, admin) exist in `macrozheng/mall`. Seller dashboards and admin panels are probably separated. However, granular permissions within seller and admin roles, and consistent enforcement across all e-commerce functionalities might be missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  More granular roles within admin and seller categories (e.g., separate roles for product management admins, order processing admins, marketing admins; different seller tiers with varying access levels), fine-grained permissions for specific e-commerce actions (e.g., "edit product description" vs. "edit product price"), RBAC enforcement in all API endpoints related to e-commerce operations (product management APIs, order APIs, seller APIs), regular audits of e-commerce roles and permissions to adapt to platform changes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Shopping Cart and Checkout Process Specific to E-commerce](./mitigation_strategies/secure_shopping_cart_and_checkout_process_specific_to_e-commerce.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Server-Side Cart Management:** Implement shopping cart logic primarily on the server-side, not relying solely on client-side storage (like local storage). This prevents client-side manipulation of cart items and prices.
    2.  **Server-Side Price and Discount Calculation:** Calculate final prices, discounts, and shipping costs on the server-side during the checkout process. Do not rely on client-side calculations, which can be easily manipulated.
    3.  **Validate Product Availability and Prices at Checkout:** Before finalizing an order, re-validate product availability and current prices from the database. This prevents issues if prices or stock levels have changed since the user added items to their cart.
    4.  **Prevent Manipulation of Order Totals:**  Ensure that order totals are securely calculated and cannot be manipulated by users during the checkout process. Use server-side logic to compute and verify the final amount.
    5.  **Secure Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with reputable and PCI DSS compliant payment gateways to handle payment processing securely. Avoid handling sensitive payment information directly within the "mall" application. Use secure APIs provided by payment gateways.
    6.  **Order Confirmation and Logging:**  Implement robust order confirmation mechanisms and logging of all checkout steps, including price calculations, discount applications, and payment transactions. This aids in auditing and fraud detection.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Price Manipulation in Shopping Cart (High Severity) - Users manipulating client-side cart data to change prices or quantities to their advantage.
    *   Discount Abuse (Medium to High Severity) - Users exploiting vulnerabilities in discount or coupon code logic to get unauthorized discounts.
    *   Inventory Manipulation during Checkout (Medium Severity) - Attackers attempting to manipulate inventory levels during the checkout process (e.g., "race conditions").
    *   Payment Fraud (High Severity) -  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the checkout process to commit payment fraud or bypass payment steps.
    *   Order Data Tampering (Medium Severity) - Users manipulating order details after placement, potentially leading to incorrect fulfillment or disputes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Price Manipulation in Shopping Cart: High Risk Reduction - Server-side cart management and price calculations prevent client-side manipulation.
    *   Discount Abuse: Medium to High Risk Reduction - Server-side discount validation and secure logic reduce discount abuse.
    *   Inventory Manipulation during Checkout: Medium Risk Reduction - Server-side inventory validation and secure transaction handling mitigate inventory manipulation.
    *   Payment Fraud: High Risk Reduction - Secure payment gateway integration and proper checkout process security minimize payment fraud risks.
    *   Order Data Tampering: Medium Risk Reduction - Secure order processing and server-side validation prevent order data tampering.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented -  `macrozheng/mall` likely has a shopping cart and checkout flow. Server-side cart management and basic price calculations are probably present. However, the robustness of server-side validation, discount logic security, real-time inventory checks at checkout, and comprehensive logging might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Strict server-side validation of all checkout steps, robust and secure discount/coupon code logic, real-time inventory validation *at the point of order confirmation*, thorough logging of all checkout events (including price breakdowns, discount applications, payment gateway interactions), security audits specifically focused on the checkout process for potential vulnerabilities, potentially missing protection against race conditions during inventory updates in high-traffic scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Product Management Features in E-commerce Context](./mitigation_strategies/secure_product_management_features_in_e-commerce_context.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **RBAC for Product Management:**  Enforce RBAC for product management features. Sellers should only be able to manage *their own* products. Admins should have broader product management capabilities.
    2.  **Input Validation for Product Data:** Implement strict input validation for all product data fields (name, description, price, images, attributes, etc.) to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and data integrity issues.
    3.  **Secure File Uploads for Product Images:**  Implement secure file upload mechanisms for product images. Validate file types, sizes, and content. Store uploaded images securely and serve them through a controlled mechanism to prevent direct execution of malicious files.
    4.  **Versioning or Audit Trails for Product Changes:** Consider implementing versioning or audit trails for product data changes. This allows tracking who made changes and when, aiding in accountability and rollback if needed.
    5.  **Prevent Product Data Scraping:** Implement measures to prevent or mitigate product data scraping by unauthorized parties. This could include rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or dynamic content loading.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Product Modification by Sellers or Customers (Medium to High Severity) - Users modifying product listings they are not authorized to manage.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Product Descriptions or Attributes (Medium to High Severity) - Attackers injecting malicious scripts into product data that is displayed to users.
    *   Malicious File Uploads via Product Images (Medium Severity) - Uploading web shells or other malicious files disguised as product images.
    *   Data Integrity Issues in Product Catalog (Medium Severity) - Invalid or malicious product data corrupting the product catalog.
    *   Competitive Scraping of Product Data (Low to Medium Severity) - Competitors scraping product data for price comparison or other competitive intelligence.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Product Modification: Medium to High Risk Reduction - RBAC effectively controls who can modify product listings.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Product Descriptions or Attributes: High Risk Reduction - Input validation and output sanitization prevent XSS attacks.
    *   Malicious File Uploads via Product Images: Medium Risk Reduction - Secure file upload validation and storage mitigate malicious file upload risks.
    *   Data Integrity Issues in Product Catalog: Medium Risk Reduction - Input validation ensures data quality and integrity.
    *   Competitive Scraping of Product Data: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Scraping prevention measures can deter or slow down unauthorized data collection.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented -  `macrozheng/mall` likely has product management features for sellers and admins. RBAC for basic seller product management is probably in place. Input validation for some product fields might exist. Secure file uploads and advanced features like versioning/audit trails are less likely to be fully implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Comprehensive input validation for *all* product data fields, robust secure file upload validation and storage for product images, implementation of versioning or audit trails for product changes, more granular RBAC for product management (e.g., different levels of product editing permissions for sellers), specific measures to prevent or mitigate product data scraping (rate limiting on product listing endpoints, CAPTCHA for browsing, dynamic content loading).
