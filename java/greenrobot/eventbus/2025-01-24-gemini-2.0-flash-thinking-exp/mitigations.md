## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Event Types and Scopes using EventBus Features](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_event_types_and_scopes_using_eventbus_features.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Utilize Class-Based Events in EventBus:**  Leverage EventBus's support for class-based events.  Define events as concrete Java classes instead of relying on string-based identifiers. This is a core feature of EventBus for type safety.
*   Step 2: **Consider Multiple EventBus Instances for Scoping:** If your application structure allows, create and use multiple `EventBus` instances.  EventBus allows for creating new instances, enabling you to limit event propagation to specific modules or components.
*   Step 3: **Register Subscribers to Specific EventBus Instances:** When using scoped `EventBus` instances, ensure subscribers are registered only to the `EventBus` instance relevant to the events they need to handle. EventBus registration is instance-specific.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Accidental Event Handling (Medium Severity):**  Reduced risk of unintended event handlers triggered by string-based event name collisions or typos, which is a risk when not using EventBus's class-based event feature.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Limiting event scope with multiple `EventBus` instances reduces the chance of sensitive events reaching unintended subscribers within the application, a risk amplified by a single global EventBus.

**Impact:**
*   **Accidental Event Handling:** Significantly reduces risk by enforcing type safety inherent in EventBus's class-based event mechanism.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Moderately reduces risk by leveraging EventBus's ability to create scoped instances, limiting event broadcast range.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Class-based events are used for core application events, utilizing EventBus's recommended approach.
*   However, only a single global `EventBus.getDefault()` instance is used, not leveraging EventBus's capability for scoped instances.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Scoped `EventBus` instances are not implemented, missing the opportunity to use EventBus's instance creation feature for better event compartmentalization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Sensitive Data in EventBus Payloads](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_sensitive_data_in_eventbus_payloads.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Review Event Payloads for Sensitive Data:** Examine all event classes used with EventBus and identify any that directly carry sensitive information within their fields.
*   Step 2: **Replace Sensitive Data with Identifiers in EventBus Events:** Modify event classes to transmit identifiers or references instead of directly embedding sensitive data in EventBus events.
*   Step 3: **Retrieve Sensitive Data Outside of EventBus Flow:** Ensure event handlers retrieve sensitive data using the identifier from a secure source *after* receiving the EventBus event, not directly from the event payload itself. This keeps sensitive data out of the EventBus broadcast.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being broadly broadcast through EventBus, reducing the risk of unintended subscribers or logging exposing this data.
*   **Data Breach via Event Logging (Medium Severity):** Minimizes the risk of sensitive data being logged as part of EventBus events, a potential vulnerability if event logging is enabled.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduces risk by limiting sensitive data exposure within the EventBus communication flow.
*   **Data Breach via Event Logging:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing sensitive data from being directly present in EventBus event logs.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Some events avoid direct sensitive data, using identifiers as a better practice with EventBus.
*   However, some events still directly include sensitive data in EventBus payloads, not fully utilizing best practices for data handling within EventBus.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent minimization of sensitive data in all EventBus event payloads is not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Authorization Checks within EventBus Event Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/implement_authorization_checks_within_eventbus_event_handlers.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Identify Sensitive Event Handlers:** Determine which EventBus subscriber methods handle sensitive data or trigger critical actions based on received events.
*   Step 2: **Add Authorization Logic to EventBus Subscriber Methods:** Within these identified EventBus subscriber methods (annotated with `@Subscribe`), implement authorization checks *before* processing the event data.
*   Step 3: **Utilize Application's Authorization Framework in EventBus Handlers:** Integrate your application's existing authorization mechanisms within the EventBus subscriber methods to verify permissions based on user context or component roles.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized components from accessing sensitive data even if they subscribe to relevant EventBus events, by adding authorization directly within the EventBus handler.
*   **Unauthorized Actions (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized components from triggering actions by handling events they should not be authorized to process, enforced within the EventBus subscriber.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Significantly reduces risk by adding access control directly to EventBus event processing logic.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring actions triggered by EventBus events are authorized at the handler level.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Authorization checks exist in some EventBus handlers for critical actions, demonstrating awareness of this need within EventBus usage.
*   However, authorization is not consistently applied across all sensitive EventBus handlers, missing opportunities to secure all relevant event processing points.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent authorization checks in all sensitive EventBus subscriber methods are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Event Publication to EventBus](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_event_publication_to_eventbus.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Identify Event Publication Points Susceptible to Flooding:** Pinpoint locations in your code where events are published to EventBus, especially those triggered by external inputs or user actions that could be abused to flood EventBus.
*   Step 2: **Implement Rate Limiting Before `EventBus.post()` Calls:** Introduce rate limiting mechanisms *before* calling `EventBus.post()` at these identified points. This is done outside of EventBus itself, controlling the input *to* EventBus.
*   Step 3: **Use Rate Limiting Techniques:** Employ standard rate limiting techniques (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket) to control the rate at which events are published to EventBus, preventing overload.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Prevents malicious actors or compromised components from overwhelming the application by flooding EventBus with events, leading to DoS.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of EventBus event queue and processing consuming excessive resources due to event flooding.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Significantly reduces risk by controlling the rate of events entering EventBus, preventing overload scenarios.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Significantly reduces risk by limiting the volume of events processed by EventBus, preventing resource depletion.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Rate limiting is applied in some areas like login attempts, indirectly limiting certain event types published to EventBus.
*   However, general rate limiting specifically targeting EventBus event publication across various potential flood points is missing.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive rate limiting on EventBus event publication is not implemented across all relevant event sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Event Data Before Publishing to EventBus](./mitigation_strategies/validate_event_data_before_publishing_to_eventbus.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: **Identify Event Publication Points with External or Untrusted Data:** Locate code sections where events are created and published to EventBus based on external input or data from less trusted sources.
*   Step 2: **Implement Input Validation Before `EventBus.post()`:**  Before calling `EventBus.post()`, add input validation logic to check the integrity and validity of the data that will be included in the event payload.
*   Step 3: **Sanitize Event Data Before Publishing to EventBus:** Sanitize the event data to remove or neutralize any potentially malicious content *before* it is packaged into an event and published to EventBus.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious code or data through event payloads by validating and sanitizing data *before* it enters the EventBus system.
*   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures data published through EventBus is valid and consistent, preventing errors and potential vulnerabilities arising from malformed data.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** Significantly reduces risk by preventing malicious payloads from being propagated through EventBus events.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Significantly reduces risk by ensuring data consistency and validity within the EventBus communication flow.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Basic input validation exists for user inputs in UI components, which indirectly affects some events published to EventBus.
*   However, consistent and thorough validation and sanitization are not applied to all event data *before* publishing to EventBus across the application.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent input validation and sanitization of event data *before* publishing to EventBus is not fully implemented across all event publication points.
