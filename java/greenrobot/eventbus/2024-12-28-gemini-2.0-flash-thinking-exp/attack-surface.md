Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving EventBus, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious Event Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker can post crafted or malicious event objects onto the EventBus.
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus facilitates the decoupling of components, allowing any component with access to the EventBus instance to post events. It doesn't inherently validate the content or origin of events.
    *   **Example:** A compromised component posts an event that triggers a vulnerable subscriber to execute arbitrary code or modify sensitive data. For instance, an event containing a malicious SQL query could be processed by a subscriber that directly uses the event data in a database query without sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, privilege escalation, or denial of service depending on the actions performed by the vulnerable subscriber.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation on event data before posting to prevent injection of malicious payloads.
        *   Enforce strict access control on components that are allowed to post specific types of events.
        *   Consider using signed events or other mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of events.
        *   Design subscribers to be resilient to unexpected or malformed event data.

*   **Attack Surface:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Events
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently included within event objects and broadcasted through the EventBus.
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus's publish/subscribe nature means any component subscribed to a particular event type will receive all events of that type, regardless of whether they need the sensitive data.
    *   **Example:** An event containing user credentials or API keys is posted. Multiple subscribers, some of which might not require this sensitive information, receive the event, potentially logging or storing it insecurely.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential compromise of user accounts or systems if exposed credentials are used maliciously.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid including sensitive data directly in event objects.
        *   Use identifiers in events and retrieve sensitive data from a secure source within the subscriber, based on the identifier.
        *   Carefully consider the scope of event subscriptions and ensure only necessary components subscribe to events containing potentially sensitive information.
        *   Implement secure logging practices to prevent accidental logging of sensitive event data.

*   **Attack Surface:** Event Flooding (Denial of Service)
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the EventBus with a large volume of events, overwhelming subscribers and consuming excessive resources.
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus processes and distributes all posted events to relevant subscribers. A lack of rate limiting or mechanisms to handle excessive event volumes can make the application vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A compromised component or a malicious actor intentionally posts a massive number of events, causing subscribers to consume excessive CPU and memory, potentially leading to application slowdowns or crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on event posting to prevent excessive event generation.
        *   Design subscribers to handle high event volumes efficiently, potentially using asynchronous processing or batching.
        *   Monitor event traffic and implement alerts for unusual spikes in event activity.
        *   Consider using backpressure mechanisms if subscribers cannot keep up with the event rate.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerable Event Handlers
    *   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within the methods annotated with `@Subscribe` (event handlers).
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus directly invokes these handler methods when a matching event is posted. If these handlers contain vulnerabilities, they can be exploited through crafted events.
    *   **Example:** An event handler directly uses data from the event object in a database query without proper sanitization, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, privilege escalation, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the handler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply secure coding practices within all event handlers, including input validation, output encoding, and protection against common vulnerabilities like injection flaws.
        *   Regularly review and test event handlers for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in event handlers.
