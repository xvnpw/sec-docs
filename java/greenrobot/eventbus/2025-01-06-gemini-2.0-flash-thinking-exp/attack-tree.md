## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_remote_code_execution__rce__via_deserialization.md)

An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an event handler where event data is deserialized.
The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the event data.
Upon deserialization, this payload executes arbitrary code on the application server, leading to a full compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger SQL Injection via Event Data](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_sql_injection_via_event_data.md)

An attacker crafts malicious SQL code within the event data.
A vulnerable event handler directly uses this event data in a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application State](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_state.md)

An attacker publishes an event with data designed to alter the application's internal state.
A vulnerable event handler processes this event and modifies the state without proper validation or authorization checks.
This can lead to unintended behavior, privilege escalation, or data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Sensitive Events](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_sensitive_events.md)

An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the subscription logic to register a malicious subscriber.
This malicious subscriber listens for and captures events containing sensitive information as they are broadcasted through the EventBus.
The attacker gains unauthorized access to confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application State Based on Observed Events](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_state_based_on_observed_events.md)

An attacker registers a malicious subscriber.
This subscriber observes events and analyzes the information contained within them.
Based on the observed events, the malicious subscriber triggers actions or publishes new events that manipulate the application's state to the attacker's benefit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Application Crash or Unexpected Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/cause_application_crash_or_unexpected_behavior.md)

An attacker publishes a specific event that triggers a vulnerable code path within an event handler.
This vulnerability leads to an error condition, causing the application to crash, become unresponsive, or exhibit unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_checks.md)

An attacker crafts a specific event that, when processed by a vulnerable event handler, bypasses intended security checks or authorization mechanisms.
This allows the attacker to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Application State](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_application_state.md)

An attacker publishes a malicious sticky event.
When new subscribers register for this event type, they receive the malicious sticky event.
The data within the malicious sticky event is then processed by these subscribers, injecting malicious data into the application's state, potentially affecting future operations or data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Event](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_event.md)

This is a critical point because the ability to inject arbitrary events allows attackers to target various vulnerabilities in event handlers. If this control is compromised, multiple high-risk paths become viable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Event Handler](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_event_handler.md)

This node represents the core of many high-risk paths. Vulnerabilities in event handlers are the direct cause of RCE, SQL injection, application state manipulation, and security bypasses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Register Malicious Subscriber](./attack_tree_paths/register_malicious_subscriber.md)

The ability to register unauthorized subscribers grants attackers the capability to eavesdrop on sensitive information and potentially influence application behavior, opening the door to interception and state manipulation attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Event Handler Logic](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_event_handler_logic.md)

This node emphasizes the importance of secure coding practices within event handlers. Flaws in the logic of these handlers are the root cause of crashes, unexpected behavior, and security bypasses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Poison Sticky Event](./attack_tree_paths/poison_sticky_event.md)

This node is critical because sticky events persist and affect future subscribers. The ability to publish malicious sticky events allows attackers to inject malicious data into the application state in a way that can have lasting consequences.
