# Attack Surface Analysis for greenrobot/eventbus

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Event Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_event_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manages to inject crafted or malicious event objects into the EventBus.
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus facilitates the communication between components by allowing any part of the application with access to the `EventBus` instance to post events. It doesn't inherently validate the content or source of these events.
    *   **Example:** A compromised component or a vulnerability allowing external input to trigger an event post could inject an event containing malicious code or data designed to exploit a vulnerability in a subscriber. For instance, an event might contain a specially crafted string that causes a buffer overflow in a subscribing component's processing logic.
    *   **Impact:**  Code execution within the subscribing component's context, data corruption, unexpected application behavior, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation in Subscribers:**  Subscribers should rigorously validate all data received within events before processing it. Implement checks for expected data types, formats, and ranges.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Event Posting:** Restrict which components have the ability to post specific types of events. Avoid making the `EventBus` instance globally accessible without careful consideration.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code that posts events to ensure no vulnerabilities exist that could lead to malicious event injection.
        *   **Consider Signed Events (Advanced):** For highly sensitive applications, explore mechanisms to sign events to verify their authenticity and integrity, although this is not a built-in feature of EventBus and would require custom implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Subscriber Registration](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_subscriber_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to register their own malicious subscriber to the EventBus.
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus allows any object to register as a subscriber for specific event types. If registration is not properly controlled or secured, an attacker could register a subscriber to intercept sensitive information.
    *   **Example:** In an Android application, if a component responsible for handling user authentication events doesn't properly secure its event bus registration, a malicious component (perhaps introduced through a compromised library) could register to receive these authentication events and steal user credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access to application functionalities, potential for further exploitation by acting on intercepted information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Controlled Subscriber Registration:** Implement mechanisms to control which components are allowed to register for specific event types. This could involve authorization checks before registration.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Subscriptions:** Only register for the specific event types that a component absolutely needs to process. Avoid overly broad subscriptions.
        *   **Secure Event Design:**  Avoid transmitting highly sensitive information directly within events if possible. Consider using event payloads as identifiers to retrieve sensitive data through secure channels.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Carefully review the registration and unregistration logic to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Event Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_event_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the EventBus with a large number of events, overwhelming subscribers and potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus efficiently distributes events to all registered subscribers. However, if an attacker can post events uncontrollably, this efficiency can be turned into a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A compromised component or an external attacker exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to trigger event postings could send a massive number of events, causing subscribers to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) and potentially leading to application crashes or timeouts.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, performance degradation, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting on Event Posting:** Implement mechanisms to limit the rate at which events can be posted, especially from untrusted sources or components.
        *   **Subscriber Efficiency:** Ensure subscribers are designed to process events efficiently and avoid blocking operations that could slow down the event processing pipeline.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor resource usage and implement throttling mechanisms if event processing starts consuming excessive resources.
        *   **Input Validation on Event Sources:** If the source of events is external or potentially untrusted, validate the input to prevent malicious actors from triggering excessive event postings.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Event Eavesdropping](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_event_eavesdropping.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a subscriber to intercept events and gain access to sensitive information being passed between components.
    *   **How EventBus Contributes:** EventBus broadcasts events to all registered subscribers of that event type. If subscriber registration is not secure, unauthorized parties can listen in on these communications.
    *   **Example:** An application uses events to communicate sensitive user data between different modules. If a malicious component can register for these events, it can passively collect this sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, business logic, or internal application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Subscriber Registration (as mentioned above):** Implement robust authorization and authentication for subscriber registration.
        *   **Minimize Sensitive Data in Events:** Avoid transmitting highly sensitive information directly within event payloads. Use events to trigger actions or pass identifiers, and retrieve sensitive data through secure channels when needed.
        *   **Consider Data Transformation:** If sensitive data must be included in events, consider encrypting or anonymizing it before posting.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Regularly review subscriber registration patterns and event data being transmitted.
