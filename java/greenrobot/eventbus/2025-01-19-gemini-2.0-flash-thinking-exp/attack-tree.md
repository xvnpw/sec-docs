# Attack Tree Analysis for greenrobot/eventbus

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the EventBus implementation.

## Attack Tree Visualization

## Attack Tree Path: [1. High-Risk Path: Exploit Malicious Event Publication due to Lack of Proper Event Validation/Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path_exploit_malicious_event_publication_due_to_lack_of_proper_event_validationsanitiza_21bfc3db.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the application's failure to validate or sanitize event data before it's processed by subscribers.
*   **Critical Node: Lack of Proper Event Validation/Sanitization:** This is a critical design flaw. If the application doesn't validate event data, any component capable of publishing events (even with legitimate intent but flawed input) can inadvertently introduce malicious data. An attacker who can influence event data (through compromised components or by exploiting other vulnerabilities) can directly inject malicious payloads.
*   **Likelihood:** High - Lack of input validation is a common vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Medium/High - Depends on the logic of the subscribers processing the unvalidated data. Could lead to data corruption, unexpected behavior, or even vulnerabilities like SQL injection within subscribers.
*   **Effort:** Low (for the attacker, as it exploits an existing weakness).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice (to exploit the lack of validation).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without specific monitoring of event content).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. High-Risk Path: Exploit Malicious Subscriber Registration leading to Harmful Actions](./attack_tree_paths/2__high-risk_path_exploit_malicious_subscriber_registration_leading_to_harmful_actions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker manages to register a malicious subscriber and then leverages it to perform harmful actions when relevant events are published. This path has several sub-vectors depending on the harmful action.
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code that Registers Subscriber:** This is a critical point because it allows the attacker to introduce their malicious component into the application's event processing flow. This often relies on exploiting other vulnerabilities like code injection flaws.
*   **Critical Node: Lack of Subscriber Authorization/Verification:** This weakness allows unauthorized or untrusted subscribers to register, making the malicious subscriber registration attack much easier.
*   **High-Risk Path Sub-Vector: Exfiltrate Sensitive Data:**
    *   A malicious subscriber listens for events containing sensitive information and transmits it to an external location.
    *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on the ability to register and the presence of sensitive data in events).
    *   Impact: Critical (data breach).
    *   Effort: Low (once the malicious subscriber is registered).
    *   Skill Level: Novice (to implement basic data exfiltration).
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard (depends on network monitoring and the sophistication of the exfiltration).
*   **High-Risk Path Sub-Vector: Modify Application State:**
    *   A malicious subscriber listens for events and then alters application data, configuration, or user permissions.
    *   Likelihood: Medium (depends on the ability to register and the application logic).
    *   Impact: High (data integrity compromise, functional disruption).
    *   Effort: Low (once the malicious subscriber is registered).
    *   Skill Level: Novice (to perform basic data modification).
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (depends on auditing and monitoring of state changes).
*   **High-Risk Path Sub-Vector: Execute Arbitrary Code:**
    *   **Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Code:** This is a critical outcome. The malicious subscriber exploits vulnerabilities in its own code or dependencies, or interacts with other parts of the system to achieve code execution on the application server.
    *   Likelihood: Low (requires vulnerabilities in the malicious subscriber's code or the application's interaction with it).
    *   Impact: Critical (full system compromise).
    *   Effort: Medium (to develop and deploy the vulnerable subscriber).
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate (to exploit vulnerabilities for code execution).
    *   Detection Difficulty: Hard (depends on the nature of the code execution and monitoring capabilities).
