## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Disrupt/Exfiltrate/Execute via EventBus [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_disruptexfiltrateexecute_via_eventbus__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to disrupt the application's functionality, steal sensitive data, or execute arbitrary code by leveraging vulnerabilities related to the EventBus implementation.
*   **Criticality:** This is the root of the attack tree and defines the overall threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Event Flow [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_event_flow__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to alter the normal sequence, content, or delivery of events within the application. This is a high-risk vector because it can directly impact the application's logic and state.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Inject Malicious Events [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_inject_malicious_events__high_risk_.md)

    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to introduce events containing harmful data or instructions into the EventBus.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Craft Events with Malicious Payload [HIGH RISK] (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_craft_events_with_malicious_payload__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

        *   **Description:** The attacker creates events with payloads designed to exploit vulnerabilities in subscribers. This could include SQL injection strings, cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads, command injection sequences, or other data designed to cause unintended behavior.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the presence of input validation and sanitization.
        *   **Impact:** High - Can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires knowledge of the application's event structure and subscriber vulnerabilities.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High - Needs understanding of injection vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High - Difficult if no input validation or logging is in place; easier with proper security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Bypass Event Type Checks (if any)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_bypass_event_type_checks__if_any_.md)

        *   **Description:** If the application restricts the types of events that can be posted, the attacker tries to circumvent these checks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the strength of the type checking mechanism.
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Depends on what the bypassed checks were protecting.
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High - Requires understanding the check mechanism and finding a bypass.
        *   **Skill Level:** High - Needs knowledge of type systems and potential bypass techniques.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Easier if checks are logged; harder if bypass is subtle.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Replay/Reorder Events](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_replayreorder_events.md)

    *   **Description:** The attacker attempts to capture and resend legitimate events or change their order.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Sniff Events to Bypass Security Checks [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_sniff_events_to_bypass_security_checks__high_risk_.md)

        *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts events, potentially by exploiting network vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Assuming network vulnerabilities exist.
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High - Depending on event content.
        *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires network sniffing tools.
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Network security knowledge needed.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High - Difficult without network intrusion detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Event Handling Logic](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_event_handling_logic.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities within the code that processes events (the subscribers).
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Data Exfiltration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_data_exfiltration__high_risk_.md)

    *   **Description:** The attacker aims to steal sensitive data by exploiting how subscribers handle events.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Post Events with Subscriber Logic [HIGH RISK] (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_post_events_with_subscriber_logic__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

        *   **Description:** The attacker crafts events that, when processed by a vulnerable subscriber, cause it to leak sensitive information. This relies on flaws in the subscriber's code that allow it to be manipulated into revealing data it shouldn't.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Requires a specific vulnerability in a subscriber.
        *   **Impact:** High - Direct data breach.
        *   **Effort:** High - Requires deep understanding of subscriber code and vulnerability identification.
        *   **Skill Level:** High - Requires expertise in secure coding and vulnerability analysis.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Requires code auditing, dynamic analysis, and potentially data loss prevention (DLP) systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.2 Post Events with Subscriber Logic [HIGH RISK] (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_2_post_events_with_subscriber_logic__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

        *   **Description:** (Same as 2.2.1 - the duplication in the original tree was likely an error.  Both represent the same attack vector.) The attacker crafts events that, when processed by a vulnerable subscriber, cause it to leak sensitive information. This relies on flaws in the subscriber's code that allow it to be manipulated into revealing data it shouldn't.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Requires a specific vulnerability in a subscriber.
        *   **Impact:** High - Direct data breach.
        *   **Effort:** High - Requires deep understanding of subscriber code and vulnerability identification.
        *   **Skill Level:** High - Requires expertise in secure coding and vulnerability analysis.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High - Requires code auditing, dynamic analysis, and potentially data loss prevention (DLP) systems.
