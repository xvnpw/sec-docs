# Threat Model Analysis for greenrobot/eventbus

## Threat: [Event Injection and Spoofing](./threats/event_injection_and_spoofing.md)

**Description:** An attacker, having compromised a component within the application or an external application (in Android context), could post malicious events onto the EventBus. These events could be crafted to mimic legitimate events, triggering unintended actions in subscribing components. For example, an attacker might inject a fake "AdminPrivilegeGrantedEvent" to gain unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to features, data manipulation, bypassing security controls, privilege escalation.

**Affected EventBus Component:** `EventBus.post()` function, Event Handlers (Subscribers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement event origin validation within event handlers to verify the source of events.
*   Design components to adhere to the principle of least privilege, minimizing reliance on events for critical security decisions without validation.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of event posting logic to ensure only legitimate events are published.
*   In Android, enforce strict permission controls to limit external applications' ability to interact with the application's EventBus (if applicable and if not intentionally exposed).
