# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The EventBus project aims to provide a decoupled communication mechanism for Android and Java applications.
  - It prioritizes simplicity and ease of use for developers to implement publish/subscribe patterns within their applications.
  - The goal is to improve application architecture by reducing dependencies between components, leading to more maintainable and scalable code.
  - Another goal is to enhance application responsiveness by enabling asynchronous event handling.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk of introducing instability or bugs into applications if EventBus itself has vulnerabilities or is poorly implemented.
  - Risk of performance bottlenecks if event handling is not efficient, especially in high-volume scenarios.
  - Risk of developer misuse leading to unexpected application behavior if the API is not clear or documentation is lacking.
  - Risk of supply chain vulnerabilities if dependencies of EventBus are compromised.
  - Risk of reputational damage if security vulnerabilities are found in EventBus, impacting applications that rely on it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
  - security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and scrutiny of the code. (Implemented: Open-source nature)
  - security control: Use of standard build tools like Gradle (assuming secure configuration). (Implemented: Build process)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on users to properly implement EventBus within their applications and handle sensitive data securely.
  - accepted risk: Limited direct control over how EventBus is used and deployed in various application contexts.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the build pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement Dependency Check tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by EventBus.
  - security control: Conduct regular code reviews, including security-focused reviews, by experienced developers.
  - security control: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation, including security considerations and best practices for using EventBus securely.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including timely patching and communication.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to EventBus library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using EventBus.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to EventBus library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using EventBus to control access to events and data.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: EventBus should handle various event types and data payloads robustly without crashing or causing unexpected behavior due to malformed input.
    - Requirement: Applications using EventBus should validate event data received through EventBus to prevent injection attacks or data integrity issues within their own application logic.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If EventBus is used to transmit sensitive data, applications should implement encryption at the application level before publishing events and decryption after receiving events. EventBus itself does not need to provide cryptographic features.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For EventBus itself, the critical process is maintaining the integrity, availability, and security of the library to ensure applications using it function correctly and are not negatively impacted.
  - For applications using EventBus, the critical business processes are those that rely on inter-component communication facilitated by EventBus. The criticality depends on the specific application and its business function.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - For EventBus library: Primarily the source code and build artifacts. Sensitivity is moderate, as vulnerabilities could impact applications using the library.
  - For applications using EventBus: The data being transmitted as events. Sensitivity depends entirely on the application and the nature of the data. It could range from low (non-sensitive application events) to high (sensitive personal or financial data transmitted via events). EventBus itself does not inherently handle sensitive data; it's a transport mechanism. The sensitivity is determined by the application's use of EventBus.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended deployment environment for applications using EventBus (e.g., mobile devices, servers, embedded systems)? (Assumption: Broad range of Android and Java environments)
  - Are there specific performance requirements for EventBus in high-volume event scenarios? (Assumption: Performance is important, but focus is on general efficiency rather than extreme low-latency requirements)
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements for applications using EventBus (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)? (Assumption: Compliance is application-specific and the responsibility of the application developers, not directly EventBus library itself)
  - Is there an existing security incident response plan for the EventBus project? (Assumption: Standard open-source project practices are followed, but a formal incident response plan might be beneficial)

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and reliable library for developers to improve application architecture.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard secure software development practices are generally followed for open-source projects. The security of applications using EventBus is primarily the responsibility of the application developers.
  - DESIGN: The design is relatively simple and focused on providing core publish/subscribe functionality. Deployment is within applications, and build process uses standard open-source build tools.
