### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 4.1.1. Post malicious sticky event that affects future subscribers [HR]

#### 4.1. Technical Background: Sticky Events in EventBus

EventBus's sticky events are designed to retain the most recent event of a specific type. When a component subscribes to a sticky event, it immediately receives the *last* posted sticky event of that type, in addition to any future events of the same type. This is useful for scenarios where components need to know the current state or configuration upon initialization, even if the state was set before the component was registered.

**Key characteristics of sticky events:**

*   **Persistence:** Sticky events are stored in memory by EventBus after being posted.
*   **Immediate Delivery to New Subscribers:**  Subscribers registering for a sticky event type receive the last posted sticky event of that type immediately upon registration.
*   **Single Instance Retention (per event type):** EventBus typically stores only the *last* sticky event posted for each event type. Posting a new sticky event of the same type replaces the previous one.
*   **Explicit Posting and Removal:** Sticky events are posted and removed using specific EventBus methods (`postSticky()`, `removeStickyEvent()`).

#### 4.2. Attack Scenario: Posting Malicious Sticky Event

**Attacker Goal:** To compromise the application or its users by injecting malicious data or logic through a sticky event that will affect future subscribers.

**Attack Steps:**

1.  **Gain Ability to Post Events:** The attacker needs to find a way to post events to the EventBus instance used by the application. This could be achieved through various means depending on the application's vulnerabilities:
    *   **Compromised Component:** If an attacker compromises a component within the application that has the ability to post events (e.g., through code injection, vulnerability exploitation in a library, or social engineering).
    *   **External Access (Less Likely):** In rare cases, if the EventBus instance is inadvertently exposed or accessible from outside the intended application boundaries (highly unlikely in typical Android applications using EventBus internally).
    *   **Malicious Application (Co-existence):** If the attacker can install a malicious application on the same device that can somehow interact with the target application's EventBus (requires specific inter-process communication vulnerabilities or shared resources, less common for standard EventBus usage).

2.  **Identify Target Sticky Event Type:** The attacker needs to identify an event type that is used as a sticky event and is subscribed to by components that perform sensitive operations or rely on the event data for critical logic. This might involve:
    *   **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing the application's code (if possible) to identify event types used with `postSticky()` and `@Subscribe(sticky = true)`.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis/Monitoring:** Observing the application's behavior and event flow to infer the usage of sticky events.
    *   **Guesswork (Less Efficient):**  Trying common event types or patterns based on application functionality.

3.  **Craft Malicious Sticky Event Payload:** The attacker creates a malicious event object of the identified type. This payload could contain:
    *   **Malicious Configuration Data:**  Data designed to misconfigure subscribers, leading to unintended behavior, security vulnerabilities, or denial of service. (Example from Attack Vector description).
    *   **Exploitative Data:** Data crafted to trigger vulnerabilities in the subscriber's event handling logic (e.g., buffer overflows, injection vulnerabilities if the subscriber processes the data unsafely).
    *   **Logic Manipulation Data:** Data intended to alter the subscriber's intended behavior, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or bypass of security controls.

4.  **Post Malicious Sticky Event:** The attacker uses the compromised component or access point to post the crafted malicious event using `EventBus.getDefault().postSticky(maliciousEvent)`. This replaces any existing sticky event of the same type.

5.  **Future Subscribers Affected:** When new components register to subscribe to the targeted sticky event type (using `@Subscribe(sticky = true)`), they will receive the malicious sticky event immediately upon registration.

6.  **Exploitation by Subscribers:** The newly registered subscribers process the malicious event. If the subscriber's event handling logic is vulnerable or relies on the event data for critical operations without proper validation and sanitization, the attacker's malicious payload will be executed, leading to the intended compromise.

#### 4.3. Potential Vulnerabilities in Subscriber Implementations

The success of this attack heavily relies on vulnerabilities in how subscribers handle sticky events. Common vulnerabilities include:

*   **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:** Subscribers might directly use data from the sticky event without proper validation or sanitization. This can lead to various injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting if the data is used in UI contexts), or data integrity issues.
*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** If the sticky event payload is serialized data (e.g., JSON, XML), vulnerabilities in deserialization processes could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or manipulate application state.
*   **Reliance on Implicit Trust:** Subscribers might implicitly trust the data received in sticky events, assuming it originates from a trusted source. This assumption is broken when a malicious sticky event is posted.
*   **Configuration Mismanagement:** If sticky events are used for configuration, malicious data can lead to misconfiguration, disabling security features, or enabling unauthorized access.
*   **State Manipulation:** Malicious sticky events can be used to manipulate the internal state of subscribers, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches.

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment (CIA Triad)

*   **Confidentiality:**
    *   **Potential Impact:** High. A malicious sticky event could be used to leak sensitive data if subscribers are designed to process and potentially expose data based on event content.  For example, a malicious configuration event could instruct a subscriber to log sensitive information to an attacker-accessible location.
*   **Integrity:**
    *   **Potential Impact:** High. This is the most likely and significant impact. Malicious sticky events are designed to manipulate the application's behavior and data integrity.  Misconfiguration, data corruption, or unauthorized modifications are all potential outcomes.
*   **Availability:**
    *   **Potential Impact:** Medium to High. A malicious sticky event could cause denial of service. For example, a configuration event could lead to application crashes, resource exhaustion, or infinite loops in subscribers. Alternatively, by manipulating application logic, critical functionalities could be disabled or rendered unusable.

**Overall Severity:** High Risk (HR) - as indicated in the attack tree path. The potential for widespread and delayed impact on future subscribers makes this a serious threat.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of malicious sticky events, the development team should implement the following strategies:

1.  **Minimize Use of Sticky Events:** Re-evaluate the necessity of using sticky events. Consider alternative approaches for state management and inter-component communication that are less susceptible to this type of attack.  For example, using shared preferences, databases, or dependency injection to manage configuration and state.

2.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in Subscribers:** **Crucially important.**  All subscribers handling sticky events *must* rigorously validate and sanitize any data received from the event before using it. This includes:
    *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure data is of the expected type and format.
    *   **Range Checks and Limits:** Verify data is within acceptable ranges and limits.
    *   **Sanitization:**  Escape or remove potentially harmful characters or patterns (e.g., for preventing injection attacks).
    *   **Consider using whitelisting instead of blacklisting for input validation.**

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Event Posting:** Restrict the ability to post events, especially sticky events, to only those components that absolutely require it.  Carefully review and control which parts of the application can post events to the EventBus.

4.  **Secure Event Payloads:** If sticky events must carry sensitive data, consider:
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data within the event payload. Subscribers would need to decrypt the data after receiving the event.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks:** Include checksums or digital signatures in the event payload to verify data integrity and authenticity.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on EventBus usage and sticky event handling logic. Look for potential vulnerabilities in subscriber implementations and areas where malicious sticky events could be exploited.

6.  **Consider Alternative Communication Mechanisms:** Explore alternative inter-component communication mechanisms that offer stronger security controls or are less susceptible to this type of attack, depending on the specific application requirements.  For example, using more explicit and controlled communication patterns instead of a loosely coupled event bus for sensitive operations.

7.  **Application Hardening:** Implement general application hardening techniques to reduce the likelihood of an attacker gaining the ability to post events in the first place. This includes:
    *   **Input Validation at Application Boundaries:**  Validate all external inputs to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities in application components.
    *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep all libraries and dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

#### 4.6. Conclusion

The attack path "Post malicious sticky event that affects future subscribers" represents a significant security risk for applications using EventBus sticky events. The delayed and widespread impact on future subscribers makes it a particularly insidious attack.

The primary vulnerability lies in the potential for subscribers to process sticky event data without sufficient validation and sanitization.  **The most critical mitigation strategy is to implement robust input validation and sanitization in all subscribers that handle sticky events.**

By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and enhance the overall security posture of the application.  It is crucial to prioritize these mitigations, especially input validation, and to regularly review EventBus usage within the application to ensure ongoing security.
