# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Signal Server project aims to provide a reliable, secure, and private messaging platform. The primary business priority is to ensure confidential and secure communication for its users. This involves protecting user privacy, message confidentiality, and system availability. The goal is to enable users to communicate freely and securely without fear of eavesdropping or censorship.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Data breaches leading to exposure of user messages and metadata.
- Service unavailability disrupting user communication.
- Privacy violations due to unauthorized access or misuse of user data.
- Legal and regulatory compliance issues related to data privacy and security.
- Reputational damage due to security incidents.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: End-to-end encryption using Signal Protocol to protect message confidentiality in transit and at rest on user devices. Described in Signal Protocol documentation and implementation within Signal clients and server.
- security control: Open-source codebase allowing for public scrutiny and community security audits. Available on GitHub repository.
- security control: Regular security updates and patching of server software. Implemented through development and release processes.
- security control: Use of TLS/SSL for communication between clients and server. Standard practice for web applications.
- security control: Account registration and authentication mechanisms. Implemented within the server codebase.
- security control: Data storage encryption at rest for sensitive server-side data. Likely implemented in database configuration and server-side code.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on user devices for key management and end-to-end encryption. Risk of compromise if user devices are insecure.
- accepted risk: Metadata collection (e.g., timestamps, sender/receiver information) necessary for service operation. Risk of metadata analysis and privacy implications.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature may expose vulnerabilities to attackers if not promptly addressed. Requires proactive security monitoring and patching.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits by external security experts to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
- security control: Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms to ensure service availability and prevent abuse.
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring for security events and incident response.
- security control: Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and respond to malicious activity.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Secure user authentication mechanism to verify user identity.
    - security requirement: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for enhanced account security.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) within the server to manage administrative privileges.
    - security requirement: Proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own data and resources.
- Input validation:
    - security requirement: Strict input validation on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    - security requirement: Input sanitization to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols for encryption and hashing.
    - security requirement: Secure key management practices for server-side cryptographic keys.
    - security requirement: Proper implementation of Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Secure message delivery: Ensuring messages are delivered reliably and confidentially to intended recipients.
- User privacy: Protecting user identity, communication metadata, and any stored user information.
- Service availability: Maintaining continuous operation of the Signal Server to enable uninterrupted communication.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Message metadata (sender, receiver, timestamps): Highly sensitive - can reveal communication patterns and relationships.
- User account information (phone number, registration details): Highly sensitive - PII, needs strong protection.
- Server-side logs (access logs, audit logs): Sensitive - can contain information about user activity and system events, needs access control and secure storage.
- Server configuration data: Sensitive - if compromised, can lead to system compromise.
- Cryptographic keys (server-side, if any for metadata encryption): Highly sensitive - critical for data confidentiality and integrity.
- Potentially message content metadata (though end-to-end encrypted, server might have some metadata): Highly sensitive - related to communication content.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific database technology is used for Signal Server? (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- What message queue technology is used? (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub, etc.)
- What specific push notification services are integrated? (FCM, APNs, others?)
- What is the data retention policy for message metadata and server logs?
- Are there specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that the Signal Server needs to adhere to?
- What is the incident response plan in case of a security breach?
- What specific SAST/DAST and container scanning tools are used or recommended?
- Is MFA planned or implemented for user accounts or administrative access?

Assumptions:
- The deployment environment is assumed to be a cloud-based infrastructure for scalability and resilience.
- Kubernetes is assumed as the container orchestration platform for managing containerized components.
- GitHub Actions is assumed as the CI/CD platform for build and deployment automation.
- Security is a high priority for the Signal Server project, given its focus on secure communication.
- End-to-end encryption using Signal Protocol is the primary security control for message confidentiality.
- The server primarily handles metadata and supporting functions, not the content of end-to-end encrypted messages.
