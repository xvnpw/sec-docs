Okay, let's create a design document for the Signal Server, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Signal is a privacy-focused messaging service. Its primary business goal is to provide secure and private communication for its users.  The core value proposition is end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the communicating users can read the messages.  Any compromise of this core principle would severely damage Signal's reputation and user trust.  Given Signal's user base and mission, the business posture leans towards a very low risk appetite, particularly concerning user data privacy and confidentiality.

Business Priorities:

*   Maintain user privacy and data confidentiality.
*   Ensure the integrity and availability of the messaging service.
*   Maintain user trust and a strong reputation for security.
*   Resist censorship and government surveillance.
*   Provide a reliable and scalable service.

Business Goals:

*   Provide end-to-end encrypted messaging.
*   Minimize data collection and retention.
*   Protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   Ensure service availability and resilience.
*   Maintain transparency and open-source development.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Compromise of encryption keys or algorithms, leading to mass decryption of messages.
*   Server compromise leading to access to user metadata (even if message content is protected).
*   Denial-of-service attacks disrupting the service.
*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or privacy breaches.
*   Legal or regulatory challenges that threaten Signal's ability to operate.
*   Supply chain attacks that compromise the integrity of the server software.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Signal employs a variety of security controls, many of which are inherent in its design and protocol. The following are based on the provided GitHub repository and general knowledge of Signal's architecture.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: End-to-end encryption (Signal Protocol) for all messages. This is implemented in the client applications and the server facilitates key exchange.
*   security control: Cryptographic deniability.
*   security control: Limited server-side data retention. The server aims to store as little user data as possible.
*   security control: Open-source codebase, allowing for public scrutiny and auditing.
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing (though details are not fully public).
*   security control: Use of memory-safe languages (Rust) for some components to reduce memory corruption vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Certificate Pinning (mentioned in issues and discussions, not explicitly in code).
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) and other web security headers (implied, but best practice).
*   security control: Rate limiting to mitigate abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   security control: Input validation to prevent injection attacks.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The server temporarily stores encrypted messages until they are delivered to the recipient. This is necessary for asynchronous communication.
*   accepted risk: The server handles user registration and contact discovery, which requires storing some user identifiers (e.g., phone numbers, usernames).
*   accepted risk: Metadata about communication (e.g., sender and recipient, timestamps) is inherently visible to the server, although Signal minimizes this.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party services (e.g., push notification services like APNs and FCM) for message delivery notifications.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   High priority: Implement a robust Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management system to track all dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
*   High priority: Formalize and document the security audit process, including frequency, scope, and remediation procedures.
*   High priority: Enhance supply chain security measures, including code signing and verification of all build artifacts.
*   High priority: Implement a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Users must be authenticated before accessing any server resources.
    *   Authentication mechanisms must be resistant to common attacks (e.g., brute-force, replay).
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered.
*   Authorization:
    *   Access control must be enforced based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Users should only be able to access their own data and authorized resources.
    *   The server should not have access to the plaintext content of messages.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from clients must be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Input validation should be performed on the server-side, even if client-side validation is also implemented.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and protocols must be used for all security-critical operations.
    *   Key management must be secure and follow best practices.
    *   Cryptographic operations should be performed using secure libraries and hardware modules where available.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic algorithms and key lengths to stay ahead of evolving threats.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer] --> B(GitHub Repository)
    B --> C{GitHub Actions}
    C -- "Build (Gradle/Cargo)" --> D[Build Artifacts]
    C -- "Tests" --> E{Test Results}
    C -- "Linters" --> F{Linter Results}
    C -- "SAST (optional)" --> G{SAST Results}
    D --> H[Container Registry]

    A(("Developer\n(Local Machine)"))
    B(("GitHub Repository\n(Source Code)"))
    C(("GitHub Actions\n(CI/CD)"))
    D(("Build Artifacts\n(JARs, Binaries)"))
    E(("Test Results"))
    F(("Linter Results"))
    G(("SAST Results"))
    H(("Container Registry\n(Docker Images)"))
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions triggers a workflow based on the commit or pull request.
3.  The workflow checks out the code.
4.  Gradle (for Java) and/or Cargo (for Rust) builds the project.
5.  Unit tests and integration tests are executed.
6.  Linters (e.g., Checkstyle, Clippy) are run to enforce code style and identify potential issues.
7.  Optionally, Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools could be integrated to scan for vulnerabilities.
8.  If all checks pass, build artifacts (JAR files, binaries, Docker images) are created.
9.  Docker images are pushed to a container registry.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Automated builds ensure consistency and reproducibility.
*   security control: Unit and integration tests help catch bugs early.
*   security control: Linters enforce code style and identify potential issues.
*   security control: (Recommended) Integrate SAST tools to scan for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: (Recommended) Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to track dependencies.
*   security control: (Recommended) Implement code signing of build artifacts.
*   security control: (Recommended) Use a secure container registry with access controls and vulnerability scanning.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
