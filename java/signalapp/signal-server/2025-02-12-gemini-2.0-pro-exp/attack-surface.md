# Attack Surface Analysis for signalapp/signal-server

## Attack Surface: [Cryptographic Implementation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/cryptographic_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the Signal Server's *implementation* of the Signal Protocol (Double Ratchet, X3DH, etc.) and related cryptographic operations. This is distinct from theoretical flaws in the protocol itself.
    *   **Signal Server Contribution:** The server is responsible for managing cryptographic state, handling key exchanges (indirectly), and performing some cryptographic operations (e.g., related to registration lock, group management).
    *   **Example:** A timing side-channel leak during key derivation allows an attacker to recover key material used for encrypting messages stored on the server (even temporarily).
    *   **Impact:** Potential for decryption of past, present, or future messages; user impersonation; compromise of group chats.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Rigorous code review focusing on cryptographic code paths; use of constant-time cryptographic libraries and coding practices; extensive fuzzing of cryptographic functions; static analysis to identify potential side-channel leaks; regular security audits by cryptography experts.

## Attack Surface: [Registration Lock PIN Brute-Forcing/Compromise](./attack_surfaces/registration_lock_pin_brute-forcingcompromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks targeting the Registration Lock feature, which uses a PIN to prevent account hijacking.
    *   **Signal Server Contribution:** The server stores a secure representation of the PIN (using SRP) and enforces rate limiting and account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker attempts to guess a user's Registration Lock PIN by repeatedly sending requests to the server.  A weak server-side rate-limiting implementation allows the attacker to succeed.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover; attacker can register the victim's phone number on a new device and potentially access message history (if backups are enabled).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust server-side rate limiting and account lockout policies; ensure secure storage of PIN-related data (using SRP correctly); protect against timing attacks during PIN verification.

## Attack Surface: [Message Storage/Delivery Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/message_storagedelivery_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the server's temporary storage and delivery of encrypted messages.
    *   **Signal Server Contribution:** The server temporarily stores messages until they are delivered to the recipient.  It also handles message routing and delivery logic.
    *   **Example:** A memory corruption vulnerability in the server allows an attacker to read the contents of encrypted messages stored in memory.
    *   **Impact:** Potential exposure of message contents (even if encrypted, due to the memory corruption); messages could be delivered to the wrong recipient or lost entirely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Minimize the time messages are stored on the server; use memory-safe programming techniques (e.g., Rust, or careful use of memory management in Java); implement robust error handling and input validation; regularly audit the message handling code.

## Attack Surface: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) against Core Services](./attack_surfaces/denial-of-service__dos__against_core_services.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks that aim to disrupt the availability of the Signal service by overwhelming the server.
    *   **Signal Server Contribution:** The server is the central point of contact for all Signal clients.  Any vulnerability that allows an attacker to consume excessive resources can lead to DoS.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of malformed registration requests, overwhelming the server's processing capacity and preventing legitimate users from registering.
    *   **Impact:** Signal service becomes unavailable to users; inability to send or receive messages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust rate limiting and resource management; use techniques like connection pooling and request queuing; design the server to be resilient to high load; have a plan for handling DDoS attacks (e.g., using a CDN or DDoS mitigation service).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency-related_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the Signal Server.
    *   **Signal Server Contribution:** The server relies on external libraries for various functionalities (e.g., cryptography, networking, database access).
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in a Java library used for handling HTTP requests allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability; could range from denial-of-service to remote code execution and complete server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the specific dependency)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update all dependencies to the latest secure versions; use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track vulnerable libraries; carefully vet third-party code before integrating it; consider using dependency pinning to prevent unexpected updates.

## Attack Surface: [Provisioning API Abuse](./attack_surfaces/provisioning_api_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access or manipulation of the provisioning API, used for account creation and management.
    *   **Signal Server Contribution:** The server exposes the provisioning API to clients.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the provisioning API to create a large number of fake accounts or to modify the settings of existing accounts.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, spam, disruption of service, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the provisioning API; use API keys or other secure authentication mechanisms; thoroughly validate all input to the API; implement rate limiting and abuse detection.
