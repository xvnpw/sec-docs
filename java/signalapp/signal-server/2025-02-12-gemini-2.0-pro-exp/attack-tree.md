## Attack Tree Path: [Deanonymize Users, Intercept Messages, or Disrupt Service](./attack_tree_paths/deanonymize_users__intercept_messages__or_disrupt_service.md)

*   This is the overarching attacker goal and is inherently critical. Success in any of these objectives represents a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Server Interaction Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-server_interaction_vulnerabilities.md)

This is a high-level category encompassing several critical attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Eavesdrop on Unencrypted Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/eavesdrop_on_unencrypted_traffic.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept HTTP/2 Connections](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_http2_connections.md)

*   *Threat:* An attacker intercepts and decrypts communication between the client and server. This typically requires breaking or bypassing TLS encryption.
*   *Mitigation:* Use strong TLS configurations (TLS 1.3), certificate pinning, HSTS, and regularly update TLS libraries.
*   *Likelihood:* Very Low (if TLS is properly configured)
*   *Impact:* Very High (complete compromise of communication)
*   *Effort:* High (requires breaking TLS)
*   *Skill Level:* Expert
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard (if TLS is broken, detection is unlikely)

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Server](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_server.md)

*   *Threat:* An attacker gains full control of the Signal Server, allowing them to intercept, modify, or block any communication.
*   *Mitigation:* Strong physical security, regular patching, intrusion detection/prevention systems, strong access controls, secure development lifecycle (SDL).
*   *Likelihood:* Very Low (requires significant resources and expertise)
*   *Impact:* Very High (complete compromise of the system)
*   *Effort:* Very High
*   *Skill Level:* Expert
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard (requires sophisticated intrusion detection)
*   ***[Exploit Server Vulnerabilities]***
    *   *Threat:* An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the server software (operating system, web server, Signal Server code itself) to gain unauthorized access.
    *   *Mitigation:* Regular security patching, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, secure coding practices.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (if server is regularly patched)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (complete compromise)
    *   *Effort:* High
    *   *Skill Level:* Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (intrusion detection systems)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   *Threat:* An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the server software (operating system, web server, Signal Server code itself) to gain unauthorized access.
    *   *Mitigation:* Regular security patching, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, secure coding practices.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (if server is regularly patched)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (complete compromise)
    *   *Effort:* High
    *   *Skill Level:* Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium (intrusion detection systems)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Client-Side Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_client-side_implementation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Crypto in Client](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_crypto_in_client.md)

*   *Threat:* The client application (not the Signal Server itself) has vulnerabilities in its cryptographic implementation, allowing an attacker to decrypt messages or impersonate users.
*   *Mitigation:* The *client* must use strong, well-vetted cryptographic libraries, follow best practices for key management, and undergo regular security audits.
*   *Likelihood:* Low to Medium (depends on the client's security)
*   *Impact:* Very High (message decryption, impersonation)
*   *Effort:* High (requires finding and exploiting crypto vulnerabilities)
*   *Skill Level:* Expert
*   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard (requires analyzing the client's code)
* ***[Supply Chain Attack on Dependencies] [CRITICAL]***
    *   *Threat:* An attacker compromises a third-party library or component used by the Signal Server, injecting malicious code.
    *   *Mitigation:* Use a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), dependency pinning, checksum verification, regular dependency audits, consider using a private package repository.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (but increasing in frequency)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (complete compromise of the system)
    *   *Effort:* High (requires compromising a trusted dependency)
    *   *Skill Level:* Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard (requires sophisticated supply chain security measures)
* **[Tamper with Server Code] [CRITICAL]**
    * *Threat:* An attacker gains unauthorized access to modify the server's source code directly.
    * *Mitigation:* Strict access control to the codebase, code signing, integrity checks, robust code review process, secure CI/CD pipeline.
    * *Likelihood:* Very Low
    * *Impact:* Very High
    * *Effort:* High
    * *Skill Level:* Expert
    * *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
