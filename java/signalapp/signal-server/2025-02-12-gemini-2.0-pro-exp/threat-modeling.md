# Threat Model Analysis for signalapp/signal-server

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_message_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a massive number of messages (or registration requests, or other API calls) to the Signal Server, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate users from communicating. The attacker might use a botnet or exploit a vulnerability that allows them to bypass rate limits.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability for legitimate users. Potential financial losses if the service is tied to business operations. Reputational damage.
*   **Signal-Server Component Affected:**
    *   `MessageServlet` (and related servlets for different message types)
    *   `AccountServlet` (for registration-related DoS)
    *   Rate limiting mechanisms (`RateLimiter` class and related configuration)
    *   Websocket connection handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Rate Limiting:** Configure and fine-tune rate limiting based on IP address, user ID, and other factors. Use adaptive rate limiting that adjusts based on server load.
    *   **DDoS Protection:** Employ a DDoS mitigation service (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield) to absorb and filter malicious traffic.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and set alerts for unusual activity.
    *   **CAPTCHA/Proof-of-Work:** Implement CAPTCHA or proof-of-work challenges for registration and potentially for other high-volume operations.
    *   **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent connections per IP address or user.
    *   **Request Validation:** Strictly validate all incoming requests to prevent malformed or oversized data from consuming excessive resources.

## Threat: [Public Key Impersonation (Man-in-the-Middle)](./threats/public_key_impersonation__man-in-the-middle_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the server's key storage or exploits a vulnerability in the key exchange process to replace a user's legitimate public key with their own.  This allows the attacker to intercept and decrypt messages intended for the victim, and potentially send forged messages.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity for affected communications.  Loss of trust in the system. Potential for significant reputational damage.
*   **Signal-Server Component Affected:**
    *   `AccountManager` (specifically, methods related to key storage and retrieval)
    *   Database interactions related to key storage (e.g., `PreKeyStore`, `SignedPreKeyStore`, `IdentityKeyStore`)
    *   Key exchange protocol implementation (within `MessageServlet` and related components)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Key Verification (Safety Numbers):**  Implement and *enforce* out-of-band key verification using safety numbers (fingerprints).  Provide clear UI guidance for users to compare safety numbers.
    *   **Trust on First Use (TOFU) with Key Pinning:**  Implement TOFU, but also allow users to "pin" trusted keys, preventing changes without explicit user approval.
    *   **Key Change Notifications:**  Alert users whenever a contact's keys change, highlighting the potential risk.
    *   **Database Security:**  Secure the database storing public keys with strong access controls, encryption at rest, and regular security audits.
    *   **Code Audits:**  Regularly audit the code responsible for key management and exchange to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Server-Side Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_server-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Signal Server code (e.g., a buffer overflow, injection flaw, or logic error) to gain unauthorized access to the server, potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially complete server compromise.  Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Access to all stored data (encrypted messages, public keys, etc.).
*   **Signal-Server Component Affected:**  Potentially any component, depending on the vulnerability.  High-risk areas include:
    *   Input validation logic in all servlets
    *   Database interaction code
    *   Authentication and authorization mechanisms
    *   External library integrations
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP) to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on security-critical areas.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Use fuzzing techniques to test the server with unexpected inputs and identify crashes or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Keep all dependencies (libraries, frameworks) up-to-date and regularly check for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the server for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
    *   **Bug Bounty Program:**  Consider establishing a bug bounty program to incentivize security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromise of Registration Lock](./threats/compromise_of_registration_lock.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses or disables the registration lock mechanism, allowing them to register a phone number already associated with an existing account, effectively hijacking the account.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover. Loss of access to the account for the legitimate user. Potential for impersonation and reputational damage.
*   **Signal-Server Component Affected:**
    *   `AccountServlet` (specifically, methods related to registration and verification)
    *   `RegistrationLockManager`
    *   Database interactions related to registration lock data
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Registration Lock Implementation:**  Ensure the registration lock mechanism is robust and resistant to brute-force attacks or bypass attempts.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for account recovery and registration, requiring a second factor (e.g., a one-time code sent to a trusted device) in addition to the phone number.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Rate limit registration attempts to prevent brute-force attacks on the registration lock.
    *   **Account Recovery Procedures:**  Implement secure account recovery procedures that are resistant to social engineering and other attacks.

## Threat: [Group Messaging Vulnerabilities (Sender Keys)](./threats/group_messaging_vulnerabilities__sender_keys_.md)

* **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the implementation of Signal's group messaging protocol (Sender Keys) could allow an attacker to:
    *   Add unauthorized members to a group.
    *   Remove legitimate members from a group.
    *   Decrypt group messages without being a member.
    *   Forge messages that appear to come from a group member.
* **Impact:**  Compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of group communications.  Loss of trust in the group messaging feature.
* **Signal-Server Component Affected:**
    *   `GroupManager`
    *   `SenderKeyStore`
    *   `GroupCipher`
    *   Methods related to group creation, membership management, and message processing within `MessageServlet` and related components.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Code Review:**  Conduct rigorous code reviews of the group messaging implementation, focusing on security-critical areas.
    *   **Formal Verification (Ideal):**  If feasible, use formal verification techniques to prove the correctness and security of the group messaging protocol implementation.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Include group messaging in regular security audits.
    *   **Testing:**  Extensive testing, including fuzzing and penetration testing, specifically targeting the group messaging functionality.
    *   **Stay Updated:**  Monitor for any security advisories or updates related to Signal's group messaging protocol.
