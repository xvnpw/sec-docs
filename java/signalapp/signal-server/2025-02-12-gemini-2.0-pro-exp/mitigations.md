## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_rate_limiting_and_abuse_prevention__server-side_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Implement multi-layered rate limiting and abuse prevention mechanisms *within the server logic*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **IP-Based Rate Limiting:**  Limit requests (registration, message sending, etc.) from a single IP address within a time window *at the server level*. Use algorithms like sliding windows or token buckets, implemented in the server's request handling code.
    2.  **Phone Number-Based Rate Limiting:** Limit registration attempts/verification code requests for a phone number within a time window.  This logic *must* reside on the server to be effective.
    3.  **Account-Based Rate Limiting:** Limit actions a single account can perform within a time window, enforced by server-side checks.
    4.  **CAPTCHA/Challenge-Response (Server-Side Trigger):**  The *decision* to present a CAPTCHA and the *validation* of the CAPTCHA response must be handled by the server. The server triggers the client to display the CAPTCHA based on rate limiting or other abuse detection logic.
    5.  **Time-Based Lockouts (Server-Enforced):**  After repeated failures, the server enforces escalating lockouts, preventing further requests for a specific phone number or IP address.
    6.  **Anomaly Detection (Server-Side):**  The server monitors for unusual activity patterns and triggers alerts or automated blocking. This requires server-side logic to analyze request patterns.
    7.  **Global Rate Limits:** Implement overall server-wide rate limits to protect against large-scale attacks. This is a server configuration and logic implementation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Registration Lock Attacks (High Severity):** Server prevents locking legitimate users out.
    *   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** Server protects itself from overload.
    *   **Account Enumeration (Medium Severity):** Server makes enumeration more difficult.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Server slows down brute-force attempts.
    *   **Spam and Abuse (Medium Severity):** Server limits abusive actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   High reduction for Registration Lock Attacks, DoS Attacks, and Brute-Force Attacks.
    *   Medium reduction for Account Enumeration and Spam/Abuse.

*   **Currently Implemented (Likely):**
    *   Basic IP and phone number rate limiting are likely present.
    *   Account-based rate limiting for message sending is probable.

*   **Missing Implementation (Potential):**
    *   Sophisticated anomaly detection, global rate limits, and dynamic CAPTCHA triggering might be incomplete.
    *   Escalating lockouts might need configuration.
    *   Consistent application across *all* API endpoints might be lacking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consistent and Opaque Error Handling (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/consistent_and_opaque_error_handling__server-side_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  The server returns generic, consistent error responses, avoiding information leakage.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Information Leakage:**  Server responses *never* reveal whether a phone number is registered, a username exists, or a password is correct.
    2.  **Generic Responses:**  The server uses responses like "Request processed" or "Invalid request" for both success/failure, where revealing success/failure would leak information.
    3.  **Consistent Timing (Server-Side):**  The server ensures consistent response times for success/failure to prevent timing attacks.  This may involve adding artificial delays *on the server*.
    4.  **Internal Logging:**  The server logs detailed error information *internally* for debugging, but never exposes it to the client.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Account Enumeration (Medium Severity):** Server prevents revealing registered phone numbers.
    *   **Username Enumeration (Medium Severity):** Server prevents revealing valid usernames.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Server makes it harder to determine password correctness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   High reduction for Account and Username Enumeration.
    *   Medium reduction for Brute-Force Attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented (Likely):**
    *   Some measures to prevent account enumeration during registration are likely present.

*   **Missing Implementation (Potential):**
    *   Uniform application across *all* API endpoints might be lacking.
    *   Timing attack mitigations might be incomplete or untested.
    *   Consistency in error handling logic might be missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Verification Code Handling (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_verification_code_handling__server-side_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  The server implements a robust mechanism for generating, validating, and managing verification codes.

*   **Description:**

    *   **Replay Attacks (Medium Severity):** Server prevents code reuse.

*   **Impact:**
    *   High reduction for all listed threats.

*   **Currently Implemented (Likely):**
    *   CSPRNG, short expiration, and limited attempts are likely implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation (Potential):**
    *   Code length and attempt limits might need review.
    *   CSPRNG implementation and seeding might need auditing.
    *   TOTP implementation might be missing.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  The server enforces message uniqueness and ordering.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Unique Message IDs:**  The server *validates* (and potentially generates) unique message IDs, scoped by device and session.  It rejects duplicates.
    2.  **Server-Side Timestamping:**  The server generates timestamps for all messages using a trusted time source.
    3.  **Timestamp Validation:** The server *validates* client-provided timestamps (within a reasonable range) to prevent manipulation.
    4.  **Out-of-Order Rejection:**  The server rejects messages that are significantly out of order (based on timestamp) or have duplicate IDs.
    5.  **Session Management (Server-Side):**  The server implements robust session management, invalidating sessions and ensuring new sessions have fresh keys and ID sequences.

    2.  **Metadata Minimization:**  The server stores only essential metadata for routing and delivery.
    3.  **Encryption at Rest:**  The server encrypts *all* stored data, including metadata and temporary message storage.
    4.  **Key Management (Server-Side):**  The server uses a robust key management system to protect encryption keys (ideally with an HSM, although HSM control is often outside the direct `signal-server` code).  Key rotation policies are enforced *by the server*.
    5.  **Access Control (Server-Side):**  The server software enforces strict access controls to limit data access, even for internal processes.
