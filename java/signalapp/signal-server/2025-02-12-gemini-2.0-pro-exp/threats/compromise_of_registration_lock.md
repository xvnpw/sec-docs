Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Compromise of Registration Lock" threat for a Signal-Server based application.

## Deep Analysis: Compromise of Registration Lock

### 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Compromise of Registration Lock" threat, identify potential vulnerabilities within the Signal-Server codebase and related systems, and propose concrete, actionable recommendations to strengthen the security posture against this specific threat.  We aim to go beyond the high-level mitigations and delve into specific implementation details.

### 2. Scope

This analysis will focus on the following areas:

*   **Code Review:**  In-depth examination of the `AccountServlet`, `RegistrationLockManager`, and related database interaction code within the Signal-Server repository (https://github.com/signalapp/signal-server).  This includes analyzing the logic for setting, verifying, and enforcing the registration lock.
*   **Data Flow Analysis:**  Tracing the flow of data related to registration lock, from user input to database storage and retrieval, to identify potential injection points or logic flaws.
*   **Attack Surface Analysis:**  Identifying all potential entry points and methods an attacker might use to attempt to bypass or disable the registration lock. This includes considering both direct attacks on the server and indirect attacks (e.g., social engineering).
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Examining the security of third-party libraries and dependencies used in the registration and registration lock processes.
*   **Deployment Environment:**  Considering the security of the server environment, including operating system, network configuration, and database security, as they relate to this specific threat.  We will *not* cover general server hardening, but only aspects directly relevant to registration lock compromise.

### 3. Methodology

We will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Static Code Analysis:**  Using automated tools (e.g., FindBugs, SpotBugs, SonarQube, Semgrep) and manual code review to identify potential vulnerabilities such as:
    *   **Injection Flaws:** SQL injection, command injection, etc., that could allow manipulation of registration lock data.
    *   **Logic Errors:**  Flaws in the registration lock verification logic that could allow bypassing the lock.
    *   **Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions:**  Vulnerabilities where the state of the registration lock changes between the time it's checked and the time it's used.
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  Issues with handling numeric values related to registration lock attempts or timers.
    *   **Improper Error Handling:**  Error conditions that could leak information or allow bypassing the lock.
    *   **Insecure Cryptography:**  Weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms or key management used for registration lock (if any).
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Using fuzzing techniques to send malformed or unexpected input to the registration and verification endpoints to identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior that could indicate vulnerabilities.  Tools like AFL, libFuzzer, or custom fuzzers could be used.
*   **Threat Modeling (STRIDE/DREAD):**  Re-evaluating the threat using STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability) to ensure all aspects of the threat are considered.
*   **Penetration Testing (Ethical Hacking):**  Simulating real-world attacks against a test environment to attempt to bypass the registration lock. This would involve both automated and manual testing.
*   **Dependency Scanning:**  Using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

### 4. Deep Analysis of the Threat

Now, let's dive into the specific threat analysis, building upon the provided information.

**4.1 Attack Vectors and Scenarios**

Here are several potential attack vectors, categorized by the STRIDE model:

*   **Spoofing:**
    *   **SMS Spoofing:** An attacker sends spoofed SMS messages to the Signal server, pretending to be the verification service, to manipulate the registration process.  This is less likely if Signal uses a dedicated, authenticated SMS gateway.
    *   **Client Impersonation:**  An attacker crafts a malicious client that mimics the legitimate Signal client but bypasses or manipulates the registration lock checks.

*   **Tampering:**
    *   **Database Manipulation:**  Directly modifying the database records related to registration lock (e.g., `registrationLock` table) to disable the lock for a target account. This requires compromising database access.
    *   **Request Tampering:**  Intercepting and modifying HTTP requests between the client and server during the registration process to alter the registration lock status or bypass checks.
    *   **Code Modification:**  If an attacker gains access to the server, they could modify the `AccountServlet` or `RegistrationLockManager` code to disable the lock or introduce vulnerabilities.

*   **Repudiation:** (Less directly relevant to bypassing the lock, but important for forensics)
    *   **Insufficient Logging:**  Lack of detailed logging of registration lock attempts, successes, and failures makes it difficult to detect and investigate attacks.

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Error Message Leaks:**  Error messages returned to the client during registration could reveal information about the registration lock status or internal workings, aiding an attacker.
    *   **Timing Attacks:**  Subtle differences in response times for different registration lock states could allow an attacker to infer information about the lock.
    *   **Database Leaks:**  A database breach could expose registration lock data, potentially revealing patterns or weaknesses.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Registration Lock Exhaustion:**  Repeatedly attempting to register a number with an incorrect registration lock PIN, potentially locking out the legitimate user.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Flooding the server with registration requests to overwhelm resources and prevent legitimate registrations.

*   **Elevation of Privilege:**
    *   **Exploiting a vulnerability in `AccountServlet` or `RegistrationLockManager`:**  Finding a bug that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to other accounts or server resources.

**4.2 Code-Level Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical Examples)**

Let's consider some hypothetical code-level vulnerabilities that could exist within the `AccountServlet` and `RegistrationLockManager`:

*   **`RegistrationLockManager` - TOCTOU Race Condition:**

    ```java
    // Vulnerable code example
    public boolean isRegistrationLocked(String phoneNumber) {
        RegistrationLock lock = getRegistrationLock(phoneNumber);
        if (lock == null || lock.isExpired()) {
            return false; // Lock doesn't exist or is expired
        }
        // ... some other checks ...
        return lock.isLocked();
    }

    public void register(String phoneNumber, String registrationLockPin) {
        if (isRegistrationLocked(phoneNumber)) { // Check 1
            if (!verifyRegistrationLockPin(phoneNumber, registrationLockPin)) {
                // Incorrect PIN
                return;
            }
        }
        // ... proceed with registration ... // Check 2 (missing)
    }
    ```

    In this example, an attacker could exploit a race condition.  If the lock expires *between* the `isRegistrationLocked()` check and the actual registration process, the attacker could register the number without knowing the PIN.  The fix is to re-check the lock status *immediately* before proceeding with registration, ideally within a synchronized block or database transaction.

*   **`AccountServlet` - SQL Injection:**

    ```java
    // Vulnerable code example
    public void setRegistrationLock(String phoneNumber, String registrationLockPin) {
        String sql = "UPDATE users SET registration_lock_pin = '" + registrationLockPin + "' WHERE phone_number = '" + phoneNumber + "'";
        // ... execute the SQL query ...
    }
    ```

    This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.  If the `registrationLockPin` or `phoneNumber` is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code to bypass the lock or gain access to other data.  The fix is to use parameterized queries (prepared statements) instead of string concatenation.

*   **`AccountServlet` - Integer Overflow in Rate Limiting:**

    ```java
    // Vulnerable code example
    public boolean isRateLimited(String phoneNumber) {
        int attempts = getRegistrationAttempts(phoneNumber);
        int maxAttempts = 10; // Example limit
        if (attempts >= maxAttempts) {
            return true;
        }
        // ...
        incrementRegistrationAttempts(phoneNumber); // Could overflow if not handled
        return false;
    }
    ```
    If `incrementRegistrationAttempts` simply increments an integer without checking for overflow, an attacker could potentially cause the counter to wrap around to a small value, bypassing the rate limiting. The fix is to use a data type that can accommodate the maximum possible number of attempts or to implement proper overflow handling.

*  **`RegistrationLockManager` - Weak Hashing of PIN:**
    If the registration lock PIN is stored using a weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD5) or without a salt, it could be vulnerable to brute-force or rainbow table attacks. The fix is to use a strong, salted hashing algorithm like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt.

* **Missing Input Validation:**
    If the server doesn't properly validate the format and length of the phone number or registration lock PIN, it could be vulnerable to various injection attacks or unexpected behavior.

**4.3 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)**

Let's expand on the provided mitigation strategies with more specific recommendations:

*   **Strong Registration Lock Implementation:**
    *   **Use a Strong Hashing Algorithm:**  Store the registration lock PIN using a robust, adaptive hashing algorithm like Argon2id (recommended), bcrypt, or scrypt.  Ensure a sufficiently high work factor (cost) is used to make brute-force attacks computationally expensive.
    *   **Salt the PIN:**  Use a unique, randomly generated salt for each PIN before hashing.  Store the salt along with the hash.
    *   **Enforce PIN Complexity:**  Require a minimum PIN length and complexity (e.g., a mix of numbers, letters, and symbols).
    *   **Prevent TOCTOU Issues:**  Use database transactions or synchronized blocks to ensure that the registration lock status is checked and updated atomically.
    *   **Implement Exponential Backoff:**  After a few failed attempts, increase the delay before allowing another attempt. This makes brute-force attacks significantly slower.
    *   **Consider Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**  For extremely high-security deployments, consider using HSMs to store and manage the cryptographic keys used for registration lock.

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password):**  Integrate with a TOTP app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) to provide a second factor.
    *   **U2F/WebAuthn:**  Support hardware security keys (e.g., YubiKey) for a more secure MFA option.
    *   **Trusted Device Verification:**  Allow users to designate trusted devices.  Require MFA only when registering from a new or untrusted device.
    *   **Make MFA Mandatory for Account Recovery:**  Crucially, MFA should be *required* for account recovery, not just optional.

*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   **IP-Based Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of registration attempts from a single IP address within a given time window.
    *   **Phone Number-Based Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of registration attempts for a specific phone number, regardless of the IP address.
    *   **Global Rate Limiting:**  Limit the overall rate of registration requests to the server to prevent overload.
    *   **Use a Sliding Window:**  Implement a sliding window rate limiter to prevent attackers from circumventing the limit by waiting for the window to reset.
    *   **CAPTCHA:**  Consider using a CAPTCHA as a fallback mechanism if rate limiting is triggered.

*   **Account Recovery Procedures:**
    *   **Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA):**  Avoid relying solely on KBA (e.g., security questions) as these are often easily guessable or obtainable through social engineering.
    *   **Email/SMS Verification (with Caution):**  If using email or SMS for account recovery, implement strong security measures to prevent account takeover via email or SMS spoofing.  This includes using strong passwords, MFA for email accounts, and verifying the sender of SMS messages.
    *   **Backup Codes:**  Provide users with a set of backup codes that can be used to recover their account if they lose access to their MFA device.  These codes should be stored securely.
    *   **Human Review (for High-Risk Cases):**  For particularly sensitive accounts or suspicious recovery attempts, consider implementing a manual review process by a trained security team.

*   **Additional Security Measures:**
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input to prevent injection attacks and other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to suspicious activity.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to help protect against common web attacks, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

### 5. Conclusion

By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, and by continuously monitoring and improving the security posture of the Signal-Server, the risk of this threat can be significantly reduced.  The key is to adopt a defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple layers of security to protect against a wide range of attack vectors.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and a strong commitment to secure coding practices are essential for maintaining a robust and secure system.
