# Threat Model Analysis for signalapp/signal-server

## Threat: [Account Takeover via Signal Protocol Vulnerabilities](./threats/account_takeover_via_signal_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in the implementation of the Signal protocol within `signal-server`. This could involve manipulating key exchange processes, exploiting cryptographic flaws, or bypassing authentication checks. The attacker might gain full control of a user's account.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of a user's communication, including the ability to read past and future messages, send messages as the victim, and potentially link new devices to the account. This leads to a severe breach of confidentiality and integrity.

**Affected Component:** Registration and Authentication Modules, Session Management, potentially the Signal Protocol implementation within the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update `signal-server` to the latest stable version with security patches.
* Thoroughly review and audit the `signal-server` codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received by the server.
* Consider using formal verification methods for critical security components.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Device Linking](./threats/unauthorized_device_linking.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the device linking process of `signal-server` to link their own device to a victim's account without authorization. This could involve bypassing verification steps or exploiting flaws in the linking API.

**Impact:** The attacker gains the ability to read all messages sent and received by the victim's account on the linked device. This compromises the confidentiality of the user's communications.

**Affected Component:** Device Linking API, Registration Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong multi-factor authentication for device linking.
* Implement rate limiting on device linking requests to prevent brute-force attempts.
* Notify users of new device links and provide mechanisms to revoke unauthorized links.
* Regularly audit the device linking process for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Critical Endpoints](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__on_critical_endpoints.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods `signal-server` endpoints (e.g., registration, message sending, presence updates) with a high volume of requests, overwhelming the server's resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Inability for users to send or receive messages, register new accounts, or access other functionalities of the application relying on `signal-server`. This disrupts communication and can impact service availability.

**Affected Component:** All API endpoints, particularly those involved in core messaging functionality.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on API endpoints.
* Deploy DDoS mitigation services in front of `signal-server`.
* Implement robust input validation to prevent resource exhaustion through malformed requests.
* Monitor server resource usage and implement auto-scaling if necessary.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `signal-server` relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the server. This could involve remote code execution or other forms of attack.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the `signal-server`, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, disrupt service, or gain control of the underlying infrastructure.

**Affected Component:** All components relying on vulnerable dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for `signal-server` dependencies.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
* Promptly update vulnerable dependencies to patched versions.
* Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability alerts.

## Threat: [Server-Side Message Manipulation (if encryption is improperly handled)](./threats/server-side_message_manipulation__if_encryption_is_improperly_handled_.md)

**Description:** While the Signal protocol aims for end-to-end encryption, vulnerabilities in how `signal-server` handles encrypted messages *before* or *after* end-to-end encryption could allow an attacker with access to the server to manipulate message content. This is a less likely scenario given the protocol's design but is a potential risk if implementation flaws exist.

**Impact:** Compromise of message integrity, where attackers can alter messages without the sender or receiver being aware. This can lead to misinformation and trust issues.

**Affected Component:** Message Delivery System, potentially encryption/decryption modules if server-side processing occurs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly adhere to the Signal protocol specifications.
* Minimize server-side processing of encrypted message content.
* Implement integrity checks on messages where possible.
* Regularly audit the message handling pipeline for potential vulnerabilities.
