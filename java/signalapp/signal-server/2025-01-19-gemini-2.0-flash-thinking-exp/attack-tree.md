## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in Signal-Server](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses_in_signal-server.md)

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in Signal-Server:**
    *   This represents a fundamental weakness in how the Signal-Server verifies user identity and grants access to resources. Exploiting this can allow attackers to bypass security measures and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerability in Login Process](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vulnerability_in_login_process.md)

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerability in Login Process:**
    *   This focuses on flaws in the mechanism used to authenticate users. Vulnerabilities here can allow attackers to log in as legitimate users without knowing their actual credentials.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Brute-force/Dictionary Attack on User Credentials:**
        *   Attackers attempt to guess user passwords by trying a large number of possibilities.
            *   **Target Specific Usernames:** Attackers may focus on known or commonly used usernames within the application.
            *   **Utilize Common Password Lists:** Attackers use lists of frequently used passwords to increase their chances of success, especially if users choose weak passwords.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Logic Flaws in Password Reset Mechanism:**
        *   Attackers exploit weaknesses in the process that allows users to reset their forgotten passwords.
            *   **Manipulate Password Reset Token Generation/Validation:** Attackers might try to generate valid reset tokens for other users or bypass the validation process to gain control of their accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure Default Configurations:**
    *   This highlights the risk of using default settings that are often insecure.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Access Administrative Interfaces with Default Credentials:**
        *   If administrative interfaces are accessible and default usernames and passwords have not been changed, attackers can easily gain full control over the Signal-Server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Message Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_message_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Message Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    *   This category focuses on weaknesses in how the Signal-Server processes and manages messages.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Server-Side Key Storage:**
        *   If the Signal-Server stores encryption keys server-side (which is generally discouraged for end-to-end encrypted systems but might exist for certain features), attackers could gain access to these keys.
            *   **Access Database or File System Containing Encryption Keys:** Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in the database or file system where keys are stored to retrieve them, allowing them to decrypt messages.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Send Malicious Messages:**
        *   Attackers can craft messages that exploit vulnerabilities in the message processing logic.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
                *   If the Signal-Server doesn't properly validate and sanitize message content, attackers can inject malicious code.
                    *   **Inject Malicious Payloads (e.g., XSS, Command Injection - if server-side processing):** This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting attacks affecting other users or, if the server processes message content, command injection allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities in Signal-Server Code](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_in_signal-server_code.md)

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities in Signal-Server Code:**
    *   This encompasses vulnerabilities within the Signal-Server's own codebase or its dependencies.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
        *   Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Unpatched Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities:**
                *   If the Signal-Server uses third-party libraries with known security flaws, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Identify and Exploit Vulnerable Libraries:** Attackers scan for and exploit known vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by the Signal-Server.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):**
        *   Attackers aim to make the Signal-Server unavailable to legitimate users.
            *   **Exploit Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities:**
                *   Attackers send requests that consume excessive server resources, leading to service disruption.
                    *   **Send Excessive Requests to Specific Endpoints:** Flooding specific server endpoints with requests can overwhelm the server and make it unresponsive.
