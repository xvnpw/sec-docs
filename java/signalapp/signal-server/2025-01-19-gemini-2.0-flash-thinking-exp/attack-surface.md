# Attack Surface Analysis for signalapp/signal-server

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_api_endpoints.md)

* **Description:** API endpoints within `signal-server` that lack proper authentication or use weak authentication mechanisms allow unauthorized access to server functionality and data.
    * **How Signal-Server Contributes:** `signal-server` itself implements and exposes various API endpoints for core functionalities like user registration, message delivery, and group management. Weaknesses here directly expose the server.
    * **Example:** An attacker could directly call `signal-server`'s `/register` endpoint to create fraudulent accounts or exploit a vulnerability in the `/message` endpoint to send unauthorized messages.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to user accounts and messages, spam and abuse on the platform.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) directly within `signal-server`'s API layer. Enforce strong password policies and secure password hashing. Thoroughly audit and test all API endpoints for authentication and authorization flaws. Implement multi-factor authentication where feasible within the `signal-server` context.

## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in API Requests](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_api_requests.md)

* **Description:** Failure to properly validate data sent to `signal-server` through its API requests can lead to injection attacks and unexpected behavior within the server.
    * **How Signal-Server Contributes:** `signal-server` directly processes user-provided data from API requests. Insufficient validation in its code can allow malicious payloads to be processed.
    * **Example:** An attacker could send a crafted message through `signal-server`'s messaging API containing SQL injection code that targets the server's database. They could also send malformed data that causes the server to crash or behave unexpectedly.
    * **Impact:** SQL Injection leading to database compromise, Command Injection on the server, Denial of Service (DoS) against `signal-server`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization within `signal-server`'s code for all API endpoints. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions. Enforce data type and length restrictions on input fields. Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Push Notifications](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_push_notifications.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how `signal-server` generates, transmits, or handles push notifications can lead to information disclosure or manipulation.
    * **How Signal-Server Contributes:** `signal-server` is responsible for generating and sending push notifications to inform users of new messages or events. Security flaws in this process are direct vulnerabilities of the server.
    * **Example:** If `signal-server` doesn't encrypt push notification payloads properly, an attacker intercepting network traffic could read message previews. Vulnerabilities in the push notification delivery mechanism could allow attackers to spoof notifications.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure of message content, potential for phishing attacks via spoofed notifications.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Ensure `signal-server` encrypts push notification payloads end-to-end. Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for interacting with push notification services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, APNs). Implement mechanisms to verify the authenticity of push notification requests and responses.

## Attack Surface: [Database Vulnerabilities (via Signal-Server Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/database_vulnerabilities__via_signal-server_interaction_.md)

* **Description:** Weaknesses in the database used by `signal-server` can be exploited through vulnerabilities in `signal-server`'s interaction with it.
    * **How Signal-Server Contributes:** While the underlying database security is crucial, `signal-server`'s code that interacts with the database can introduce vulnerabilities like SQL injection if not properly written.
    * **Example:** A SQL injection vulnerability in `signal-server`'s message retrieval logic could allow an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database beyond their authorized access.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, loss of user data, unauthorized modification of data within the `signal-server` database.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  As mentioned above, use parameterized queries and prepared statements within `signal-server`'s code. Enforce the principle of least privilege for database access from `signal-server`. Regularly audit `signal-server`'s database interaction code for potential vulnerabilities. Securely configure the underlying database server.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** `signal-server` relies on various third-party libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the server.
    * **How Signal-Server Contributes:** By including these dependencies, `signal-server` becomes vulnerable to any security flaws present in them.
    * **Example:** A critical vulnerability in a logging library used by `signal-server` could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the `signal-server`, Denial of Service (DoS), information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for `signal-server`. Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools. Prioritize updating dependencies to their latest secure versions. Implement a process for monitoring security advisories related to used libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Key Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_key_management.md)

* **Description:** Weaknesses in how `signal-server` generates, stores, or manages cryptographic keys can compromise the security of the entire system.
    * **How Signal-Server Contributes:** `signal-server` is directly involved in key generation, distribution, and potentially storage for various cryptographic operations. Flaws here directly impact the security of user communications.
    * **Example:** If `signal-server` uses a weak random number generator for key creation or stores private keys insecurely, attackers could compromise these keys and decrypt messages.
    * **Impact:** Loss of confidentiality of messages, potential for message forgery and impersonation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for key generation within `signal-server`. Store private keys securely, ideally using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves. Implement secure key exchange protocols. Follow best practices for key rotation and lifecycle management within the `signal-server` implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Signal-Server](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_targeting_signal-server.md)

* **Description:** Malicious actors can attempt to overwhelm `signal-server` with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    * **How Signal-Server Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in `signal-server`'s request handling or resource management can make it more susceptible to DoS attacks.
    * **Example:** An attacker could flood `signal-server`'s registration endpoint with bogus requests, exhausting server resources and preventing legitimate users from signing up or using the service.
    * **Impact:** Service unavailability, disruption of communication for all users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints within `signal-server`. Optimize code and infrastructure to handle a reasonable amount of traffic. Implement input validation to prevent resource exhaustion through malformed requests. Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and DDoS mitigation services in front of the `signal-server` infrastructure.
