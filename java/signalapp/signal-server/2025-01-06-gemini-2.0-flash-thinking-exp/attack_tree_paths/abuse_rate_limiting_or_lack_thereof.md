    * **High Message Volume from Single User/IP:** Monitoring the number of messages sent by a specific user or from a particular IP address within a short timeframe.
    * **Unusual Messaging Patterns:** Identifying patterns of sending messages to a large number of recipients or non-existent users.
    * **User Reporting:** Implementing mechanisms for users to report spam or abusive messaging.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Rate Limiting on Message Sending:** Implement limits on the number of messages a user can send within a specific time window.
    * **Recipient-Based Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of messages a user can send to a specific recipient within a given timeframe.
    * **Content Filtering and Analysis:** Implement mechanisms to detect and block spam or malicious content.
    * **Reputation Scoring:**  Develop a reputation scoring system for users based on their messaging behavior.
    * **Temporary Account Suspension:** Suspend accounts exhibiting abusive messaging behavior.

**3. API Endpoint Abuse:**

* **Mechanism:** An attacker repeatedly calls resource-intensive API endpoints without proper authorization or at an excessive rate. This can target endpoints related to:
    * **Profile Updates:**  Repeatedly updating profile information.
    * **Group Management:**  Creating or joining a large number of groups.
    * **Key Exchange:**  Initiating numerous key exchange requests.
    * **Device Linking:**  Attempting to link a large number of devices.
* **Impact:**
    * **Resource Exhaustion:**  Overloads the server's processing power, database, and network resources.
    * **Performance Degradation:**  Slows down the server's responsiveness for all users.
