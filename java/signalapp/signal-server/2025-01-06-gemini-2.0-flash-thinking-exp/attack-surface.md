# Attack Surface Analysis for signalapp/signal-server

## Attack Surface: [Account Takeover via Phone Number Hijacking](./attack_surfaces/account_takeover_via_phone_number_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a user's Signal account by intercepting or manipulating the phone number verification process.
*   **How Signal-Server Contributes:** The reliance on phone numbers as the primary identifier and the SMS/call-based verification mechanism are core to Signal's design and implementation within `signal-server`. Weaknesses in the code handling registration and verification directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker social engineers a mobile carrier to transfer a victim's phone number to their control. They then initiate the Signal registration process via the `signal-server`, receive the verification code, and link their device to the victim's account.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's Signal account, including access to message history, contacts, and the ability to send and receive messages on their behalf.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust rate limiting on verification attempts within `signal-server` to prevent brute-forcing.
        *   Consider multi-factor authentication options beyond SMS/phone calls (though this deviates from core Signal principles and would require modifications to `signal-server`).
        *   Implement mechanisms within `signal-server` to detect and flag suspicious account recovery attempts.
        *   Ensure secure communication with SMS gateway providers from the `signal-server`.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Device Linking](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_device_linking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker links their device to a victim's Signal account without proper authorization.
*   **How Signal-Server Contributes:** The device linking mechanism is implemented within `signal-server`. Vulnerabilities in the authorization flow or the handling of linking secrets by the server can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains physical access to a victim's device while it's unlocked and scans the "Link a Device" QR code, which interacts directly with the `signal-server` for authorization. Alternatively, vulnerabilities in the manual verification process handled by the server could be exploited remotely.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can read all messages sent and received by the victim on the linked device.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authorization checks within `signal-server` for device linking requests.
        *   Ensure that linking secrets are securely generated and transmitted by the `signal-server`.
        *   Provide users with clear visibility of linked devices and the ability to revoke access through the `signal-server`.
        *   Consider time-based limitations for the validity of linking codes/QR codes generated by the `signal-server`.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Message Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malformed_message_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted messages that exploit vulnerabilities in the message processing logic of `signal-server`.
*   **How Signal-Server Contributes:** The `signal-server` is responsible for receiving, validating, and storing messages. Bugs or vulnerabilities in the code within `signal-server` that handles message parsing and processing can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message with an unusually large size, a malformed media attachment, or specific Unicode characters that cause the `signal-server` to crash or behave unexpectedly.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service of the `signal-server`, potential data corruption within the server's storage, or even remote code execution on the server if vulnerabilities are severe enough.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all incoming messages within the `signal-server` codebase.
        *   Conduct thorough fuzzing and security testing of the message processing logic in `signal-server`.
        *   Implement proper error handling and resource management within `signal-server` to prevent crashes.
        *   Keep dependencies related to message processing used by `signal-server` updated.
