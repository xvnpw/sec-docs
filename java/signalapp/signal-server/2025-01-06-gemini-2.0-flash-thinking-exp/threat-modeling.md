# Threat Model Analysis for signalapp/signal-server

## Threat: [Mass Account Registration Abuse](./threats/mass_account_registration_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in the Signal-Server's registration process to automatically create a large number of accounts. This bypasses or overwhelms security measures like CAPTCHA or rate limiting implemented on the server.
*   **Impact:** Resource exhaustion on the Signal-Server (database, network), enabling spam and abuse by the created accounts, potentially disrupting legitimate user registration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Account Takeover via Brute-Force or Credential Stuffing](./threats/account_takeover_via_brute-force_or_credential_stuffing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets the Signal-Server's authentication API, attempting to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by trying numerous password combinations (brute-force) or using lists of known username/password pairs (credential stuffing) against the server's login endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user messages, profile information, and linked devices managed by the Signal-Server; impersonation of the user; potential for sending malicious messages or performing unauthorized actions through the compromised account.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Device Linking Abuse](./threats/device_linking_abuse.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Signal-Server's device linking protocol to link unauthorized devices to a legitimate user's account without their consent. This directly targets the server's mechanism for managing authorized devices.
*   **Impact:** Interception of messages intended for the legitimate user, ability to send messages as the legitimate user via the Signal-Server, access to user data synchronized through the server to the linked device.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Metadata Leakage through Signal-Server Vulnerabilities](./threats/metadata_leakage_through_signal-server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability within the Signal-Server's codebase or configuration allows an attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to stored metadata. This directly exploits weaknesses in how the server handles and protects this information.
*   **Impact:** Revelation of communication patterns, social connections, and user activity logs managed by the Signal-Server, potentially leading to privacy breaches and targeted attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_message_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Signal-Server by sending a massive number of messages, exploiting the server's message processing and delivery mechanisms. This directly targets the server's ability to handle legitimate traffic.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, preventing legitimate users from sending or receiving messages through the Signal-Server, potentially leading to server instability or crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Compromise of Signal-Server Dependencies](./threats/compromise_of_signal-server_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** The Signal-Server relies on various third-party libraries and dependencies. An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in these dependencies that are directly integrated into the Signal-Server, potentially gaining control or access through these weaknesses.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts, from data breaches and service disruption to complete Signal-Server compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the affected dependency).

## Threat: [Internal Signal-Server API Abuse (if exposed)](./threats/internal_signal-server_api_abuse__if_exposed_.md)

*   **Description:** If the Signal-Server exposes internal APIs for management or other purposes, an attacker with sufficient access (e.g., through a compromised administrator account or internal network access) exploits vulnerabilities in these APIs to perform unauthorized actions directly on the server.
*   **Impact:** Server misconfiguration, data manipulation within the Signal-Server's data stores, privilege escalation allowing further control over the server, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Data Storage Compromise (Metadata on Signal-Server)](./threats/data_storage_compromise__metadata_on_signal-server_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Signal-Server's data storage containing metadata (e.g., through a database vulnerability directly affecting the Signal-Server's database instance or compromised credentials used by the server). While message content is encrypted, this attack targets the server's management of metadata.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of communication patterns, social connections, timestamps, and other metadata managed by the Signal-Server, potentially leading to privacy breaches and targeted attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
