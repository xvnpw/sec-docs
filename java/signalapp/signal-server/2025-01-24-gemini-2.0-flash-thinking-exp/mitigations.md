# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for signalapp/signal-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Phone Number Verification (Signal-Server Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_phone_number_verification__signal-server_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Robust Phone Number Verification (Signal-Server Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rate Limiting in Signal-Server:**  Utilize `signal-server`'s configuration options (if available, or through reverse proxy in front of it) to implement rate limiting on the phone number verification endpoints (`/v1/register`, `/v1/verify`).  This limits the number of verification requests from the same IP address or phone number within a specific time window.
    2.  **Implement CAPTCHA before Signal-Server Verification:**  Integrate a CAPTCHA challenge *before* the request reaches `signal-server`'s verification endpoint. This is typically done at the application level or a reverse proxy sitting in front of `signal-server`.  The CAPTCHA response must be validated before forwarding the verification request to `signal-server`.
    3.  **Review Signal-Server's Verification Logic:**  If extending or modifying `signal-server`, carefully review the phone number verification code for any logical vulnerabilities or bypasses. Ensure the verification process is robust and resistant to manipulation.
    4.  **Monitor Verification Logs in Signal-Server:**  Actively monitor `signal-server`'s logs for suspicious verification attempts, such as high volumes of requests from single IPs or for sequential phone numbers. Configure alerts for anomalies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-force Phone Number Enumeration (High Severity):** Attackers attempting to discover valid phone numbers registered within the Signal ecosystem via `signal-server`.
    *   **SMS Bombing/Spam via Verification Endpoint (Medium Severity):** Attackers abusing `signal-server`'s verification endpoint to trigger SMS bombing attacks on target phone numbers.
    *   **Automated Account Creation on Signal Platform (Medium Severity):** Bots attempting to create numerous Signal accounts by bypassing or exploiting weaknesses in `signal-server`'s verification process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-force Phone Number Enumeration (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the effectiveness of enumeration attacks targeting Signal user base.
    *   **SMS Bombing/Spam via Verification Endpoint (Medium Impact):** Makes SMS bombing attacks through `signal-server`'s verification endpoint more difficult and costly.
    *   **Automated Account Creation on Signal Platform (Medium Impact):** Deters automated account creation attempts on the Signal platform.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Likely partially implemented within `signal-server` or its ecosystem components, but the effectiveness and configurability might vary. Requires review and potentially hardening at reverse proxy level.
    *   **CAPTCHA:**  Not typically implemented directly within the core `signal-server` codebase. Usually handled by client applications or intermediary services before interacting with `signal-server`.
    *   **Verification Logic Review:**  Signal Foundation likely conducts ongoing reviews of the core `signal-server` verification logic.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Fine-grained Rate Limiting Configuration in Signal-Server:**  More granular rate limiting options directly configurable within `signal-server` itself might be beneficial.
    *   **Direct CAPTCHA Integration in Signal-Server API:** While client-side CAPTCHA is common, server-side enforcement or API-level integration within `signal-server` could enhance robustness.
    *   **Public Documentation on Recommended Verification Hardening for Deployers:** Clearer documentation from Signal Foundation on best practices for hardening phone number verification when deploying `signal-server` would be valuable.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Database Security Hardening (Signal-Server Database)](./mitigation_strategies/database_security_hardening__signal-server_database_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Database Security Hardening (Signal-Server Database)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Patch Signal-Server Database:** Ensure the database system used by `signal-server` (typically PostgreSQL) is regularly patched with the latest security updates. Follow the database vendor's security advisories and release notes.
    2.  **Implement Strong Database User Authentication:** Enforce strong password policies for all database users accessing the `signal-server` database. Use password complexity requirements and regular password rotation. Consider using certificate-based authentication for enhanced security.
    3.  **Restrict Database Access (Network Level):** Configure firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to restrict database access to only authorized services and IP addresses that need to connect to the `signal-server` database.  Ideally, only the `signal-server` application server should be able to connect directly to the database.
    4.  **Enable Database Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Enable encryption at rest for the database storage volumes to protect data if physical storage is compromised. Enable encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) for all connections between `signal-server` and the database to prevent eavesdropping.
    5.  **Regular Database Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the `signal-server` database configuration and access controls. Use database security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Database Breach and Data Exfiltration (Critical Severity):** Attackers gaining unauthorized access to the `signal-server` database and exfiltrating sensitive user data, including potentially metadata and message-related information (depending on `signal-server` configuration and data storage practices).
    *   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Although Signal protocol aims for end-to-end encryption, vulnerabilities in `signal-server`'s database interactions could potentially lead to SQL injection if not properly handled in custom extensions or modifications.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Database (Medium Severity):** Attackers exploiting weak database user permissions or vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges within the database system, potentially leading to data manipulation or further system compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Database Breach and Data Exfiltration (Critical Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of a successful database breach and minimizes the potential damage if a breach occurs.
    *   **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Mitigates the risk of SQL injection attacks targeting the `signal-server` database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Database (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of attackers escalating privileges within the database system.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Regular Patching (Likely - Best Practice):** Signal Foundation likely follows best practices for patching the database infrastructure used for their services. For self-deployed instances, this is the responsibility of the deployer.
    *   **Strong Authentication (Likely - Best Practice):** Strong authentication practices are generally expected for production database deployments.
    *   **Network Access Control (Likely - Best Practice):** Network-level access controls are standard security practice for databases.
    *   **Encryption in Transit (Likely - Best Practice):** Encryption in transit is a common best practice and likely implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Encryption at Rest (Potentially):**  Encryption at rest might not be enabled by default in all deployment scenarios and needs to be explicitly configured.
    *   **Regular Database Security Audits (Variable):**  The frequency and rigor of database security audits might vary depending on the deployment environment and security policies.
    *   **Automated Database Vulnerability Scanning (Potentially):**  Automated vulnerability scanning of the `signal-server` database might not be consistently implemented in all deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention (Signal-Server API)](./mitigation_strategies/api_rate_limiting_and_abuse_prevention__signal-server_api_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** API Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention (Signal-Server API)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Rate Limiting for Signal-Server API Endpoints:**  Implement rate limiting specifically for `signal-server`'s API endpoints (e.g., `/v1/message`, `/v1/profile`, `/v1/keys`). This can be done using a reverse proxy (like Nginx or HAProxy) placed in front of `signal-server` or through a dedicated API gateway if used.
    2.  **Define Rate Limit Policies Based on Endpoint and User:**  Establish different rate limit policies for various API endpoints based on their criticality and expected usage patterns. Consider different rate limits for authenticated vs. unauthenticated requests, or for different user roles if applicable in your extended application.
    3.  **Implement Abuse Detection Logic (Custom or WAF):**  Develop or utilize abuse detection logic (potentially within a WAF or custom application code) to identify and block malicious API usage patterns. This could include detecting excessive failed requests, rapid bursts of requests, or requests with suspicious payloads.
    4.  **Log API Rate Limiting and Abuse Events:**  Ensure that rate limiting actions and abuse detection events are logged by the reverse proxy, API gateway, or `signal-server` itself. These logs are crucial for monitoring, analysis, and incident response.
    5.  **Implement Response Mechanisms for Rate Limiting:**  Configure appropriate HTTP response codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) and informative error messages when rate limits are exceeded. This helps legitimate clients understand and adjust their behavior.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Signal-Server API (High Severity):** Attackers overwhelming `signal-server`'s API endpoints with excessive requests, causing service disruption for legitimate users.
    *   **API Abuse and Exploitation of Signal-Server Functionality (Medium Severity):** Attackers abusing `signal-server`'s API for malicious purposes, such as spamming, unauthorized data access (if vulnerabilities exist in extensions), or resource exhaustion.
    *   **Brute-force Attacks via Signal-Server API (Medium Severity):** Attackers attempting brute-force attacks (e.g., password guessing, key enumeration) through `signal-server`'s API endpoints if such endpoints are exposed or vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Signal-Server API (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the impact of DoS attacks targeting `signal-server`'s API, maintaining service availability for legitimate users.
    *   **API Abuse and Exploitation of Signal-Server Functionality (High Impact):** Prevents or significantly reduces API abuse, protecting `signal-server` resources and functionalities from malicious exploitation.
    *   **Brute-force Attacks via Signal-Server API (Medium Impact):** Makes brute-force attacks via `signal-server`'s API less effective by limiting the rate of attempts.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Basic Rate Limiting (Potentially):**  `signal-server` itself might have some basic internal rate limiting mechanisms. Reverse proxies or API gateways deployed in front of it are more likely to provide robust rate limiting capabilities.
    *   **Logging (Likely):**  `signal-server` likely has logging capabilities that can be configured to capture API access and potential abuse attempts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Fine-grained Rate Limiting Configuration for Signal-Server API:**  More configurable and granular rate limiting policies specifically tailored to different `signal-server` API endpoints might be needed.
    *   **Advanced Abuse Detection for Signal-Server API:**  More sophisticated abuse detection logic beyond basic rate limiting, potentially integrated with a WAF or custom application layer, could enhance protection.
    *   **Centralized API Rate Limiting Management:**  If multiple `signal-server` instances or related services are deployed, a centralized API gateway or rate limiting management system would be beneficial.
