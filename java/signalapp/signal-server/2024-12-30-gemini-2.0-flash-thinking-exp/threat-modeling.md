Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical severity threats directly involving `signal-server`:

*   **Threat:** Compromised Registration Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a user's registration credentials (e.g., phone number verification code, registration token) due to vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the `signal-server` registration process. The attacker could then complete the registration process as the victim, potentially intercepting messages intended for them.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to communication, impersonation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Registration API, Phone Number Verification Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust phone number verification mechanisms with time limits and protection against brute-force attacks within `signal-server`.
        *   Consider multi-factor authentication for registration within `signal-server` if feasible.
        *   Implement rate limiting on registration attempts within `signal-server`.

This could be achieved through SQL injection, insecure API endpoints exposed by `signal-server`, or unauthorized access to the database managed by `signal-server`.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of communication patterns, social connections, and potentially sensitive information about user activity, even if message content remains encrypted.
    *   **Affected Component:** Message Handling Components within `signal-server`, Database managed by `signal-server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement secure coding practices within `signal-server` to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce strict access controls on the database and API endpoints within `signal-server`.
        *   Minimize the amount of metadata stored by `signal-server` and consider anonymization techniques where possible.
        *   Regularly audit database access and API usage within `signal-server`.

*   **Threat:** Message Queue Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the message queueing system used by `signal-server` due to vulnerabilities in its integration or configuration. They could then manipulate the queue to drop messages, reorder them, or inject malicious messages.
    *   **Impact:** Message loss, disruption of communication, potential for injecting malicious content or triggering unintended actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Message Queueing System integration within `signal-server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the message queueing system with strong authentication and authorization within the `signal-server` context.
        *   Implement message integrity checks within `signal-server` to detect tampering.
        *   Monitor the message queue for unusual activity from the `signal-server` side.
        *   Ensure proper configuration and hardening of the message queue infrastructure used by `signal-server`.

*   **Threat:** Storage Vulnerabilities Leading to Message Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the storage mechanisms used by `signal-server` (e.g., database, file system for media) to gain unauthorized access to stored messages or media files. This could involve exploiting database vulnerabilities, file system permissions issues within the `signal-server` environment, or insecure storage configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive message content and media, compromising user privacy and confidentiality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Database managed by `signal-server`, Media Storage Components within `signal-server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong encryption for data at rest within the `signal-server` storage.
        *   Enforce strict access controls on the database and file system used by `signal-server`.
        *   Regularly patch and update the database and storage systems used by `signal-server`.
        *   Conduct regular security audits of storage configurations within the `signal-server` environment.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Message Flooding
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of messages to the `signal-server`, overwhelming its resources and causing service disruption for legitimate users. This could exploit a lack of proper rate limiting or resource management within `signal-server`.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, inability for users to send or receive messages.
    *   **Affected Component:** Message Handling Components within `signal-server`, Rate Limiting Mechanisms within `signal-server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust rate limiting on message sending within `signal-server`.
        *   Implement mechanisms within `signal-server` to detect and block malicious traffic sources.
        *   Ensure sufficient server resources and scalability for the `signal-server` to handle expected traffic loads.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Server Keys
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `signal-server`'s private keys used for cryptographic operations. This could happen through insecure key storage within the `signal-server` environment, vulnerabilities in the server's operating system hosting `signal-server`, or insider threats.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to decrypt past and potentially future messages, impersonate the server, compromise the integrity of the entire system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Key Management System within `signal-server`, Cryptographic Modules within `signal-server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store server keys securely using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key management systems integrated with `signal-server`.
        *   Implement strict access controls for key management within the `signal-server` environment.

        *   Monitor access to and usage of server keys within the `signal-server` environment.

*   **Threat:** Unsecured Administrative Interface
    *   **Description:** The administrative interface of `signal-server` is not properly secured, allowing unauthorized access. This could be due to weak default credentials, lack of multi-factor authentication for the `signal-server` admin interface, or exposure of the interface to the public internet.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, ability to modify configurations, access sensitive data, and disrupt service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Administrative Interface of `signal-server`, Authentication and Authorization Modules within `signal-server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong passwords for administrative accounts of `signal-server`.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication for administrative access to `signal-server`.
