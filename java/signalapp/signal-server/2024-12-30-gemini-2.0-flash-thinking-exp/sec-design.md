## Project Design Document: Signal Server (Improved)

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a detailed architectural design of the Signal Server, based on the open-source project available at [https://github.com/signalapp/signal-server](https://github.com/signalapp/signal-server). This document aims to provide a comprehensive and improved understanding of the server's components, their interactions, and the overall system architecture. It will serve as a robust foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities.

**1.1. Purpose**

The primary purpose of this document is to clearly and comprehensively articulate the design of the Signal Server. This enhanced clarity will enable stakeholders, particularly security engineers, to gain a deeper understanding of the system's structure and identify potential security vulnerabilities with greater precision.

**1.2. Scope**

This document focuses on the server-side architecture of the Signal messaging platform. It covers the core components responsible for handling user registration, message delivery, group management, profile management, and other server-side functionalities. Client applications (iOS, Android, Desktop) are considered external entities and are not within the scope of this document, except where their interactions with the server are directly relevant to understanding server-side processes.

**1.3. Audience**

This document is intended for:

*   Security engineers involved in threat modeling, security architecture reviews, and penetration testing.
*   Software architects and developers working on, integrating with, or extending the Signal Server.
*   Operations engineers responsible for the deployment, maintenance, monitoring, and scaling of the Signal Server infrastructure.

**2. System Overview**

The Signal Server acts as the central, privacy-focused hub for routing end-to-end encrypted messages between Signal users. It securely manages user identities, device registrations, cryptographic key material (for session establishment, though not message content), and group memberships. Critically, the server is designed to have no access to the plaintext content of messages due to the implementation of the Signal Protocol.

**5. Security Considerations**

This section outlines key security considerations for the Signal Server, providing more specific examples where applicable.

*   **End-to-End Encryption (Signal Protocol):** The fundamental security mechanism, ensuring only communicating parties can decrypt messages. The server's role is to facilitate the secure exchange of these encrypted messages, not to decrypt them.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Strong password policies and enforcement.
    *   Secure storage of credentials using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., Argon2id) with unique salts.
    *   Implementation of robust session management using secure tokens (e.g., JWTs with appropriate expiration and refresh mechanisms).
    *   Authorization checks at the API Gateway and within backend services to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to.
*   **Secure Storage of Credentials:** Employing encryption at rest for the Database (User Credentials) using technologies like Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
*   **Protection of Encryption Keys (Server-Side):** While the server doesn't have access to message content keys, it manages pre-keys and signed pre-keys. Secure generation, storage, and access control for these keys within the Key Distribution Service are critical.
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation and sanitization of all input received from clients at the API Gateway and within backend services to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implementing aggressive rate limiting at the API Gateway to protect against denial-of-service attacks, brute-force attacks, and abuse.
*   **Secure Communication Channels:** Enforcing HTTPS with TLS 1.3 or higher for all client-server communication, ensuring proper certificate management and configuration.
*   **Database Security:**
    *   Implementing network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to database servers.
    *   Employing the principle of least privilege for database user accounts.
    *   Regularly patching and updating database software.
    *   Implementing encryption at rest for all databases containing sensitive information.
    *   Performing regular database backups and ensuring their secure storage.
*   **Logging and Auditing:** Comprehensive logging of important events, including authentication attempts, API requests, and security-related actions, for security monitoring, intrusion detection, and incident response. Secure storage and access control for audit logs.
*   **Dependency Management:** Maintaining a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and regularly scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Implementing a process for promptly patching or mitigating identified vulnerabilities.
*   **Push Notification Security:** Secure handling and storage of device tokens. Using authenticated and encrypted communication channels with push notification providers.
*   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conducting regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

**6. Assumptions and Constraints**

*   **Secure Infrastructure:** It is assumed that the underlying server infrastructure (hardware, operating systems, network) is securely configured and maintained.
*   **Trust in External Services:** The design relies on the security and availability of external services such as push notification providers.
*   **Client Application Security:** While out of scope, the security of the Signal client applications is crucial for the overall security of the platform. It is assumed that clients properly implement the Signal Protocol and handle key material securely.
*   **Scalability and High Availability:** The design should be implemented with scalability and high availability in mind, although specific implementation details are not the primary focus of this document.
