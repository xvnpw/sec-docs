# Deep Analysis: Deserialization of Untrusted Data in Apache Commons Lang

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Deserialization of Untrusted Data" attack surface related to the use of `org.apache.commons.lang.SerializationUtils` in Apache Commons Lang.  We aim to:

*   Understand the precise mechanisms by which this vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Identify specific code patterns that are particularly vulnerable.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies.
*   Provide concrete recommendations for developers to avoid or remediate this vulnerability.
*   Determine the limitations of `SerializationUtils` and when alternative solutions are mandatory.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   The `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` and `SerializationUtils.clone()` methods in Apache Commons Lang (versions that include these methods â€“ note that `SerializationUtils` was deprecated in 3.x and later removed).  We will consider both direct use and indirect use through other libraries or frameworks.
*   Java Object Serialization as the underlying mechanism.
*   Scenarios where the application receives serialized data from external, untrusted sources (e.g., HTTP requests, message queues, file uploads).
*   The impact of this vulnerability on application security, specifically focusing on Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   Mitigation strategies that are practical and effective within the context of using (or choosing *not* to use) Commons Lang.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   Other serialization formats (e.g., JSON, XML) unless they indirectly leverage Java Object Serialization.
*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to deserialization.
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of Apache Commons Lang, except where they directly interact with the deserialization process.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examination of the source code of `SerializationUtils` to understand its internal workings and identify potential weaknesses.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  Review of known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and exploits related to Java deserialization and Apache Commons Lang.
*   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**  Creation of simple, illustrative PoC examples to demonstrate the vulnerability and the effectiveness of mitigations (in a controlled environment).  This is *not* about creating weaponized exploits, but about understanding the mechanics.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:**  Review of security best practices and guidelines for secure deserialization in Java.
*   **Comparative Analysis:**  Comparison of `SerializationUtils` with more secure alternatives for deserialization.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 2.1. Mechanism of Exploitation

The core vulnerability lies in the fundamental nature of Java Object Serialization.  When an object is deserialized, the `readObject()` method of the object (and any objects it references) is executed.  An attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, performs actions unintended by the application developer.  This often involves:

1.  **Gadget Chains:**  The attacker leverages a chain of objects (a "gadget chain") whose `readObject()` methods, when called in sequence, ultimately lead to the execution of arbitrary code.  These gadgets often reside within commonly used libraries (like Apache Commons Collections, Spring Framework, etc.).  Commons Lang itself might not contain the *execution* gadget, but it provides the *entry point* for the deserialization process.
2.  **Untrusted Input:** The attacker provides this crafted serialized object as input to the application.  This could be through an HTTP request parameter, a message in a queue, a file upload, or any other mechanism where the application accepts external data.
3.  **`SerializationUtils.deserialize()` Call:** The application uses `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` to deserialize the attacker-provided data *without* validating the contents or the classes being instantiated.
4.  **Code Execution:**  The `readObject()` methods of the gadget chain are executed, leading to the attacker's desired outcome, typically Remote Code Execution (RCE).

### 2.2. Vulnerable Code Patterns

The most vulnerable pattern is the direct use of `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` with data from an untrusted source:

```java
// HIGHLY VULNERABLE - DO NOT USE
byte[] untrustedData = getUntrustedDataFromRequest(); // Example: from an HTTP request
Object obj = SerializationUtils.deserialize(untrustedData);
// At this point, arbitrary code may have already executed.
```

Even seemingly "safe" uses can be vulnerable if the deserialized object is later used in a way that triggers a gadget chain.  For example:

```java
// STILL VULNERABLE - DO NOT USE
byte[] untrustedData = getUntrustedDataFromRequest();
MyObject obj = (MyObject) SerializationUtils.deserialize(untrustedData); //Casting doesn't help
// ... later ...
obj.someMethod(); // This might trigger a gadget chain within MyObject or its dependencies.
```
Using `SerializationUtils.clone()` is also vulnerable, as it internally uses `deserialize()`:
```java
//VULNERABLE
MyObject original = ...;
MyObject cloned = (MyObject) SerializationUtils.clone(original); //If original is tainted, cloned is too.
```

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies: Detailed Evaluation

Let's examine the proposed mitigation strategies in more detail:

*   **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization:**  This is the *best* and most reliable mitigation.  If you don't need to deserialize data from untrusted sources, *don't*.  Consider alternative data formats like JSON or XML, which, while still having potential vulnerabilities, are generally easier to handle securely.  This often involves a significant architectural change.

*   **Whitelist-Based Deserialization:**  If deserialization is *unavoidable*, use a whitelist approach.  This means explicitly specifying the *exact* classes that are allowed to be deserialized.  Any attempt to deserialize a class not on the whitelist should be rejected.  *Do not rely on blacklists* (lists of forbidden classes), as attackers can often find ways to bypass them.

    *   **`ClassLoaderObjectInputStream` with Whitelist:**  Commons Lang provides `ClassLoaderObjectInputStream`, which can be used to restrict the classes that can be loaded.  However, it's crucial to understand its limitations:
        *   **Class Name Matching:**  The whitelist typically operates on class names.  An attacker might be able to find a different class with the same name in a different package that *is* vulnerable.
        *   **Gadget Chains within Whitelisted Classes:**  Even if you whitelist a class, that class itself might contain a gadget chain that can be exploited.  The whitelist only prevents the *initial* class from being unexpected; it doesn't prevent vulnerabilities within that class or its dependencies.
        *   **Configuration Complexity:**  Maintaining a comprehensive and accurate whitelist can be challenging, especially in large applications with many dependencies.

        ```java
        // BETTER, BUT STILL REQUIRES CAREFUL WHITELISTING
        Set<String> allowedClasses = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(
                "com.example.MySafeClass",
                "java.util.ArrayList",
                "java.lang.String" // Be VERY specific; avoid broad entries like "java.lang.*"
        ));

        try (ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(untrustedData);
             ClassLoaderObjectInputStream ois = new ClassLoaderObjectInputStream(
                     Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(), bais) {
                 @Override
                 protected Class<?> resolveClass(ObjectStreamClass desc) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
                     if (!allowedClasses.contains(desc.getName())) {
                         throw new InvalidClassException("Unauthorized deserialization attempt", desc.getName());
                     }
                     return super.resolveClass(desc);
                 }
             }) {
            Object obj = ois.readObject();
            // ... use obj ...
        } catch (InvalidClassException e) {
            // Handle the attempted deserialization of an unauthorized class
            log.error("Deserialization attack detected!", e);
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            // Handle other exceptions
            log.error("Deserialization error", e);
        }
        ```

*   **Look-Ahead Deserialization (Java 9+):** Java 9 introduced the `ObjectInputFilter` interface, which provides a more robust mechanism for filtering during deserialization. This allows for more fine-grained control, including checking the depth and size of the object graph. This is generally preferred over `ClassLoaderObjectInputStream`.

    ```java
    // BEST APPROACH (Java 9+)
    ObjectInputFilter filter = ObjectInputFilter.Config.createFilter(
            "maxdepth=20;maxrefs=200;maxbytes=1048576;java.util.*;com.example.MySafeClass"
    );

    try (ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(untrustedData);
         ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais)) {
        ois.setObjectInputFilter(filter);
        Object obj = ois.readObject();
        // ... use obj ...
    } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
        log.error("Deserialization error", e);
    }
    ```

*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Even with the best mitigations, it's crucial to have robust monitoring and alerting in place.  Log any attempts to deserialize unexpected classes or data.  Use security tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis) to detect potential deserialization vulnerabilities.

### 2.4. Limitations of `SerializationUtils`

The key limitation of `SerializationUtils` is that it's designed for *convenience*, not *security*.  It provides a simple API for serialization and deserialization, but it doesn't offer built-in protection against deserialization vulnerabilities.  It relies entirely on the developer to implement appropriate security measures.  `ClassLoaderObjectInputStream` is a *helper*, but it's not a complete solution.

### 2.5. Recommendations

1.  **Strongly Prefer Alternatives:**  Avoid using `SerializationUtils` for deserializing data from untrusted sources.  Prioritize using safer data formats (JSON, XML with appropriate security measures) or more secure deserialization libraries.
2.  **If Unavoidable, Use `ObjectInputFilter` (Java 9+):**  If you *must* use Java Object Serialization with untrusted data, use the `ObjectInputFilter` interface (available from Java 9 onwards) for the most robust filtering.
3.  **`ClassLoaderObjectInputStream` as a Last Resort:** If you are on an older Java version and *must* use `SerializationUtils`, use `ClassLoaderObjectInputStream` with a *very* restrictive whitelist.  Thoroughly test and audit this whitelist.
4.  **Comprehensive Testing:**  Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing and fuzzing, to identify any potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
5.  **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect and respond to any attempted deserialization attacks.
6. **Dependency Management:** Keep your dependencies, including Apache Commons Lang and any libraries that might contain gadgets, up-to-date to benefit from security patches. Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.
7. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage from a successful RCE.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Deserialization of Untrusted Data" attack surface, particularly when using `SerializationUtils` in Apache Commons Lang, presents a critical security risk.  While `SerializationUtils` simplifies serialization, it offers no inherent protection against this vulnerability.  The best mitigation is to avoid deserializing untrusted data entirely.  If that's not possible, use `ObjectInputFilter` (Java 9+) or, as a less secure alternative, `ClassLoaderObjectInputStream` with a meticulously crafted whitelist.  Continuous monitoring, logging, and security testing are essential to minimize the risk of exploitation. Developers should prioritize secure alternatives and understand the inherent dangers of Java Object Serialization when dealing with untrusted input.

This detailed analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its mechanisms, and effective mitigation strategies. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding untrusted deserialization whenever possible and provides concrete guidance for developers to secure their applications. Remember to always prioritize security over convenience when dealing with serialization.
