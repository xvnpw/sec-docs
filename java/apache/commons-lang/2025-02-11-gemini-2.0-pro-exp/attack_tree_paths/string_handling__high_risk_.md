### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

**2.1. Understanding `StrSubstitutor`**

`StrSubstitutor` is a powerful class for performing string substitution based on a map of variables or a custom `StrLookup`.  It replaces placeholders in a string with values retrieved from the provided lookup.  The core functionality is to find patterns like `${variableName}` and replace them.

**2.2. The Vulnerability: Script Injection via `StrLookup`**

The primary vulnerability arises when user-controlled input is used *directly* within the template string passed to `StrSubstitutor`, *and* a potentially dangerous `StrLookup` is used (or a vulnerable version of a built-in lookup is used).  While `StrSubstitutor` itself isn't inherently vulnerable, the *way* it's used, combined with the capabilities of the `StrLookup`, creates the risk.

**2.2.1.  Vulnerable `StrLookup` Implementations (and Versions)**

*   **`StrLookup.systemPropertiesLookup()` (All Versions):**  Allows access to system properties.  While not directly executable code, this can leak sensitive information like usernames, file paths, and environment variables.  Example: `${sys:user.home}`.

*   **`StrLookup.mapLookup()` (All Versions):**  Safe if the map is populated with trusted data.  Vulnerable if the map's *keys or values* are derived from untrusted input.

*   **`StrLookup.interpolatorLookup()` (All Versions):** This is where the most significant risks lie, especially in older versions.  It allows nested lookups and, crucially, access to other lookups like `script`, `url`, and `file`.

*   **`script` Lookup (Vulnerable in older versions, mitigated in later versions):**  Prior to Commons Lang 3.6, the `script` lookup allowed arbitrary script execution (e.g., JavaScript, Groovy) *without any restrictions*.  This was a major security flaw.  Later versions introduced the `ScriptEngineManager` and required explicit enabling of scripting.  Example (pre-3.6, or if scripting is explicitly enabled): `${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('calc.exe')}`.

*   **`url` and `file` Lookups (Potentially dangerous):**  These lookups can be used to read data from URLs or files.  While not directly code execution, they can lead to information disclosure or, in some cases, denial of service (e.g., reading from `/dev/random` or a very large file).  Example: `${url:UTF-8:https://example.com/sensitive_data.txt}`.

**2.2.2. Version-Specific Considerations**

*   **Commons Lang 3.0 - 3.5:**  Highly vulnerable due to the unrestricted `script` lookup.  Upgrade is *essential*.
*   **Commons Lang 3.6 - 3.11:**  Introduced significant security improvements, including disabling the `script` lookup by default and requiring explicit configuration.  Still, careful configuration is crucial.
*   **Commons Lang 3.12+:** Further hardening and improvements.  Staying up-to-date is always recommended.

**2.3. Attack Scenarios**

*   **Scenario 1: Information Disclosure (System Properties):**
    *   Application uses `StrSubstitutor` with `StrLookup.systemPropertiesLookup()` to format a welcome message.
    *   User input is directly included in the template string.
    *   Attacker provides input: `Hello, ${sys:user.name}! Your home directory is ${sys:user.home}.`
    *   Result: The application reveals the user's name and home directory.

*   **Scenario 2: Remote Code Execution (Pre-3.6, or with Scripting Enabled):**
    *   Application uses `StrSubstitutor` with `StrLookup.interpolatorLookup()` and an older version of Commons Lang 3.
    *   User input is directly included in the template string.
    *   Attacker provides input: `Result: ${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('notepad.exe')}`.
    *   Result: The application executes `notepad.exe` on the server.

*   **Scenario 3: Denial of Service (File Lookup):**
    *   Application uses `StrSubstitutor` with `StrLookup.interpolatorLookup()` and the `file` lookup.
    *   User input controls the file path.
    *   Attacker provides input: `Contents: ${file:/dev/random}`.
    *   Result: The application attempts to read from `/dev/random`, potentially consuming excessive resources and causing a denial of service.

* **Scenario 4: Indirect Injection via MapLookup:**
    * Application uses `StrSubstitutor` with `StrLookup.mapLookup()`.
    * The map is populated from a database, but a separate vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious values into the database.
    * Attacker injects a key-value pair into the database:  `key = "userInput", value = "${script:javascript:..."}`.
    * When the application uses `StrSubstitutor` with the template string "Your input: ${userInput}", the injected script is executed.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategies (Refined)**

1.  **Input Sanitization and Validation (Essential):**
    *   **Never** directly use user input in the template string.  This is the most critical rule.
    *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed characters for any input that *must* be used in the template.  For example, if you need to include a username, allow only alphanumeric characters and a limited set of safe punctuation.
    *   Use a regular expression to validate the input against the whitelist.

    ```java
    // Example of whitelisting for a username:
    String userInput = getUserInput(); // Assume this gets input from the user
    if (userInput.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$")) {
        // Input is considered safe (for this specific context)
        String template = "Hello, " + userInput + "!";
        // ... use StrSubstitutor safely ...
    } else {
        // Reject the input or sanitize it further (e.g., replace invalid characters)
    }
    ```

2.  **Predefined Variable Set (Highly Recommended):**
    *   Define a fixed set of allowed variables that the application will use.  Do not allow users to introduce new variable names.
    *   Populate the variable map with values that are either hardcoded or derived from trusted sources (e.g., application configuration, database queries with parameterized queries).

    ```java
    Map<String, String> valueMap = new HashMap<>();
    valueMap.put("appName", "My Application");
    valueMap.put("currentDate", LocalDate.now().toString());
    // Do NOT add user input directly to this map!

    StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(valueMap);
    String template = "Welcome to ${appName}. Today is ${currentDate}.";
    String result = sub.replace(template); // Safe
    ```

3.  **Restrictive Templating Engine (Alternative):**
    *   Consider using a more restrictive templating engine like Mustache, Velocity (with strict configuration), or Thymeleaf.  These engines often have built-in escaping mechanisms and limit the potential for code injection.  This is a good option if you need more complex templating features than simple string substitution.

4.  **Keep Commons Lang 3 Updated (Essential):**
    *   Always use the latest stable version of Commons Lang 3.  Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases.
    *   Regularly check for security advisories related to Commons Lang 3.

5.  **Disable Unnecessary Lookups (Crucial):**
    *   If you are using `StrLookup.interpolatorLookup()`, explicitly disable any lookups you don't need.  This significantly reduces the attack surface.

    ```java
    // Create an InterpolatorLookup and explicitly disable script, url, and file lookups:
    StrLookup<?> interpolatorLookup = StrLookup.interpolatorLookup();
    ((InterpolatorStringLookup) interpolatorLookup).getStringLookupMap().remove("script");
    ((InterpolatorStringLookup) interpolatorLookup).getStringLookupMap().remove("url");
    ((InterpolatorStringLookup) interpolatorLookup).getStringLookupMap().remove("file");

    StrSubstitutor sub = new StrSubstitutor(interpolatorLookup);
    // Now, even if user input contains ${script:...}, it won't be executed.
    ```

6.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they manage to exploit a vulnerability.

7.  **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Pay close attention to how user input is handled and how `StrSubstitutor` is used.

8. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * Use WAF to filter malicious requests.

**2.5. Limitations of Mitigations**

*   **Input Sanitization Complexity:**  It can be challenging to create a perfect sanitization routine that covers all possible attack vectors.  Attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass filters.
*   **Templating Engine Limitations:**  Even restrictive templating engines may have vulnerabilities or misconfiguration issues.
*   **Human Error:**  Developers may make mistakes, forgetting to apply mitigations or introducing new vulnerabilities.
* **Zero-day vulnerabilities:** New vulnerabilities can be discovered.
