## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Deserialization of untrusted data can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if vulnerable classes are present on the classpath.
*   **How Commons Lang Contributes:** Functions like `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` and `ObjectUtils.clone()` in Commons Lang facilitate object deserialization. If these functions are used to process data from untrusted sources, and the application's classpath contains classes vulnerable to deserialization attacks, it creates a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized Java object designed to execute arbitrary code. The application receives this object as input and uses `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` to process it. This action triggers the execution of the attacker's code on the server, granting them control.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is the most severe impact, allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, malware installation, and significant operational disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**  The primary and most effective mitigation is to *never* use `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` or `ObjectUtils.clone()` on data originating from untrusted sources. Re-evaluate your application's design to eliminate the need for deserializing external data using these methods.
    *   **Upgrade Commons Lang:** Ensure you are using the latest stable version of Commons Lang. While newer versions might not fully eliminate all deserialization risks if vulnerable classes exist elsewhere, they may contain fixes for specific deserialization-related issues within Commons Lang itself.
    *   **Strict Classpath Management (Dependency Security):**  Meticulously manage your application's dependencies. Identify and remove or update any libraries known to be vulnerable to deserialization exploits (e.g., older versions of Apache Commons Collections, Spring libraries, etc.). Employ dependency scanning tools to proactively detect vulnerable dependencies in your project.
    *   **Consider Safer Data Exchange Formats:** If data exchange is necessary, explore and adopt safer alternatives to Java serialization. Formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers are generally less susceptible to deserialization vulnerabilities and are often more efficient and interoperable.

## Attack Surface: [String Manipulation Misuse leading to Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/string_manipulation_misuse_leading_to_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or inconsistent use of string escaping utilities provided by Commons Lang can lead to injection vulnerabilities, primarily Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **How Commons Lang Contributes:** Commons Lang offers utilities like `StringEscapeUtils` for escaping strings for various contexts (HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSV, etc.).  If developers misuse these utilities by applying incorrect escaping for the target context, or by failing to escape data consistently before outputting it in a web page or other sensitive context, it can create XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A developer uses `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4()` to escape user input before displaying it in an HTML context. However, if the same user input is later embedded within a JavaScript block on the same page *without* using JavaScript-specific escaping (e.g., `StringEscapeUtils.escapeEcmaScript()`), an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code. This code will then execute in the user's browser when they view the page.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). XSS vulnerabilities can have a high impact, allowing attackers to hijack user sessions, steal cookies, deface websites, redirect users to malicious sites, and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within users' browsers, potentially compromising their accounts and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Context-Specific Escaping is Mandatory:**  Always escape data according to the *exact* context where it will be used.  Utilize the appropriate escaping function from `StringEscapeUtils` (or a similar library) for HTML, JavaScript, XML, and other relevant contexts.  Never assume that HTML escaping is sufficient for all situations.
    *   **Leverage Templating Engines with Automatic Contextual Escaping:** Employ templating engines that offer built-in, automatic context-aware escaping. These engines are designed to handle escaping automatically based on the output context, significantly reducing the risk of manual escaping errors and inconsistencies. Popular templating engines often provide robust auto-escaping features.
    *   **Enforce Consistent Output Encoding (e.g., UTF-8):** Ensure that your application consistently uses a proper output encoding, such as UTF-8, throughout the entire system. Mismatched or incorrect output encoding can sometimes bypass escaping mechanisms and introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Code Reviews and Static Analysis:** Conduct regular security-focused code reviews and utilize static analysis tools to identify potential areas where string manipulation and escaping might be misused or inconsistent. Static analysis tools can often automatically detect common escaping errors and highlight potential XSS vulnerabilities.
