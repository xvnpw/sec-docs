## Attack Tree Path: [0. Compromise Application Using Apache Commons Lang [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/0__compromise_application_using_apache_commons_lang__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Root goal of the attacker. Represents the overall objective of exploiting Commons Lang to compromise the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure coding practices throughout the application.
    *   Regular security assessments and penetration testing.
    *   Defense-in-depth security architecture.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability in SerializationUtils [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_deserialization_vulnerability_in_serializationutils__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting the `SerializationUtils` component for deserialization vulnerabilities. This is the primary high-risk attack vector related to Commons Lang.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate or minimize the use of `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` on untrusted input.**
    *   If deserialization is unavoidable, implement strict input validation (though extremely difficult for serialized objects).
    *   Consider using secure deserialization libraries or alternative data formats (JSON, Protobuf).
    *   Apply principle of least privilege to application processes.
    *   Regularly update Commons Lang library.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Application uses SerializationUtils.deserialize() on untrusted input [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__application_uses_serializationutils_deserialize___on_untrusted_input__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Identifying and exploiting code locations where the application uses `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` to process data from external, potentially malicious sources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code review to identify all usages of `SerializationUtils.deserialize()`.**
    *   Trace data flow to determine if input to `deserialize()` originates from untrusted sources (user input, external APIs, network data).
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization (if deserialization is absolutely necessary, but highly complex and error-prone for serialized objects).
    *   Consider architectural changes to avoid deserialization of untrusted data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Craft malicious serialized object (e.g., using ysoserial or similar tools) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__craft_malicious_serialized_object__e_g___using_ysoserial_or_similar_tools___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Creating a specially crafted serialized Java object that, when deserialized by the vulnerable application, will execute attacker-controlled code. Tools like `ysoserial` simplify this process by providing pre-built payloads and gadget chains.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if previous steps are successful)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Payload Delivery)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (Tool Usage, Gadget Chain Understanding)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Signature-based detection possible, evasion possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Address the root cause: avoid deserialization of untrusted data (mitigation for 1.1).**
    *   Implement network intrusion detection systems (IDS) or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect known malicious serialized payloads (signature-based detection).
    *   Employ anomaly detection to identify unusual deserialization patterns.
    *   Keep Java runtime and dependencies updated to patch known gadget chains (though new ones are constantly discovered).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4. Send malicious serialized object to vulnerable endpoint/code path [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4__send_malicious_serialized_object_to_vulnerable_endpointcode_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Transmitting the crafted malicious serialized object to the identified vulnerable endpoint or code path in the application, triggering the deserialization process.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if previous steps are successful)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Exploitation Trigger)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Network Monitoring, Anomaly Detection)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Address the root cause: avoid deserialization of untrusted data (mitigation for 1.1).**
    *   Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block suspicious serialized data in requests.
    *   Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns or large serialized data payloads.
    *   Rate limiting and input validation at the application entry points.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4.2. Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on server [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH IMPACT] [HIGH-RISK PATH END]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_2__achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__on_server__critical_node__high_impact___high-risk_path__c162f2f5.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successful deserialization of the malicious object leads to the execution of attacker-controlled code on the application server. This is the ultimate goal of this high-risk path, resulting in full system compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Very High (if previous steps are successful)
*   **Impact:** Critical
*   **Effort:** N/A (Outcome)
*   **Skill Level:** N/A (Outcome)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (Post-Exploitation activity)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prevent reaching this stage by effectively mitigating earlier steps, especially 1.1.**
    *   Implement robust post-exploitation detection and response mechanisms (e.g., endpoint detection and response - EDR).
    *   Regular security monitoring and incident response planning.
    *   System hardening and least privilege configurations to limit the impact of RCE.
