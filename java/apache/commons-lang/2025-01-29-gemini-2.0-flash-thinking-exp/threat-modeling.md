# Threat Model Analysis for apache/commons-lang

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can exploit the use of `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` or `ObjectUtils.clone()` with untrusted data. By crafting malicious serialized payloads and feeding them to these functions, the attacker can trigger the deserialization of harmful objects. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if classes vulnerable to deserialization attacks are present in the application's classpath. The attacker's goal is to execute arbitrary code on the server by leveraging weaknesses in the deserialization process.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise, potential data breach, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `SerializationUtils.deserialize()`, `ObjectUtils.clone()` (due to their reliance on Java serialization).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate deserialization of untrusted data:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources altogether.
    *   **Use safer data formats:** Prefer using JSON or other text-based formats for data exchange instead of Java serialization.
    *   **Implement strict input validation:** If deserialization is necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize the input data before attempting to deserialize it.
    *   **Employ a deserialization whitelist:** Restrict deserialization to a predefined set of safe classes, preventing the instantiation of potentially dangerous classes.
    *   **Keep dependencies updated:** Ensure `commons-lang` and all other libraries are updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consider alternative cloning methods:** Explore cloning mechanisms that do not rely on Java serialization if `ObjectUtils.clone()` is used.
