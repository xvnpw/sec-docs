## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Deserialization RCE via Commons Lang

This analysis delves into the specific attack path: **"Attacker crafts a malicious serialized object containing a payload that leverages Commons Lang classes to achieve RCE [CRITICAL NODE]"**, focusing on the bypass of existing security measures.

**1. Understanding the Core Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization**

The foundation of this attack lies in the inherent risks associated with deserializing untrusted data in Java. Java's object serialization allows converting objects into a byte stream for storage or transmission, and deserialization reconstructs the object from that stream. The vulnerability arises when an attacker can control the content of this byte stream, allowing them to craft malicious objects that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code.

**2. The Role of Apache Commons Lang**

Apache Commons Lang is a widely used utility library providing helper functions for core Java classes. Historically, certain classes within Commons Lang, particularly those related to reflection and dynamic method invocation, have been exploited in deserialization attacks. Key classes often involved include:

* **`org.apache.commons.collections.Transformer` implementations (often used in conjunction with Commons Collections, but the principle applies):** While technically from Commons Collections, the concept of "transformers" that manipulate objects is crucial. Specifically, classes like `InvokerTransformer`, `ConstantTransformer`, and `ChainedTransformer` can be combined to achieve arbitrary method invocation.
* **`org.apache.commons.lang3.concurrent.LazyInitializer`:**  While less common in direct RCE exploits, this class, if misused, could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or information disclosure during deserialization.
* **Other utility classes:** Depending on the application's usage of Commons Lang, other classes might be leveraged in more specific attack scenarios.

**3. Attack Breakdown: Crafting the Malicious Payload**

The attacker's goal is to construct a serialized object that, when deserialized by the target application, will execute arbitrary commands on the server. This typically involves the following steps:

* **Identifying Gadget Chains:** The attacker needs to find a "gadget chain" â€“ a sequence of method calls triggered during deserialization that ultimately leads to code execution. This often involves leveraging the `Transformer` classes mentioned above.
* **Constructing the Payload using Commons Lang:**
    * **Initial Trigger:**  The serialized object will likely contain an object from a library the application uses, whose `readObject()` method (or similar deserialization logic) initiates the gadget chain.
    * **Transformer Chain Construction:**  The attacker will use Commons Lang classes (or related classes from Commons Collections) to build a chain of transformations. For example:
        * **`ConstantTransformer(Runtime.class)`:**  Provides access to the `Runtime` class.
        * **`MethodInvoker("getMethod", new Class[]{String.class, Class[].class}, new Object[]{"getRuntime", new Class[0]})`:** Invokes the `getRuntime()` method on the `Runtime` class.
        * **`MethodInvoker("exec", new Class[]{String.class}, new Object[]{"malicious command"})`:** Invokes the `exec()` method on the `Runtime` instance with the attacker's command.
        * **`ChainedTransformer`:**  Combines these individual transformers into a single chain.
    * **Integrating the Chain:** This transformer chain is then embedded within another object that triggers its execution during deserialization. This often involves utilizing collections or other data structures that iterate over elements and apply transformations.
* **Serializing the Malicious Object:** The crafted object is then serialized into a byte stream.

**4. Delivery and Deserialization**

The attacker needs to deliver this malicious serialized object to the vulnerable application. Common delivery methods include:

* **HTTP Requests:**  Embedding the serialized object in request parameters, headers, or the request body.
* **File Uploads:**  Uploading a file containing the serialized object.
* **Database Entries:**  If the application deserializes data retrieved from a database.
* **Message Queues:**  If the application processes messages containing serialized objects.

Once the application receives the malicious serialized data and attempts to deserialize it using standard Java deserialization mechanisms (e.g., `ObjectInputStream`), the crafted object will be reconstructed, triggering the execution of the embedded payload.

**5. Bypassing Existing Security Measures**

The critical aspect of this attack path is the ability to bypass existing security measures. Here's how this can occur:

* **Sandboxing:**
    * **Insufficient Restrictions:** The sandbox might not be configured strictly enough to prevent reflection or access to critical system classes like `Runtime`.
    * **Exploiting Sandbox Weaknesses:**  Attackers might find ways to escape the sandbox environment through vulnerabilities in its implementation.
    * **Reflection Capabilities:**  Reflection, heavily utilized in deserialization exploits, can often bypass standard sandbox restrictions if not explicitly blocked.
* **Security Managers:**
    * **Permissive Policies:** The Security Manager might have overly permissive policies that allow the execution of arbitrary code.
    * **Exploiting Policy Gaps:** Attackers might find specific permissions that, when combined, allow them to achieve code execution.
    * **Default Configurations:**  Applications might rely on default Security Manager configurations, which are often not restrictive enough to prevent sophisticated attacks.
* **Input Validation:**
    * **Focus on Data Content, Not Structure:** Traditional input validation focuses on the content of data (e.g., checking for SQL injection characters). Deserialization attacks exploit the *structure* of the serialized data, which is not typically validated by standard input validation techniques.
    * **Binary Data:** Serialized data is binary, making it difficult to inspect and validate using text-based validation methods.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**
    * **Limited Deserialization Awareness:**  Many WAFs are primarily designed to analyze HTTP traffic and may not have deep inspection capabilities for serialized Java objects.
    * **Evasion Techniques:** Attackers can use various encoding and obfuscation techniques to bypass WAF signatures.
* **Lack of Deserialization Filtering:**  The application might not implement any specific mechanisms to filter or validate the types of objects being deserialized. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary classes into the deserialization process.

**6. Impact of Successful RCE**

Successful Remote Code Execution can have catastrophic consequences:

* **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker gains full control over the server, allowing them to:
    * **Steal Sensitive Data:** Access databases, configuration files, and other confidential information.
    * **Install Malware:** Deploy backdoors, ransomware, or other malicious software.
    * **Disrupt Services:**  Bring down the application or the entire system.
    * **Pivot to Other Systems:**  Use the compromised server as a launching point for attacks on other internal systems.
* **Data Breach:**  Loss of customer data, financial information, or other sensitive data, leading to legal and reputational damage.
* **Financial Losses:**  Direct financial losses due to theft, business disruption, and recovery costs.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's brand.

**7. Mitigation Strategies**

To prevent this type of attack, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:** This is the most effective defense. If possible, avoid deserializing data from external sources or untrusted clients.
* **Input Validation for Serialized Data (Difficult but Possible):** Implement mechanisms to validate the structure and content of serialized data before deserialization. This is challenging due to the binary nature of serialized objects but can be achieved through whitelisting allowed classes or using specialized deserialization libraries.
* **Use Secure Alternatives to Serialization:** Consider using alternative data exchange formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers, which do not have the same inherent deserialization risks.
* **Implement Object Stream Filtering (Java 9+):** Utilize the `ObjectInputFilter` introduced in Java 9 to restrict the classes that can be deserialized. This allows for a more granular control over the deserialization process.
* **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of a successful RCE.
* **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Apache Commons Lang and other dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Code Audits and Security Reviews:** Conduct thorough code audits and security reviews, specifically focusing on areas where deserialization is used.
* **Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) with Deserialization Awareness:**  Use WAFs that have capabilities to inspect and potentially block malicious serialized payloads.
* **Consider Using Serialization Libraries with Security Features:** Explore serialization libraries that offer built-in security features or mechanisms to mitigate deserialization risks.
* **Monitor for Suspicious Deserialization Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual patterns or errors during deserialization, which could indicate an attack attempt.

**Conclusion**

The attack path involving malicious serialized objects leveraging Apache Commons Lang to achieve RCE highlights the critical importance of secure deserialization practices. The ability to bypass existing security measures underscores the need for a layered security approach that includes not only traditional defenses but also specific mitigations for deserialization vulnerabilities. By understanding the mechanics of this attack and implementing appropriate preventative measures, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of successful exploitation.
