# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/commons-lang

## Attack Surface: [String Manipulation Vulnerabilities (Regex Injection)](./attack_surfaces/string_manipulation_vulnerabilities__regex_injection_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the improper use of Commons Lang's string manipulation utilities, particularly when dealing with user-controlled input in regular expressions.
    * **How Commons-Lang Contributes:** Commons Lang's `StringUtils` provides methods like `contains(String str, String searchStr)` (when `searchStr` is interpreted as a regex) where unsanitized user input can be injected to create malicious regular expressions.
    * **Example:** An application uses `StringUtils.contains(userInput, maliciousRegex)` to check for patterns. An attacker provides a crafted `maliciousRegex` causing excessive backtracking, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially leading to application crashes or unresponsiveness.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate user input thoroughly before using it in `StringUtils` methods that might interpret input as regular expressions.
        * **Avoid User Input in Regex:** Avoid using user-provided input directly as regular expressions.
        * **Use Literal Matching:** If simple string matching is needed, use methods performing literal matching instead of regex-based ones.
        * **Limit Regex Complexity:** If regex is necessary, ensure patterns are well-defined and avoid overly complex ones prone to backtracking.
        * **Timeouts for Regex Operations:** Implement timeouts for regex operations to prevent excessive processing.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Specific Versions of Commons Lang](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_specific_versions_of_commons_lang.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting known, high or critical severity vulnerabilities present in specific, older versions of the Commons Lang library itself.
    * **How Commons-Lang Contributes:** The vulnerability exists within the code of the specific version of the Commons Lang library being used.
    * **Example:** A specific older version of Commons Lang has a known vulnerability that allows for a certain type of input to cause a buffer overflow or remote code execution. An attacker targets an application using this vulnerable version.
    * **Impact:** Can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE) or High (for other significant vulnerabilities)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Commons Lang to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Commons Lang your application is using.
        * **Follow Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Apache Commons Lang and promptly apply necessary updates.
