# Threat Model Analysis for apache/commons-lang

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious serialized Java object and provide it as input to the application. When the application uses `SerializationUtils.deserialize()` to process this object, the attacker's code embedded within the object will be executed on the server. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, leading to complete system compromise, data breach, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Affected Commons Lang Component:** `org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils.deserialize()` method.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources entirely.
* If deserialization is unavoidable, use a secure serialization mechanism that doesn't allow arbitrary code execution.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization before attempting deserialization.
* Use a deserialization whitelist to explicitly define the allowed classes for deserialization.
* Keep Commons Lang updated to the latest version to benefit from potential security patches.

## Threat: [Command Injection via String Manipulation](./threats/command_injection_via_string_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious commands into input fields or data streams that are then processed by the application using Commons Lang's string manipulation functions (e.g., `StringUtils.replace()`, `StringUtils.join()`). If the application then uses these manipulated strings to execute system commands or interact with external systems without proper sanitization, the attacker's commands will be executed.

**Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server, potentially leading to data manipulation, system takeover, or launching attacks on other systems.

**Affected Commons Lang Component:**  Various methods within `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils` and potentially other string manipulation classes like `WordUtils`, depending on the specific usage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid constructing system commands or interacting with external systems using unsanitized input.
* Prefer using parameterized commands or APIs that prevent direct command injection.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially dangerous characters before using strings in system commands.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack](./threats/dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker could introduce a malicious version of the Apache Commons Lang library into the application's dependencies, potentially through a compromised repository or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependency management process. This malicious library could contain backdoors or other malicious code that compromises the application.

**Impact:** Introduction of malware, backdoors, or other malicious functionalities into the application, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further attacks.

**Affected Commons Lang Component:** The entire library (`org.apache.commons.lang3`) if a malicious version is introduced.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use a dependency management system (e.g., Maven, Gradle) with checksum verification to ensure the integrity of downloaded dependencies.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
* Use a private repository manager to control access to dependencies and ensure their integrity.
* Implement a secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) that includes security checks at each stage.
