# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to build distributed microservice applications.
  - Provide a framework for service discovery, load balancing, traffic routing, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.
  - Simplify the development and management of microservices.
  - Offer high performance and scalability for microservice architectures.
  - Support various communication protocols and deployment environments.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of service unavailability due to misconfiguration or failures in the distributed system.
  - Risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to services and data due to security vulnerabilities in the framework or applications built on top of it.
  - Risk of performance degradation due to inefficient configuration or resource constraints.
  - Risk of vendor lock-in if heavily reliant on specific Dubbo features or ecosystem components.
  - Risk of adoption failure if the framework is too complex to learn or use effectively.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process (described in project contribution guidelines).
  - security control: Dependency management (using Maven, Gradle, etc. - standard practice in Java projects).
  - security control: Regular updates to dependencies (implied by active project maintenance).
  - security control: Input validation (expected to be implemented by developers using the framework).
  - security control: Authentication and Authorization mechanisms (provided as features within Dubbo framework, documentation available).
  - security control: Encryption capabilities (SSL/TLS support for communication, documented in Dubbo features).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (mitigated by dependency management and updates, but not fully eliminated).
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of security features by developers using the framework.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in applications built on top of Dubbo (responsibility of application developers).
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing of applications built using Dubbo.
  - security control: Provide security training for developers using Dubbo framework.
  - security control: Implement security policy enforcement mechanisms within the framework (e.g., policy-based access control).
  - security control: Enhance logging and monitoring for security events.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Services must be able to authenticate clients (other services or external applications).
    - Support for various authentication mechanisms (e.g., basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    - Secure storage and management of authentication credentials.
  - Authorization:
    - Services must enforce access control policies to restrict access to resources and operations.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) or Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) should be supported.
    - Fine-grained authorization at the method or data level.
  - Input Validation:
    - All service inputs must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
    - Input validation should be performed on both client and server sides.
    - Use of secure coding practices to avoid common input validation vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Sensitive data in transit must be encrypted using strong cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS).
    - Consider encryption for sensitive data at rest (if applicable within the framework's scope).
    - Proper key management practices for cryptographic keys.
    - Use of well-vetted and standard cryptographic libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Service Discovery: Ensuring services can reliably discover each other is critical for the functioning of the distributed system. Failure can lead to service unavailability and application failures.
  - Service Invocation: Secure and reliable communication between services is essential for data integrity and application functionality. Interruption or compromise can lead to data loss or corruption.
  - Configuration Management: Proper configuration of Dubbo and services is crucial for performance, stability, and security. Misconfiguration can lead to vulnerabilities or performance issues.
  - Monitoring and Alerting: Effective monitoring is necessary to detect and respond to issues in the distributed system. Lack of monitoring can delay incident response and increase downtime.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - Service Metadata (Registry Data): Low to Medium sensitivity. Contains information about services, their locations, and configurations. Exposure could lead to service disruption or information disclosure.
  - Application Data: Sensitivity depends on the applications built using Dubbo. Could range from low to high sensitivity depending on the business domain and data types. Dubbo itself handles the transport and routing of this data, so its security is paramount.
  - Monitoring Data: Low sensitivity in general, but can contain operational insights that might be valuable to attackers.
