# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Apache Dubbo, aims to provide a high-performance, lightweight RPC framework for building microservices architectures. The primary business priority is to enable organizations to develop and deploy distributed applications efficiently and reliably. The goal is to simplify the complexities of microservices communication, service discovery, and traffic management, allowing businesses to focus on core application logic and faster time-to-market for new features and services.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of service unavailability due to failures in the distributed system.
- Risk of performance bottlenecks affecting application responsiveness and user experience.
- Risk of data inconsistency across services in a distributed environment.
- Risk of security breaches due to vulnerabilities in the framework or misconfigurations.
- Risk of vendor lock-in if the framework becomes too tightly coupled with specific infrastructure or platforms.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open Source Development Model - The project is developed in the open, allowing for community review and contributions, which can lead to earlier detection of vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub repository and Apache Software Foundation processes.
- security control: Code Review Process - Contributions to the project are reviewed by maintainers, aiming to catch potential security issues before they are merged. Implemented through GitHub pull request review process.
- security control: Vulnerability Reporting - The Apache Software Foundation has a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities. Described in Apache Security Team documentation.
- security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) awareness - While not explicitly documented for Dubbo, being an Apache project, there is an implicit awareness of SSDLC principles within the development process.
- security control: Dependency Management - Project uses dependency management tools (like Maven) which helps in managing and potentially scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Implemented through Maven build system configuration.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes - The speed and completeness of security fixes can depend on the availability and responsiveness of the community.
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in dependencies - Despite dependency management, there's always a risk of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- accepted risk: Configuration complexity -  Dubbo's flexibility can lead to complex configurations, increasing the risk of misconfigurations that introduce security vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline - Integrate SAST and DAST tools to automatically detect vulnerabilities in code and during runtime.
- security control: Regularly perform penetration testing - Conduct periodic penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by automated tools and code reviews.
- security control: Provide security configuration guidelines and best practices - Create and maintain clear documentation on secure configuration and deployment of Dubbo applications.
- security control: Implement and enforce security policies for dependencies - Establish policies for dependency selection and update, including vulnerability scanning and whitelisting/blacklisting.
- security control: Enhance input validation and output encoding across all components - Ensure robust input validation and output encoding to prevent common web application vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - security requirement: Service-to-service authentication - Dubbo should support mechanisms for services to authenticate each other to ensure only authorized services can communicate.
    - security requirement: User authentication for management interfaces - If Dubbo exposes management interfaces, these should require strong user authentication.
- Authorization:
    - security requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Implement RBAC to control access to services and operations based on roles.
    - security requirement: Fine-grained authorization policies - Allow for defining granular authorization policies to control access to specific resources or data within services.
- Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Validate all inputs at service boundaries - Implement strict input validation for all service requests to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - security requirement: Sanitize data before processing and storage - Ensure data is properly sanitized before being processed or stored to prevent data integrity issues and security vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
    - security requirement: Encrypt sensitive data in transit - Support encryption of communication channels between services using protocols like TLS.
    - security requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data - If Dubbo components store sensitive data (e.g., configuration secrets), ensure it is encrypted at rest.
    - security requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries - Rely on well-vetted and strong cryptographic algorithms and libraries for all security functions.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Inter-service communication: Reliable and secure communication between microservices is fundamental for application functionality.
- Service discovery: Accurate and timely service discovery is crucial for services to locate and interact with each other.
- Configuration management: Consistent and secure configuration management is essential for proper service operation and security posture.
- Monitoring and observability: Effective monitoring is necessary to ensure service availability, performance, and security incident detection.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Service metadata (service names, addresses, configurations): Sensitivity: Medium. Exposure could lead to service disruption or unauthorized access if leveraged for malicious purposes.
- Application data transmitted between services: Sensitivity: High to Low, depending on the application. Could include sensitive user data, financial information, or business-critical data. Requires confidentiality and integrity.
- Configuration data (including secrets): Sensitivity: High. Secrets like database passwords, API keys, and encryption keys must be protected to prevent unauthorized access and system compromise.
- Monitoring and logging data: Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Logs may contain operational details and potentially some user information. Access should be controlled to prevent unauthorized access to operational insights or sensitive data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific Service Registry is primarily used with Dubbo in the target environment? (Zookeeper, Nacos, etc.)
- What Monitoring System is used for Dubbo services? (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, etc.)
- What are the specific authentication and authorization mechanisms required for service-to-service communication?
- What are the data sensitivity levels for the applications being built with Dubbo?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) that Dubbo deployments must adhere to?
- What is the expected deployment environment (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?

Assumptions:
- Dubbo will be deployed in a containerized environment, likely Kubernetes.
- Service-to-service communication will require mutual TLS for encryption and authentication.
- A centralized Service Registry and Monitoring System will be used.
- Security is a high priority for the applications being built with Dubbo.
- Standard secure development practices will be followed.
