## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Registry Vulnerabilities -> Unsecured Registry Access -> No Authentication/Authorization on Registry](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_registry_vulnerabilities_-_unsecured_registry_access_-_no_authenticationauthorization_on_reg_2474905f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Lack of authentication and authorization on the Dubbo registry (e.g., ZooKeeper, Nacos).
*   **Action:** Attacker accesses the registry management interface (e.g., ZooKeeper UI, Nacos Console) without credentials.
*   **Critical Node: Outcome: Modify Service Registrations, Steal Credentials, DoS Registry**
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Attacker can manipulate service registrations, potentially redirecting traffic to malicious providers, steal registry credentials for further access, or cause a Denial of Service by disrupting the registry.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Provider Vulnerabilities via Dubbo -> Insecure Deserialization -> Exploit Dubbo's Default Serialization (Hessian2)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_provider_vulnerabilities_via_dubbo_-_insecure_deserialization_-_exploit_dubbo's_default_seri_80f96b66.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting insecure deserialization vulnerabilities in Dubbo's default Hessian2 serialization.
*   **Action:** Attacker sends a malicious payload within a Dubbo request, targeting deserialization flaws in Hessian2.
*   **Critical Node: Outcome: Remote Code Execution on Provider Server**
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Dubbo Provider server, allowing full system compromise.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Provider Vulnerabilities via Dubbo -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Service Implementation Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_provider_vulnerabilities_via_dubbo_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_service_implementation_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Command Injection) present in the Dubbo Provider's service implementation code.
*   **Action:** Attacker crafts Dubbo method calls to trigger vulnerabilities within the Provider's service logic.
*   **Critical Node: Outcome: Data Breach, Code Execution on Provider Server**
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Exploiting these vulnerabilities can result in Data Breaches by accessing sensitive data or Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Provider server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses in Dubbo Framework -> Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms -> No Authentication Enabled](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses_in_dubbo_framework_-_weak_or_missing_authenticat_643c4c97.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Absence of authentication mechanisms in the Dubbo framework itself.
*   **Action:** Attacker directly accesses and invokes any Dubbo service without needing any credentials or authentication.
*   **Critical Node: Outcome: Full Access to Services, Data Manipulation, Service Disruption**
    *   **Impact:** Critical -  Attacker gains full, unauthorized access to all Dubbo services, enabling data manipulation, service disruption, and potentially further system compromise.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks (Dubbo Dependencies) -> Compromised Dubbo Libraries or Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks__dubbo_dependencies__-_compromised_dubbo_libraries_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using compromised or vulnerable Dubbo libraries or their dependencies.
*   **Action:** Application unknowingly includes backdoored or vulnerable libraries, potentially through dependency confusion or compromised repositories.
*   **Critical Node: Outcome: Code Execution, Data Breach, Backdoor Access within the Application**
    *   **Impact:** Critical -  Compromised dependencies can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Data Breaches, and the establishment of persistent backdoors within the application.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
