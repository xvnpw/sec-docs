### Key Attack Surfaces Introduced by Maven (High & Critical, Direct Maven Involvement)

*   **Attack Surface:** Introduction of Malicious or Vulnerable Dependencies
    *   **Description:**  The application includes external libraries (dependencies) that contain known vulnerabilities or intentionally malicious code.
    *   **How Maven Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Maven's core function of dependency management allows developers to declare and automatically download external libraries. This mechanism can be exploited if the downloaded dependencies are compromised.
    *   **Example:** A developer adds a popular library to their `pom.xml` without verifying its source or integrity. This library contains a known security flaw that is later exploited in the application. Alternatively, an attacker publishes a malicious library with a name similar to a legitimate one, and a developer accidentally includes it.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application, data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement dependency scanning tools that identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        *   Utilize Maven's dependency management features to enforce specific versions and exclude vulnerable transitive dependencies.
        *   Enforce the use of private repositories with strict access controls and vulnerability scanning.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Verify the integrity of dependencies using checksums or signatures when available.
        *   Be cautious about adding new dependencies and thoroughly research their origin and reputation.

*   **Attack Surface:** Use of Malicious or Vulnerable Maven Plugins
    *   **Description:** Maven plugins, which extend Maven's functionality, contain vulnerabilities or malicious code that can be executed during the build process.
    *   **How Maven Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Maven's plugin architecture allows developers to extend its capabilities by incorporating external plugins. If these plugins are compromised, they can execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the Maven process.
    *   **Example:** A developer includes a plugin from an untrusted source to perform a specific build task. This plugin contains code that steals environment variables or injects malicious code into the build artifacts.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, injection of malicious code into the application, exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Verify the integrity of plugins using checksums or signatures.
        *   Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement security scanning for Maven plugins.
        *   Restrict the permissions of the user running the Maven build process.
        *   Carefully review the configuration and goals of any new plugin before using it.

*   **Attack Surface:** Compromised Maven Repositories (Public or Private)
    *   **Description:**  Maven repositories, where dependencies and plugins are stored, are compromised, leading to the distribution of malicious artifacts.
    *   **How Maven Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Maven relies on repositories to download dependencies and plugins. If a repository is compromised, Maven will download and use the malicious artifacts, believing them to be legitimate.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a private Maven repository and replaces a legitimate library with a backdoored version. Developers using this repository will unknowingly download and integrate the compromised library. Similarly, a vulnerability in a public repository could allow attackers to inject malicious packages.
    *   **Impact:**  Widespread compromise of applications using the affected repository, supply chain attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for repository communication.
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for private repositories.
        *   Regularly scan private repositories for vulnerabilities and malware.
        *   Utilize repository managers that offer security features like vulnerability scanning and artifact signing verification.
        *   Consider using artifact signing and verification mechanisms to ensure the integrity of downloaded artifacts.

*   **Attack Surface:** Manipulation of `pom.xml` or `settings.xml` Files
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain access to and modify the `pom.xml` (project object model) or `settings.xml` files to introduce malicious dependencies, plugins, or repository configurations.
    *   **How Maven Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Maven relies on these configuration files to define the project's dependencies, plugins, and build process. Modifying these files directly impacts how Maven operates.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's machine or a shared build server and modifies the `pom.xml` to include a malicious dependency or a plugin that executes arbitrary code during the build. They might also modify `settings.xml` to point to a malicious repository.
    *   **Impact:**  Introduction of malicious code, compromise of the build process, exposure of sensitive information (e.g., repository credentials).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls and permissions for `pom.xml` and `settings.xml` files.
        *   Store these files in secure locations and use version control to track changes.
        *   Educate developers about the risks of unauthorized modification of these files.
        *   Implement code review processes to detect malicious changes.
        *   Secure the development environment and build servers.
