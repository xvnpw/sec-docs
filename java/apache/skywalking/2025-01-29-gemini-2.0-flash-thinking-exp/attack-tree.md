        * **1.1.1. Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption in Agent Code [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Vulnerability:** Flaws in agent code (especially in native components or languages without memory safety) that allow writing beyond allocated memory buffers.
            * **Exploitation:** Attacker sends specially crafted data to the agent (e.g., through application requests or manipulated telemetry data) that triggers a buffer overflow. This can overwrite critical memory regions, leading to code execution.
            * **Impact:** Full control of the application server, application compromise, data breach, denial of service.
        * **1.1.2. Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., Log Injection, Command Injection) in Agent [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            * **Vulnerability:** Agent code improperly handles input data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code or commands. Log injection targets logging mechanisms, while command injection aims to execute system commands.
            * **Exploitation:**
                * **Log Injection:** Attacker crafts application requests or manipulates data to include malicious payloads that are logged by the agent. These logs, when processed by other systems, can lead to further vulnerabilities.
                * **Command Injection:** If the agent processes external input to execute system commands (e.g., through configuration or data processing), an attacker can inject malicious commands to be executed by the agent process.
            * **Impact:**
                * **Log Injection:** Log poisoning, potential for log analysis manipulation, indirect attacks on systems processing logs.
