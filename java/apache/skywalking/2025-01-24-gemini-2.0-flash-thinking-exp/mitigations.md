# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/skywalking

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS/SSL for Agent-to-Collector Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tlsssl_for_agent-to-collector_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure SkyWalking OAP Collector for TLS:** In the SkyWalking OAP (Observability Analysis Platform) Collector configuration (e.g., `application.yml`), enable TLS for gRPC and HTTP receivers. This is done by setting properties like `grpc.server.ssl.enabled: true` and configuring the paths to your keystore and truststore files, along with their respective passwords.
    2.  **Configure SkyWalking Agents for TLS:** In each SkyWalking Agent configuration file (`agent.config`), specify the collector address using the `grpcs://` scheme for gRPC or `https://` scheme for HTTP, instead of `grpc://` or `http://`.  For example, `collector.servers=grpcs://your-collector-host:11800`.
    3.  **Provide Certificates to Agents (if necessary):** If you are using self-signed certificates or certificates issued by an internal Certificate Authority for your SkyWalking Collector, ensure that the SkyWalking Agents are configured to trust these certificates. This might involve configuring a truststore path in the agent's JVM arguments or relying on the system-wide trust store if the CA is already trusted by the system.
    4.  **Verify TLS Connection in Logs:** After applying the configurations, check the logs of both the SkyWalking Agents and the OAP Collector. Look for log messages indicating a successful TLS handshake and confirmation of encrypted communication being established.
*   *List of Threats Mitigated:*
    *   Eavesdropping (High Severity): Unauthorized interception of sensitive monitoring data transmitted between agents and the collector.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity): Attackers intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between agents and collectors.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Eavesdropping: High Reduction - Encrypts data in transit, rendering it unreadable to eavesdroppers.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High Reduction - TLS provides authentication and encryption, making MITM attacks significantly more difficult to execute successfully.
*   *Currently Implemented:* Potentially Missing - TLS for agent-to-collector communication is often not enabled by default in SkyWalking and requires explicit configuration. Project's SkyWalking setup needs to be checked for TLS configuration.
*   *Missing Implementation:* Likely missing in both agent and collector configurations if not explicitly set up. Implementation is needed in both SkyWalking OAP Collector and Agent configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in SkyWalking UI](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_skywalking_ui.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable RBAC in SkyWalking OAP:** Configure RBAC in the SkyWalking OAP Collector. This typically involves enabling the RBAC feature in the OAP's configuration files (e.g., `application.yml`) and potentially configuring an authentication provider if required by RBAC implementation.
    2.  **Define Roles and Permissions:** Define roles within SkyWalking that align with user responsibilities (e.g., administrator, read-only user, service-specific viewer). Assign specific permissions to each role, controlling access to different functionalities and data within the SkyWalking UI. SkyWalking's RBAC usually allows control over viewing dashboards, accessing traces, metrics, etc.
    3.  **Assign Roles to Users:**  Integrate SkyWalking's RBAC with your user authentication system (if applicable) or use SkyWalking's built-in user management (if available and suitable for your environment). Assign defined roles to users based on their job functions and need-to-know basis.
    4.  **Test RBAC Enforcement:** Thoroughly test the RBAC configuration by logging in to the SkyWalking UI with different user accounts assigned to different roles. Verify that users can only access the functionalities and data permitted by their assigned roles.
*   *List of Threats Mitigated:*
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Monitoring Data (Medium to High Severity): Users accessing monitoring data they are not authorized to view, potentially leading to information disclosure or misuse of sensitive operational insights.
    *   Unauthorized Modification of SkyWalking Configuration (Medium Severity): Users with excessive privileges potentially modifying SkyWalking configurations in the UI, leading to service disruption or security misconfigurations.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Monitoring Data: Medium to High Reduction - RBAC granularly controls access, limiting data visibility based on roles.
    *   Unauthorized Modification of SkyWalking Configuration: Medium Reduction - Restricts configuration changes to authorized roles, preventing accidental or malicious misconfigurations by unauthorized users.
*   *Currently Implemented:* Potentially Missing - RBAC in SkyWalking UI might not be enabled or fully configured by default. Project's SkyWalking UI and OAP configuration needs to be checked for RBAC implementation.
*   *Missing Implementation:* Likely missing RBAC configuration in SkyWalking OAP and potentially user role assignments. Implementation is needed in SkyWalking OAP configuration and user management processes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure SkyWalking UI Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/secure_skywalking_ui_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication for SkyWalking UI:** Ensure that authentication is enabled for accessing the SkyWalking UI. SkyWalking typically supports various authentication methods, including built-in authentication, integration with external authentication providers (like LDAP, OAuth 2.0, OIDC), or reverse proxy based authentication. Choose a strong authentication method suitable for your organization's security policies.
    2.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies (if using built-in authentication):** If using SkyWalking's built-in user management, enforce strong password policies for user accounts. This includes password complexity requirements, password expiration, and prevention of password reuse.
    3.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (if supported or via reverse proxy):** For enhanced security, implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for SkyWalking UI access. This can be achieved if SkyWalking directly supports MFA or by using a reverse proxy in front of the UI that provides MFA capabilities.
    4.  **Regularly Review User Accounts:** Periodically review user accounts configured for SkyWalking UI access. Remove or disable accounts that are no longer needed or associated with users who have left the organization.
*   *List of Threats Mitigated:*
    *   Unauthorized Access to SkyWalking UI (High Severity):  Attackers gaining unauthorized access to the SkyWalking UI, potentially leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks (Medium to High Severity): Weak or default credentials making the UI vulnerable to credential-based attacks.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Unauthorized Access to SkyWalking UI: High Reduction - Authentication prevents anonymous access, requiring valid credentials.
    *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks: Medium to High Reduction - Strong password policies and MFA significantly increase the difficulty of successful credential-based attacks.
*   *Currently Implemented:* Potentially Partially Implemented - Basic authentication might be enabled, but stronger methods like MFA or integration with external providers might be missing. Project's SkyWalking UI authentication configuration needs to be reviewed.
*   *Missing Implementation:* Potentially missing strong authentication methods like MFA or integration with external providers. Strong password policies might also be missing if using built-in authentication. Implementation is needed in SkyWalking UI configuration and potentially integration with external authentication systems.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit SkyWalking UI Network Exposure](./mitigation_strategies/limit_skywalking_ui_network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Network Access:** Configure network firewalls or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict network access to the SkyWalking UI. Ideally, the UI should not be directly exposed to the public internet.
    2.  **Use a Reverse Proxy:** Deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache HTTP Server) in front of the SkyWalking UI. Configure the reverse proxy to handle TLS termination, authentication, and authorization, and to forward only authorized requests to the SkyWalking UI backend. This adds a layer of security and control.
    3.  **Internal Network Access Only (Ideal):**  Ideally, restrict access to the SkyWalking UI to only your internal network or trusted networks (e.g., VPN). Users accessing the UI from outside the internal network should connect through a VPN or other secure access methods.
*   *List of Threats Mitigated:*
    *   Direct Attacks on SkyWalking UI (High Severity):  Direct exposure to the internet increases the attack surface and makes the UI a target for various web application attacks.
    *   Unauthorized Public Access (High Severity):  Publicly accessible UI allows anyone to potentially access sensitive monitoring data without authentication if authentication is misconfigured or bypassed.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Direct Attacks on SkyWalking UI: High Reduction - Reduces the attack surface by limiting direct internet exposure.
    *   Unauthorized Public Access: High Reduction - Network restrictions and reverse proxies control access, preventing unauthorized public access.
*   *Currently Implemented:* Potentially Partially Implemented - Network restrictions might be in place, but a dedicated reverse proxy or strict internal network access policy might be missing. Project's network infrastructure and UI deployment needs to be reviewed.
*   *Missing Implementation:* Potentially missing a dedicated reverse proxy and strict network access controls for the SkyWalking UI. Implementation is needed in network infrastructure and UI deployment configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep SkyWalking Components Updated (OAP Collector, UI, Agents)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_skywalking_components_updated__oap_collector__ui__agents_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Schedule for SkyWalking:** Define a regular schedule for updating all SkyWalking components (OAP Collector, UI, Agents) to the latest versions. This schedule should consider the frequency of SkyWalking releases and your organization's change management processes.
    2.  **Subscribe to SkyWalking Security Advisories:** Subscribe to the Apache SkyWalking project's security mailing lists, release notes, and security advisories to receive timely notifications about security updates, vulnerability patches, and security best practices.
    3.  **Test Updates in Non-Production Environment:** Before deploying updates to production SkyWalking components, thoroughly test them in a non-production (staging or testing) environment. This helps identify any compatibility issues, performance regressions, or unexpected behavior introduced by the updates.
    4.  **Automate Update Process (if possible):**  Automate the update process for SkyWalking components using configuration management tools, deployment automation scripts, or container orchestration platforms. Automation reduces manual effort, ensures consistency, and speeds up the update deployment process.
*   *List of Threats Mitigated:*
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in SkyWalking (High Severity): Running outdated versions of SkyWalking components exposes the system to publicly known security vulnerabilities that are patched in newer releases.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in SkyWalking: High Reduction - Applying updates patches known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation.
*   *Currently Implemented:* Partially Implemented - Update processes might exist, but might not be consistently applied to all SkyWalking components or prioritized for security updates. Project's SkyWalking update practices need to be reviewed.
*   *Missing Implementation:* Potentially missing a formal update schedule specifically for SkyWalking, subscription to security advisories, and automated update processes. Implementation is needed by establishing update procedures and automation for SkyWalking components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Scan SkyWalking Component Dependencies for Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/scan_skywalking_component_dependencies_for_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Dependencies for OAP Collector, UI, and Agents:** Determine all dependencies (libraries, frameworks, runtime environments) used by SkyWalking OAP Collector, UI, and Agents. This information is usually available in SkyWalking project documentation or build files (e.g., `pom.xml`, `package.json`).
    2.  **Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools into your development or deployment pipeline to automatically scan the dependencies of SkyWalking components for known vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Regularly Scan Dependencies:** Schedule regular scans of SkyWalking component dependencies (e.g., weekly or monthly). Automate these scans as part of your CI/CD pipeline or security scanning processes.
    4.  **Remediate Vulnerabilities:** When vulnerabilities are identified in SkyWalking dependencies, prioritize remediation. This typically involves updating the vulnerable dependencies to patched versions or applying other mitigation measures as recommended by security advisories for those dependencies.
*   *List of Threats Mitigated:*
    *   Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in SkyWalking Dependencies (High Severity): Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks used by SkyWalking components can be exploited to compromise the SkyWalking infrastructure or the systems it monitors.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in SkyWalking Dependencies: High Reduction - Identifies and helps remediate vulnerabilities in SkyWalking's dependencies, reducing the attack surface and preventing potential exploitation.
*   *Currently Implemented:* Potentially Missing - Dependency scanning might not be specifically implemented for SkyWalking component dependencies. Project's security scanning practices need to be reviewed for SkyWalking components.
*   *Missing Implementation:* Likely missing SCA integration and regular dependency scanning for SkyWalking components. Implementation is needed by integrating SCA tools and establishing scanning schedules for SkyWalking dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Validation and Data Sanitization in Custom SkyWalking Extensions/Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_validation_and_data_sanitization_in_custom_skywalking_extensionsplugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Custom Extensions/Plugins:** If you have developed or deployed any custom extensions or plugins for SkyWalking OAP Collector or Agents, identify these custom components.
    2.  **Implement Input Validation:** For any custom extensions that receive input from agents or external sources, implement robust input validation. Validate all incoming data to ensure it conforms to expected formats, data types, and ranges. Reject or sanitize invalid input to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    3.  **Implement Data Sanitization:** When processing and storing data within custom extensions, implement data sanitization techniques to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or injection attacks. Encode output data appropriately before displaying it in the UI or storing it in the backend.
    4.  **Security Code Review for Custom Extensions:** Conduct thorough security code reviews for all custom SkyWalking extensions and plugins. Focus on identifying potential input validation flaws, data sanitization issues, and other security vulnerabilities in the custom code.
*   *List of Threats Mitigated:*
    *   Injection Attacks (High Severity): Custom extensions without proper input validation can be vulnerable to various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, log injection) if they process untrusted data.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity): Custom UI components or data processing in extensions might be vulnerable to XSS if output data is not properly sanitized and encoded.
    *   Data Corruption (Medium Severity): Lack of input validation can lead to processing and storage of malformed or malicious data, potentially corrupting monitoring data.
*   *Impact:*
    *   Injection Attacks: High Reduction - Input validation and data sanitization prevent injection attacks by ensuring data integrity and preventing malicious code execution.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium Reduction - Data sanitization and encoding prevent XSS vulnerabilities by neutralizing malicious scripts in output data.
    *   Data Corruption: Medium Reduction - Input validation helps prevent the processing and storage of malformed or malicious data, maintaining data integrity.
*   *Currently Implemented:* Potentially Missing - Input validation and data sanitization are development best practices, but might not be consistently implemented in all custom SkyWalking extensions. Custom extension code needs to be reviewed for security practices.
*   *Missing Implementation:* Likely missing in custom SkyWalking extensions if not explicitly considered during development. Implementation is needed in the code of all custom extensions and plugins.
