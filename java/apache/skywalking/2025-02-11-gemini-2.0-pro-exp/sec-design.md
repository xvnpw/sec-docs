## BUILD

The Apache SkyWalking build process involves multiple stages, from source code to deployable artifacts. The process leverages Apache Maven and other tools to ensure code quality and security.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") --> GitRepo("GitHub Repository")
    GitRepo --> BuildServer("Build Server (GitHub Actions/Jenkins)")
    BuildServer --> SAST("SAST Tools")
    BuildServer --> SCA("SCA Tools")
    BuildServer --> Linter("Linters")
    BuildServer --> Test("Unit/Integration Tests")
    SAST --> Report("Security Reports")
    SCA --> Report
    Linter --> Report
    Test --> Report
    BuildServer --> ArtifactRepo("Artifact Repository (Maven Central)")
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the GitHub repository.
2.  A build server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by commits or pull requests.
3.  The build server checks out the code and executes the build process.
4.  Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are run to analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
5.  Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools are used to identify and analyze third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
6.  Linters are used to enforce code style and identify potential code quality issues.
7.  Unit and integration tests are executed to verify the functionality of the code.
8.  Build artifacts (JAR files, Docker images) are created.
9.  The artifacts are published to an artifact repository (e.g., Maven Central).

Security Controls:

*   security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Tools like FindBugs, SpotBugs, and PMD are likely used (though not explicitly stated in the provided repository link, it's standard practice for Apache projects).
*   security control: SCA (Software Composition Analysis): Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check are likely used to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Linters: Checkstyle and other linters are used to enforce code quality and prevent common coding errors.
*   security control: Build Automation: GitHub Actions or Jenkins automates the build process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Code Reviews: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Application Performance Monitoring: The core process of collecting, processing, and visualizing performance data is critical. Any disruption or failure in this process would significantly impact the value of SkyWalking.
*   Alerting and Notification: Timely and accurate alerts are crucial for enabling rapid response to performance issues.
*   Data Storage and Retrieval: The ability to reliably store and retrieve performance data is essential for historical analysis and trend identification.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Performance Data (Traces, Metrics, Logs): This data can contain sensitive information about the application's internal workings, including database queries, API calls, and user interactions. While not directly PII, it could potentially be used to infer sensitive information or be exploited in conjunction with other data. Sensitivity: Medium.
*   Configuration Data: This data includes settings for connecting to databases, external services, and authentication providers. It may contain credentials or other secrets. Sensitivity: High.
*   User Data (if stored): If SkyWalking is configured to store user-related information (e.g., user IDs, usernames), this data would be considered sensitive. Sensitivity: High (depending on the specific data stored).
