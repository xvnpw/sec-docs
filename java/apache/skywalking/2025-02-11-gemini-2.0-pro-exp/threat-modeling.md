# Threat Model Analysis for apache/skywalking

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Agent Collection](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_agent_collection.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure via Agent Collection

    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages overly permissive agent configuration to collect sensitive data (PII, credentials, API keys, etc.) transmitted within application requests, responses, database queries, or external service calls. The attacker might passively observe network traffic between the agent and OAP, or gain access to the SkyWalking storage.  This is a *SkyWalking-specific* threat because the agent is the component collecting and potentially exposing this data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), reputational damage, financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Agent (specifically, data collection plugins and configuration: `agent.config`, tracing plugins, logging plugins).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Strict Data Masking:** Configure agent-side data masking rules (using regular expressions or custom logic) to redact or obfuscate sensitive data *before* it leaves the application. This is the most crucial mitigation.
        *   **Minimize Data Collection:** Configure the agent to collect *only* the essential data required for monitoring. Disable unnecessary plugins and features.
        *   **Regularly Audit Agent Configuration:** Review and update the agent configuration frequently.
        *   **Use Secure Communication Channels:** Ensure TLS encryption is enabled for communication between the agent and the OAP server.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to SkyWalking UI/API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_skywalking_uiapi.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to SkyWalking UI/API

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the SkyWalking UI or API due to weak authentication, missing authorization controls, or exposed endpoints. The attacker could then view sensitive performance data, trace information, and potentially modify SkyWalking configurations. This is *SkyWalking-specific* because it targets the SkyWalking UI and API.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to application internals, potential for further attacks (e.g., modifying agent configurations).
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking OAP Server (UI and backend API), SkyWalking Web UI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define granular roles and permissions.
        *   **Secure Network Configuration:** Place the SkyWalking OAP server and UI behind a firewall.
        *   **Regularly Audit Access Logs:** Monitor access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against OAP Server](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_oap_server.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) against OAP Server

    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the SkyWalking OAP server with a large volume of trace data or malicious requests, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become unresponsive. This is *SkyWalking-specific* because it targets the OAP server, a core SkyWalking component.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of monitoring capabilities, potential application performance degradation (if agents block on sending data).
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking OAP Server (receiver modules, data processing pipeline).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Configure rate limits on the OAP server.
        *   **Use a Load Balancer:** Deploy a load balancer in front of multiple OAP server instances.
        *   **Configure Agent-Side Throttling:** Configure agents to limit data sent.
        *   **Implement Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Use network-based security tools.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Scaling:** Monitor OAP server resource utilization.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Storage Backend](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_storage_backend.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) against Storage Backend

    *   **Description:** An attacker targets the SkyWalking storage backend (e.g., Elasticsearch, H2, MySQL) with a large number of queries or data insertion requests, designed to overwhelm its resources. While the backend itself might not be *exclusively* SkyWalking, the *interaction* between SkyWalking's OAP and the storage backend is a SkyWalking-specific concern. The OAP's storage plugin is the affected component.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of monitoring data, inability to access historical traces, disruption of SkyWalking functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Storage Backend (Elasticsearch, H2, MySQL, etc.) *and* the SkyWalking OAP Server's storage plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Storage Backend Configuration:** Implement strong authentication, authorization, and access controls for the storage backend.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Storage Backend):** Configure rate limiting within the storage backend.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Scaling (Storage Backend):** Monitor and scale resources.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement regular backups.

## Threat: [SkyWalking Agent Compromise](./threats/skywalking_agent_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** SkyWalking Agent Compromise

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a server running a SkyWalking agent and modifies the agent's configuration or code. This is *entirely SkyWalking-specific* as it involves the agent itself.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, application compromise, potential for lateral movement.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Agent (all components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Server Hardening:** Implement strong server hardening practices.
        *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Run the agent with minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Monitor the integrity of agent files.
        *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the agent up to date.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the monitored application and agent.

## Threat: [Exploitation of SkyWalking Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_skywalking_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of SkyWalking Vulnerabilities

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the SkyWalking OAP server, UI, or agent code. This is *SkyWalking-specific* because it targets vulnerabilities within SkyWalking's own codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but could range from data breaches to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any SkyWalking component (OAP Server, Web UI, Agent, storage plugins).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep SkyWalking Updated:** Regularly update all components.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the infrastructure.
        *   **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Monitor for announcements.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic penetration testing.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration Leading to Data Leakage](./threats/misconfiguration_leading_to_data_leakage.md)

* **Threat:** Misconfiguration Leading to Data Leakage

    * **Description:** An administrator configures SkyWalking (agent or OAP server) incorrectly, leading to unintentional exposure of sensitive data. This is *SkyWalking-specific* because it involves the configuration of SkyWalking components.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations, reputational damage.
    * **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Agent (configuration), SkyWalking OAP Server (configuration), SkyWalking Web UI (configuration).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review all configuration files.
        * **Use Configuration Management Tools:** Automate deployment and configuration.
        * **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to security best practices.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege.
        * **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation.
