# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/skywalking

## Attack Surface: [Data Ingestion Endpoints (gRPC/HTTP)](./attack_surfaces/data_ingestion_endpoints__grpchttp_.md)

*   **Description:**  The exposed endpoints on the OAP server that receive data from SkyWalking agents.
*   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** SkyWalking *requires* these endpoints to function, making them an inherent and unavoidable part of its attack surface.  The volume and nature of data sent directly impact the risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the gRPC endpoint with malformed trace data, causing the OAP server to crash, disrupting monitoring.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (OAP server unavailable), potential data loss, disruption of monitoring capabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on the ingestion endpoints.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate *all* incoming data, rejecting anything malformed or unexpected. Define and enforce strict data schemas.
    *   **Authentication:**  Mandatory agent authentication using strong mechanisms (e.g., mutual TLS, regularly rotated API keys).
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the OAP server on a dedicated network segment with tightly controlled access.
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Restrict access to the ingestion endpoints to *only* authorized agent IPs/networks.
    *   **IDS/IPS:** Deploy intrusion detection/prevention systems to monitor and block malicious traffic.

## Attack Surface: [Storage Backend (Database) - *SkyWalking's Data Handling*](./attack_surfaces/storage_backend__database__-_skywalking's_data_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  The database used by the OAP server to store collected data, *specifically focusing on how SkyWalking interacts with it*.
*   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** SkyWalking's data storage logic and query patterns directly influence the attack surface of the underlying database.  Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in SkyWalking's database interaction can expose the database.
*   **Example:**  A vulnerability in SkyWalking's data sanitization logic allows an attacker to inject malicious data that, when stored and later queried, triggers a vulnerability in the database (e.g., a stored XSS attack if the database is used to render UI elements).
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data loss, data tampering, potential compromise of the monitored application (if sensitive data is exposed).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege (SkyWalking's Database User):**  Ensure the database user account used by SkyWalking has *absolutely minimal* permissions â€“ only what's needed for its specific operations.  Avoid granting administrative or overly broad privileges.
    *   **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:**  SkyWalking *must* use prepared statements or parameterized queries for *all* database interactions to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This is a fundamental security requirement.
    *   **Input Validation (Before Storage):**  SkyWalking must rigorously validate *all* data *before* storing it in the database, even if it has already been validated at the ingestion endpoint.  This provides defense-in-depth.
    *   **Output Encoding (When Retrieving Data):** If SkyWalking retrieves data from the database for display in a UI or other output, it *must* properly encode that data to prevent XSS or other injection attacks.
    *   **Regular Audits of SkyWalking's Database Interactions:**  Specifically audit the code responsible for interacting with the database to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Query Interface (GraphQL/REST)](./attack_surfaces/query_interface__graphqlrest_.md)

*   **Description:** The API (GraphQL or REST) used to query the data collected by SkyWalking.
*   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** This interface is a core component of SkyWalking, providing access to the collected data. Its design and implementation directly determine its security.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the GraphQL query parser to execute arbitrary code on the OAP server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, information disclosure, unauthorized data access, potential for remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Strong authentication and fine-grained authorization (RBAC) are mandatory.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the rate and complexity of queries.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate *all* query parameters and structures.
    *   **Disable Introspection (GraphQL):**  Disable GraphQL introspection in production.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits (GraphQL):**  Enforce strict limits on query complexity and depth.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all queries for security analysis and incident response.

## Attack Surface: [Agent-to-OAP Communication](./attack_surfaces/agent-to-oap_communication.md)

*   **Description:** The communication channel between the SkyWalking agents and the OAP server.
*   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** This is the fundamental data pipeline of SkyWalking; its security is essential for the integrity of the entire system.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts unencrypted communication between an agent and the OAP server, stealing sensitive trace data.
*   **Impact:** Data tampering, data loss, compromised monitoring data, potential for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory TLS Encryption:**  Enforce TLS encryption with strong, modern ciphers for *all* agent-to-OAP communication.  Do not allow unencrypted connections.
    *   **Certificate Verification:**  Agents *must* rigorously verify the OAP server's certificate, and vice-versa (mutual TLS is strongly recommended).
    *   **Agent Authentication:**  Require agents to authenticate with the OAP server using strong credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Agent Vulnerabilities (RCE)](./attack_surfaces/agent_vulnerabilities__rce_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities within the SkyWalking agent's code itself, specifically those that could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **How SkyWalking Contributes:** The agent runs *within* the monitored application's process, making RCE vulnerabilities extremely high-impact.  The agent's code is the direct source of this risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a buffer overflow in the SkyWalking agent to execute arbitrary code within the context of the monitored application, gaining full control.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the monitored application, potential for lateral movement within the network, data exfiltration, etc.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Agent Updates:**  Apply security updates to SkyWalking agents *immediately* upon release.  This is the most critical mitigation.
    *   **Rigorous Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough security-focused code reviews of the agent's codebase.
    *   **Security Testing (SAST/DAST/IAST):**  Employ static, dynamic, and interactive application security testing tools to identify vulnerabilities in the agent.
    *   **Least Privilege (Application Context):**  Run the monitored application (and therefore the agent) with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the impact of a successful exploit.
    * **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan and update third-party dependencies of the agent.
