# High-Risk Sub-Tree for Compromising Application via Apache SkyWalking

**Goal:** Compromise Application via SkyWalking

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

*   **Compromise SkyWalking Agent [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Agent-Collector Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   Intercept Agent-Collector Traffic
            *   Exploit Lack of Encryption or Weak Encryption (if any custom setup)
        *   Inject Malicious Data/Commands
            *   Send Crafted Traces/Metrics to Influence Application Behavior
    *   **Agent Configuration Manipulation (if exposed) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   Gain Access to Agent Configuration Files/Settings
            *   Exploit Weak File Permissions or Accessible Configuration Endpoints (if any)
        *   Modify Agent Behavior
            *   Example: Change reporting destination to a malicious collector, disable security features
*   **Compromise SkyWalking Collector (OAP) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass on OAP Endpoints [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   Exploit Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms
            *   Example: Access administrative or sensitive endpoints without proper credentials
    *   **Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS) on OAP [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   Send a Large Volume of Malicious or Invalid Data
            *   Overwhelm the OAP's processing capabilities, making it unavailable and potentially impacting the application monitoring
*   **Compromise SkyWalking Storage (Backend) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Access Control Issues on Storage [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   Gain Unauthorized Access to the Storage Layer
            *   Example: Default credentials, misconfigured security groups, exposed storage endpoints

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise SkyWalking Agent [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_skywalking_agent__critical_node_.md)

This node is critical because the agent resides within the target application's environment. Successful compromise provides a direct pathway to influence the application's behavior or exfiltrate sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack on Agent-Collector Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_agent-collector_communication__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Lack of Encryption or Weak Encryption:** If the communication between the agent and the collector is not properly encrypted using TLS/SSL, or if weak ciphers are used, an attacker positioned on the network can intercept the traffic.
    *   **Inject Malicious Data/Commands:** Once the traffic is intercepted, the attacker can inject malicious data disguised as legitimate monitoring information. This could include:
        *   **Fake Error Traces:**  Triggering fallback logic in the application, potentially leading to denial-of-service or incorrect behavior.
        *   **Malicious Metrics:** Providing misleading performance data, which could influence operational decisions or hide malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Agent Configuration Manipulation (if exposed) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/agent_configuration_manipulation__if_exposed___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Weak File Permissions or Accessible Configuration Endpoints:** If the agent's configuration files are not properly protected with appropriate file system permissions, or if configuration endpoints are unintentionally exposed (e.g., through a management interface), an attacker can gain access to them.
    *   **Change Reporting Destination to a Malicious Collector:** By modifying the configuration, the attacker can redirect the agent to send monitoring data to a collector under their control, allowing them to intercept sensitive information.
    *   **Disable Security Features:** An attacker could disable security features within the agent's configuration, making other attacks easier to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise SkyWalking Collector (OAP) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_skywalking_collector__oap___critical_node_.md)

The collector is a critical node as it receives and processes data from all agents. Compromising it grants access to a wealth of monitoring information and can disrupt the entire monitoring infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass on OAP Endpoints [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass_on_oap_endpoints__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms:** If the OAP's API endpoints or administrative interfaces lack proper authentication or use weak authentication methods (e.g., default credentials, easily guessable passwords), an attacker can bypass these controls.
    *   **Access Administrative or Sensitive Endpoints:** Successful bypass allows attackers to access sensitive data, modify configurations, or potentially execute commands on the OAP server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service (DoS) on OAP [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustiondenial_of_service__dos__on_oap__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Send a Large Volume of Malicious or Invalid Data:** An attacker can flood the OAP with a large number of requests or malformed data packets.
    *   **Overwhelm the OAP's Processing Capabilities:** This flood of data can overwhelm the OAP's resources (CPU, memory, network), making it unresponsive and disrupting the monitoring of all connected applications. This can also mask other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise SkyWalking Storage (Backend) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_skywalking_storage__backend___critical_node_.md)

The storage layer holds all historical monitoring data, making it a critical target for attackers seeking sensitive information or aiming to manipulate past events.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Control Issues on Storage [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_control_issues_on_storage__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Default Credentials:** If the default credentials for the storage system (e.g., Elasticsearch, H2) are not changed, an attacker can easily gain access.
    *   **Misconfigured Security Groups:** Incorrectly configured network security groups or firewall rules can expose the storage system to unauthorized access from the internet or other untrusted networks.
    *   **Exposed Storage Endpoints:** If the storage system's API endpoints are publicly accessible without proper authentication, attackers can directly query or manipulate the stored data.
