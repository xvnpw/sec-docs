## 2. Project Overview

Apache SkyWalking is a powerful open-source Application Performance Monitoring (APM) system designed for modern, distributed architectures, including microservices, cloud-native, and containerized environments. Its primary function is to provide comprehensive observability through distributed tracing, service performance metrics analysis, log correlation, and dynamic service topology mapping. This observability empowers teams to diagnose performance bottlenecks, understand service dependencies, and proactively address issues.

## 3. System Architecture

SkyWalking employs a distributed client-server architecture where lightweight agents collect telemetry data from monitored applications and a central backend processes, analyzes, and stores this data.

### 3.1. Key Components (Detailed)

*   **Agent (SkyWalking Agent SDK):**
    *   **Deployment:** Integrated directly into the application process or deployed as a sidecar.
    *   **Functionality:** Intercepts application requests and responses at runtime using bytecode instrumentation, SDK APIs, or service mesh integrations. Collects detailed telemetry data, including:
        *   Distributed traces spanning multiple services.
        *   Performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rates).
        *   Application logs (optionally correlated with traces).
        *   Resource utilization metrics.
    *   **Language Support:** Offers SDKs for various programming languages and frameworks (Java, .NET Core, Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, etc.), ensuring broad applicability.
    *   **Communication:** Securely transmits collected data to the SkyWalking Collector, typically over gRPC or HTTP(S). Configuration options allow for secure connections (TLS/SSL).
    *   **Configuration:**  Configuration is typically managed through environment variables, configuration files, or centralized configuration servers. Securely managing and distributing agent configurations is critical.
*   **Collector (SkyWalking OAP Backend - Observability Analysis Platform):**
    *   **Role:** The central processing hub for all incoming telemetry data.
    *   **Input Protocols:** Listens for incoming data from agents via gRPC and HTTP(S). Supports pluggable receivers for extending input capabilities.
    *   **Processing Pipeline:**  Data undergoes a multi-stage processing pipeline:
        *   **Decoding:** Deserializes data received from agents.
        *   **Validation:** Verifies data integrity and format.
        *   **Aggregation:** Combines related data points to generate higher-level metrics.
        *   **Analysis:** Performs calculations and derives insights from the data.
        *   **Persistence:**  Prepares data for storage.
    *   **Extensibility:**  Provides a plugin mechanism for extending processing capabilities and integrating with other systems.
*   **Storage (SkyWalking Storage Layer):**
    *   **Purpose:**  Persistently stores the processed telemetry data for querying and visualization.
    *   **Storage Options:** Supports a variety of backend storage systems, allowing users to choose based on their needs and infrastructure:
        *   Elasticsearch (popular choice for its search capabilities).
        *   Apache Cassandra (suitable for high write throughput).
        *   TiDB (HTAP database).
        *   BanyanDB (SkyWalking's native storage solution).
        *   Other databases through plugins.
    *   **Data Model:** Defines the schema for storing traces, metrics, and logs. Understanding the data model is crucial for security analysis.
    *   **Security:**  Security considerations for the storage layer include access control, encryption at rest, and secure network connections.
*   **UI (SkyWalking WebUI):**
    *   **Functionality:** Provides a web-based interface for users to visualize and analyze the collected APM data.
    *   **Data Retrieval:** Queries the storage layer through a defined API to retrieve data based on user requests.
    *   **Visualization:** Presents data through dashboards, charts, graphs, and service topology maps.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implements mechanisms to control user access to the UI and its features.
*   **Satellite (Optional):**
    *   **Deployment:** Deployed as a sidecar alongside the application agent.
    *   **Benefits:** Offloads certain tasks from the main application agent, such as data forwarding, sampling, and local aggregation, reducing resource consumption on the application.
    *   **Communication:** Communicates with the agent and the Collector using gRPC.

    D -- "Query API" --> C
```

### 3.3. Component Interactions (Detailed)

*   **Agent to Collector Communication:** Agents establish connections with the Collector to transmit telemetry data. This communication channel is a critical security boundary.
    *   **Protocols:** gRPC (default, efficient binary protocol) or HTTP(S) (more interoperable).
    *   **Security:** TLS/SSL encryption should be enforced for secure communication. Authentication mechanisms (e.g., tokens) may be used to verify agent identity.
*   **Satellite to Collector Communication:** Similar to agent communication, Satellite uses gRPC to send aggregated or forwarded data to the Collector. Secure communication is also essential here.
*   **Collector to Storage Interaction:** The Collector interacts with the chosen storage backend using its specific API.
    *   **APIs:**  Vary depending on the storage (e.g., Elasticsearch REST API, Cassandra native protocol).
    *   **Authentication:** The Collector needs appropriate credentials to access the storage layer. Securely managing these credentials is vital.
    *   **Authorization:** The Collector should only have the necessary permissions to write and manage data in the storage layer.
*   **WebUI to Storage Interaction:** The WebUI queries the storage layer to retrieve data for visualization.
    *   **APIs:**  Typically involves a query language specific to the storage backend.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** The WebUI needs to authenticate with the storage layer (or the Collector acting as a proxy) and should only be authorized to retrieve data it is permitted to access.

## 4. Data Flow (Detailed)

Understanding the data flow is crucial for identifying potential points of data interception, manipulation, or leakage.

1. **Data Generation (within Monitored Application):** The Agent SDK instruments the application to automatically generate telemetry data.
    *   **Trace Context Propagation:**  Crucially, trace context is propagated across service boundaries, often through HTTP headers, which can be a point of vulnerability if not handled securely.
    *   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Agents might inadvertently capture sensitive data (e.g., API keys, personal information) in request parameters or headers. Proper configuration and data masking are essential.
2. **Data Transmission (Agent/Satellite to Collector):** Data is transmitted over the network to the Collector.
    *   **Network Security:** The network connection should be secured using TLS/SSL to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Authentication:**  Mechanisms to authenticate the agent or satellite to the Collector prevent unauthorized data submission.
3. **Data Processing (Collector):** The Collector processes the incoming data.
    *   **Data Validation and Sanitization:** The Collector should validate and sanitize incoming data to prevent injection attacks or data corruption.
    *   **Aggregation and Analysis:**  Processing logic itself could contain vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
4. **Data Persistence (Collector to Storage):** Processed data is written to the storage layer.
    *   **Storage API Security:** Securely interacting with the storage API is crucial.
    *   **Data Encryption at Rest:**  Encrypting data at rest in the storage layer protects against unauthorized access to the physical storage.
5. **Data Retrieval (WebUI to Storage):** The WebUI retrieves data for display.
    *   **Query Security:**  User queries should be carefully constructed to prevent information leakage or denial-of-service attacks on the storage layer.
    *   **Authorization:** Users should only be able to retrieve data they are authorized to view.
6. **Data Visualization (WebUI):** The WebUI presents the retrieved data.
    *   **Web Application Security:** Standard web application security best practices (e.g., protection against XSS, CSRF) are essential for the WebUI.
