# Threat Model Analysis for apache/skywalking

## Threat: [Agent Compromise](./threats/agent_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the host machine where the SkyWalking agent is running. This compromise allows the attacker to manipulate the agent's behavior and access its resources.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Access to sensitive application data collected by the agent (e.g., request parameters, headers).
        *   Modification of agent configurations to send malicious data to the OAP backend, potentially leading to false alerts or masking real issues.
        *   Potential pivoting to other parts of the application infrastructure from the compromised host.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Agent (process running alongside the application).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the host operating system running the agent.
        *   Keep the host OS and other software up-to-date with security patches.
        *   Implement strong access controls and monitoring on the agent host.
        *   Consider running agents in isolated environments (e.g., containers).

## Threat: [Agent Vulnerabilities](./threats/agent_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The SkyWalking agent software itself contains security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially remotely, to gain control of the agent or the host it runs on.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote code execution on the agent's host, potentially compromising the application as well.
        *   Agent crash, leading to loss of monitoring data.
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive information on the agent's host.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Agent (specific modules or functions with vulnerabilities).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the SkyWalking agent updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for SkyWalking and apply updates promptly.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the agent's exposure.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via Agent](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_agent.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having compromised the agent or the application it monitors, manipulates the agent to send unauthorized data to the SkyWalking OAP backend or other external destinations. This could involve sending sensitive business data or personally identifiable information.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of confidential or sensitive data.
        *   Compliance violations and potential legal repercussions.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Agent (data collection and reporting mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls on the agent host and the application.
        *   Monitor agent network traffic for unusual outbound connections.

*   **Description:** Communication between the SkyWalking agent and the OAP backend is not properly secured (e.g., using unencrypted protocols like gRPC without TLS). An attacker on the network could eavesdrop on this communication.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Interception of sensitive data being transmitted, such as application performance metrics, tracing information, and potentially request/response data.
        *   Exposure of internal system architecture and communication patterns.
    *   **Affected Component:** Agent to OAP communication channel (network protocols).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable TLS encryption for communication between the agent and the OAP backend.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management for secure communication.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack (Agent to OAP)](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack__agent_to_oap_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication between the SkyWalking agent and the OAP backend. This could be achieved by compromising network infrastructure or exploiting vulnerabilities in the communication protocol.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Injection of false telemetry data, leading to misleading monitoring and alerting.
        *   Prevention of legitimate telemetry data from reaching the OAP, disrupting monitoring.
        *   Potential downgrade attacks if secure communication protocols are not enforced.
    *   **Affected Component:** Agent to OAP communication channel (network infrastructure, communication protocols).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce mutual TLS authentication between the agent and the OAP backend.
        *   Implement network security measures to prevent unauthorized access and interception.
