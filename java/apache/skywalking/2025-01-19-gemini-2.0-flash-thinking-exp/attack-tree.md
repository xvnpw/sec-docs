## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Agent Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_agent_weaknesses.md)

*   **Exploit Agent Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   This encompasses any vulnerability or misconfiguration within the SkyWalking agent that an attacker can leverage to compromise the application. This is critical because the agent resides within the application's environment, making it a valuable entry point.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data via Agent](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_via_agent.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Data via Agent (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   Attackers can exploit the agent's role in sending data to the collector.
        *   **Lack of Agent Authentication/Authorization (CRITICAL NODE):** If the collector doesn't properly verify the identity of agents, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate agent and send fabricated or malicious data. This can lead to data poisoning, misleading monitoring, and potentially trigger automated actions based on false information.
        *   **Inject Malicious Tracing Data (HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers can craft malicious span data, potentially injecting code into tags or logs that might be processed by the collector or UI in a vulnerable way (e.g., SQL injection if logs are stored in a database and displayed without proper sanitization).

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Agent Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_agent_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Lack of Agent Authentication/Authorization (CRITICAL NODE):** If the collector doesn't properly verify the identity of agents, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate agent and send fabricated or malicious data. This can lead to data poisoning, misleading monitoring, and potentially trigger automated actions based on false information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Tracing Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_tracing_data.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Tracing Data (HIGH RISK PATH):** Attackers can craft malicious span data, potentially injecting code into tags or logs that might be processed by the collector or UI in a vulnerable way (e.g., SQL injection if logs are stored in a database and displayed without proper sanitization).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Agent Process](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_agent_process.md)

*   **Compromise Agent Process (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   Gaining control of the agent's process allows for significant manipulation and can be a stepping stone to further compromise the application or its host.
        *   **Insecure Credentials, Exposed Sensitive Information (CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Agent Credentials/Config):** If the agent's configuration contains insecurely stored credentials or other sensitive information, an attacker gaining access to this configuration can use it for lateral movement or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Credentials, Exposed Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_credentials__exposed_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Insecure Credentials, Exposed Sensitive Information (CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Agent Credentials/Config):** If the agent's configuration contains insecurely stored credentials or other sensitive information, an attacker gaining access to this configuration can use it for lateral movement or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Collector (OAP) Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_collector__oap__weaknesses.md)

*   **Exploit Collector (OAP) Weaknesses (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   The collector is a central component of SkyWalking. Exploiting its weaknesses can have a broad impact on the monitoring system and potentially the application itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Data Processing Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   Attackers can target the collector's data processing mechanisms to cause harm.
        *   **Inject Malicious Data via Collector API (HIGH RISK PATH):** The collector exposes APIs for receiving data. Attackers can craft malicious requests to exploit input validation flaws, potentially leading to code execution, resource exhaustion, or other vulnerabilities on the collector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data via Collector API](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_via_collector_api.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Data via Collector API (HIGH RISK PATH):** The collector exposes APIs for receiving data. Attackers can craft malicious requests to exploit input validation flaws, potentially leading to code execution, resource exhaustion, or other vulnerabilities on the collector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Collector Process](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_collector_process.md)

*   **Compromise Collector Process (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   Gaining control of the collector's process provides access to sensitive monitoring data and can be used as a launchpad for further attacks.
        *   **Insecure Credentials, Exposed Sensitive Information, Weak Access Controls (CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Collector Credentials/Config):** Similar to the agent, insecurely configured collectors with weak credentials or exposed sensitive information are vulnerable to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Credentials, Exposed Sensitive Information, Weak Access Controls](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_credentials__exposed_sensitive_information__weak_access_controls.md)

*   **Insecure Credentials, Exposed Sensitive Information, Weak Access Controls (CRITICAL NODE: Insecure Collector Credentials/Config):** Similar to the agent, insecurely configured collectors with weak credentials or exposed sensitive information are vulnerable to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Collector APIs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_collector_apis.md)

*   **Exploit Insecure Collector APIs (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   If the collector's APIs are not properly secured, attackers can gain unauthorized access and control.
        *   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Default Credentials, Weak Authentication Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE: Weak Collector API Authentication):**  Using default or weak credentials for the collector's APIs allows attackers to easily bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Abuse Management/Admin APIs (HIGH RISK PATH):** Once authenticated (or if authentication is bypassed), attackers can abuse management or administrative APIs to change configurations, manipulate data, or even take over the monitoring system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Default Credentials, Weak Authentication Mechanisms (CRITICAL NODE: Weak Collector API Authentication):**  Using default or weak credentials for the collector's APIs allows attackers to easily bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.

*   **Exploit Storage Weaknesses (Indirectly via SkyWalking) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   While not a direct vulnerability in SkyWalking's code, the collector's access to the storage backend creates an indirect attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Collector Access to Storage](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_collector_access_to_storage.md)

*   **Leverage Collector Access to Storage (HIGH RISK PATH):**
    *   Attackers can exploit the collector's legitimate access to the storage backend for malicious purposes.
        *   **Exploit Collector Vulnerabilities to Access Storage (HIGH RISK PATH):**
            *   **Gain Access to Database Credentials or Storage API Keys (CRITICAL NODE: Storage Credentials/Keys via Collector):** If the collector is compromised, attackers can potentially extract the credentials or API keys used by the collector to access the storage backend, granting them direct access to the stored data.
        *   **Manipulate Data in Storage via Collector (HIGH RISK PATH):** A compromised collector can be used to directly manipulate the data stored in the backend, leading to data poisoning or tampering with historical records.
