## 6. Data Flow

The data flow within Apache SkyWalking involves several stages, from data collection at the application level to visualization in the UI.

1. **Instrumentation and Data Collection:** Agents, integrated into monitored applications, automatically or manually instrument code to capture telemetry data (traces, metrics, and optionally logs).
2. **Data Transmission to OAP:** Agents transmit the collected data to the OAP cluster. This typically occurs over gRPC for trace and metrics data, and potentially through other mechanisms for logs.
3. **Data Reception and Initial Processing:** The OAP cluster receives the incoming data through dedicated receivers. It then decodes and validates the data.
4. **Trace Analysis and Reconstruction:** For trace data, the OAP analyzes spans and segments to reconstruct distributed transactions and build the call graph.
5. **Metrics Aggregation:** The OAP aggregates metrics based on predefined rules, creating time-series data.
6. **Topology Building:** The OAP builds a service topology graph by analyzing trace data and service registrations.
7. **Data Storage:** The processed and aggregated trace data, metrics, and topology information are written to the configured storage backend.
8. **Query Reception:** The UI (or other consumers) sends queries to the OAP cluster's GraphQL query API.
9. **Data Retrieval from Storage:** The OAP's query engine retrieves the requested data from the storage backend.
10. **Data Delivery to UI:** The OAP sends the query results back to the UI.
11. **Data Visualization:** The UI renders the received data into meaningful visualizations, dashboards, and reports for the user.

```

## 7. Deployment Model

Apache SkyWalking components can be deployed in various configurations, each with its own trade-offs in terms of complexity, scalability, and resilience.

*   **Standalone Mode:** All OAP components run within a single JVM process. This is suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments.
*   **Cluster Mode (Stateless OAP):** The OAP is deployed as a cluster of stateless instances behind a load balancer. This provides high availability and scalability. Requires a shared storage backend.
    *   **Service Registry:**  Typically uses a service registry (e.g., Kubernetes Services, Nacos, Zookeeper) for OAP instance discovery by agents and the UI.
    *   **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across the OAP instances.
*   **Containerized Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes):**  The recommended approach for production deployments. Components are packaged as Docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes, providing scalability, resilience, and automated management.
    *   **StatefulSets (for Storage):**  Used for deploying stateful storage backends like Elasticsearch or Cassandra.
    *   **Deployments (for OAP and UI):** Used for deploying stateless components.
    *   **Services (Kubernetes):** Expose the OAP and UI for internal and external access.
*   **Cloud-Based Deployment:** Can be deployed on various cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) leveraging managed services for storage, compute, and networking.
    *   **Managed Kubernetes Services (EKS, AKS, GKE):** Simplify the deployment and management of containerized SkyWalking.
    *   **Managed Storage Services (e.g., AWS Elasticsearch Service, Azure Cosmos DB):**  Reduce the operational burden of managing the storage backend.

## 8. Technologies and Protocols

*   **Communication:** gRPC (primary for agent-to-OAP communication), HTTP/HTTPS (for UI-to-OAP communication and some APIs), potentially Kafka or other message queues for agent data ingestion.
*   **Serialization:** Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient data serialization.
*   **Storage:** Elasticsearch, Apache Cassandra, TiDB, BanyanDB, H2, InfluxDB.
*   **Service Discovery:** Kubernetes Services, Nacos, Zookeeper.
*   **Programming Languages:** Java (primarily for OAP), various languages for agents (matching the monitored application's language).
*   **Web UI:**  Primarily built with JavaScript frameworks (e.g., potentially React or similar).
*   **Query Language:** GraphQL for querying data from the OAP.

## 9. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific examples of potential threats and vulnerabilities.

*   **Agent Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Man-in-the-middle attacks during data transmission. **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS encryption for agent-to-OAP communication.
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized agents sending malicious data. **Mitigation:** Implement agent authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., using tokens or certificates).
    *   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in agent implementations leading to application compromise. **Mitigation:** Regular security audits and updates of agent libraries. Secure coding practices during agent development.
*   **OAP Cluster Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to the OAP's APIs. **Mitigation:** Implement authentication and authorization for the GraphQL API. Consider API rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    *   **Threat:** Injection attacks through query parameters or data payloads. **Mitigation:** Input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Threat:** Denial-of-service attacks targeting the OAP receivers. **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting and resource management. Deploy behind a load balancer with DDoS protection.
    *   **Threat:** Internal communication within the OAP cluster being intercepted. **Mitigation:** Secure internal communication channels (e.g., using mutual TLS).
*   **Storage Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to sensitive telemetry data. **Mitigation:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the storage backend. Network segmentation to restrict access.
    *   **Threat:** Data breaches due to compromised storage credentials. **Mitigation:** Securely manage storage credentials. Implement encryption at rest and in transit for stored data.
    *   **Threat:** Data loss due to storage failures. **Mitigation:** Implement proper backup and recovery procedures. Utilize storage backends with built-in redundancy.
*   **UI Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. **Mitigation:** Implement proper output encoding and sanitization. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   **Threat:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. **Mitigation:** Implement CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., synchronizer tokens).
    *   **Threat:** Authentication and authorization bypass. **Mitigation:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for UI access. Enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Threat:** Exposure of sensitive data through the UI. **Mitigation:** Implement proper access controls and data masking where necessary.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to SkyWalking components. **Mitigation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate components. Use firewalls to restrict access to necessary ports and protocols.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. **Mitigation:** Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
