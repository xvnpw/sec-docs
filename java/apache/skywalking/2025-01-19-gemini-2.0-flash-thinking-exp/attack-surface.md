# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/skywalking

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Agent Configuration](./attack_surfaces/malicious_agent_configuration.md)

*   **Key Attack Surface: Malicious Agent Configuration**
    *   Description: Attackers gain access to the SkyWalking agent's configuration and modify it for malicious purposes.
    *   How SkyWalking Contributes: The agent's configuration file dictates where and how telemetry data is sent. SkyWalking's architecture relies on this configuration for proper operation.
    *   Example: An attacker modifies the `agent.config` file to point the agent to a rogue OAP collector under their control, causing sensitive application data to be exfiltrated.
    *   Impact: Data exfiltration, potential for further attacks based on the stolen data, disruption of monitoring.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Secure the agent's configuration file with appropriate file system permissions, limiting access to authorized users only.
        *   Implement configuration management tools to ensure the integrity and consistency of agent configurations.
        *   Consider using environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive configuration parameters instead of plain text files.
        *   Monitor agent configuration files for unauthorized changes.

## Attack Surface: [Rogue OAP Collector Connection](./attack_surfaces/rogue_oap_collector_connection.md)

*   **Key Attack Surface: Rogue OAP Collector Connection**
    *   Description: An application's SkyWalking agent is tricked into connecting to a malicious OAP collector.
    *   How SkyWalking Contributes: The agent is configured with the address of the OAP collector. If this configuration is compromised or not properly validated, it can be pointed to a malicious endpoint.
    *   Example: An attacker performs a DNS spoofing attack or compromises a configuration server to redirect agents to their malicious OAP instance, intercepting telemetry data.
    *   Impact: Data exfiltration, injection of false monitoring data, potential for denial-of-service against the legitimate OAP.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication between agents and the OAP collector to verify the identity of both parties.
        *   Use secure and trusted methods for distributing and managing the OAP collector's address.
        *   Implement network segmentation to restrict communication between the application and the OAP collector to authorized networks.
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious connections from agents.

## Attack Surface: [OAP Input Validation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/oap_input_validation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Key Attack Surface: OAP Input Validation Vulnerabilities**
    *   Description: The SkyWalking OAP collector does not properly validate data received from agents, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
    *   How SkyWalking Contributes: The OAP is designed to receive and process telemetry data from numerous agents. Insufficient validation of this input can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   Example: A malicious agent sends specially crafted data to the OAP that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability, leading to remote code execution on the OAP server.
    *   Impact: Compromise of the OAP server, potential data corruption or loss, disruption of monitoring services.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the OAP collector for all data received from agents.
        *   Regularly update the SkyWalking OAP to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or similar security controls in front of the OAP to filter malicious traffic.
        *   Perform security audits and penetration testing on the OAP to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [OAP API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/oap_api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Key Attack Surface: OAP API Authentication and Authorization Bypass**
    *   Description: Weak or missing authentication and authorization controls on the SkyWalking OAP's APIs allow unauthorized access.
    *   How SkyWalking Contributes: The OAP exposes APIs for data retrieval, configuration management, and other functionalities. Lack of proper security on these APIs creates an attack vector.
    *   Example: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the OAP's GraphQL endpoint due to default credentials or a lack of authentication, allowing them to view sensitive monitoring data or modify configurations.
    *   Impact: Exposure of sensitive monitoring data, unauthorized modification of OAP settings, potential for further system compromise.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for accessing the OAP's APIs (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce granular authorization controls to restrict access to specific API endpoints and data based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Disable or secure any default or test accounts.
        *   Regularly review and audit API access logs.
