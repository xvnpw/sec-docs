This could be achieved through network attacks targeting exposed ports or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the collector's processing logic.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the SkyWalking collector server, potentially leading to access to all collected monitoring data, manipulation of the monitoring system, or use of the server for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Collector (OAP core logic, specific modules handling data processing or APIs).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the SkyWalking collector updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strong network security controls around the collector, limiting access to authorized sources.
        *   Regularly scan the collector server for vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring the collector.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Collector APIs](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_collector_apis.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Collector APIs
    *   **Description:** If the SkyWalking collector exposes APIs for accessing monitoring data without proper authentication and authorization, an attacker could gain access to sensitive performance and application data managed by SkyWalking.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive monitoring data, potentially revealing business logic, performance bottlenecks, and other internal application details managed and exposed by SkyWalking.
    *   **Affected Component:** SkyWalking Collector (OAP API endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for all collector APIs.
