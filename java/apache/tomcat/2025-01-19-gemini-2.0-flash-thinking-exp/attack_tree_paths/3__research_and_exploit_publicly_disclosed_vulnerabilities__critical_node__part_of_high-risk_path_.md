### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Research and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities

**4.1 Attacker Actions:**

This attack path begins with the attacker actively seeking publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting the specific version of Apache Tomcat being used by the target application. This involves several key steps:

* **Target Identification:** The attacker first identifies that the target application is running on Apache Tomcat. This can be done through various techniques, such as analyzing HTTP headers (`Server:` field), probing common Tomcat ports (e.g., 8080, 8443), or observing application behavior.
* **Version Detection:** Once Tomcat is identified, the attacker attempts to determine the exact version. This can be achieved through:
    * **Error Messages:**  Some error messages might reveal the Tomcat version.
    * **Server Status Page:** If accessible, the server status page often displays version information.
    * **Specific File Requests:**  Requesting specific files known to exist in certain Tomcat versions.
    * **Banner Grabbing:** Using tools like `nmap` to identify the service and its version.
* **CVE Research:** With the Tomcat version identified, the attacker searches public vulnerability databases (e.g., National Vulnerability Database (NVD), CVE.org, Exploit-DB) for relevant CVEs. They will filter for vulnerabilities affecting the specific Tomcat version.
* **Vulnerability Analysis:** The attacker analyzes the details of the identified CVEs, focusing on:
    * **Severity Score (CVSS):**  Prioritizing high and critical severity vulnerabilities.
    * **Attack Vector:**  Focusing on vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely (Network).
    * **Exploit Availability:**  Checking if publicly available exploits or proof-of-concept code exists.
    * **Technical Details:** Understanding the root cause of the vulnerability and how it can be triggered.
* **Exploit Development/Obtaining:**  If a suitable exploit is not readily available, the attacker may:
    * **Develop their own exploit:** This requires in-depth knowledge of the vulnerability and programming skills.
    * **Adapt existing exploits:** Modifying publicly available exploits to fit the specific target environment.
    * **Purchase exploits:** In some cases, attackers may acquire exploits from underground markets.
* **Exploitation:**  The attacker uses the developed or obtained exploit to target the vulnerable Tomcat instance. This typically involves sending specially crafted requests or data to the server.

**4.2 Technical Details and Examples:**

Numerous publicly disclosed vulnerabilities have affected Apache Tomcat over the years. Here are a few examples illustrating the types of vulnerabilities attackers might target:

* **CVE-2020-1938 (Ghostcat):** A serious vulnerability in the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector. An attacker could send specially crafted AJP requests to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive configuration files, source code, or even credentials.
    * **Mechanism:** The vulnerability lies in how Tomcat handles AJP requests and trusts information provided in them.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers send AJP requests specifying the path of the file they want to read.
* **CVE-2017-12615:** A vulnerability in the default Servlet configuration that allowed for arbitrary file upload and remote code execution.
    * **Mechanism:**  When the `readonly` initialization parameter of the `DefaultServlet` was set to `false` (which was the default in some versions), attackers could upload malicious JSP files.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers would send a PUT request to upload a JSP file containing malicious code, which could then be accessed and executed by the server.
* **CVE-2019-0232:** A vulnerability in the CGI Servlet that allowed for remote code execution.
    * **Mechanism:**  Improper handling of arguments passed to the CGI program could allow an attacker to inject malicious commands.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers could craft URLs with malicious parameters that would be executed by the server.

**4.3 Prerequisites for Successful Exploitation:**

For this attack path to be successful, several conditions typically need to be met:

* **Vulnerable Tomcat Version:** The target application must be running a version of Apache Tomcat affected by the identified vulnerability.
* **Accessible Tomcat Instance:** The attacker needs network access to the Tomcat instance on the relevant port (e.g., 8080, 8443, or the AJP port 8009 for Ghostcat).
* **Vulnerability Not Patched:** The vulnerability must not have been patched by applying the latest security updates.
* **Misconfigurations (in some cases):** Some vulnerabilities, like CVE-2017-12615, rely on specific misconfigurations (e.g., `readonly=false` for the `DefaultServlet`).

**4.4 Potential Impact:**

Successful exploitation of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to:
    * **Complete system compromise:** The attacker gains full control over the server.
    * **Data exfiltration:** Sensitive data can be stolen.
    * **Malware installation:** The server can be used to host or distribute malware.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can crash the server or make it unavailable.
* **Data Breach:**  Vulnerabilities allowing file access (like Ghostcat) can expose sensitive data stored on the server, including:
    * **Configuration files:** Containing database credentials, API keys, etc.
    * **Source code:** Potentially revealing further vulnerabilities.
    * **User data:**  Personal or financial information.
* **Website Defacement:**  Attackers might modify the website's content to display their message.
* **Lateral Movement:**  A compromised Tomcat server can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

**4.5 Detection of Exploitation Attempts:**

Detecting attempts to exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities can be challenging but is crucial. Key detection methods include:

* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  These systems can identify malicious network traffic patterns associated with known exploits. Signature-based detection is effective against well-known vulnerabilities.
* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can analyze HTTP requests and responses, blocking malicious requests targeting known vulnerabilities. Virtual patching capabilities allow for applying rules to mitigate vulnerabilities even before official patches are applied.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** SIEM systems collect and analyze logs from various sources, including web servers and operating systems. They can correlate events to identify suspicious activity indicative of exploitation attempts.
* **Log Analysis:**  Analyzing Tomcat access logs and error logs for unusual patterns, such as:
    * **Requests for unusual file paths.**
    * **Error messages related to vulnerability exploitation.**
    * **Large numbers of requests from a single IP address.**
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scanning the Tomcat instance with vulnerability scanners can identify known vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Monitoring critical Tomcat files for unauthorized changes can help detect successful exploitation that involves modifying files.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk associated with this attack path, the following strategies are recommended:

* **Patching and Upgrading:**  The most critical mitigation is to keep Apache Tomcat up-to-date with the latest security patches. Regularly monitor security advisories and apply updates promptly.
* **Configuration Hardening:**
    * **Disable unnecessary connectors:** If the AJP connector is not required, disable it to mitigate vulnerabilities like Ghostcat.
    * **Restrict access to management interfaces:** Secure the Tomcat Manager and Host Manager applications with strong authentication and restrict access to authorized users only.
    * **Review default configurations:**  Ensure that default configurations are reviewed and hardened, such as the `readonly` parameter for the `DefaultServlet`.
    * **Implement the principle of least privilege:** Run Tomcat with the minimum necessary privileges.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to filter malicious traffic and protect against known exploits. Configure the WAF with rules specific to Tomcat vulnerabilities.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Implement an IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block exploitation attempts.
* **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:**  Perform regular vulnerability scans to identify and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited.
* **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the Tomcat configuration and deployment to identify potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not directly preventing the exploitation of known vulnerabilities, robust input validation can help mitigate some types of attacks.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers and administrators about common Tomcat vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
* **Implement a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool:** SCA tools can help identify vulnerable dependencies within the Tomcat installation or deployed web applications.

### 6. Conclusion

The attack path involving the research and exploitation of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat represents a significant risk. Attackers actively seek and leverage known weaknesses to gain unauthorized access and control. Proactive measures, including diligent patching, configuration hardening, and the implementation of security controls like WAFs and IDS/IPS, are crucial for mitigating this risk. Regular vulnerability scanning and security audits are essential for identifying and addressing potential weaknesses before they can be exploited. By understanding the attacker's methodology and the potential impact of these attacks, the development team can implement effective strategies to protect the application and its underlying infrastructure.
