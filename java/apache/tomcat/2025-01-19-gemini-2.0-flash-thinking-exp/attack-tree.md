## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Tomcat Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_tomcat_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This is a critical entry point as it targets flaws in Tomcat's core code. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_known_vulnerabilities__cves___critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers actively seek and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities with CVE identifiers. This is a common and often successful attack vector due to readily available information and exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Research and Exploit Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/3__research_and_exploit_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

This step involves the attacker identifying a relevant CVE for the target Tomcat version and developing or obtaining an exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/4__remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

The ability to execute arbitrary code on the server is the most critical impact. This allows the attacker to gain full control of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Servlet Container (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_servlet_container__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

This specifically targets vulnerabilities within Tomcat's servlet container, which is responsible for handling web requests and executing application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Gain Shell Access on Server (Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/6__gain_shell_access_on_server__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

The direct outcome of a successful RCE exploit, providing the attacker with a command-line interface on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit Tomcat Misconfiguration (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_tomcat_misconfiguration__critical_node_.md)

Misconfigurations are a frequent source of security weaknesses and are often easier to exploit than complex code vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Exploit Weak or Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/8__exploit_weak_or_default_credentials__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Using default or easily guessable credentials for Tomcat's management interfaces is a fundamental security flaw that can be easily exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Access Tomcat Manager Application with Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/9__access_tomcat_manager_application_with_default_credentials__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_95a6a0f6.md)

Successful login to the Tomcat Manager application with weak credentials grants significant control over the Tomcat instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Deploy Malicious WAR File (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/10__deploy_malicious_war_file__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Deploying a specially crafted WAR file containing malicious code is a direct way to compromise the application and potentially gain RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Exploit Enabled but Unsecured Features (e.g., AJP connector without proper restrictions) (Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/11__exploit_enabled_but_unsecured_features__e_g___ajp_connector_without_proper_restrictions___part_o_6aa8c2bd.md)

Leaving features like the AJP connector enabled without proper security measures (like authentication and restricted access) can expose the system to vulnerabilities like the "Ghostcat" vulnerability, allowing attackers to bypass security checks and potentially gain access to sensitive information or achieve RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Exploit Tomcat Features in Unintended Ways (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/12__exploit_tomcat_features_in_unintended_ways__critical_node_.md)

This involves abusing legitimate features of Tomcat for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Exploit Tomcat Manager Application Functionality (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/13__exploit_tomcat_manager_application_functionality__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

The Tomcat Manager application provides functionalities for deploying, undeploying, and managing web applications. If access is gained (through compromised credentials or other means), these features can be abused.

## Attack Tree Path: [14. Deploy Malicious WAR File via Manager Application (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/14__deploy_malicious_war_file_via_manager_application__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Using the legitimate deployment functionality of the Manager application to deploy a malicious WAR file.

## Attack Tree Path: [15. Exploit AJP Protocol Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/15__exploit_ajp_protocol_vulnerabilities__critical_node__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

The Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) is a binary protocol used for communication between web servers (like Apache HTTP Server) and application servers (like Tomcat). Vulnerabilities in the AJP implementation can allow attackers to proxy requests and bypass security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [16. Proxy Requests via AJP to Bypass Security Measures (Part of HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/16__proxy_requests_via_ajp_to_bypass_security_measures__part_of_high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can exploit AJP vulnerabilities to send crafted requests that bypass authentication or authorization checks, potentially accessing internal resources or impersonating other services.
