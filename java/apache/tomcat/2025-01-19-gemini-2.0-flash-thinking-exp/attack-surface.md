# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/tomcat

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials for Management Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials_for_management_interfaces.md)

- **Description:** Tomcat ships with default usernames and passwords for the Manager and Host Manager web applications.
    - **How Tomcat Contributes:** Tomcat provides these default accounts for administrative purposes out-of-the-box.
    - **Example:** An attacker uses the default username "tomcat" and password "tomcat" to log into the Tomcat Manager application without any prior compromise.
    - **Impact:** Full administrative control over the Tomcat server, allowing deployment of malicious applications, configuration changes, and potentially gaining access to the underlying operating system.
    - **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Immediately change the default usernames and passwords for the Manager and Host Manager applications upon installation.
        - Enforce strong password policies for all administrative accounts.
        - Consider disabling or removing the default accounts if not needed.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Management Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_management_interfaces.md)

- **Description:** The Tomcat Manager and Host Manager applications are accessible without proper authentication or authorization restrictions.
    - **How Tomcat Contributes:** Tomcat, by default, might not restrict access to these management applications based on IP address or other criteria.
    - **Example:** The Tomcat Manager application is accessible on the public internet without any authentication, allowing anyone to attempt login.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, leading to server compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
    - **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Restrict access to the Manager and Host Manager applications to specific IP addresses or networks using Tomcat's `<Valve>` configurations (e.g., `RemoteAddrValve`).
        - Ensure proper authentication is enforced for these applications.
        - Consider placing the management interfaces behind a VPN or internal network.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the AJP Connector (e.g., Ghostcat)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_ajp_connector__e_g___ghostcat_.md)

- **Description:** The Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector, if enabled and improperly secured, can be exploited to bypass authentication and access internal resources.
    - **How Tomcat Contributes:** Tomcat provides the AJP connector for communication with other web servers like Apache HTTP Server. Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in this connector can be exploited.
    - **Example:** An attacker exploits the Ghostcat vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938) in the AJP connector to read arbitrary files from the Tomcat server, including application configuration files containing database credentials.
    - **Impact:**  Bypassing authentication, accessing sensitive data, potential remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.
    - **Risk Severity:** **High**
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Disable the AJP connector if it's not required.
        - If the AJP connector is necessary, ensure it's only listening on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) and is properly firewalled.
        - Configure the `secretRequired` attribute and a strong `secret` for the AJP connector.
        - Keep Tomcat updated to the latest version to patch known AJP vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Deployment of Malicious WAR Files](./attack_surfaces/deployment_of_malicious_war_files.md)

- **Description:** Attackers with access to the Tomcat server or management interface can deploy malicious Web Application Archive (WAR) files.
    - **How Tomcat Contributes:** Tomcat's core functionality includes the ability to deploy and run web applications packaged as WAR files.
    - **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Tomcat Manager application and deploys a WAR file containing a web shell, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    - **Impact:** Full control over the Tomcat server and potentially the underlying operating system, leading to data breaches, malware installation, and service disruption.
    - **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Restrict access to the Tomcat Manager application using strong authentication and authorization.
        - Implement strict controls over who can deploy applications.
        - Regularly audit deployed applications for suspicious activity.
        - Consider using a separate, hardened environment for deploying and testing applications before production deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Security Misconfigurations in `server.xml`](./attack_surfaces/security_misconfigurations_in__server_xml_.md)

- **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configurations within Tomcat's `server.xml` file can introduce vulnerabilities.
    - **How Tomcat Contributes:** `server.xml` is the central configuration file for Tomcat, controlling connectors, realms, and other critical settings.
    - **Example:**  A connector is configured to allow insecure HTTP access when HTTPS should be enforced, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service, and other security breaches.
    - **Risk Severity:** **High**
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly review and audit the `server.xml` configuration for security best practices.
        - Enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP traffic and configuring secure connectors.
        - Properly configure security realms and authentication mechanisms.
        - Disable unnecessary connectors or features.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_ssltls_configuration.md)

- **Description:** Weak or outdated SSL/TLS configurations on Tomcat connectors can make the server vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.
    - **How Tomcat Contributes:** Tomcat handles SSL/TLS configuration for secure communication through its connectors.
    - **Example:** Using outdated TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0) or weak cipher suites makes the server susceptible to attacks like POODLE or BEAST.
    - **Impact:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive data, and potential compromise of secure communication.
    - **Risk Severity:** **High**
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Configure Tomcat connectors to use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        - Select secure cipher suites and disable weak or vulnerable ones.
        - Regularly update the Java runtime environment (JRE) used by Tomcat, as it handles the underlying SSL/TLS implementation.
        - Use tools like SSL Labs' SSL Server Test to verify the SSL/TLS configuration.
