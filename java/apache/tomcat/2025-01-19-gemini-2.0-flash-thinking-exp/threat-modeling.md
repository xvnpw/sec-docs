# Threat Model Analysis for apache/tomcat

## Threat: [Default Manager Application Credentials](./threats/default_manager_application_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the Tomcat Manager application using the default username and password (often `tomcat/tomcat` or similar). If successful, they gain full administrative control over the Tomcat instance. This allows them to deploy malicious web applications, undeploy existing ones, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the Tomcat server, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and potential control of the underlying operating system.

**Affected Component:** Manager Application (`/manager/html`, `/manager/text`, `/host-manager/html`, `/host-manager/text`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Change the default usernames and passwords for the Manager and Host Manager applications immediately after installation.
* Restrict access to the Manager and Host Manager applications based on IP address or require strong authentication (e.g., client certificates).
* Consider disabling the Manager and Host Manager applications entirely if they are not needed.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in the Manager Application](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_the_manager_application.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Tomcat Manager application itself. This could involve sending specially crafted requests to bypass authentication, perform unauthorized actions, or execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** **Critical** to **High**. Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to full server compromise, unauthorized access to deployed applications, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Manager Application (`/manager/*`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Tomcat updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review security advisories for Apache Tomcat.
* Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests targeting the Manager application.
* Restrict access to the Manager application to trusted networks and users.

## Threat: [Session Fixation](./threats/session_fixation.md)

**Description:** An attacker can force a user to use a specific session ID. If the attacker knows this session ID, they can hijack the user's session after the user authenticates. This can be achieved by sending a link with a predefined session ID or through other means.

**Impact:** **High**. Allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users and access their data and functionalities.

**Affected Component:** Session Management Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure Tomcat to invalidate the old session ID upon successful login and generate a new one.
* Use HTTPS to protect session IDs from being intercepted in transit.
* Implement additional security measures like HTTPOnly and Secure flags for session cookies.

## Threat: [Predictable Session IDs](./threats/predictable_session_ids.md)

**Description:** If Tomcat generates predictable session IDs, an attacker might be able to guess valid session IDs and hijack user sessions without needing to interact with the legitimate user.

**Impact:** **High**. Allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users and access their data and functionalities.

**Affected Component:** Session ID Generation Mechanism

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Tomcat is configured to generate cryptographically secure and unpredictable session IDs. This is generally the default behavior in recent Tomcat versions, but it's worth verifying the configuration.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Configuration files like `server.xml`, `web.xml`, and `context.xml` might contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or internal network details. If these files are accessible due to misconfigurations or insecure file permissions, attackers can gain valuable information.

**Impact:** **Medium** to **High**. Exposure of sensitive credentials can lead to further compromise of other systems and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Configuration File Handling

**Risk Severity:** High (when highly sensitive information is exposed)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure file permissions on all Tomcat configuration files, ensuring only the Tomcat user has read access.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Consider using environment variables, JNDI resources, or secure vault solutions.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Tomcat Connectors (e.g., AJP)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_tomcat_connectors__e_g___ajp_.md)

**Description:** Tomcat connectors, such as the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector, can have their own vulnerabilities. If the AJP connector is exposed and vulnerable, attackers can potentially bypass web server security measures and directly access the Tomcat server, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Can lead to full compromise of the Tomcat server and the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** Connectors (e.g., AJP Connector)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable the AJP connector if it is not being used.
* If the AJP connector is necessary, ensure it is properly secured and only accessible from trusted hosts (e.g., the frontend web server).
* Keep Tomcat updated to patch vulnerabilities in connectors.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Attackers can send a large number of requests to the Tomcat server, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, threads) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash.

**Impact:** **High**. Service disruption, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Request Processing Engine, Thread Pool

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure connection limits and timeouts in Tomcat.
* Implement rate limiting mechanisms (e.g., using a web application firewall or load balancer).
* Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to the Tomcat server.
* Consider using a reverse proxy or load balancer to distribute traffic and provide protection against DoS attacks.
