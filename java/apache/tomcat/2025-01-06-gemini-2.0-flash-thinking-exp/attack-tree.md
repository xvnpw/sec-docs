## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Tomcat Core Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical_node__exploit_tomcat_core_vulnerability.md)

*   **[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known CVE:**
    *   This involves leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers. Attackers can use readily available exploit code or tools to target these weaknesses, potentially achieving Remote Code Execution or Information Disclosure directly in the Tomcat core.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Tomcat Misconfiguration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_tomcat_misconfiguration.md)

*   **[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weak/Default Credentials -> [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Access Tomcat Manager Application with default credentials:**
    *   Tomcat's Manager Application often has default or weak credentials set. Attackers can easily gain access using these credentials, which then allows them to deploy malicious web applications, effectively achieving Remote Code Execution on the server.
*   **[HIGH RISK] Exploit Insecure Connector Configuration -> [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit exposed AJP connector -> Achieve Remote Code Execution via AJP vulnerabilities (e.g., GhostCat):**
    *   The Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector, if enabled and exposed without proper security measures, can be vulnerable. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities like "GhostCat" to achieve Remote Code Execution on the Tomcat server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Tomcat Management Interface](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical_node__exploit_tomcat_management_interface.md)

*   **[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Brute-force/Exploit Tomcat Manager Application -> [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit vulnerabilities in the Manager Application itself (deployment flaws, etc.):**
    *   Beyond simple brute-forcing, vulnerabilities within the Tomcat Manager Application itself can be exploited. These vulnerabilities, often related to deployment functionalities, can allow attackers to upload and deploy malicious web applications, leading to Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Intercept/Manipulate Tomcat Specific Communication](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__interceptmanipulate_tomcat_specific_communication.md)

*   **[HIGH RISK] Man-in-the-Middle Attack on AJP Communication:**
    *   If the AJP connector is used and not properly secured (e.g., no mutual authentication or encryption), attackers on the network can intercept and manipulate the communication between the web server and Tomcat. This can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Tomcat's Interaction with the Operating System](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_tomcat's_interaction_with_the_operating_system.md)

*   **[HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE] OS Command Injection via Tomcat Features:**
    *   Certain Tomcat features, like the Manager Application's deployment functionality, can be exploited to execute arbitrary operating system commands if input validation is lacking. This grants the attacker full control over the underlying server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tomcat Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tomcat_dependencies.md)

*   Leverage known vulnerabilities in libraries bundled with or used by Tomcat:
    *   Tomcat relies on various third-party libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application. The impact can range from significant information disclosure to critical Remote Code Execution, depending on the vulnerable library and the specific vulnerability.
