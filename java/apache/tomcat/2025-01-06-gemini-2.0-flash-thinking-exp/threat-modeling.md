# Threat Model Analysis for apache/tomcat

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attack on Tomcat Manager Application](./threats/brute-force_attack_on_tomcat_manager_application.md)

*   **Threat:** Brute-Force Attack on Tomcat Manager Application
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Tomcat Manager application by trying various username and password combinations. Successful login allows deployment of malicious web applications or server reconfiguration.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution, Server Takeover, Data Breach.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tomcat Manager application, User Authentication mechanism (e.g., `tomcat-users.xml`, JNDIRealm).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong and unique passwords for all Tomcat Manager users.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
        *   Restrict access to the Tomcat Manager application to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Consider disabling the Tomcat Manager application if not required.

## Threat: [Exploiting the Ghostcat Vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938)](./threats/exploiting_the_ghostcat_vulnerability__cve-2020-1938_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting the Ghostcat Vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938)
    *   **Description:** An attacker can exploit a flaw in the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector to read arbitrary files from the server or execute arbitrary code. This is achieved by crafting malicious AJP requests.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Server Takeover.
    *   **Affected Component:** AJP Connector (typically on port 8009).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the AJP connector if it's not being used.
        *   If the AJP connector is necessary, ensure the `secretRequired` attribute is set to `true` and a strong, unique secret is configured in the `<Connector>` element.
        *   Restrict access to the AJP port to trusted servers only (e.g., using firewall rules).
        *   Upgrade to a patched version of Tomcat that addresses this vulnerability.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Credentials](./threats/insecure_default_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Credentials
    *   **Description:**  If the default username and password for the Tomcat Manager application (if any exist in older versions or are not changed after installation) are not modified, attackers can easily gain access.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Server Takeover, Data Breach.
    *   **Affected Component:** User Authentication mechanism (e.g., `tomcat-users.xml`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default username and password for the Tomcat Manager application upon installation.
        *   Regularly review and update user credentials.

## Threat: [JMX (Java Management Extensions) Misconfiguration](./threats/jmx__java_management_extensions__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** JMX (Java Management Extensions) Misconfiguration
    *   **Description:** If JMX is enabled without proper authentication and authorization, attackers can connect remotely and monitor or even control the Tomcat instance, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Server Monitoring, Data Breach.
    *   **Affected Component:** JMX implementation within the JVM and Tomcat.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure JMX access by enabling authentication and authorization.
        *   Use strong passwords for JMX users.
        *   Restrict access to the JMX port to trusted networks or hosts.
        *   Consider disabling JMX if it's not required.
