                    *   **Attack Vector:** Utilizing functionalities within the Tomcat Manager application, such as JMX interface (if exposed), to execute arbitrary server-side code.
                    *   **Potential Impact:** Direct RCE on the Tomcat server, leading to full system compromise.

*   **2.2. Exposed Tomcat Manager Application [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The Tomcat Manager application being accessible from unauthorized networks or the public internet without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **2.2.2. Access Manager Application without Proper Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** Bypassing or circumventing authentication and authorization mechanisms protecting the Tomcat Manager application.

                *   Attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms if they are weak or vulnerable.
            *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthenticated access to the Tomcat Manager application, leading to the same impacts as gaining access via weak credentials (see 2.1.4 and its sub-nodes).

*   **2.3. Insecure Connector Configuration (e.g., AJP) [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in Tomcat connectors, particularly the AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) connector.
    *   **Breakdown:**
