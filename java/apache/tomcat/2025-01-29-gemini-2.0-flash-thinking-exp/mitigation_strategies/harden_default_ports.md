### 2. Deep Analysis of Harden Default Ports Mitigation Strategy

#### 2.1. Detailed Examination of the Mitigation Technique

The "Harden Default Ports" strategy, as described, involves modifying the `server.xml` configuration file in Apache Tomcat to change the default ports for HTTP (port 8080) and HTTPS (port 8443) connectors to non-standard ports above 1024.

**Breakdown of the Steps:**

1.  **Locate `server.xml`:** This step is straightforward. The `server.xml` file is the primary configuration file for Tomcat's server settings, and its location within the `conf` directory is standard across Tomcat installations.
2.  **Modify HTTP Connector Port:**  This involves finding the `<Connector>` element configured for HTTP (typically listening on port 8080) and changing the `port` attribute. Choosing a port above 1024 is crucial as ports below 1024 are considered privileged and usually require root/administrator privileges to bind to on Unix-like systems.
    ```xml
    <!-- Example before modification -->
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" />

    <!-- Example after modification -->
    <Connector port="8090" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" />
    ```
3.  **Modify HTTPS Connector Port:** Similar to the HTTP connector, this step involves locating the `<Connector>` element configured for HTTPS (typically listening on port 8443) and changing its `port` attribute.  It's essential to ensure the `secure="true"` and `scheme="https"` attributes remain to maintain HTTPS functionality.
    ```xml
    <!-- Example before modification -->
    <Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
               maxThreads="200"
               SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />

    <!-- Example after modification -->
    <Connector port="8453" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
               maxThreads="200"
               SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
    ```
4.  **Save `server.xml`:**  Standard file saving procedure.
5.  **Restart Tomcat:**  Restarting Tomcat is necessary for the configuration changes in `server.xml` to be loaded and applied.

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Port Selection:**  Choosing a non-standard port should be done thoughtfully. While any port above 1024 is technically valid, it's advisable to select ports that are less commonly associated with other services to minimize potential conflicts and reduce predictability.  Documenting the chosen ports is crucial for operational consistency.
*   **Firewall Configuration:**  Changing default ports necessitates updating firewall rules to allow traffic on the newly configured ports.  Failing to do so will render the application inaccessible. This is a critical step often overlooked.
*   **Load Balancers and Proxies:** If the Tomcat application is behind a load balancer or reverse proxy, these components must also be configured to forward traffic to the new non-standard ports.
*   **Client Communication:**  Users or client applications accessing the Tomcat application will need to be informed of the new port numbers. This might involve updating documentation, client-side configurations, or communication protocols.

#### 2.2. Threat Mitigation Assessment

The strategy aims to mitigate the following threats:

*   **Automated Scanning and Probing (Low Severity):**
    *   **Analysis:** Attackers frequently use automated scanners to identify systems running services on default ports. These scanners are often the first step in reconnaissance for broader attacks. By changing default ports, the application becomes less visible to these generic scans.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:**  **Moderate.**  It significantly reduces the application's exposure to *basic* automated scans that only check default ports. However, sophisticated attackers will perform port scans across the entire port range or use service-specific probes that don't rely solely on default ports.
    *   **Severity:**  Correctly categorized as **Low Severity**.  Automated scanning is primarily reconnaissance and doesn't directly compromise the application. It merely increases the likelihood of further, more targeted attacks.

*   **Information Disclosure (Low Severity):**
    *   **Analysis:**  Default ports can subtly reveal the underlying technology stack.  Port 8080 is strongly associated with Tomcat (and other Java application servers).  While not a direct vulnerability, this information can aid attackers in tailoring their attacks to known Tomcat vulnerabilities or configurations.
    *   **Mitigation Effectiveness:**  **Low.**  Changing ports provides a minimal layer of obscurity.  Determined attackers can still identify the technology through other means, such as examining HTTP headers, error messages, or application behavior.  Furthermore, port scanning can still reveal open ports, and if a non-standard port is consistently used for web applications, it might still become associated with web servers over time.
    *   **Severity:**  Correctly categorized as **Low Severity**.  Information disclosure through default ports is a very minor risk factor compared to other information leakage vulnerabilities.

**Threats NOT Mitigated:**

It's crucial to understand that "Harden Default Ports" **does not** mitigate the following significant threats:

*   **Web Application Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), insecure deserialization, etc. These vulnerabilities reside within the application code itself and are independent of the port number.
*   **Tomcat Server Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):**  Vulnerabilities in the Tomcat server software itself.  These require patching and updates, not just port changes.
*   **Misconfigurations (Medium to High Severity):**  Incorrectly configured security settings in Tomcat or the application, such as weak authentication, insecure session management, or exposed administrative interfaces.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  Changing ports does not prevent DoS attacks.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Changing ports does not prevent brute-force attacks against login pages or other authentication mechanisms.

#### 2.3. Impact Analysis

*   **Automated Scanning and Probing:**
    *   **Impact Reduction:** **High.** As stated, it significantly reduces visibility to basic automated scans targeting default ports. This can decrease the overall noise and potentially reduce the number of opportunistic attacks.
    *   **Positive Security Impact:**  Increases the effort required for initial reconnaissance by less sophisticated attackers.

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Impact Reduction:** **Low.**  Provides a minimal level of obscurity but does not fundamentally hide the technology stack.
    *   **Positive Security Impact:**  Marginally reduces the ease of identifying the technology stack based solely on port number.

*   **Operational Impact:**
    *   **Slight Inconvenience:**  Requires users and administrators to use non-standard ports when accessing the application. This can be mitigated through clear documentation, bookmarks, and potentially DNS configurations (if applicable).
    *   **Configuration Overhead:**  Requires updating `server.xml`, firewall rules, load balancer/proxy configurations, and potentially client-side configurations. This is a one-time overhead during implementation.
    *   **Potential for Misconfiguration:**  If not implemented carefully and documented properly, changing ports can lead to misconfigurations, especially in complex environments.

*   **Performance Impact:**
    *   **Negligible:** Changing ports itself has no noticeable performance impact on Tomcat or the application.

#### 2.4. Currently Implemented and Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented: Partially implemented. HTTP port is changed to `8090` in development and staging environments.**
    *   **Analysis:**  Changing the HTTP port in development and staging environments is a good practice. It helps to differentiate these environments from production and can prevent accidental exposure of development/staging systems on default ports.
    *   **Positive Aspect:** Demonstrates an awareness of the mitigation strategy and a willingness to implement it.

*   **Missing Implementation: HTTPS port needs to be changed to a non-standard port in production and staging environments.**
    *   **Analysis:**  Leaving the HTTPS port at the default `8443` in production and staging environments negates a significant portion of the intended benefit. HTTPS is typically used for sensitive applications, and hardening its port is equally, if not more, important than hardening the HTTP port.
    *   **Negative Aspect:**  Represents an incomplete implementation and a missed opportunity to enhance security, even if marginally.
    *   **Priority:**  **High Priority** to implement the HTTPS port change in production and staging environments.

#### 2.5. Recommendations

1.  **Complete Implementation:**  **Immediately change the HTTPS port from `8443` to a non-standard port (e.g., `8453`, `9443`, or a randomly chosen port within the allowed range) in both production and staging environments.** Ensure consistent port selection across environments where possible, or document the specific ports used for each.
2.  **Document the Changes:**  **Thoroughly document the non-standard ports used for HTTP and HTTPS in all relevant documentation, including:**
    *   Deployment guides
    *   Configuration management documentation
    *   Network diagrams
    *   User manuals (if applicable)
    *   Internal knowledge bases
3.  **Update Firewall Rules:**  **Ensure firewall rules are updated to allow traffic on the newly configured non-standard ports for both HTTP and HTTPS.** Verify that firewalls are configured correctly in all environments (development, staging, production).
4.  **Update Load Balancer/Proxy Configurations:**  **If load balancers or reverse proxies are in use, update their configurations to forward traffic to the new non-standard ports.**
5.  **Consider DNS SRV Records (Optional):** For more complex environments or for services intended for wider consumption, consider using DNS SRV records to advertise the non-standard ports. This allows clients to discover the port dynamically without hardcoding it, while still benefiting from non-default ports.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  **Incorporate port configuration checks into regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.** Ensure that non-standard ports are consistently used and that no services are inadvertently exposed on default ports.
7.  **Holistic Security Approach:**  **Recognize that "Harden Default Ports" is a very minor security measure and should be part of a broader, more comprehensive security strategy.** Focus on implementing robust security practices such as:
    *   **Regular Security Patching:**  Keep Tomcat and the application dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Implement a WAF to protect against web application attacks.
    *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong authentication mechanisms and role-based access control.
    *   **Security Hardening of Tomcat:**  Apply other Tomcat hardening techniques, such as disabling unnecessary connectors, restricting access to administrative interfaces, and configuring security managers.
    *   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Harden Default Ports" mitigation strategy provides a marginal security benefit by reducing exposure to basic automated scans and slightly obscuring the technology stack. While it is a low-effort measure and recommended as a basic security hygiene practice, it should not be considered a significant security control.

The current partial implementation, with only the HTTP port changed in development and staging, is insufficient.  **It is crucial to complete the implementation by changing the HTTPS port in production and staging environments and to ensure proper documentation and configuration updates.**

Ultimately, "Harden Default Ports" is a small piece of a larger security puzzle.  A robust security posture requires a layered approach that addresses vulnerabilities at all levels, from the application code to the infrastructure, and includes proactive measures like regular patching, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.  Focusing on more impactful security measures, such as addressing web application vulnerabilities and implementing a WAF, should be prioritized alongside basic hardening steps like changing default ports.
