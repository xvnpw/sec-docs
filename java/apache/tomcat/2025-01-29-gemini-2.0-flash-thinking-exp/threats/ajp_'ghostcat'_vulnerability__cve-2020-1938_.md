### 2. Deep Analysis of AJP 'Ghostcat' Vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938)

#### 2.1 Vulnerability Description

The 'Ghostcat' vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938) is a critical security flaw residing within the **Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector** in Apache Tomcat.  AJP is a binary protocol used for communication between a web server (like Apache HTTP Server) and a servlet container (like Tomcat).  It is often used in setups where Tomcat is behind a reverse proxy.

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Tomcat handles certain attributes within AJP requests. Specifically, attackers can send specially crafted AJP requests that manipulate attributes intended for internal use within Tomcat, such as:

*   `javax.servlet.include.request_uri`
*   `javax.servlet.include.path_info`
*   `javax.servlet.include.servlet_path`

By manipulating these attributes, an attacker can trick Tomcat into processing requests as if they were internal include requests. This bypasses standard security checks and allows the attacker to:

*   **Read arbitrary files on the server:** By manipulating the `javax.servlet.include.path_info` attribute, an attacker can specify a path to any file accessible by the Tomcat process and have Tomcat serve its content as part of the response. This is the "file inclusion" aspect of the vulnerability.
*   **Potentially achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In certain configurations, if the attacker can upload files to the server (e.g., through a vulnerable file upload functionality in the web application) and knows the upload path, they can then use the file inclusion vulnerability to execute code within those uploaded files. This is because Tomcat might interpret certain file types (like JSP or other server-side scripting languages) as executable.

**Key Points:**

*   **AJP Connector Specific:** The vulnerability is specific to the AJP connector and does not affect the HTTP connector.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication mechanisms configured for web applications running on Tomcat, as the attack occurs at the AJP connector level before reaching the application's security filters.
*   **Default Configuration Risk:**  In many default Tomcat installations, the AJP connector is enabled and listens on port 8009 on all interfaces (0.0.0.0). If this port is exposed to the network (even internally), it becomes a potential attack vector.

#### 2.2 Technical Deep Dive

The vulnerability stems from Tomcat's handling of AJP request attributes related to include requests.  Normally, these attributes are set internally by Tomcat when processing include directives within JSPs or servlets. However, the AJP connector incorrectly allows external clients to set these attributes via AJP requests.

When Tomcat receives an AJP request, it processes the attributes included in the request.  Due to the vulnerability, if an attacker sends an AJP request with attributes like `javax.servlet.include.path_info` set to a file path (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `WEB-INF/web.xml`), Tomcat will treat this request as an internal include.

Tomcat's internal include processing mechanism is designed to retrieve resources within the web application's context. However, because the attacker can control the `path_info`, they can force Tomcat to access files outside the intended web application directory, including sensitive system files or application configuration files.

**Why `requiredSecret` is not a complete mitigation:**

The `requiredSecret` attribute for the AJP connector was introduced as a security measure to authenticate connections. However, it is **not a robust mitigation** for the Ghostcat vulnerability for several reasons:

*   **Bypassable in some scenarios:**  If the attacker is on the same network segment as the Tomcat server (which is often the case in internal networks or compromised environments), they might be able to bypass or guess the `requiredSecret` through network sniffing or brute-force attempts, especially if it's not a strong, randomly generated secret.
*   **Not designed for this type of vulnerability:** `requiredSecret` is primarily intended to prevent unauthorized *connections* to the AJP port, not to prevent manipulation of request attributes within a valid AJP connection. The Ghostcat vulnerability exploits a flaw in *how* Tomcat processes requests, even from authenticated connections.
*   **Configuration complexity and potential for misconfiguration:** Relying solely on `requiredSecret` can create a false sense of security.  Administrators might incorrectly assume it fully mitigates the risk and neglect other crucial security measures like patching or disabling AJP.

**In essence, `requiredSecret` is a weak layer of defense against Ghostcat and should not be considered a primary or sufficient mitigation.**

#### 2.3 Exploitation Scenarios

**2.3.1 Arbitrary File Reading:**

This is the most direct and easily exploitable aspect of the Ghostcat vulnerability. An attacker can send a crafted AJP request to the vulnerable Tomcat server with the `javax.servlet.include.path_info` attribute set to the path of a file they want to read.

**Example:** To read `/etc/passwd` on a Linux server, the attacker would send an AJP request with:

```
attributes: {
  "javax.servlet.include.path_info": "/etc/passwd"
}
```

Tomcat, upon processing this request, would read the contents of `/etc/passwd` and include it in the response body, effectively exposing the file to the attacker.

**Sensitive files that could be targeted include:**

*   `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` (on Linux systems)
*   `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM` (on Windows systems - requires SYSTEM privileges to read, less likely via Tomcat)
*   Web application configuration files (e.g., `WEB-INF/web.xml`, `WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml`, database connection strings)
*   Source code files (e.g., JSP files, Java source files if accessible)
*   Log files containing sensitive information

**2.3.2 Remote Code Execution (RCE):**

Achieving RCE is more complex and depends on specific server configurations and application vulnerabilities. A common scenario involves:

1.  **File Upload Vulnerability:** The target web application has a file upload functionality that allows attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server.
2.  **Upload Location Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path where uploaded files are stored on the server's filesystem.
3.  **Exploiting Ghostcat for Execution:** The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a JSP file containing web shell code) and then uses the Ghostcat vulnerability to include and execute this uploaded file.

**Example:**

1.  Attacker uploads `webshell.jsp` to `/var/www/uploads/` via a vulnerable file upload feature.
2.  Attacker sends a crafted AJP request with:

    ```
    attributes: {
      "javax.servlet.include.path_info": "/var/www/uploads/webshell.jsp"
    }
    ```
3.  Tomcat executes `webshell.jsp`, granting the attacker remote code execution capabilities on the server.

**Conditions for RCE:**

*   Writable directory accessible by Tomcat.
*   Ability to upload files to that directory (directly or indirectly via application vulnerability).
*   Tomcat configuration that allows execution of uploaded file types (e.g., JSP processing enabled).

#### 2.4 Impact Assessment

The impact of the Ghostcat vulnerability is **critical** due to the potential for:

*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Files:**  Attackers can read configuration files, source code, and system files, potentially exposing credentials, application secrets, and sensitive data. This can lead to data breaches and further compromise.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  RCE allows attackers to gain complete control over the Tomcat server. They can install backdoors, steal data, disrupt services, and use the compromised server as a launchpad for further attacks on the internal network.
*   **Server Compromise:**  Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability bypasses application-level authentication, making it particularly dangerous as it can grant access to protected resources without valid credentials.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**.  The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, requires low skill to exploit (proof-of-concept exploits are readily available), and has a high impact.

#### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

**2.5.1 Disable the AJP Connector (Recommended if not needed):**

*   **Effectiveness:** This is the **most effective mitigation** if the AJP connector is not required for your application architecture. If Tomcat is not behind a reverse proxy using AJP, disabling the connector completely eliminates the attack vector.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Locate the `<Connector>` element in your `server.xml` configuration file that defines the AJP connector. It typically looks like this:
        ```xml
        <Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3"
                   address="0.0.0.0"
                   redirectPort="8443" />
        ```
    *   **Comment out or remove** this entire `<Connector>` element from `server.xml`.
    *   **Restart Tomcat** for the changes to take effect.
*   **Verification:** After restarting, verify that Tomcat is no longer listening on port 8009 (or the configured AJP port) using tools like `netstat` or `ss`.

**2.5.2 Restrict Access to the AJP Connector (If AJP is required):**

*   **Effectiveness:**  If AJP is necessary (e.g., for communication with a reverse proxy), restrict access to the AJP connector to only trusted sources. This limits the attack surface.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **`address` attribute in `server.xml`:**  Modify the `address` attribute in the AJP `<Connector>` element to bind it to a specific IP address or network interface. For example, to only allow connections from localhost:
        ```xml
        <Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3"
                   address="127.0.0.1"
                   redirectPort="8443" />
        ```
        If the reverse proxy is on a different server, set `address` to the Tomcat server's private IP address and use firewall rules to allow connections only from the reverse proxy's IP address.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules (e.g., using `iptables`, `firewalld`, or cloud provider security groups) to block external access to the AJP port (typically 8009). Only allow connections from the trusted reverse proxy server's IP address.

**2.5.3 Upgrade to a Patched Version of Tomcat (Highly Recommended):**

*   **Effectiveness:**  Upgrading to a patched version of Tomcat is the **most comprehensive and recommended solution**. Patched versions contain fixes that directly address the vulnerability in the AJP connector.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Identify your current Tomcat version.**
    *   **Check the Apache Tomcat security advisories** for CVE-2020-1938 to determine the patched versions for your Tomcat branch (e.g., 9.0.x, 8.5.x, 7.0.x).
    *   **Download the patched version** from the official Apache Tomcat website.
    *   **Follow the Tomcat upgrade instructions** for your specific installation method. This typically involves replacing the Tomcat binaries and libraries with the new version.
    *   **Thoroughly test your application** after upgrading to ensure compatibility and proper functionality.

**2.5.4 Configure `requiredSecret` Attribute (Temporary Measure, Not a Complete Fix):**

*   **Effectiveness:**  Adding `requiredSecret` provides a basic level of authentication for AJP connections. However, as discussed earlier, it is **not a robust or complete mitigation** and should be considered a temporary measure until upgrading or disabling AJP is implemented.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Generate a strong, random secret key.**
    *   **Add the `requiredSecret` attribute** to the AJP `<Connector>` element in `server.xml`, setting its value to the generated secret:
        ```xml
        <Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3"
                   address="0.0.0.0"
                   redirectPort="8443"
                   requiredSecret="YourStrongRandomSecretKey" />
        ```
    *   **Configure the same `secret` in your reverse proxy** (if applicable) to ensure it sends the correct secret in AJP requests.  Refer to your reverse proxy documentation for AJP configuration.
    *   **Restart Tomcat** for the changes to take effect.
*   **Limitations:**  Remember that `requiredSecret` is not a strong security control against determined attackers and should not be relied upon as the primary mitigation.

### 3. Recommendations for the Development Team

Based on this deep analysis, the following recommendations are crucial for the development team:

1.  **Prioritize Upgrading Tomcat:**  **Immediately plan and execute an upgrade to a patched version of Apache Tomcat** that addresses CVE-2020-1938. This is the most effective and long-term solution. Refer to the Apache Tomcat security advisories to identify the appropriate patched version for your Tomcat branch.
2.  **Disable AJP Connector if Not Required:**  If your application architecture does not require the AJP connector, **disable it completely** by commenting out or removing the AJP `<Connector>` element in `server.xml`. This eliminates the vulnerability entirely.
3.  **Restrict AJP Access if Required:** If AJP is necessary, **restrict access to the AJP connector** using the `address` attribute and firewall rules. Ensure only trusted sources (like your reverse proxy server) can connect to the AJP port.
4.  **Avoid Relying Solely on `requiredSecret`:**  While you can configure `requiredSecret` as a temporary measure, **do not consider it a complete mitigation**. It provides a weak layer of defense and should not replace upgrading or disabling AJP.
5.  **Regular Security Patching:**  Establish a process for **regularly monitoring and applying security patches** for Apache Tomcat and all other software components in your application stack. Stay informed about security advisories and proactively address vulnerabilities.
6.  **Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning:**  Conduct **regular security audits and vulnerability scans** of your Tomcat deployments and web applications to identify and address potential security weaknesses, including misconfigurations and outdated software.
7.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the Tomcat process runs with the **minimum necessary privileges**. Avoid running Tomcat as root or with overly broad permissions, which can limit the impact of a successful compromise.
8.  **Network Segmentation:**  Implement **network segmentation** to isolate the Tomcat server and other critical components from less trusted networks. This can help contain the impact of a security breach.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can effectively mitigate the risk posed by the AJP 'Ghostcat' vulnerability and significantly improve the overall security posture of the application and infrastructure.  **Upgrading Tomcat should be the top priority.**
