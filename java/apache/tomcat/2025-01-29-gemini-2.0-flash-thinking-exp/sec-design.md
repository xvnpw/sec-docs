# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, reliable, and performant open-source web server and servlet container.
  - Adhere to Java Servlet and JSP specifications to ensure compatibility and interoperability.
  - Maintain a secure platform for deploying web applications.
  - Foster a strong community of users and contributors.
  - Ensure long-term stability and support for the project.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Tomcat could lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and reputational damage for users.
  - Performance issues could negatively impact user experience and application availability.
  - Lack of compliance with specifications could lead to application compatibility problems.
  - Community decline could result in slower development and reduced support.
  - Instability or lack of updates could make Tomcat less attractive compared to alternatives.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular security updates and patches are released to address identified vulnerabilities. (Described in Apache Tomcat Security documentation and release notes)
  - security control: Security configuration options are available to harden Tomcat installations, such as disabling default ports, restricting access to management interfaces, and configuring secure protocols. (Described in Apache Tomcat Configuration Reference)
  - security control: Documentation on security best practices is provided to guide users in securing their Tomcat deployments. (Available on the Apache Tomcat website and documentation)
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, vulnerability disclosure and patching relies on community reporting and volunteer effort, which might introduce delays compared to commercial products with dedicated security teams.
  - accepted risk: Users are responsible for properly configuring and maintaining the security of their Tomcat deployments, and misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST and DAST) in the development and release pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a formal Security Incident Response Plan to handle security incidents effectively.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses.
  - security control: Promote and enforce secure coding practices among contributors.
  - security control: Enhance supply chain security by verifying dependencies and using secure build processes.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Implement robust authentication mechanisms for accessing Tomcat management interfaces (e.g., Manager, Host Manager).
    - Requirement: Support various authentication methods, including username/password, certificate-based authentication, and integration with external authentication providers (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to Tomcat resources and functionalities based on user roles.
    - Requirement: Ensure that only authorized users can deploy, undeploy, and manage web applications.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement comprehensive input validation for all data received by Tomcat, including HTTP requests, configuration files, and management commands.
    - Requirement: Protect against common injection attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Enforce the use of strong cryptography for protecting sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - Requirement: Support secure communication protocols such as TLS/SSL for HTTPS connections.
    - Requirement: Provide options for encrypting sensitive configuration data, such as passwords and private keys.

  - Management and administration of the Tomcat server.
  - Development and maintenance of the Tomcat project itself.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Web Application Data: Sensitivity depends on the applications deployed on Tomcat. Could range from public information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
  - Configuration Data: Includes sensitive information like passwords, keys, and connection strings. High sensitivity.
  - Log Data: May contain sensitive information depending on logging configuration. Medium to high sensitivity.
  - Source Code: Intellectual property of the Apache Software Foundation and contributors. Medium sensitivity (integrity and availability are key).
  - Build Artifacts: Deployable software components. Medium sensitivity (integrity and availability are key).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Tomcat is used in a wide range of environments, from development to production, and by organizations of varying sizes and risk appetites.
  - Question: What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) that Tomcat deployments might need to adhere to?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Basic security controls are in place, but there is always room for improvement, especially in areas like automated security testing and supply chain security.
  - Question: What is the current vulnerability management process for Tomcat? How quickly are security patches released and applied by users?

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: The design is based on a standard web server architecture, with clear separation of concerns between the web server container, connectors, and management interfaces.
  - Question: Are there any specific architectural components or features in Tomcat that are known to be more complex or prone to security vulnerabilities?
