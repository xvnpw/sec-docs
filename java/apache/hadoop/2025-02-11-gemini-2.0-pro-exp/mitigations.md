# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/hadoop

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication with Kerberos (Hadoop-Specific Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication_with_kerberos__hadoop-specific_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Hadoop Services:** Modify the configuration files (e.g., `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, `yarn-site.xml`, `mapred-site.xml`) of *each Hadoop service* to enable Kerberos authentication. This is the Hadoop-specific part. This includes:
        *   Setting `hadoop.security.authentication` to `kerberos`.
        *   Specifying the Kerberos realm (`hadoop.security.kerberos.realm`).
        *   Defining service principals for each service (e.g., `dfs.namenode.kerberos.principal`, `yarn.resourcemanager.kerberos.principal`).
        *   Specifying the location of keytab files for each service (e.g., `dfs.namenode.keytab.file`, `yarn.resourcemanager.keytab.file`).
        *   Configuring SPNEGO for web UIs (if used) to enable Kerberos authentication for web access.
    2.  **Client Configuration (Hadoop Side):** Ensure that Hadoop client configurations (typically in `core-site.xml`) are set up to use Kerberos. This includes setting `hadoop.security.authentication` to `kerberos`.
    3. **Keytab Management within Hadoop:** Hadoop configuration files directly reference keytab files. Secure handling of these files *within the Hadoop configuration* is crucial.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from accessing Hadoop services without valid Kerberos tickets.
    *   **Impersonation (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from impersonating legitimate users or services.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** When combined with wire encryption, helps prevent MITM attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
    *   **Impersonation:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low, with wire encryption).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HDFS: Implemented. Kerberos authentication is enabled for HDFS.
    *   YARN: Implemented. Kerberos authentication is enabled for YARN.
    *   MapReduce: Implemented. Kerberos authentication is enabled for MapReduce jobs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hive: Not yet implemented. Hive access is currently not secured with Kerberos.
    *   HBase: Not yet implemented. HBase access is currently not secured with Kerberos.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Fine-Grained Authorization with Ranger (Hadoop Service Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/fine-grained_authorization_with_ranger__hadoop_service_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Ranger Plugins:** This is the key Hadoop-specific step.  Enable the Ranger *plugins* for *each Hadoop service* you want to protect (HDFS, YARN, Hive, HBase, etc.). These plugins are part of the Hadoop ecosystem and are configured within Hadoop's configuration files.  The plugins:
        *   Intercept access requests to the Hadoop service.
        *   Consult the Ranger server for authorization decisions based on defined policies.
        *   Enforce the Ranger policies, allowing or denying access.
    2.  **Hadoop Configuration:**  Configure the Hadoop services (in their respective configuration files, e.g., `hdfs-site.xml`, `yarn-site.xml`) to use the Ranger plugins. This typically involves specifying the Ranger server address and other plugin-specific settings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access beyond basic HDFS permissions.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification or deletion.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Limits privilege escalation within Hadoop.
    *   **Insider Threats (High Severity):** Helps mitigate insider threats.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
    *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HDFS: Implemented. Ranger policies control access to HDFS resources.
    *   YARN: Implemented. Ranger policies control access to YARN queues and applications.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hive: Not yet implemented. Ranger plugins are not yet enabled for Hive.
    *   HBase: Not yet implemented. Ranger plugins are not yet enabled for HBase.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Encryption at Rest (HDFS Transparent Encryption - Hadoop Native)](./mitigation_strategies/data_encryption_at_rest__hdfs_transparent_encryption_-_hadoop_native_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Hadoop KMS (if using):** If using the Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS), configure it within Hadoop (typically in `kms-site.xml`). This includes setting the key provider, key store location, and encryption algorithms.
    2.  **HDFS Crypto Commands:** Use the `hdfs crypto` command-line utility (part of HDFS) to:
        *   Create encryption zones: `hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName <key_name> -path <path>`. 
        *   List encryption zones: `hdfs crypto -listZones`.
        *   Manage encryption keys (if using Hadoop KMS).
    3. **Hadoop Client Configuration:** Ensure Hadoop clients are configured to interact with the KMS (if using Hadoop KMS or a supported third-party KMS). This is often handled automatically if the KMS is properly configured within Hadoop.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Theft (High Severity):** Protects data on stolen disks.
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Raw Data (High Severity):** Prevents access to raw data on disk.
    *   **Compliance Violations (Medium to High Severity):** Helps meet compliance requirements.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach from Physical Theft:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Raw Data:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
    *   **Compliance Violations:** Risk reduced (from Medium/High to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HDFS: Partially Implemented. Encryption zones exist for some data.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive Coverage: Not all HDFS data is in encryption zones.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Encryption in Transit (Wire Encryption - Hadoop Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/data_encryption_in_transit__wire_encryption_-_hadoop_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hadoop RPC Configuration:** Configure Hadoop's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism to use encryption. This is done within Hadoop's configuration files (primarily `core-site.xml`):
        *   Set `hadoop.rpc.protection` to `privacy`. This enables encryption for RPC communication.  This setting works *in conjunction with* Kerberos.
        *   Ensure `hadoop.security.authentication` is set to `kerberos` (required for `hadoop.rpc.protection` to work).
    2. **Service-Specific Configuration:** Some Hadoop services may have additional configuration options related to wire encryption (e.g., enabling SSL for web UIs in `hdfs-site.xml` or `yarn-site.xml`).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (Medium Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping on Hadoop communication.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents MITM attacks.
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit (Medium Severity):** Ensures data integrity during transit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low).
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low).
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit:** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HDFS: Implemented. Wire encryption is enabled for HDFS communication.
    *   YARN: Implemented. Wire encryption is enabled for YARN communication.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hive: Not yet implemented. Wire encryption is not yet enabled for Hive.
    *   HBase: Not yet implemented. Wire encryption is not yet enabled for HBase.
