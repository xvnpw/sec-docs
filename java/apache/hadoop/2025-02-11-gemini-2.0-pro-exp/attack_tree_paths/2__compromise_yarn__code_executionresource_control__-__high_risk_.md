Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on compromising YARN in an Apache Hadoop environment.

## Deep Analysis of YARN Compromise Attack Path

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerabilities, attack methods, potential impacts, and effective mitigation strategies related to compromising the YARN component of an Apache Hadoop cluster.  This understanding will inform the development team about necessary security controls and configurations to protect the application and its underlying infrastructure.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations to reduce the risk of YARN-based attacks.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the following attack tree path:

*   **2. Compromise YARN (Code Execution/Resource Control)**
    *   **2a. Weak Authentication/Authorization to YARN**
        *   **2a1. Kerberos Weaknesses (YARN)**
        *   **2a2. No Authentication (Simple Auth - YARN)**
    *   **2c. Rogue YARN Application (Malicious Container)**
        *   **2c1. Application Submission (Malicious Code)**

The analysis will *not* cover other potential attack vectors against Hadoop (e.g., HDFS-specific attacks, network-level attacks) except where they directly relate to the YARN compromise path.  We will assume a standard Apache Hadoop deployment, potentially with common extensions like Spark.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify specific vulnerabilities within each node of the attack tree path.  This includes researching known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), common misconfigurations, and inherent design weaknesses.
2.  **Attack Method Decomposition:**  Break down the "Potential Attack Methods" into concrete, step-by-step procedures an attacker might follow.  This will involve considering different attacker skill levels and available tools.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering data breaches, system disruption, resource exhaustion, and reputational damage.  We will categorize impact as High, Medium, or Low.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Expand on the provided "Mitigation" steps, providing specific configuration recommendations, code changes, and operational best practices.  We will prioritize mitigations based on their effectiveness and feasibility.
5.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  After implementing mitigations, identify any remaining risks and propose further actions to address them.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

#### 2. Compromise YARN (Code Execution/Resource Control)

**Overall Risk: HIGH**

YARN is the central resource manager in Hadoop.  Compromising YARN grants an attacker significant control over the cluster, enabling them to execute arbitrary code, steal data, and disrupt operations.

#### 2a. Weak Authentication/Authorization to YARN - [HIGH RISK]

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Weak Kerberos Configuration:**  Misconfigured Kerberos (e.g., weak keytab permissions, outdated KDC software, use of weak encryption algorithms) can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users or services.
*   **Simple Authentication (or No Authentication):**  The default "simple" authentication in Hadoop trusts the username provided by the client *without verification*.  This is highly vulnerable.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:**  Even with strong authentication, if authorization policies are too permissive (e.g., allowing all authenticated users to submit applications), attackers can still exploit the system.
*   **Lack of Network Segmentation:**  If the YARN ResourceManager and NodeManagers are accessible from untrusted networks, attackers can directly interact with them, bypassing any perimeter defenses.

**Attack Method Decomposition (2a2. No Authentication - Example):**

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker scans the network for open YARN ports (typically 8088 for the ResourceManager web UI and others for NodeManager communication).
2.  **Job Submission:** The attacker uses the `yarn` command-line tool or crafts HTTP requests to the YARN REST API.  They specify a malicious application (e.g., a simple shell script that downloads and executes a backdoor).  No credentials are provided.
3.  **Application Execution:** YARN, configured with simple authentication, accepts the job without verifying the user's identity.  The application is scheduled and executed on a NodeManager.
4.  **Code Execution:** The malicious script runs, establishing a foothold on the cluster.
5.  **Escalation:** The attacker leverages the initial foothold to further compromise the cluster, potentially accessing data in HDFS or launching other attacks.

**Impact Assessment: HIGH**

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in HDFS.
*   **System Disruption:**  Attackers can terminate running jobs, consume all cluster resources, or even shut down the cluster.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Attackers can launch resource-intensive jobs (e.g., cryptocurrency mining) for their own benefit.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation.

**Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**

*   **Enforce Strong Authentication (Kerberos):**
    *   **Mandatory:**  Configure YARN to *require* Kerberos authentication.  Disable simple authentication completely (`yarn.resourcemanager.principal`, `yarn.nodemanager.principal`, etc., must be set).
    *   **Keytab Security:**  Protect keytab files with strict file system permissions (read-only by the YARN user).  Regularly rotate keytabs.
    *   **KDC Hardening:**  Ensure the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is patched, securely configured, and monitored for suspicious activity.
    *   **Strong Encryption:** Use strong encryption algorithms for Kerberos tickets (e.g., AES-256).
*   **Implement Strict Authorization (ACLs):**
    *   **YARN Queues:**  Use YARN queues to segment resources and control access.  Define Access Control Lists (ACLs) for each queue, specifying which users and groups can submit applications, administer the queue, etc. (`yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.acl_submit_applications`, `yarn.scheduler.capacity.<queue-path>.acl_administer_queue`).
    *   **Fine-Grained Permissions:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and groups.  Avoid using wildcard permissions.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Hadoop cluster on a dedicated network segment, restricting access from untrusted networks using firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs).
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the YARN configuration and Kerberos setup to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Service Principal Names (SPNs):** Ensure that SPNs are correctly configured and unique for each service.

#### 2c. Rogue YARN Application (Malicious Container) - [HIGH RISK]

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Untrusted Application Sources:**  Allowing users to submit applications from untrusted sources (e.g., public repositories) increases the risk of malicious code.
*   **Insufficient Code Validation:**  Lack of code review, static analysis, or dynamic analysis of submitted applications allows malicious code to slip through.
*   **Overly Permissive Container Environments:**  Containers running with excessive privileges (e.g., root access, access to host resources) can be exploited to compromise the host system.
*   **Lack of Resource Isolation:**  If containers are not properly isolated, a malicious container can interfere with other containers or the host system.

**Attack Method Decomposition (2c1. Application Submission - Example):**

1.  **Craft Malicious Application:** The attacker develops a YARN application (e.g., a MapReduce job) that includes malicious code.  This code might:
    *   Read sensitive data from HDFS.
    *   Download and execute a remote shell.
    *   Launch a denial-of-service attack against other services.
    *   Attempt to escalate privileges within the container or on the host.
2.  **Submit Application:** The attacker submits the application to YARN using the command-line interface or REST API, providing valid credentials (obtained through other means, or if authentication is weak).
3.  **Application Execution:** YARN schedules the application and executes it within a container on a NodeManager.
4.  **Malicious Code Execution:** The malicious code within the application runs, carrying out the attacker's objectives.
5.  **Data Exfiltration/Damage:** The attacker exfiltrates data, disrupts services, or causes other damage.

**Impact Assessment: HIGH (Potentially CRITICAL)**

The impact is highly variable, depending on the malicious code.  It could range from data exfiltration to complete system compromise.  A rogue application could even be used to launch attacks against other systems outside the Hadoop cluster.

**Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**

*   **Application Submission Control:**
    *   **Whitelist:**  Implement a whitelist of trusted application sources or users who are allowed to submit applications.
    *   **Code Signing:**  Require applications to be digitally signed by trusted developers.  Verify signatures before execution.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong authentication and authorization for application submission, as described in 2a.
*   **Code Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, FindBugs) to scan application code for potential vulnerabilities before execution.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Run applications in a sandboxed environment to monitor their behavior and detect malicious activity.
    *   **Code Review:**  Require manual code review for all submitted applications, especially those from untrusted sources.
*   **Containerization and Isolation:**
    *   **Docker (or Similar):**  Use containerization technologies like Docker to isolate applications and limit their privileges.
    *   **Resource Quotas:**  Enforce resource quotas (CPU, memory, disk I/O) on containers to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **User Namespace Mapping:**  Map container users to unprivileged host users to prevent privilege escalation.
    *   **Seccomp Profiles:**  Use seccomp profiles to restrict the system calls that containers can make.
    *   **AppArmor/SELinux:**  Use mandatory access control (MAC) systems like AppArmor or SELinux to further restrict container access to system resources.
*   **Monitoring and Auditing:**
    *   **Application Logs:**  Regularly audit application logs for suspicious activity (e.g., unusual system calls, network connections, file access).
    *   **Resource Usage Monitoring:**  Monitor resource usage patterns to detect anomalies that might indicate malicious activity.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to detect and alert on suspicious network traffic and system events.
*   **Yarn Service Level Authorization:** Enable and configure service-level authorization to control which users can perform specific actions on YARN resources.

### 3. Residual Risk Assessment

Even with all the above mitigations in place, some residual risk remains:

*   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  New vulnerabilities in Hadoop or related software could be discovered and exploited before patches are available.
*   **Insider Threats:**  A malicious or compromised insider with legitimate access to the cluster could bypass many security controls.
*   **Sophisticated Attackers:**  Highly skilled attackers might be able to find ways to circumvent even the most robust defenses.

**Further Actions:**

*   **Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:**  Regularly conduct vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and address weaknesses.
*   **Threat Intelligence:**  Stay informed about the latest threats and vulnerabilities related to Hadoop and YARN.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan to handle security breaches effectively.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Train all users and administrators on security best practices to reduce the risk of human error.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Continuously review and refine user and service permissions, ensuring they adhere to the principle of least privilege.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the YARN compromise attack path and offers actionable recommendations to significantly reduce the risk.  Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and a proactive security posture are crucial for maintaining the security of a Hadoop cluster.
