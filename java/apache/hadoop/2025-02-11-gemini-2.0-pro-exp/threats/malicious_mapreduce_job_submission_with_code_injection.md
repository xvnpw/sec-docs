Okay, let's break down the "Malicious MapReduce Job Submission with Code Injection" threat in a detailed analysis.

## Deep Analysis: Malicious MapReduce Job Submission with Code Injection

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the attack vectors associated with malicious MapReduce job submissions.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities within the Hadoop ecosystem that could be exploited.
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of existing mitigation strategies and propose enhancements.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for the development team to strengthen the application's security posture against this threat.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses on the following components and their interactions:

*   **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):**  Specifically, the ResourceManager (RM) and NodeManager (NM).  We'll examine how jobs are submitted, scheduled, and executed.
*   **MapReduce Framework:**  The job submission process, the execution of Mapper and Reducer tasks, and the handling of job configurations.
*   **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** While not the primary focus, HDFS is relevant as it stores job-related files (JARs, input data) that could be manipulated.
*   **Client-Side Components:**  The tools and libraries used to submit MapReduce jobs (e.g., the Hadoop command-line client, web UIs).
* **Authentication and Authorization mechanisms:** Kerberos, Ranger, Knox.

This analysis *excludes* threats related to network-level attacks (e.g., DDoS) or physical security, focusing solely on the application-level threat of code injection via job submission.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Review:**  Revisit the initial threat model entry to ensure a complete understanding of the threat's description, impact, and affected components.
2.  **Attack Vector Analysis:**  Identify specific ways an attacker could inject malicious code into a MapReduce job. This will involve examining the job submission process, configuration options, and potential vulnerabilities in the MapReduce framework.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Research known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and common weaknesses in Hadoop related to code injection.  This includes examining the source code of relevant Hadoop components (where accessible) and reviewing security advisories.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**  Assess the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies in the threat model.  Identify any gaps or weaknesses in these mitigations.
5.  **Recommendation Generation:**  Develop concrete, actionable recommendations for the development team to improve security.  These recommendations will be prioritized based on their impact and feasibility.
6. **Documentation:** Create clear and concise documentation of the analysis, findings, and recommendations.

### 2. Attack Vector Analysis

An attacker can inject malicious code through several avenues:

*   **Job Configuration Parameters:**
    *   **`mapreduce.job.jar`:**  The most obvious vector.  An attacker could submit a JAR file containing malicious classes disguised as legitimate MapReduce code.
    *   **`mapreduce.map.class` / `mapreduce.reduce.class`:**  Specifying a malicious class name that exists on the classpath (perhaps due to a previously compromised node or a dependency confusion attack).
    *   **`mapreduce.job.ubertask.enable`:** If uber tasks are enabled, a small malicious job might run directly within the ApplicationMaster, potentially bypassing some security checks.
    *   **Streaming Jobs (Shell Scripts):**  Using `mapreduce.job.map.command` or `mapreduce.job.reduce.command` to execute arbitrary shell scripts.  These scripts could download and execute malware, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **InputFormat/OutputFormat Manipulation:**  Specifying a custom, malicious `InputFormat` or `OutputFormat` that executes arbitrary code during data reading or writing.
    *   **Configuration File Injection:**  Submitting a job with a modified `mapred-site.xml` or `yarn-site.xml` that alters security settings or introduces vulnerabilities.
    * **Exploiting libraries:** Using vulnerable libraries in map reduce job.

*   **Input Data Manipulation:**
    *   **Data Poisoning:**  Crafting input data that triggers a vulnerability in a legitimate Mapper or Reducer.  This could involve exploiting buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other code injection flaws in the application's data processing logic.  This is particularly relevant if the Mapper/Reducer uses native libraries or external tools.
    *   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  If the Mapper or Reducer deserializes data from untrusted sources (e.g., input files), an attacker could inject malicious serialized objects that execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.

*   **Exploiting Existing Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Known CVEs:**  Leveraging unpatched vulnerabilities in Hadoop components (e.g., YARN, MapReduce, HDFS) to gain code execution.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  Using previously unknown vulnerabilities to achieve code injection.

* **Compromised Nodes:**
    * If attacker already has access to one of the nodes, he can use it to inject malicious code.

### 3. Vulnerability Analysis

Several classes of vulnerabilities are relevant:

*   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities:**  These are the most direct threat.  They can occur in:
    *   **Improper Input Validation:**  Failure to properly sanitize job configuration parameters or input data.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:**  Deserializing untrusted data without proper validation.
    *   **Dynamic Code Loading:**  Loading code from untrusted sources (e.g., user-supplied JAR files) without adequate security checks.
    *   **Command Injection:**  Constructing shell commands using untrusted input without proper escaping.

*   **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**
    *   **Weak Authentication:**  Using weak passwords or default credentials.
    *   **Misconfigured Kerberos:**  Improperly configured Kerberos authentication can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Insufficient Authorization:**  Users having more permissions than necessary, allowing them to submit malicious jobs.
    *   **YARN ACL Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured YARN ACLs can allow unauthorized users to submit jobs.

*   **Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not directly code injection, a malicious job could consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), making the cluster unavailable to legitimate users.

* **Dependency Confusion:**
    * Attacker can upload malicious package with the same name as internal package to public repository.

**Example CVEs (Illustrative, not exhaustive):**

*   **CVE-2018-11769:**  Apache Hadoop YARN ResourceManager command injection vulnerability.
*   **CVE-2016-3089:**  Apache Hadoop MapReduce command injection vulnerability.
*   **CVE-2015-1775:**  Apache Hadoop HDFS vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution.

These CVEs highlight the importance of staying up-to-date with security patches.

### 4. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigations:

*   **Strict Input Validation:**  **Essential.**  Whitelisting is crucial.  Validation should be performed at multiple levels (client-side, ResourceManager, NodeManager).  Regular expressions should be carefully crafted to avoid ReDoS vulnerabilities.  Validation should include data type, length, and allowed character sets.
*   **Secure Class Loading:**  **Highly Recommended.**  Using a custom `ClassLoader` with restricted permissions (e.g., using Java's `SecurityManager`) is vital for limiting the capabilities of untrusted code.  Sandboxing with a separate JVM adds another layer of defense.
*   **Code Signing:**  **Recommended.**  Ensures that only trusted code is executed.  Requires a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and key management.  Needs to be integrated with the job submission process.
*   **YARN ACLs:**  **Essential.**  Properly configured ACLs restrict job submission to authorized users and groups.  This is a fundamental security control.  Regular audits of ACLs are necessary.
*   **Resource Limits:**  **Essential.**  Limits the damage a malicious job can cause.  Should be enforced at the container level (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth).  Consider using cgroups for resource isolation.
*   **Static Code Analysis:**  **Recommended.**  Can detect potential vulnerabilities before execution.  Tools like FindBugs, PMD, and SonarQube can be used.  Requires integration with the CI/CD pipeline.  May produce false positives.
* **Dynamic Code Analysis:** **Recommended.** Can detect vulnerabilities during runtime.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** **Essential.** Use Kerberos, Ranger, Knox.
* **Network Segmentation:** **Recommended.** Isolate hadoop cluster from other networks.
* **Regular Security Audits:** **Essential.** Regularly audit security configuration.
* **Penetration Testing:** **Recommended.** Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Keep Software Up to Date:** **Essential.** Regularly update hadoop and all related software.

**Gaps and Weaknesses:**

*   **Complexity:**  Implementing all these mitigations can be complex and require significant effort.
*   **Performance Overhead:**  Some mitigations (e.g., sandboxing, code signing) can introduce performance overhead.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  Mitigations may not be effective against unknown vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Poisoning:**  The existing mitigations don't fully address the threat of data poisoning.  Additional measures, such as robust input validation within Mappers/Reducers and anomaly detection, are needed.
* **Dependency Confusion:** Static code analysis can help, but it is not always effective.

### 5. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Input Validation:** Implement the most rigorous input validation possible for *all* job configuration parameters and input data.  Use whitelisting and strict type checking.  Validate at multiple layers (client, RM, NM).
2.  **Enforce Secure Class Loading:** Implement a secure `ClassLoader` with restricted permissions.  Strongly consider using a separate, sandboxed JVM for untrusted code.
3.  **Implement Code Signing:** Require digital signatures for all submitted JAR files and scripts.  Establish a robust PKI and key management process.
4.  **Strengthen YARN ACLs:**  Ensure that YARN ACLs are correctly configured and regularly audited.  Follow the principle of least privilege.
5.  **Enforce Resource Limits:**  Implement strict resource limits on containers using cgroups.  Monitor resource usage and alert on anomalies.
6.  **Integrate Static and Dynamic Code Analysis:**  Incorporate static and dynamic code analysis tools into the CI/CD pipeline to scan submitted code for vulnerabilities.
7.  **Address Data Poisoning:**  Implement robust input validation *within* Mappers and Reducers.  Consider using anomaly detection techniques to identify malicious input data.
8.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.
9.  **Stay Up-to-Date:**  Apply security patches promptly.  Monitor security advisories for Hadoop and related components.
10. **Harden Authentication and Authorization:** Use Kerberos for authentication. Use Ranger or Knox for authorization. Regularly review and update access control policies.
11. **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Hadoop cluster from other networks to limit the attack surface.
12. **Dependency Management:** Regularly review and update project dependencies. Use tools to identify and mitigate dependency confusion risks.
