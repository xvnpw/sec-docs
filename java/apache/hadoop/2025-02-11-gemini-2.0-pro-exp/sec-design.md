# Project Design Document: Apache Hadoop

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Apache Hadoop is a mature, widely-used open-source project. It's a cornerstone of many organizations' big data strategies. The business priorities and goals revolve around:

*   Reliable and Scalable Data Storage: Providing a distributed file system (HDFS) that can handle petabytes of data across commodity hardware.
*   Efficient Data Processing: Enabling large-scale data processing using the MapReduce framework and, more recently, other processing engines like Spark and Flink that can leverage HDFS.
*   Cost-Effectiveness: Leveraging commodity hardware to reduce the cost of storing and processing large datasets compared to traditional solutions.
*   Open Source Ecosystem: Fostering a vibrant community and ecosystem of tools and applications built around Hadoop.
*   Fault Tolerance: Ensuring data availability and processing continuity even in the face of hardware failures.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in HDFS.
*   Data Loss: Loss of data due to hardware failures, software bugs, or operational errors.
*   Service Disruption: Interruption of data processing jobs due to cluster instability or resource contention.
*   Compliance Violations: Failure to meet regulatory requirements related to data privacy and security.
*   Performance Bottlenecks: Inefficient data processing or storage leading to delays and increased costs.
*   Complexity and Operational Overhead: The inherent complexity of managing a distributed system like Hadoop can lead to operational challenges and increased costs.
*   Security Vulnerabilities: Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Hadoop components or related ecosystem projects.
*   Data Integrity Issues: Corruption of data during storage or processing.

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Kerberos Authentication: Hadoop uses Kerberos for strong authentication of users and services. Described in Hadoop documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs): HDFS provides ACLs to control access to files and directories. Described in HDFS documentation.
*   security control: Service-Level Authorization: Hadoop provides authorization mechanisms to control which users can submit jobs and access resources. Described in Hadoop configuration files.
*   security control: Data Encryption (at rest and in transit): Hadoop supports encryption of data both in transit (using TLS/SSL) and at rest (using HDFS encryption zones). Described in Hadoop documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: Auditing: Hadoop provides auditing capabilities to track user activity and system events. Described in Hadoop documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: Secure Configuration: Hadoop provides various configuration options to enhance security, such as disabling unnecessary services and enabling security features. Described in Hadoop configuration files.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of Configuration: Securely configuring Hadoop can be complex, and misconfigurations can lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on External Security Infrastructure: Hadoop's security often relies on external systems like Kerberos, which introduces dependencies and potential points of failure.
*   accepted risk: Potential for Insider Threats: While access controls are in place, malicious insiders with legitimate access could still pose a threat.
*   accepted risk: Ecosystem Security: The security of the Hadoop ecosystem depends on the security of numerous related projects, which may have their own vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   security control: Integrate with centralized identity and access management (IAM) systems.
*   security control: Implement network segmentation to isolate Hadoop clusters from other networks.
*   security control: Enable and monitor security-related logs comprehensively.
*   security control: Implement data masking or anonymization for sensitive data.
*   security control: Regularly update Hadoop and related ecosystem components to the latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement robust monitoring and alerting for security-related events.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users and services must be strongly authenticated, preferably using Kerberos.
    *   Multi-factor authentication should be considered for privileged users.
    *   Integration with existing enterprise identity providers (e.g., Active Directory) should be supported.

*   Authorization:
    *   Access to data and resources must be controlled based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Fine-grained access control mechanisms (e.g., ACLs) should be used.
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from external sources (e.g., user-submitted jobs, data from external systems) must be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Data should be validated for type, length, format, and range.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Data in transit must be encrypted using TLS/SSL.
    *   Data at rest should be encrypted using HDFS encryption zones or other appropriate encryption mechanisms.
    *   Strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices must be used.

### BUILD

Hadoop's build process is complex and involves multiple components. It uses Apache Maven as the primary build tool.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer(("Developer")) --> GitRepository["Git Repository\n(Source Code)"]
    GitRepository --> BuildServer["Build Server\n(e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)"]
    BuildServer --> Maven["Maven\n(Build Tool)"]
    Maven --> StaticAnalysis["Static Analysis Tools\n(e.g., FindBugs, SpotBugs, Checkstyle)"]
    Maven --> UnitTests["Unit Tests"]
    Maven --> IntegrationTests["Integration Tests"]

    UnitTests --> BuildArtifacts
    IntegrationTests --> BuildArtifacts
    BuildArtifacts --> ArtifactRepository["Artifact Repository\n(e.g., Apache Nexus, JFrog Artifactory)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to the Git repository.
2.  A build server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) triggers a build based on commits or a schedule.
3.  Maven is used to manage dependencies, compile code, run tests, and package the software.
4.  Static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs, SpotBugs, Checkstyle) are integrated into the Maven build process to identify potential bugs and code quality issues.
5.  Unit tests and integration tests are executed as part of the build process.
6.  Build artifacts (JARs, TARs) are generated.
7.  Build artifacts are published to an artifact repository (e.g., Apache Nexus, JFrog Artifactory).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Maven is used to manage dependencies and ensure that only approved versions are used.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check can be integrated to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Build Server Security: The build server itself is secured and access is restricted.
*   security control: Artifact Repository Security: The artifact repository is secured and access is controlled.
*   security control: Signed Artifacts: Build artifacts can be digitally signed to ensure their integrity.
