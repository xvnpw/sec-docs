# Threat Model Analysis for apache/hadoop

## Threat: [Unauthorized HDFS Data Access via Direct Block Access](./threats/unauthorized_hdfs_data_access_via_direct_block_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized HDFS Data Access via Direct Block Access

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the underlying operating system of a DataNode and attempts to directly read data blocks from the disk, bypassing HDFS permissions and ACLs.  This could be achieved through a compromised DataNode, physical access, or exploitation of an OS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach; sensitive data is exposed directly, bypassing all HDFS security mechanisms.
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS DataNode (specifically, the underlying file system and block storage).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HDFS Encryption at Rest:** Implement encryption zones with strong keys managed by a secure KMS (Key Management Service). This ensures data is encrypted on disk, rendering direct block access useless without the decryption key.
        *   **Operating System Security:** Harden the operating system of all DataNodes. Implement strict access controls, file system permissions, and regular security patching.
        *   **Physical Security:** If DataNodes are physically accessible, implement strong physical security controls to prevent unauthorized access.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) on DataNodes to monitor for suspicious file system activity.

## Threat: [Malicious MapReduce Job Submission with Code Injection](./threats/malicious_mapreduce_job_submission_with_code_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious MapReduce Job Submission with Code Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a specially crafted MapReduce job that contains malicious code embedded within the job configuration (e.g., as a Java class, a shell script within a streaming job, or a manipulated input file that triggers a vulnerability in a mapper or reducer). The attacker aims to execute arbitrary code on the cluster nodes.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for complete cluster compromise, data exfiltration, data destruction, or use of the cluster for malicious purposes (e.g., botnet, cryptocurrency mining).
    *   **Affected Component:** YARN (ResourceManager, NodeManager), MapReduce framework (Job submission process, Mapper/Reducer execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation for *all* job configuration parameters. Reject any input that doesn't conform to expected formats and types. Use whitelisting rather than blacklisting.
        *   **Secure Class Loading:** If custom code is allowed, use a secure class loader that restricts the permissions of loaded code. Consider using a separate, sandboxed JVM for untrusted code.
        *   **Code Signing:** Require that all submitted code (JAR files, scripts) be digitally signed by trusted entities.
        *   **YARN ACLs:** Restrict job submission to authorized users and groups using YARN ACLs.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory) on containers to limit the damage a malicious job can cause.
        *   **Static Code Analysis:** Use static code analysis tools to scan submitted code for potential vulnerabilities before execution.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits a large number of resource-intensive jobs (or a single, very large job) to YARN, overwhelming the cluster's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This prevents legitimate jobs from running.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of service; legitimate users are unable to run their jobs, potentially causing business impact.
    *   **Affected Component:** YARN (ResourceManager, NodeManager), potentially HDFS (if the attack involves excessive data access).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **YARN Capacity/Fair Scheduler:** Configure YARN's capacity scheduler or fair scheduler with appropriate resource quotas and limits for different users and queues.
        *   **Preemption:** Enable job preemption to allow higher-priority jobs to preempt lower-priority jobs that are consuming excessive resources.
        *   **Container Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory) on individual containers using cgroups.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on job submissions to prevent a single user or application from flooding the cluster.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity or resource exhaustion.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via HDFS Client Manipulation](./threats/data_tampering_via_hdfs_client_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering via HDFS Client Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a client application that has write access to HDFS. The attacker uses this compromised client to modify or delete data in HDFS, potentially corrupting data or causing data loss.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity violation; data stored in HDFS is no longer reliable.
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS (DataNodes, NameNode), Client Application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HDFS ACLs:** Implement strict HDFS ACLs to limit write access to specific files and directories based on user/group. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Client Application Security:** Secure the client application itself. Implement strong authentication, authorization, and input validation. Regularly patch the client application for vulnerabilities.
        *   **HDFS Auditing:** Enable HDFS auditing to track all write operations, including the user and client application responsible.
        *   **Data Integrity Checks:** Regularly verify the integrity of data stored in HDFS using checksums or other data validation techniques.
        *   **HDFS Snapshots:** Use HDFS snapshots to create point-in-time backups of data, allowing for recovery from accidental or malicious modifications.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Hadoop Dependencies](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_hadoop_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerable Hadoop Dependencies

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a third-party library used by Hadoop (e.g., a vulnerable version of a logging library, a serialization library, or a web framework). This could lead to remote code execution or other security breaches.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete cluster compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Hadoop component that uses the vulnerable dependency (could be HDFS, YARN, MapReduce, or other services).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use an SCA tool to identify and track all third-party dependencies used by Hadoop and their associated vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Hadoop and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. Subscribe to security advisories for Hadoop and its related projects.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to manage Hadoop's dependencies and ensure that only approved versions are used.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Hadoop cluster for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
