# Threat Model Analysis for apache/hadoop

## Threat: [Unauthorized HDFS Data Access](./threats/unauthorized_hdfs_data_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized HDFS Data Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit misconfigured HDFS permissions to directly read sensitive data files. This could involve using Hadoop CLI tools or APIs with compromised credentials or by exploiting vulnerabilities in permission checks within Hadoop.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data, potential regulatory violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS (Namenode - for permission checks, Datanodes - for data storage). Specifically, the `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.FSPermissionChecker` and related classes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication using Kerberos.
        *   Enforce strict Access Control Lists (ACLs) on HDFS directories and files, following the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly audit and review HDFS permissions.
        *   Disable anonymous access to HDFS.

## Threat: [Malicious MapReduce Job Submission](./threats/malicious_mapreduce_job_submission.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious MapReduce Job Submission
    *   **Description:** An attacker could submit a crafted MapReduce job designed to steal data from HDFS, disrupt other jobs, or consume excessive cluster resources. This could be done by compromising user credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in Hadoop's job submission mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, denial of service, resource exhaustion, potential for arbitrary code execution on cluster nodes.
    *   **Affected Component:** YARN (ResourceManager - for job scheduling and resource allocation, NodeManager - for executing tasks), MapReduce framework. Specifically, the `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager` and `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce` packages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for job submission.
        *   Enforce resource quotas and limits for users and jobs within YARN.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within MapReduce jobs to prevent malicious code injection.
        *   Monitor job submissions and resource usage for suspicious activity within Hadoop's monitoring tools.

## Threat: [Data Tampering in HDFS](./threats/data_tampering_in_hdfs.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering in HDFS
    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to HDFS could modify or corrupt data files. This could be achieved through compromised credentials or by exploiting vulnerabilities in Hadoop's data replication or storage mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity issues, incorrect application behavior, potential for business disruption and financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS (Datanodes - for data storage, Namenode - for metadata management). Specifically, the data block management within `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization to restrict write access to HDFS.
        *   Utilize HDFS snapshots for data recovery.
        *   Implement data integrity checks (e.g., checksums) and monitoring within HDFS.
        *   Consider using HDFS audit logging to track data modifications.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Hadoop RPC](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_hadoop_rpc.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Hadoop RPC
    *   **Description:** If communication between Hadoop components (e.g., NameNode and DataNodes) is not encrypted, an attacker could intercept and potentially manipulate RPC calls, leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions within the Hadoop cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity issues, potential for cluster compromise, unauthorized control over Hadoop components.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hadoop RPC framework used for inter-component communication. Specifically, the `org.apache.hadoop.ipc` package.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable RPC encryption using SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) with Kerberos within Hadoop's configuration.
        *   Ensure proper configuration of Hadoop security settings to enforce authentication and encryption.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Hadoop Version Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_hadoop_version_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Hadoop Version Exploitation
    *   **Description:** Using an outdated or vulnerable version of Apache Hadoop exposes the application to known security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit directly against the Hadoop infrastructure.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution on Hadoop nodes, data breaches within HDFS, and denial of service affecting Hadoop services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any component within the Hadoop distribution depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Hadoop installation up-to-date with the latest security patches and stable releases.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for announcements of new Hadoop vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and address known Hadoop risks.

## Threat: [Compromised Hadoop Node](./threats/compromised_hadoop_node.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Hadoop Node
    *   **Description:** If an attacker gains control of a node within the Hadoop cluster (e.g., a DataNode or NodeManager), they can perform various malicious actions directly within Hadoop, such as stealing data from HDFS, injecting malicious code into running MapReduce tasks, or disrupting Hadoop services.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption within HDFS, denial of service affecting Hadoop services, cluster compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any component running on the compromised Hadoop node.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating systems of all Hadoop nodes.
        *   Implement strong access controls and monitoring on all Hadoop nodes.
        *   Use network segmentation to isolate the Hadoop cluster.
        *   Regularly scan Hadoop nodes for vulnerabilities and malware.

## Threat: [Insecure Delegation Token Handling](./threats/insecure_delegation_token_handling.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Delegation Token Handling
    *   **Description:** If delegation tokens, a Hadoop security mechanism for granting temporary access, are not properly secured or managed by the application, attackers could intercept or steal these tokens and use them to impersonate authorized users within the Hadoop ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and resources within Hadoop, potential for malicious actions under legitimate user identities within the Hadoop cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hadoop security framework, specifically the delegation token management within components like HDFS and YARN.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use HTTPS for communication when obtaining and using Hadoop delegation tokens.
        *   Store Hadoop delegation tokens securely and protect them from unauthorized access.
        *   Implement short expiration times for Hadoop delegation tokens.
        *   Avoid logging or transmitting Hadoop delegation tokens in insecure ways.
