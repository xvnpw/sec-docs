## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL] Exploit Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical__exploit_default_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to Hadoop services (e.g., NameNode web UI, DataNode web UI, YARN ResourceManager UI, SSH) using default usernames and passwords that were not changed during the initial setup.
*   **Impact:** Successful login grants the attacker significant control over the Hadoop cluster, potentially leading to full data access, modification, deletion, or denial of service.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Default credentials are widely known or easily guessable, making this a low-effort attack with a high chance of success if not addressed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Exploit Missing or Misconfigured Kerberos/Other Auth](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_missing_or_misconfigured_kerberosother_auth.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If Kerberos or another authentication mechanism is not properly implemented or is misconfigured (e.g., weak keytab permissions, incorrect configuration files), attackers can bypass authentication checks and impersonate legitimate users or services.
*   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to HDFS data, submit malicious jobs, or perform administrative actions as a trusted entity.
*   **Why High-Risk:** While requiring more effort than exploiting default credentials, misconfigurations in complex authentication systems are common, increasing the likelihood of success.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Exploit Unsecured RPC Communication](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_unsecured_rpc_communication.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Hadoop components communicate using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). If this communication is not encrypted (e.g., using SASL with encryption), attackers can eavesdrop on network traffic to intercept sensitive data (including authentication tokens) or potentially inject malicious commands.
*   **Impact:** Data interception can lead to exposure of confidential information. Command injection can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on Hadoop nodes.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Lack of encryption is a common vulnerability, and the tools to intercept and analyze network traffic are readily available.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization for Job Submission](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_weak_authenticationauthorization_for_job_submission.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If YARN does not properly authenticate and authorize users submitting jobs, attackers can submit malicious or resource-intensive jobs without legitimate credentials.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to resource exhaustion, denial of service on the YARN cluster, or potentially data manipulation by executing malicious processing tasks.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Weak authentication controls are a common issue, and the impact of resource exhaustion can be significant.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Exploit Lack of Input Validation in Job Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_lack_of_input_validation_in_job_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious job configurations that exploit vulnerabilities in how YARN processes these configurations. This could involve injecting code or specifying excessive resource requests.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to resource exhaustion, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution on NodeManagers.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Input validation is a common area of weakness, and the potential for code execution makes this a serious threat.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Exploit Network Vulnerabilities or Unsecured RPC (within YARN)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_network_vulnerabilities_or_unsecured_rpc__within_yarn_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to the HDFS scenario, if communication between YARN components (ResourceManager, NodeManagers, ApplicationMasters) is not secured, attackers can intercept or manipulate messages.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to YARN instability, job failures, or the ability to control or disrupt resource allocation.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Consistent lack of encryption across different Hadoop components increases the overall attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Input Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_input_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If the MapReduce or other processing framework deserializes untrusted input data without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious serialized objects that execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the nodes processing the data, allowing for full system compromise.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Deserialization vulnerabilities are a well-known class of security flaws with severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK, CRITICAL] Exploit Enabled Debugging/Admin Interfaces](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__critical__exploit_enabled_debuggingadmin_interfaces.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Hadoop often provides web-based debugging and administrative interfaces. If these interfaces are left enabled in production environments without proper authentication or with default credentials, attackers can gain access to sensitive information, modify configurations, or even control the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the Hadoop cluster, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or system compromise.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  These interfaces often provide powerful capabilities and are easily accessible if not properly secured.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Exploit Disabled Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__exploit_disabled_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If authentication and authorization are completely disabled on Hadoop services, anyone with network access can interact with the cluster without any restrictions.
*   **Impact:**  Full, unrestricted access to HDFS data, the ability to submit arbitrary jobs, and control over the cluster.
*   **Why High-Risk:** While a basic security practice, misconfigurations or intentional disabling for testing purposes left in production can have catastrophic consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH_RISK] Access Sensitive Information (e.g., credentials) in Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk__access_sensitive_information__e_g___credentials__in_configuration_files.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Hadoop configuration files may contain sensitive information, such as database credentials or API keys. If these files have overly permissive access controls, attackers can read them and obtain these credentials.
*   **Impact:**  Stolen credentials can be used to access other systems or escalate privileges within the Hadoop environment.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Storing secrets in configuration files is a common anti-pattern, and lax file permissions are a frequent misconfiguration.
