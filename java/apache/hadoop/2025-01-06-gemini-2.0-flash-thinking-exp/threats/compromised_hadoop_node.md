This document provides a detailed analysis of the "Compromised Hadoop Node" threat identified in our application's threat model, which utilizes Apache Hadoop. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the threat, its potential impact, and actionable mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Deep Dive:**

The "Compromised Hadoop Node" threat represents a significant security risk to our application. It goes beyond simply losing access to a single server; it signifies a breach within the core infrastructure responsible for storing and processing our critical data. An attacker gaining control of a Hadoop node gains a foothold within the trusted environment of the cluster, allowing them to leverage the inherent functionalities and permissions within Hadoop for malicious purposes.

**Understanding the Attack Landscape:**

An attacker could compromise a Hadoop node through various attack vectors, including but not limited to:

* **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities:** Unpatched operating systems, Hadoop daemons, or other software running on the node can be exploited to gain initial access. This includes known vulnerabilities in Java, SSH, or specific Hadoop components.
* **Weak Credentials:** Default or easily guessable passwords for user accounts or services running on the node provide a simple entry point.
* **Malware Infection:** Introduction of malware through phishing attacks targeting administrators, drive-by downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in other applications running on the same network.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromise of third-party software or hardware components used in the Hadoop environment.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent actions by authorized personnel with access to the Hadoop infrastructure.
* **Physical Access:** In scenarios where physical security is lacking, an attacker might gain direct access to the server.

**Once Inside: The Attacker's Arsenal:**

A compromised Hadoop node provides an attacker with a powerful platform for various malicious activities:

* **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data stored in HDFS. This could involve directly reading files, manipulating access control lists (ACLs), or leveraging Hadoop's APIs.
* **Data Corruption:** Modifying or deleting data within HDFS, potentially leading to data loss, integrity issues, and application malfunctions. This can be done subtly, making detection difficult.
* **Code Injection and Execution:** Injecting malicious code into running MapReduce or YARN applications. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on other nodes in the cluster, potentially escalating their access and impact.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting Hadoop services by overloading resources, crashing daemons, or manipulating configurations. This can render the entire application unavailable.
* **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised node as a stepping stone to attack other nodes within the Hadoop cluster or the broader network. This could involve leveraging trust relationships between nodes or exploiting network vulnerabilities.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to gain root or superuser privileges on the compromised node or within the Hadoop ecosystem to gain broader control.
* **Installation of Backdoors:** Establishing persistent access mechanisms for future exploitation, even after the initial vulnerability is patched.

**2. Impact Analysis (Expanded):**

The "Critical" risk severity assigned to this threat is justified by the potentially devastating impact it can have:

* **Data Breach (Detailed):**  Beyond simply stealing data, a breach could expose personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, intellectual property, or other sensitive information, leading to significant financial losses, regulatory fines (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.
* **Data Corruption within HDFS (Detailed):**  This can lead to inconsistent or unreliable data, impacting business intelligence, analytics, and decision-making processes. Recovering from data corruption can be time-consuming and costly, potentially requiring complete data restoration from backups.
* **Denial of Service Affecting Hadoop Services (Detailed):**  Disruption of core Hadoop services like HDFS, YARN, or MapReduce can render the entire application unusable, impacting business operations, service level agreements (SLAs), and customer satisfaction. Prolonged outages can lead to significant financial losses.
* **Cluster Compromise (Detailed):**  A single compromised node can be the entry point for a wider attack, leading to the compromise of the entire Hadoop cluster. This scenario represents a catastrophic failure, potentially requiring a complete rebuild of the infrastructure. The attacker could gain control over all data and processing capabilities.
* **Reputational Damage:**  News of a successful attack on our Hadoop infrastructure can severely damage our reputation and erode customer trust, leading to loss of business and difficulty attracting new customers.
* **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Data breaches and security incidents can result in legal action, regulatory investigations, and significant fines, particularly if sensitive data is involved.
* **Financial Losses:**  Direct costs associated with incident response, data recovery, system restoration, legal fees, and potential fines, as well as indirect costs due to business disruption and reputational damage.

**3. Affected Components (Granular View):**

While the initial description states "Any component running on the compromised Hadoop node," let's break down specific Hadoop components and their vulnerability in this scenario:

* **DataNodes:**  Direct access to stored data. An attacker can read, modify, or delete data blocks.
* **NameNode:**  While not directly storing data, the NameNode holds metadata about the file system. Compromise here could lead to manipulation of file locations and permissions, causing data loss or misdirection.
* **ResourceManager:**  Controls resource allocation for applications. A compromised ResourceManager could be used to starve legitimate applications of resources or launch malicious tasks.
* **NodeManagers:**  Manage resources on individual nodes and execute tasks. A compromised NodeManager allows for direct code execution on that node and potentially other nodes.
* **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):**  The resource management framework. Compromise here can disrupt job execution and resource allocation across the cluster.
* **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System):**  The core storage layer. Direct target for data theft and corruption.
* **MapReduce/Spark/Other Processing Engines:**  Attackers can inject malicious code into running jobs to steal data, execute commands, or disrupt processing.
* **Operating System:**  The underlying OS is a critical point of vulnerability. Compromise here grants broad access to all running processes and resources.
* **Installed Applications and Services:**  Any other software running on the node (e.g., monitoring agents, databases) can be exploited or leveraged by the attacker.

**4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Actionable):**

The provided mitigation strategies are a good starting point. Let's expand on them with specific actionable steps:

* **Harden the Operating Systems of all Hadoop Nodes:**
    * **Regular Patching:** Implement a robust patching schedule for the OS, kernel, and all installed software. Automate patching where possible.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Identify and disable any services not required for Hadoop functionality to reduce the attack surface.
    * **Strong System Configuration:** Implement security hardening guidelines (e.g., CIS benchmarks) for OS configurations, including file system permissions, kernel parameters, and network settings.
    * **Implement a Host-Based Firewall:** Configure firewalls on each node to restrict network access to only necessary ports and protocols.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of OS configurations to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
