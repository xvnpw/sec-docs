Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain control of the NameNode, leading to cluster-wide disruption, data corruption, or unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Availability compromise, business disruption, data inaccessibility, potential data integrity compromise, potential cluster-wide compromise.
*   **Affected Hadoop Component:** HDFS (NameNode)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the NameNode software and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Harden the NameNode operating system and restrict access to the NameNode server.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor NameNode activity.
    *   Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) on the NameNode server.
    *   Regularly scan the NameNode for vulnerabilities.
    *   Deploy a highly available NameNode setup (HA) to mitigate single point of failure risks.

## Threat: [ResourceManager Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/resourcemanager_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the YARN ResourceManager service. Similar to NameNode vulnerabilities, this could lead to control over the ResourceManager, disrupting resource allocation, application execution, and potentially the entire cluster.
*   **Impact:** Availability compromise, application failures, business disruption, potential cluster-wide compromise.
*   **Affected Hadoop Component:** YARN (ResourceManager)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the ResourceManager software and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Harden the ResourceManager operating system and restrict access to the ResourceManager server.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor ResourceManager activity.
    *   Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) on the ResourceManager server.
    *   Regularly scan the ResourceManager for vulnerabilities.
