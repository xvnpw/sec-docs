# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache Hadoop project aims to provide a reliable, scalable, distributed computing platform for processing large datasets. It enables organizations to store and analyze massive amounts of data that would be impractical to handle with traditional single-server systems.

Business priorities and goals for organizations adopting Hadoop typically include:
- Big Data Processing: Efficiently process and analyze large volumes of data to gain insights.
- Scalability and Reliability: Handle growing data volumes and ensure continuous operation even with hardware failures.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Provide a cost-effective solution for big data processing compared to traditional data warehousing solutions.
- Data Analytics and Business Intelligence: Enable advanced analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence applications on large datasets.

Most important business risks associated with Hadoop deployments include:
- Data Breaches and Data Loss: Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored and processed within Hadoop clusters.
- Service Disruption and Downtime: Failures in the Hadoop cluster leading to unavailability of data processing services.
- Data Integrity Issues: Corruption or modification of data during processing or storage.
- Compliance and Regulatory Risks: Failure to meet data privacy and security regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) when handling sensitive data.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Inefficient configuration or resource management leading to slow data processing and missed business objectives.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the Apache Hadoop project and typical deployments:
- security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs) for HDFS file and directory permissions. Implemented within HDFS.
- security control: Kerberos authentication for cluster services and user access. Configured and managed within the Hadoop cluster and integrated with enterprise Kerberos infrastructure.
- security control: Data encryption in transit using TLS/SSL for communication between Hadoop components and clients. Configured within Hadoop services.
- security control: Data encryption at rest for HDFS data. Configured within HDFS using encryption zones and key management systems.
- security control: Ranger or Apache Sentry for fine-grained authorization and policy management. Deployed as separate components integrated with Hadoop services.
- security control: Audit logging for user access and administrative actions. Configured within Hadoop services and potentially integrated with centralized logging systems.
- security control: Secure Shell (SSH) access control to cluster nodes. Operating system level security control.
- security control: Network segmentation to isolate Hadoop clusters from untrusted networks. Network infrastructure level security control.
- security control: Regular security patching of operating systems and Hadoop components. Operational security process.
- security control: Vulnerability scanning of Hadoop infrastructure and applications. Security operations process.

Accepted risks for typical Hadoop deployments:
- accepted risk: Complexity of security configuration and management, potentially leading to misconfigurations.
- accepted risk: Performance overhead of encryption and security features.
- accepted risk: Reliance on external security infrastructure like Kerberos and key management systems.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party Hadoop ecosystem components.
- accepted risk: Insider threats with privileged access to Hadoop clusters.

Recommended security controls to implement:
- security control: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access to Hadoop clusters and related systems.
- security control: Deploy and utilize a centralized security information and event management (SIEM) system to monitor Hadoop security events and detect anomalies.
- security control: Implement data loss prevention (DLP) measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the Hadoop environment without authorization.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of Hadoop deployments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) for consistent and secure Hadoop cluster deployments.

Security requirements for the Apache Hadoop project and deployments:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Securely authenticate users and services accessing Hadoop resources.
    - Requirement: Support integration with enterprise authentication systems like Active Directory or LDAP.
    - Requirement: Implement strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Enforce fine-grained access control to data and resources based on user roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Support policy-based authorization management.
    - Requirement: Implement least privilege access principles.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all inputs to Hadoop services to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided data before processing or storage.
    - Requirement: Implement input validation at multiple layers (e.g., application, API, data storage).
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.
    - Requirement: Protect cryptographic keys from unauthorized access.
