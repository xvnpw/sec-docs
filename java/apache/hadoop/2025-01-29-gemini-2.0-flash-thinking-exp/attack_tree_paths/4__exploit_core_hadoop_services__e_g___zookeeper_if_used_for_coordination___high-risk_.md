    * **Regular Patching:**  Keeping core services and their dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolating core services within a secure network segment, limiting network access to only authorized components and administrators.
    * **Monitoring and Logging:** Implementing comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect anomalous activity and potential security breaches targeting core services.

#### 4.1. Compromise ZooKeeper (if used) [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** This node focuses specifically on compromising ZooKeeper. While newer Hadoop versions might use alternative coordination mechanisms, many deployments, especially those using older versions or specific distributions, rely heavily on ZooKeeper.  ZooKeeper acts as a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and group services.
* **Impact:** **High to Critical** - Compromising ZooKeeper can have devastating consequences for a Hadoop cluster:
    * **Cluster Instability:** ZooKeeper is crucial for maintaining cluster consistency. Its compromise can lead to split-brain scenarios, leader election failures, and overall cluster instability.
    * **Service Disruption:** Many Hadoop services depend on ZooKeeper for service discovery and coordination. If ZooKeeper is unavailable or compromised, these services can become dysfunctional.
    * **Data Corruption:**  ZooKeeper stores critical metadata and configuration information. Tampering with this data can lead to data corruption in HDFS or incorrect job execution in YARN.
    * **Information Disclosure:** ZooKeeper can store sensitive configuration details, connection strings, and potentially even credentials, which could be exposed if compromised.
* **Mitigation:** Hardening ZooKeeper security is essential for Hadoop cluster stability and security. Key mitigations include:
    * **Harden ZooKeeper Security:**
        * **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  Disable any ZooKeeper features or functionalities that are not required for the Hadoop deployment to reduce the attack surface.
        * **Secure Configuration:**  Review and harden the `zoo.cfg` configuration file, ensuring secure settings for ports, data directories, and other parameters.

    * **Restrict Access:**
        * **Network Firewalls:** Implement network firewalls to restrict access to ZooKeeper ports (default 2181, 2888, 3888) from only authorized hosts and networks within the Hadoop cluster.
        * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Utilize ZooKeeper's ACLs to implement fine-grained access control, limiting which users and IP addresses can perform specific operations on ZooKeeper znodes (data nodes).
    * **Implement DoS Protection:**
        * **Connection Limits:** Configure ZooKeeper to limit the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address to prevent connection flooding attacks.
        * **Request Rate Limiting:**  Consider implementing rate limiting mechanisms at the network level or within ZooKeeper (if available through plugins or custom configurations) to mitigate request flooding attacks.
    * **Regularly Patch:**  Establish a process for regularly patching ZooKeeper and its dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor vendor advisories for timely updates.
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization (ACLs):**  As mentioned above, enforce strong authentication for clients connecting to ZooKeeper and utilize ACLs to control access to specific znodes and operations.  Consider using Kerberos authentication for enhanced security in enterprise environments.

#### 4.1.1. DoS ZooKeeper [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against ZooKeeper aim to overwhelm the service, making it unavailable to legitimate clients and disrupting the Hadoop cluster's coordination and operation.
* **Impact:** **Medium to High** - While not directly leading to data corruption, a successful DoS attack on ZooKeeper can cause:
    * **Service Disruption:**  Hadoop services that rely on ZooKeeper will become unavailable or function erratically.
    * **Cluster Instability:**  Loss of coordination can lead to cluster instability, potentially causing job failures, data inconsistencies, and even cluster-wide outages.
* **Mitigation:** Mitigating DoS attacks requires a multi-layered approach:
    * **Connection Limits:**  Configure ZooKeeper's `maxClientCnxns` parameter in `zoo.cfg` to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections from a single IP address. This helps prevent connection flooding attacks.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the network firewall level to restrict the number of connection requests or data requests from a specific source within a given time frame.  This can help mitigate both connection and request flooding.
    * **Network Firewalls:**  Deploy network firewalls to filter traffic to ZooKeeper ports, allowing only legitimate traffic from within the Hadoop cluster and authorized administrative networks.  This can block malicious traffic from external sources.
    * **Patching:**  Regularly patch ZooKeeper to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS attacks. Vulnerabilities in the ZooKeeper software itself could be leveraged to crash or overload the service.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Connection Flooding [HIGH-RISK]:**
        * **Technical Details:** An attacker floods ZooKeeper with a massive number of connection requests, exceeding its capacity to handle legitimate connections. This can exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), preventing legitimate clients from connecting.
        * **Example Scenario:** A botnet is used to send thousands of connection requests to the ZooKeeper port from various compromised machines.
        * **Mitigation:**
            * **`maxClientCnxns` Configuration:**  Properly configure the `maxClientCnxns` parameter in `zoo.cfg` to limit connections per IP.
            * **SYN Flood Protection (Firewall/Load Balancer):**  Enable SYN flood protection on network firewalls or load balancers in front of ZooKeeper to mitigate TCP SYN flood attacks.
            * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and block connection flooding attempts based on traffic patterns.

        * **Example Scenario:** An attacker sends a script that continuously sends `getData` requests for a large number of znodes, consuming ZooKeeper's resources.
        * **Mitigation:**
            * **Request Rate Limiting (Network/Application Level):** Implement rate limiting at the network firewall or potentially at the application level (if ZooKeeper plugins or custom solutions allow) to restrict the number of requests per second from a source.
            * **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor ZooKeeper's resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts to detect unusual spikes in request rates that might indicate a request flooding attack.
            * **Optimize ZooKeeper Performance:**  Tune ZooKeeper configuration and hardware resources to handle expected workloads and potential spikes in legitimate traffic, making it more resilient to request flooding.
    * **Exploiting Unpatched Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**
        * **Technical Details:** Attackers exploit known security vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper software that have not been patched. These vulnerabilities could allow them to crash the ZooKeeper service, trigger resource exhaustion, or execute arbitrary code, leading to DoS.
        * **Example Scenario:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability in a specific ZooKeeper version allows an attacker to send a specially crafted packet that causes the ZooKeeper server to crash.
        * **Mitigation:**

    * **Encryption at Rest (Limited in ZooKeeper):** ZooKeeper itself does not natively support encryption at rest for its data store. Consider implementing file system level encryption for the ZooKeeper data directories if required by security policies.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Unauthorized Access to ZooKeeper Data [HIGH-RISK]:**
        * **Technical Details:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to ZooKeeper data due to:
            * **Open Access:**  ZooKeeper is misconfigured with open access (no authentication or weak ACLs).
            * **Credential Compromise:**  Attackers compromise credentials of authorized users or services that have read access to ZooKeeper.
            * **Insider Threat:**  Malicious insiders with legitimate access abuse their privileges to access sensitive information.
        * **Example Scenario:**  ZooKeeper is deployed with default configurations and no ACLs. An attacker gains network access to the ZooKeeper port and uses ZooKeeper client tools to browse and extract configuration data.
        * **Mitigation:**
            * **Enforce Authentication and Authorization (ACLs):**  As described above, implement strong authentication and fine-grained ACLs to control access to ZooKeeper data.
            * **Regular Access Reviews:**  Periodically review and audit ZooKeeper access logs and ACL configurations to identify and address any unauthorized access or overly permissive permissions.
            * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary read access to ZooKeeper data to users and services.
    * **Exploiting ZooKeeper Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]:**
        * **Technical Details:** Attackers exploit security vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper software that allow them to bypass authentication or authorization and extract data from ZooKeeper. This could involve vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized data retrieval or information leakage.
        * **Example Scenario:** A vulnerability in ZooKeeper allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request that bypasses ACL checks and allows them to read any znode.
        * **Mitigation:**
            * **Regular Patching (Critical):**  Promptly apply security patches for ZooKeeper to address known vulnerabilities that could lead to information disclosure.
            * **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan ZooKeeper servers for vulnerabilities.
            * **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block exploit attempts targeting ZooKeeper vulnerabilities.

#### 4.1.4. Availability Disruption of ZooKeeper [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** This node focuses on attacks that aim to disrupt the availability of ZooKeeper, making it unavailable to the Hadoop cluster. This can be achieved through various means, including DoS attacks (already covered) and data corruption that leads to ZooKeeper instability.
* **Impact:** **Medium to High** - Disruption of ZooKeeper availability can lead to:
    * **Service Disruption:** Hadoop services dependent on ZooKeeper will become unavailable or malfunction.
    * **Cluster Instability:** Loss of coordination can cause cluster instability, potentially leading to job failures and cluster outages.
* **Mitigation:** Ensuring ZooKeeper availability requires redundancy, monitoring, and proactive measures against DoS and data corruption:
    * **Redundancy:**
        * **ZooKeeper Ensemble:** Deploy ZooKeeper in an ensemble (cluster) of multiple servers (typically an odd number like 3 or 5). This provides fault tolerance and high availability. If one or more ZooKeeper servers fail, the ensemble can continue to operate.
        * **Leader Election:** ZooKeeper's leader election mechanism ensures that if the leader server fails, a new leader is automatically elected from the remaining servers, minimizing downtime.
    * **Monitoring:**
        * **Health Checks:** Implement robust health checks to monitor the status of ZooKeeper servers and the ensemble. Monitor metrics like server status, leader status, connection counts, request latency, and resource utilization.

    * **Data Integrity Checks:** While ZooKeeper doesn't have extensive built-in data integrity features, ensure the underlying storage system for ZooKeeper data directories is reliable and protected against data corruption. Regularly back up ZooKeeper data to facilitate recovery in case of data corruption or failures.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **DoS ZooKeeper [HIGH-RISK]:** (As described in 4.1.1. DoS ZooKeeper) - Connection flooding, request flooding, and exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities can all lead to ZooKeeper unavailability.
    * **Data Corruption Leading to ZooKeeper Instability:**
        * **Technical Details:**  Maliciously or accidentally corrupting the data stored in ZooKeeper's data directories can lead to ZooKeeper server crashes, failures to start, or inconsistent behavior, ultimately disrupting its availability.
        * **Example Scenario:** An attacker with write access to the ZooKeeper server's file system directly modifies the data files in the ZooKeeper data directory, introducing corruption.
        * **Mitigation:**
            * **Strong Access Controls to ZooKeeper Servers:**  Restrict physical and remote access to ZooKeeper server machines to only authorized administrators.
            * **File System Integrity Monitoring:**  Implement file system integrity monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications to ZooKeeper data directories.
            * **Regular Backups and Recovery Procedures:**  Establish a robust backup and recovery plan for ZooKeeper data. Regularly back up ZooKeeper data and test the recovery procedures to ensure quick restoration in case of data corruption or failures.
            * **Data Validation (Application Level):**  If possible, implement application-level validation of data retrieved from ZooKeeper to detect and handle potential data corruption issues.
