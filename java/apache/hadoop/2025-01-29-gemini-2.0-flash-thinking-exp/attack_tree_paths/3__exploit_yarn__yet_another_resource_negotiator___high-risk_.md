### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit YARN

#### 3. Exploit YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** YARN is the resource management layer in Hadoop, responsible for allocating cluster resources and scheduling applications. Exploiting YARN means targeting this core component to disrupt operations, steal resources, or gain unauthorized control.  Successful exploitation can have widespread and severe consequences across the entire Hadoop cluster.
* **Impact:** High to Critical -  Compromising YARN can lead to a cascade of issues. Service disruption can halt critical data processing pipelines. Resource theft can impact performance and availability for legitimate users. Control over application execution allows attackers to run malicious code, potentially leading to data breaches, further system compromise, or denial of service. Information disclosure can reveal sensitive metadata about applications and cluster operations, aiding further attacks.
* **Mitigation:** Securing YARN is paramount. This requires a multi-layered approach:
    * **Secure ResourceManager and NodeManagers:**  Harden the operating systems and configurations of servers hosting these critical components.
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (Kerberos is the standard in Hadoop) to verify user and service identities. Enforce strict authorization policies (ACLs) to control access to YARN resources and APIs.
    * **Resource Quotas:**  Define and enforce resource quotas to limit the resources that individual users or applications can consume, preventing resource exhaustion attacks.
    * **Regular Patching:**  Keep Hadoop and all underlying components (OS, Java, etc.) up-to-date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate YARN components within secure network segments to limit the impact of breaches and control network traffic.
    * **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement comprehensive monitoring of YARN components to detect anomalous activity and potential attacks in real-time. Set up alerts for critical events.

#### 3.1. Compromise ResourceManager [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** The ResourceManager (RM) is the central authority in YARN. It manages cluster resources, schedules applications, and oversees NodeManagers. Compromising the RM is a highly impactful attack as it grants control over the entire cluster's resource allocation and application execution.
* **Impact:** High to Critical -  A compromised RM can lead to cluster-wide availability disruption, as the RM is essential for all application execution. Resource theft becomes trivial as the attacker controls allocation. Control over application execution is direct, allowing for malicious application deployment and manipulation. Information disclosure is significant as the RM holds metadata about all applications and cluster resources.
* **Mitigation:**  Securing the ResourceManager is the highest priority for YARN security.
    * **Harden ResourceManager Security:**  Apply security hardening best practices to the RM server, including OS hardening, disabling unnecessary services, and using a firewall.
    * **Restrict Access:**  Limit access to the RM UI and API to only authorized administrators and services. Implement strong access control lists (ACLs).
    * **Implement DoS Protection:**  Employ rate limiting and input validation on RM APIs to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if the RM UI is exposed to external networks (though generally discouraged).
    * **Regularly Patch:**  Prioritize patching the ResourceManager component and its dependencies.
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce Kerberos authentication for all communication with the RM. Implement fine-grained authorization to control who can submit applications, access RM information, and perform administrative tasks.
    * **Dedicated Hardware (Optional but Recommended for High Security):** Consider running the ResourceManager on dedicated, hardened hardware to further isolate it.

##### 3.1.1. DoS ResourceManager (Availability Impact) [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:**  A Denial of Service (DoS) attack against the ResourceManager aims to overwhelm it with requests or resource consumption, making it unavailable to process legitimate application submissions and resource allocations. This effectively halts all application execution on the cluster.
* **Impact:** High - Service disruption is the primary impact. Cluster unavailability means no new applications can be started, and running applications may be affected if they require new resources. This can lead to significant business disruption and inability to meet SLAs.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Resource Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor RM resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) to detect anomalies and potential DoS attacks early.
    * **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on RM APIs, especially application submission and resource request APIs, to prevent excessive requests from a single source.
    * **Resource Quotas:**  Enforce resource quotas to limit the impact of any single user or application consuming excessive resources.
    * **Patching:**  Regularly patch the RM to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited for DoS attacks.
    * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all inputs to RM APIs to prevent malformed requests from crashing the service.
    * **Network Security:**  Use firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block malicious network traffic targeting the RM.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory) [HIGH-RISK]:**  Attackers can submit a large number of resource-intensive requests or applications designed to consume excessive CPU and memory on the RM server, starving it of resources and causing it to become unresponsive.  *Example: Submitting applications with extremely high memory or CPU requirements, or repeatedly requesting large numbers of containers.*
    * **Excessive Application Submissions [HIGH-RISK]:** Flooding the RM with a massive number of application submission requests can overwhelm its processing capacity, leading to delays and eventual service failure. *Example: Using a botnet to rapidly submit thousands of application submission requests.*
    * **Exploiting Unpatched Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the ResourceManager software (e.g., in the web UI, API endpoints, or core scheduling logic) can allow attackers to directly crash the RM service or cause it to enter a denial-of-service state. *Example: Exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in an RM API endpoint to crash the service.*

##### 3.1.2. Resource Manipulation/Theft via ResourceManager [CRITICAL]

* **Description:** This attack aims to manipulate the ResourceManager's resource allocation logic or steal resources intended for legitimate applications. This can be achieved by gaining unauthorized access to the RM or exploiting vulnerabilities in its resource management mechanisms.
* **Impact:** High - Resource theft directly impacts legitimate applications, causing denial of resources and performance degradation. This can lead to application failures, missed deadlines, and reduced overall cluster efficiency. In severe cases, it can effectively deny service to legitimate users.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization:**  Robustly authenticate all users and services interacting with the RM. Implement fine-grained authorization to control who can request resources, modify application priorities, or access resource allocation information. Kerberos is essential.
    * **Robust Resource Scheduling Algorithms:**  Utilize and configure robust resource scheduling algorithms (e.g., Fair Scheduler, Capacity Scheduler) that are resistant to manipulation and prioritize fairness and resource utilization. Regularly review and tune scheduler configurations.
    * **Resource Quotas:**  Enforce strict resource quotas at user, group, and application levels to limit the amount of resources any single entity can consume, preventing resource monopolization.
    * **Patching:**  Keep the ResourceManager patched to address vulnerabilities in resource scheduling and allocation logic that could be exploited for manipulation.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs to RM APIs related to resource requests and application configurations to prevent injection attacks that could manipulate resource allocation.
    * **Audit Logging:**  Maintain detailed audit logs of all resource allocation events and administrative actions on the RM to detect and investigate suspicious activity.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK]:** If authentication or authorization mechanisms are weak or misconfigured, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the RM APIs or UI. This allows them to directly manipulate resource allocations, change application priorities, or steal resources. *Example: Exploiting default credentials, bypassing weak authentication, or leveraging misconfigured ACLs to gain administrative access to the RM.*
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Resource Scheduling/Allocation [CRITICAL]:**  Vulnerabilities in the RM's resource scheduling algorithms or allocation logic can be exploited to manipulate resource distribution. Attackers might be able to craft specific application requests or exploit race conditions to gain disproportionate access to resources or starve other applications. *Example: Exploiting a vulnerability in the Fair Scheduler to prioritize malicious applications over legitimate ones, or using a specially crafted application to trigger a bug in resource allocation logic.*

##### 3.1.3. Information Disclosure via ResourceManager [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** This attack focuses on gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by the ResourceManager. This information can include application metadata (user, application ID, configuration), resource allocation details, cluster topology, and potentially even application logs if accessible through the RM UI/API.
* **Impact:** Medium to High - Information leakage can lead to privacy violations if application metadata contains sensitive user information. It can also provide attackers with valuable insights into cluster operations, application behavior, and potential vulnerabilities, aiding in planning further attacks.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Restrict Access to ResourceManager UI/API:**  Implement strict access controls to the RM web UI and API.  Require strong authentication (Kerberos) and authorization for access. Limit access to only authorized administrators and monitoring services.  Consider disabling the UI/API entirely if not strictly needed for operational purposes and rely on command-line tools or secure APIs for management.
    * **Secure Logging:**  Ensure that RM logs do not inadvertently expose sensitive information. Sanitize logs to remove or mask sensitive data before storage. Implement secure log storage and access controls.
    * **Sanitize Error Messages:**  Avoid exposing overly detailed error messages in the RM UI or API responses, as these can reveal internal system details or potential vulnerabilities to attackers. Provide generic error messages and log detailed errors securely for administrators.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and services accessing the RM. Avoid overly permissive roles that could lead to information disclosure.
    * **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of RM configurations, access controls, and logging practices to identify and remediate potential information disclosure vulnerabilities.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Unauthorized Access to ResourceManager Web UI [HIGH-RISK]:** If the RM web UI is accessible without proper authentication or with weak authentication, attackers can gain access and browse sensitive information displayed in the UI, such as application lists, resource usage, and cluster metrics. *Example: Exploiting default credentials, bypassing weak authentication, or accessing an improperly secured RM UI exposed to the internet.*
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in ResourceManager Web UI/API [HIGH-RISK]:**  Vulnerabilities in the RM web UI or API (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, API vulnerabilities) can be exploited to extract sensitive information. Attackers might use these vulnerabilities to bypass authentication, access restricted data, or inject malicious scripts to steal information from legitimate users accessing the UI. *Example: Exploiting an XSS vulnerability in the RM UI to steal session cookies of administrators, or using an API vulnerability to query sensitive application metadata without proper authorization.*

##### 3.1.4. Control Application Execution via ResourceManager [CRITICAL]

* **Description:** This is a highly critical attack that aims to gain control over the execution of applications within the Hadoop cluster by manipulating the ResourceManager. This allows attackers to run malicious applications, modify the behavior of existing applications, or disrupt legitimate workloads.
* **Impact:** Critical -  Gaining control over application execution is a severe compromise. Attackers can run malicious applications to steal data, perform further attacks within the cluster, or disrupt services. Manipulating application behavior can lead to data corruption, incorrect results, or denial of service. This can have significant business and operational consequences.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Strong Authentication and Authorization for Application Submission:**  Enforce strong authentication (Kerberos) for all application submissions. Implement robust authorization policies to control who can submit applications and what types of applications they are allowed to submit.
    * **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all application submission requests and configurations to prevent injection attacks or the submission of malicious parameters.
    * **Secure Application Submission Process:**  Implement a secure application submission process that includes checks for malicious code, resource requests, and configurations. Consider using application whitelisting or sandboxing techniques.
    * **Patching:**  Regularly patch the ResourceManager and related components to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass application submission checks or manipulate application execution.
    * **Application Sandboxing and Isolation (Containerization):**  Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) for application execution to isolate applications from each other and the underlying NodeManager. Implement strong container security measures to prevent container escapes and limit the impact of compromised applications.
    * **Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:**  Monitor application execution for suspicious behavior, such as unexpected resource consumption, network connections, or file access patterns. Implement anomaly detection systems to identify and alert on potentially malicious application activity.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Malicious Application Submission [CRITICAL]:** Attackers directly submit malicious applications to the cluster, aiming to have them executed by YARN.
        * **Bypassing Application Submission Checks [CRITICAL]:** Attackers attempt to circumvent security checks during application submission, such as authentication, authorization, or malware scanning, to successfully submit malicious applications. *Example: Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application submission API, using stolen credentials, or crafting applications that evade malware detection.*
        * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Application Submission Process [CRITICAL]:**  Vulnerabilities in the application submission process itself (e.g., in input validation, file parsing, or security checks) can be exploited to inject malicious code or configurations into submitted applications. *Example: Exploiting a vulnerability in the application archive parsing logic to inject malicious code into the application package.*
        * **Social Engineering to Submit Malicious Application (if applicable) [HIGH-RISK]:** In environments with less stringent controls, attackers might use social engineering techniques to trick authorized users into submitting malicious applications unknowingly. *Example: Phishing attacks targeting Hadoop users to trick them into submitting a seemingly legitimate application that is actually malicious.*
    * **Application Manipulation after Submission [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers attempt to manipulate running applications after they have been submitted and are being managed by YARN.
        * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in ApplicationMaster Communication [CRITICAL]:**  Vulnerabilities in the communication channels between the ResourceManager and ApplicationMasters (AMs) can be exploited to intercept or manipulate communication. This could allow attackers to alter application configurations, inject malicious code into running applications, or disrupt application execution. *Example: Man-in-the-middle attacks on communication between RM and AMs, exploiting vulnerabilities in the RPC protocol used for communication.*

#### 3.2. Compromise NodeManagers [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** NodeManagers (NMs) are the worker nodes in YARN that execute application containers. Compromising NMs allows attackers to execute code directly on worker nodes, access data within containers, and potentially pivot to other parts of the cluster.
* **Impact:** High to Critical - Code execution on NMs grants significant control over worker nodes. Resource exhaustion on NMs can impact application performance and stability. Data exfiltration from NMs can lead to data breaches. Compromised NMs can be used as a launchpad for lateral movement within the cluster.
* **Mitigation:** Securing NodeManagers is crucial for protecting worker nodes and the applications running on them.
    * **Secure NodeManager Servers:** Harden the operating systems and configurations of servers hosting NodeManagers. Apply security best practices for server hardening.
    * **Container Security:** Implement robust container security measures to isolate containers from each other and the host NodeManager. Use secure container runtimes and configurations.
    * **Resource Quotas:** Enforce resource quotas at the container level to limit the resources that individual containers can consume, preventing resource exhaustion on NMs.
    * **Regular Patching:** Keep NodeManager software, container runtimes, and underlying OS patched to address known vulnerabilities.
    * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate NodeManagers within secure network segments to limit lateral movement in case of compromise. Implement network policies to control communication between NMs and other components.
    * **Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS on NodeManager servers and network segments to detect and prevent malicious activity.
    * **Least Privilege within Containers:**  Run applications within containers with the least privileges necessary to perform their functions. Avoid running containers as root.

##### 3.2.1. Code Execution on NodeManagers [CRITICAL]

* **Description:** Achieving code execution on a NodeManager server is a critical security breach. It grants the attacker full control over the NodeManager, allowing them to perform arbitrary actions, including accessing data, installing malware, and potentially pivoting to other systems.
* **Impact:** Critical - Full control over NodeManager is the most severe impact. This can lead to data access and theft, installation of persistent backdoors, lateral movement to other nodes, and complete service disruption on the compromised NodeManager.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Container Security:**  Robust container security is the primary mitigation. This includes:
        * **Secure Container Runtimes:** Use secure and patched container runtimes (e.g., Docker, containerd).
        * **Container Image Security:**  Use trusted and scanned container images. Implement image scanning and vulnerability management.
        * **Container Isolation:**  Enforce strong container isolation using namespaces, cgroups, and security profiles (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux).
        * **Resource Limits:**  Set resource limits for containers to prevent resource exhaustion and contain the impact of compromised containers.
    * **Regular Patching:**  Keep NodeManager software, container runtimes, and the underlying OS patched to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited for code execution.
    * **Intrusion Detection:**  Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) on NodeManager servers to detect malicious activity and potential code execution attempts.
    * **Least Privilege within Containers:**  Run applications within containers with the least privileges necessary. Avoid running containers as root. Implement capabilities management to restrict container capabilities.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploiting Containerization Vulnerabilities (e.g., Docker escape if used) [CRITICAL]:**  Vulnerabilities in container runtimes (like Docker) or container configurations can be exploited to escape the container environment and gain access to the host NodeManager operating system. *Example: Exploiting a known Docker escape vulnerability to gain root access on the NodeManager host.*
    * **Exploiting NodeManager Vulnerabilities (Software bugs) [CRITICAL]:**  Vulnerabilities in the NodeManager software itself (e.g., in its RPC endpoints, web UI, or core components) can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the NodeManager server. *Example: Exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in a NodeManager API endpoint to execute shellcode.*
    * **Privilege Escalation within Containers [HIGH-RISK]:**  Even if the initial container entry point is not privileged, attackers might be able to exploit vulnerabilities within the application running in the container or in the container environment to escalate privileges to root within the container. From there, they might be able to further escalate privileges to the host NodeManager. *Example: Exploiting a setuid binary vulnerability within a container to gain root privileges inside the container, and then using this to escape to the host.*

##### 3.2.2. Resource Exhaustion on NodeManagers [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** This attack aims to exhaust the resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth) of NodeManager servers, impacting the performance and stability of applications running on those NMs. This can lead to application slowdowns, failures, and overall service disruption.
* **Impact:** Medium to High - Service disruption and application performance degradation are the primary impacts. Resource exhaustion can cause applications to run slowly, fail to complete tasks, or even crash. This can impact business operations and SLAs.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Resource Quotas:**  Enforce resource quotas at the container level to limit the resources that individual containers can consume. This prevents a single malicious or poorly written application from monopolizing NM resources.
    * **Fair Scheduling:**  Utilize fair scheduling mechanisms within YARN to distribute resources fairly among applications and prevent resource starvation.
    * **Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor NodeManager resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) to detect anomalies and potential resource exhaustion attacks. Set up alerts for high resource usage.
    * **DoS Protection:**  Implement DoS protection measures at the network level to prevent attackers from overwhelming NodeManagers with network traffic.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize application resource requests to prevent applications from requesting excessive resources.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Malicious Applications Consuming Excessive Resources [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers submit applications specifically designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, etc.) on NodeManagers. These applications might be intentionally designed to exhaust resources or might be poorly written and resource-intensive. *Example: Submitting applications with very high memory or CPU requirements, or applications that contain infinite loops or memory leaks.*
    * **DoS NodeManager Service [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers directly target NodeManager services (e.g., RPC endpoints, web UI) with DoS attacks to overwhelm them and cause resource exhaustion. *Example: Flooding NodeManager RPC endpoints with a large number of requests, or exploiting a vulnerability in the NM web UI to cause excessive resource consumption.*
    * **Exploiting Unpatched Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in NodeManager software or container runtimes can allow attackers to cause resource exhaustion indirectly. For example, a vulnerability might allow an attacker to trigger a memory leak or CPU-intensive operation within the NodeManager service. *Example: Exploiting a vulnerability in the NodeManager's container management logic to trigger a memory leak that eventually exhausts NM memory.*

##### 3.2.3. Data Exfiltration from NodeManagers [HIGH-RISK]

* **Description:** This attack aims to steal data from NodeManagers. This data can include application data processed by containers running on the NM, application logs, configuration files, or even sensitive data stored on the NodeManager server itself.
* **Impact:** High - Data breach and information leakage are the primary impacts. Exfiltrated data can include sensitive business information, personal data, or intellectual property, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Container Isolation:**  Strong container isolation is crucial to prevent containers from accessing data outside their designated boundaries.
    * **Access Controls:**  Implement strict access controls on NodeManager servers and container data directories. Limit access to only authorized users and services.
    * **Network Policies:**  Implement network policies to restrict network communication from containers and NodeManagers. Prevent containers from making unauthorized outbound network connections to exfiltrate data. Use network segmentation to isolate NodeManagers.
    * **Secure Logging:**  Implement secure logging practices to prevent sensitive data from being logged unnecessarily. Sanitize logs to remove or mask sensitive data. Securely store and access logs.
    * **Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit:**  Encrypt sensitive data at rest on NodeManager disks and in transit over the network to protect it from unauthorized access even if exfiltrated.
    * **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) (Optional):**  Consider implementing DLP solutions to monitor and prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data from NodeManagers.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Accessing Container Data Directories [HIGH-RISK]:** Attackers who gain access to a NodeManager (e.g., through code execution or compromised credentials) can directly access the data directories of containers running on that NM. These directories often contain application data, logs, and configuration files. *Example: Accessing Docker volume mounts or container file systems on the NodeManager host to steal application data.*
    * **Network Exfiltration from Containers [HIGH-RISK]:**  Attackers who compromise an application running in a container might be able to use network connections from within the container to exfiltrate data to external systems controlled by the attacker. *Example: Modifying a compromised application to send data over HTTP or DNS to an attacker-controlled server outside the Hadoop cluster.*
