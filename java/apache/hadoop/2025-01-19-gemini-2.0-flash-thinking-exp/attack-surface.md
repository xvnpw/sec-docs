# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/hadoop

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured HDFS Permissions](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_hdfs_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** Default or misconfigured HDFS permissions allow unauthorized access to data stored in the distributed file system.
*   **Hadoop Contribution:** HDFS's permission model, if not properly configured, can be overly permissive. Reliance on default settings without hardening.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains read access to sensitive customer data stored in HDFS due to world-readable permissions on a directory.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data access, potential regulatory fines.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement and enforce strict HDFS permissions using ACLs.
    *   Regularly review and audit HDFS permissions.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access.
    *   Disable default superuser access or manage it very carefully.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Job Submission to YARN](./attack_surfaces/malicious_job_submission_to_yarn.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in YARN to submit malicious jobs that can execute arbitrary code on cluster nodes or consume excessive resources.
*   **Hadoop Contribution:** YARN's resource management and job execution framework, if not secured, can be a vector for executing malicious code.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a MapReduce job that contains code to steal credentials from NodeManagers or launch a denial-of-service attack against other services.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, cluster compromise, denial of service, data exfiltration.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable authentication and authorization for YARN (e.g., using Kerberos).
    *   Implement resource quotas and limits to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Sanitize job configurations and inputs to prevent code injection.
    *   Monitor YARN job submissions for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-node Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of encryption for communication between Hadoop components (e.g., DataNodes and NameNode, ResourceManager and NodeManagers) exposes data in transit.
*   **Hadoop Contribution:** Hadoop's default configuration often doesn't enforce encryption for inter-node communication.
*   **Example:** An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic between DataNodes and the NameNode, intercepting sensitive data blocks being transferred.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, information disclosure, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable encryption for HDFS data in transit using features like HDFS encryption zones or TLS.
    *   Enable encryption for YARN RPC communication.
    *   Secure the network infrastructure where Hadoop is deployed.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Hadoop Web UIs](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_hadoop_web_uis.md)

*   **Description:** Unsecured or poorly configured Hadoop web UIs (e.g., NameNode UI, ResourceManager UI) can be vulnerable to attacks like XSS, CSRF, and authentication bypass.
*   **Hadoop Contribution:** Hadoop provides web UIs for management and monitoring, which, if not secured, become attack vectors.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability in the ResourceManager UI to steal the session cookies of an administrator.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, unauthorized access to cluster information and control, malicious actions performed on behalf of legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable authentication and authorization for Hadoop web UIs.
    *   Implement HTTPS for secure communication to the web UIs.
    *   Keep Hadoop versions up-to-date to patch known web UI vulnerabilities.
    *   Disable or restrict access to web UIs if not strictly necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Hadoop Daemon Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_hadoop_daemon_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Unpatched Hadoop daemons (NameNode, DataNode, ResourceManager, NodeManager) can be vulnerable to known security flaws that allow for remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Hadoop Contribution:** Hadoop's core functionality relies on these daemons, and vulnerabilities within them directly impact the security of the entire system.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in the NameNode to gain remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data loss, denial of service, infrastructure takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a robust patching process for Hadoop and its dependencies.
    *   Regularly monitor security advisories and apply necessary patches promptly.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems.

## Attack Surface: [Default or Weak Authentication Configurations](./attack_surfaces/default_or_weak_authentication_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** Using default passwords or weak authentication mechanisms for Hadoop services makes them easy targets for attackers.
*   **Hadoop Contribution:** Hadoop's initial setup might have default credentials or less secure authentication methods enabled.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials to gain administrative access to the ResourceManager.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, cluster compromise, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Hadoop users and service accounts.
    *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms like Kerberos.
    *   Disable or change default passwords immediately after installation.
    *   Consider using multi-factor authentication where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** If Hadoop relies on insecure deserialization of data, attackers can exploit this to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Hadoop Contribution:** Hadoop uses serialization for inter-process communication and data storage, and vulnerabilities in deserialization libraries can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by a Hadoop component, executes arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
    *   Use secure serialization libraries and keep them updated.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
