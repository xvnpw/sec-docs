# Threat Model Analysis for apache/hadoop

## Threat: [Data at Rest Exposure](./threats/data_at_rest_exposure.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying storage or HDFS due to missing encryption or weak access controls. They might directly access data files on disk or exploit vulnerabilities in HDFS services to read sensitive information.

**Impact:** Confidential data is exposed, leading to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** HDFS DataNodes, NameNode (metadata), underlying file system.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement HDFS Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
* Enforce strong HDFS Access Control Lists (ACLs).
* Utilize Kerberos for authentication and authorization.
* Secure the underlying operating system and storage.

## Threat: [Data in Transit Interception](./threats/data_in_transit_interception.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between HDFS clients and the NameNode or DataNodes, or between DataNodes themselves. They might use techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks to eavesdrop on data being transferred.

**Impact:** Sensitive data is exposed during transmission, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of data in transit.

**Affected Component:** HDFS RPC communication channels between clients, NameNode, and DataNodes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable RPC encryption using Kerberos or SSL/TLS.
* Ensure secure network configurations to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Threat: [NameNode Compromise](./threats/namenode_compromise.md)

**Impact:** Cluster unavailability, data loss or corruption, potential for malicious code execution on the NameNode.

**Affected Component:** HDFS NameNode service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Hadoop version up-to-date with security patches.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for NameNode access.
* Harden the operating system hosting the NameNode.
* Monitor NameNode logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [DataNode Compromise](./threats/datanode_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a DataNode service or gains unauthorized access. This allows them to read or modify data stored on that DataNode, potentially impacting data integrity and availability.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, potential for using the compromised node for further attacks within the cluster.

**Affected Component:** HDFS DataNode service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Hadoop version up-to-date with security patches.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for DataNode access.
* Harden the operating system hosting the DataNodes.
* Monitor DataNode logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [HDFS Permissions Bypass](./threats/hdfs_permissions_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds a way to bypass configured HDFS permissions or ACLs, allowing them to access or modify data they are not authorized to interact with. This could be due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the permission enforcement mechanisms.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data corruption, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** HDFS permission and ACL enforcement mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly review and audit HDFS permissions and ACLs.
* Enforce the principle of least privilege.
* Utilize tools for managing and verifying HDFS permissions.

## Threat: [ResourceManager Compromise](./threats/resourcemanager_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the ResourceManager service or gains unauthorized access. This allows them to control resource allocation, potentially leading to denial of service or the ability to execute arbitrary code on cluster nodes.

**Impact:** Cluster unavailability, inability to run applications, potential for malicious code execution across the cluster.

**Affected Component:** YARN ResourceManager service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Hadoop version up-to-date with security patches.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for ResourceManager access.
* Harden the operating system hosting the ResourceManager.
* Monitor ResourceManager logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [NodeManager Compromise](./threats/nodemanager_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a NodeManager service or gains unauthorized access. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on that node, potentially gaining access to data or using the node for further attacks.

**Impact:** Compromise of individual compute nodes, potential for lateral movement within the cluster, data breaches.

**Affected Component:** YARN NodeManager service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Hadoop version up-to-date with security patches.
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for NodeManager access.
* Isolate NodeManagers using containerization technologies (e.g., Docker).
* Harden the operating system hosting the NodeManagers.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Application Submission](./threats/unauthorized_application_submission.md)

**Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication and authorization mechanisms to submit malicious applications to the YARN cluster. These applications could consume excessive resources, attempt to access sensitive data, or execute malicious code.

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion, denial of service for legitimate applications, potential for data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** YARN application submission process, ResourceManager.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong authentication and authorization for application submission (e.g., using Kerberos).
* Utilize YARN ACLs to control access to queues and resources.
* Implement input validation and sanitization for application submissions.

## Threat: [Malicious MapReduce Job Submission](./threats/malicious_mapreduce_job_submission.md)

**Description:** An attacker submits a MapReduce job designed to perform malicious actions, such as accessing sensitive data, corrupting data, or causing denial of service.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, resource exhaustion, potential for system compromise.

**Affected Component:** MapReduce job submission and execution framework.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong authentication and authorization for job submission.
* Implement input validation and sanitization for MapReduce jobs.
* Monitor job execution for suspicious activity.
* Consider migrating to YARN for more granular resource control and security features.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Libraries and Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_libraries_and_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or dependencies used by Hadoop.

**Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Hadoop Common libraries and dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Hadoop and its dependencies to the latest versions.
* Monitor security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
* Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Files](./threats/insecure_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) is stored in Hadoop configuration files with insecure permissions, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to resources, potential for lateral movement.

**Affected Component:** Hadoop configuration files (e.g., core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, yarn-site.xml).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely store and manage Hadoop configuration files.
* Restrict access to configuration files using appropriate file system permissions.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; consider using credential management systems.

## Threat: [Unsecured RPC Communication](./threats/unsecured_rpc_communication.md)

**Description:** Communication between Hadoop components (e.g., NameNode and DataNodes, ResourceManager and NodeManagers) is not encrypted or authenticated, allowing attackers to eavesdrop or manipulate messages.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, data breaches, potential for disrupting cluster operations.
