# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Attack Surface: [Exposed ShardingSphere Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposed_shardingsphere_configuration.md)

**Description:** Sensitive configuration data, including database credentials, sharding rules, and governance center connection details, is accessible to unauthorized parties.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** ShardingSphere requires configuration files (e.g., `shardingsphere.yaml`) or a governance center to define its behavior. These configurations contain sensitive information necessary for ShardingSphere to function.

**Example:** A publicly accessible Git repository containing the `shardingsphere.yaml` file with database credentials.

**Impact:** Full compromise of backend databases, unauthorized data access, manipulation of sharding logic leading to data corruption or exposure.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store configuration files with appropriate access controls (e.g., file system permissions, secrets management tools).
*   Avoid committing sensitive configuration directly to version control systems.
*   Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions for sensitive information like database credentials.
*   Implement role-based access control for accessing and modifying ShardingSphere configurations.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Through ShardingSphere's Parsing/Rewriting](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_through_shardingsphere's_parsingrewriting.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere's SQL parsing and rewriting logic to inject malicious SQL that bypasses intended security measures and reaches the backend databases.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** ShardingSphere intercepts and rewrites SQL queries to route them to the appropriate shards. Flaws in this process can create opportunities for injection.

**Example:** A carefully crafted SQL query that, after ShardingSphere's rewriting, executes unintended actions on a backend database (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; DROP TABLE users;`).

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service on backend databases.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep ShardingSphere updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the application layer *before* the query reaches ShardingSphere.
*   Follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of constructing vulnerable SQL queries.
*   Consider using parameterized queries or prepared statements where possible, even when using ShardingSphere.
*   Regularly review ShardingSphere's security advisories and apply recommended mitigations.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in ShardingSphere Proxy](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_shardingsphere_proxy.md)

**Description:** Attackers bypass the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the ShardingSphere Proxy to gain unauthorized access to backend data sources.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** The ShardingSphere Proxy acts as a gateway to the sharded databases and has its own authentication and authorization layer. Weaknesses here can be exploited.

**Example:** Exploiting a default password or a vulnerability in the proxy's authentication logic to connect to the proxy without valid credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data exfiltration or manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies for ShardingSphere Proxy users.
*   Utilize secure authentication mechanisms supported by ShardingSphere Proxy (e.g., certificate-based authentication).
*   Implement fine-grained authorization rules to restrict access to specific databases or tables based on user roles.
*   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions within the ShardingSphere Proxy.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of Distributed Governance Center](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_distributed_governance_center.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the distributed governance center (e.g., ZooKeeper, etcd) used by ShardingSphere, allowing them to manipulate metadata and control the sharding infrastructure.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** ShardingSphere relies on a distributed governance center for managing metadata, routing rules, and coordination. Compromising this center directly impacts ShardingSphere's functionality.

**Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in ZooKeeper or using default credentials to access the ZooKeeper ensemble and modify sharding rules.

**Impact:** Complete control over the sharded data infrastructure, potential for data corruption, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the distributed governance center with strong authentication and authorization.
*   Keep the governance center software updated with the latest security patches.
*   Implement network segmentation to restrict access to the governance center.
*   Monitor the governance center for suspicious activity and unauthorized access attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Data Leakage Due to Incorrect Sharding Logic](./attack_surfaces/data_leakage_due_to_incorrect_sharding_logic.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured or flawed sharding rules inadvertently expose data to users who should not have access to it.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** ShardingSphere's core function is data sharding. Errors in defining or implementing sharding rules can lead to unintended data access.

**Example:** A sharding key based on user ID is not consistently applied, allowing users to access data from other users' shards.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, privacy violations, potential regulatory penalties.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully design and thoroughly test sharding rules before deployment.
*   Implement robust access control mechanisms at both the ShardingSphere and database levels.
*   Regularly audit sharding configurations and data access patterns.
*   Consider using data masking or encryption techniques as additional layers of security.
