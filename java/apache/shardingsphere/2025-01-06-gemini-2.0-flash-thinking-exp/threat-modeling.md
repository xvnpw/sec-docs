# Threat Model Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Threat: [SQL Injection via ShardingSphere's SQL Parsing](./threats/sql_injection_via_shardingsphere's_sql_parsing.md)

* **Threat:** SQL Injection via ShardingSphere's SQL Parsing
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL statements that bypass ShardingSphere's parsing and rewriting logic. This allows execution of unintended commands on the underlying sharded databases. The attacker might achieve this by exploiting weaknesses in ShardingSphere's SQL parsing rules or by injecting code through application inputs that are not properly sanitized before being passed to ShardingSphere.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion across multiple shards. Potential for privilege escalation on the database servers.
    * **Affected Component:**  `shardingsphere-sql-parser` module, specifically the SQL parsing and rewriting functions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization at the application layer *before* sending SQL queries to ShardingSphere.
        * Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever possible, even when interacting with ShardingSphere. This prevents raw SQL from being directly interpreted.
        * Keep ShardingSphere updated to the latest version, as newer versions may contain fixes for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        * Regularly audit the application's code and database interactions for potential SQL injection points.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Incorrect Result Merging](./threats/data_leakage_through_incorrect_result_merging.md)

* **Threat:** Data Leakage through Incorrect Result Merging
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or logical errors in ShardingSphere's result merging engine. This might allow them to retrieve data from shards they are not authorized to access. This could occur if the merging logic doesn't properly enforce access controls or if there are flaws in how data from different shards is combined.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data from unintended shards, potentially leading to a data breach.
    * **Affected Component:** `shardingsphere-merge` module, specifically the result merging engine and related logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test ShardingSphere's result merging behavior with various query types and access control scenarios.
        * Implement data masking or filtering at the application layer to further restrict access to sensitive data after it's retrieved from ShardingSphere.
        * Carefully review and configure ShardingSphere's access control mechanisms.
        * Monitor query execution logs for unusual data access patterns.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in ShardingSphere Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_shardingsphere_configuration.md)

* **Threat:** Exposure of Database Credentials in ShardingSphere Configuration
    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to ShardingSphere's configuration files (e.g., `shardingsphere.yaml`) which may contain database connection details, including usernames and passwords. This access is directly related to how ShardingSphere stores and manages its configuration.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the backend sharded databases, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data.
    * **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and management within various ShardingSphere modules.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Securely store ShardingSphere configuration files with appropriate access controls (restrict read access to only necessary users/processes).
        * Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in configuration files. Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) and reference them in the ShardingSphere configuration.
        * Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files if direct storage is unavoidable.
        * Regularly audit the security of the environment hosting ShardingSphere and its configuration.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere's Management Console/API](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_shardingsphere's_management_consoleapi.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere's Management Console/API
    * **Description:** If ShardingSphere exposes a management console or API for administrative tasks, vulnerabilities in this interface could be exploited by attackers. This could allow unauthorized access to manage ShardingSphere configurations, potentially leading to full compromise of the data sharding setup.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of ShardingSphere configurations, potentially leading to data access issues, security breaches, or service disruption. In severe cases, it could allow for remote code execution on the ShardingSphere instance.
    * **Affected Component:** `shardingsphere-proxy` or any module exposing management interfaces.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Secure the management console/API with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        * Restrict access to the management interface to only authorized personnel and networks.
        * Keep ShardingSphere updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities in the management interface.
        * If not strictly necessary, consider disabling the management console/API.

## Threat: [Distributed Transaction Inconsistency due to ShardingSphere Bugs](./threats/distributed_transaction_inconsistency_due_to_shardingsphere_bugs.md)

* **Threat:** Distributed Transaction Inconsistency due to ShardingSphere Bugs
    * **Description:**  Bugs or flaws in ShardingSphere's distributed transaction management logic could lead to data inconsistencies across different shards. This could occur during transaction commit or rollback phases, especially in failure scenarios.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, business logic errors due to inconsistent data across shards.
    * **Affected Component:** `shardingsphere-transaction` module.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly test distributed transaction scenarios, including failure scenarios, in a non-production environment.
        * Understand the limitations and guarantees of the distributed transaction type being used (e.g., XA, BASE).
        * Monitor transaction logs for any errors or inconsistencies.
        * Keep ShardingSphere updated to benefit from bug fixes related to transaction management.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass in ShardingSphere or Integrated Components](./threats/authentication_bypass_in_shardingsphere_or_integrated_components.md)

* **Threat:** Authentication Bypass in ShardingSphere or Integrated Components
    * **Description:** An attacker finds a way to bypass ShardingSphere's authentication mechanisms or those of any integrated authentication providers. This directly relates to ShardingSphere's ability to control access.
