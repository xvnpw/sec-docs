## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ShardingSphere Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_shardingsphere_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Exploit ShardingSphere Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This represents a direct attack targeting vulnerabilities within the ShardingSphere middleware itself. Successful exploitation can lead to various severe outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

* **SQL Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application inputs that are not properly sanitized before being processed by ShardingSphere.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious SQL via application input not sanitized by ShardingSphere **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_via_application_input_not_sanitized_by_shardingsphere__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Inject malicious SQL via application input not sanitized by ShardingSphere (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            * The application fails to sanitize user-provided data, allowing attackers to craft SQL queries that bypass ShardingSphere's intended logic and execute directly on the backend databases.
            * This can result in unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass__critical_node_.md)

* **Authentication/Authorization Bypass (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers attempt to circumvent ShardingSphere's authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
    * This could involve exploiting flaws in the authentication process, RBAC implementation, or the connection to backend databases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node_.md)

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the ShardingSphere server.
    * This is a critical threat as it grants the attacker complete control over the ShardingSphere instance and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Misconfigurations **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_misconfigurations__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Abuse Misconfigurations (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers exploit insecure configurations within ShardingSphere to gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication/Authorization Configuration **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authenticationauthorization_configuration__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Weak Authentication/Authorization Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * ShardingSphere is configured with weak or default credentials, or the RBAC rules are overly permissive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default or weak ShardingSphere administrative credentials **(HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/default_or_weak_shardingsphere_administrative_credentials__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Default or weak ShardingSphere administrative credentials (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
            * The most critical misconfiguration, where default or easily guessable administrative credentials are used, providing attackers with immediate full control over ShardingSphere.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Network Configuration **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_network_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Insecure Network Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * The network environment in which ShardingSphere operates is not properly secured.

## Attack Tree Path: [ShardingSphere management interface exposed without proper protection **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/shardingsphere_management_interface_exposed_without_proper_protection__high-risk_path_.md)

* **ShardingSphere management interface exposed without proper protection (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            * The administrative interface of ShardingSphere is accessible without proper authentication or from untrusted networks, allowing attackers to manage the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unencrypted communication between application and ShardingSphere **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/unencrypted_communication_between_application_and_shardingsphere__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Unencrypted communication between application and ShardingSphere (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            * Communication between the application and ShardingSphere is not encrypted (e.g., using TLS), allowing attackers to intercept sensitive data like credentials and queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Settings and Unpatched Vulnerabilities **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/default_settings_and_unpatched_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Default Settings and Unpatched Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * The ShardingSphere instance is running with default, insecure settings or has not been updated with the latest security patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific ShardingSphere version **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_specific_shardingsphere_version__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific ShardingSphere version (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
            * Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities present in the specific version of ShardingSphere being used, often with readily available exploit code.
