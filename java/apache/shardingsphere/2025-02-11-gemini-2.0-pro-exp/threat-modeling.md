# Threat Model Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Threat: [ShardingSphere Proxy/Agent Compromise via Exploit](./threats/shardingsphere_proxyagent_compromise_via_exploit.md)

*   **Threat:** **ShardingSphere Proxy/Agent Compromise via Exploit**

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, remote code execution, or authentication bypass) in the ShardingSphere Proxy or Agent code to gain control of the process.  The attacker might upload a malicious script, modify the running code, or gain shell access to the host.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over database traffic routing, potential data interception, modification, and deletion.  The attacker could also pivot to attack the underlying databases or other systems on the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy (core networking, protocol handling, authentication modules), ShardingSphere Agent (plugin loading, bytecode manipulation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep ShardingSphere Proxy and Agent updated to the latest stable release to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Perform regular vulnerability scans of the ShardingSphere deployment and its host environment.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Ensure robust input validation within ShardingSphere to prevent injection attacks. (This is primarily a ShardingSphere development task).
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the ShardingSphere Proxy/Agent with the least necessary privileges on the host operating system.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Proxy/Agent on a separate network segment to limit the impact of a compromise.
        *   **Intrusion Detection:** Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to monitor for and block malicious activity.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering (Sharding Rules)](./threats/configuration_file_tampering__sharding_rules_.md)

*   **Threat:** **Configuration File Tampering (Sharding Rules)**

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ShardingSphere configuration files (e.g., `config-sharding.yaml`, `server.yaml`) and modifies the sharding rules.  They might change the target database for specific data ranges, redirect traffic to a malicious database, or disable sharding altogether.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption (writing to the wrong database), data leakage (reading from the wrong database), denial of service (if sharding is disabled or misconfigured), potential for unauthorized data access.
    *   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy (configuration loading and parsing, routing engine), ShardingSphere-JDBC (configuration loading).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Permissions:**  Set strict file system permissions on configuration files, allowing read/write access only to the ShardingSphere user.
        *   **Integrity Monitoring:** Use file integrity monitoring tools (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire) to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
        *   **Version Control:** Store configuration files in a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to ensure consistent and secure configurations across all ShardingSphere instances.
        *   **Regular Audits:**  Periodically audit configuration files for unauthorized changes.

## Threat: [SQL Injection Bypassing ShardingSphere Parsing](./threats/sql_injection_bypassing_shardingsphere_parsing.md)

*   **Threat:** **SQL Injection Bypassing ShardingSphere Parsing**

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query that exploits a flaw in ShardingSphere's SQL parser or routing logic.  The query bypasses ShardingSphere's intended behavior and is executed directly on the underlying database, potentially with unintended consequences. This is *not* general SQL injection; it's specific to ShardingSphere's handling.
    *   **Impact:**  Standard SQL injection impacts: data leakage, modification, deletion, potential for command execution on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy (SQL parser, lexer, routing engine), ShardingSphere-JDBC (SQL parsing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterized Queries (Application Level):**  *Always* use parameterized queries or prepared statements in the application code, *even when using ShardingSphere*. This is the primary defense.
        *   **ShardingSphere Updates:** Keep ShardingSphere updated to address any parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   **Extensive Testing:**  Thoroughly test ShardingSphere with a wide variety of SQL queries, including edge cases and known SQL injection payloads, focusing on the parsing and routing logic.
        *   **WAF (Web Application Firewall):**  Use a WAF with rules specifically designed to detect and block SQL injection attempts, including those that might target ShardingSphere's parsing.
        *   **SQL Audit Logging:** Enable ShardingSphere's SQL audit logging to monitor all executed SQL statements.

## Threat: [Data Leakage Due to Misconfigured Data Masking](./threats/data_leakage_due_to_misconfigured_data_masking.md)

*   **Threat:** **Data Leakage Due to Misconfigured Data Masking**

    *   **Description:**  If using ShardingSphere's data masking features, an attacker exploits a misconfiguration or vulnerability in the masking rules to access sensitive data that should be masked.  For example, a poorly defined regular expression might fail to mask all instances of a sensitive data pattern.
    *   **Impact:**  Data leakage; sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized users.
    *   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy (data masking engine), ShardingSphere-JDBC (data masking).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Rule Definition:**  Thoroughly review and test data masking rules to ensure they correctly mask all intended data.  Use precise regular expressions and other masking techniques.
        *   **Regular Expression Testing:**  Specifically test regular expressions used for masking against a variety of inputs, including edge cases and known attack patterns.
        *   **Least Privilege (Data Access):**  Ensure that users and applications only have access to the data they need, even if masking fails.
        *   **Auditing:**  Enable logging of masked data access to monitor for potential leaks.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Weak Authentication to ShardingSphere Proxy](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_weak_authentication_to_shardingsphere_proxy.md)

*   **Threat:** **Unauthorized Access via Weak Authentication to ShardingSphere Proxy**

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ShardingSphere Proxy using weak or default credentials, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the authentication mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can intercept, modify, or redirect database traffic, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy (authentication modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for all ShardingSphere Proxy accounts.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Implement MFA for accessing the ShardingSphere Proxy, if supported.
        *   **Account Lockout:**  Configure account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **Regular Password Changes:**  Enforce regular password changes.
        *   **Disable Default Accounts:** Disable or change the passwords for any default accounts.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via ShardingSphere Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_shardingsphere_vulnerability.md)

* **Threat:** **Privilege Escalation via ShardingSphere Vulnerability**
    * **Description:** An attacker, having gained initial limited access (e.g., to the application server), exploits a vulnerability within ShardingSphere to gain higher privileges, either within ShardingSphere itself or on the underlying database servers.
    * **Impact:** The attacker could gain full control of ShardingSphere and potentially the connected databases, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and other severe consequences.
    * **Affected Component:** Any ShardingSphere component with a privilege escalation vulnerability (e.g., Proxy, Agent, JDBC driver).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Security Updates:** Apply ShardingSphere security patches and updates promptly.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run ShardingSphere components with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:** Regularly scan for and test vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere and its dependencies.
        *   **Security Hardening:** Follow security best practices for hardening the operating system and network infrastructure where ShardingSphere is deployed.
