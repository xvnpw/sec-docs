# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management within ShardingSphere](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_within_shardingsphere.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce strict access control and a robust change management process *specifically for ShardingSphere configuration files*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Configuration Files:** Determine which files contain ShardingSphere configurations (e.g., `config-*.yaml`, `server.yaml`, property files).
    2.  **Operating System-Level Permissions:** Use `chmod` (Linux/macOS) or equivalent commands (Windows) to restrict read/write access to these files to *only* the user account running the ShardingSphere proxy and a designated administrator group.  *No other users should have access.*
    3.  **Version Control (Git) - ShardingSphere Configs Only:** Store *only* ShardingSphere configuration files in a dedicated Git repository (or a dedicated branch/folder within a larger repository). Configure branch protection rules:
        *   Require pull requests for *all* changes.
        *   Require at least one (preferably two) code reviews from authorized personnel before merging.
        *   Enable status checks (e.g., automated tests *specifically targeting ShardingSphere config*) that must pass before merging.
    4.  **Change Management Process (ShardingSphere-Specific):**
        *   Document a formal change management process *specifically for ShardingSphere configuration changes*. This should include:
            *   A request for change (RFC) process.
            *   Impact analysis of the proposed ShardingSphere change.
            *   Peer review of the ShardingSphere configuration changes.
            *   Automated testing (see below, focused on ShardingSphere).
            *   Rollback plan in case of failure related to ShardingSphere.
            *   Post-implementation review of the ShardingSphere changes.
    5.  **Access Control for ShardingSphere Configuration Tools:** If using a GUI or web-based tool *provided by ShardingSphere* to manage its configuration, ensure that access to this tool is strictly controlled using authentication and authorization mechanisms *provided by ShardingSphere*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized ShardingSphere Configuration Modification (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers or unauthorized users from altering ShardingSphere's sharding rules, routing logic, or security settings, which could lead to data breaches, denial of service, or other severe consequences *directly via ShardingSphere*.
    *   **Accidental ShardingSphere Misconfiguration (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of human error leading to incorrect ShardingSphere configurations that expose data or disrupt service.
    *   **Insider Threats (to ShardingSphere Config) (Severity: High):** Limits the ability of malicious insiders to tamper with the ShardingSphere configuration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced substantially (60-70%).
    *   **Insider Threats:** Risk reduced moderately (40-50%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   OS-level permissions are partially implemented on the production server.
    *   Version control (Git) is used, but branch protection rules are not fully enforced *specifically for ShardingSphere configs*.
    *   A basic change management process exists but is not consistently followed *for ShardingSphere*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full enforcement of branch protection rules in Git (required reviewers, status checks) *specifically for the ShardingSphere configuration repository/branch*.
    *   Formal documentation and consistent adherence to the change management process *specifically for ShardingSphere*.
    *   Access control for any ShardingSphere-provided configuration tools (if used).
    *   Automated testing of ShardingSphere configuration changes (covered in the next mitigation).

## Mitigation Strategy: [ShardingSphere Configuration Validation and Automated Testing (ShardingSphere-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/shardingsphere_configuration_validation_and_automated_testing__shardingsphere-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests *that directly interact with and validate ShardingSphere's configuration and behavior*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify ShardingSphere-Specific Test Scenarios:** Create a list of test scenarios that cover *all aspects of ShardingSphere's configuration*:
        *   All sharding rules (table sharding, database sharding, read/write splitting) *as configured in ShardingSphere*.
        *   All routing rules (ensuring queries are routed to the correct data sources *by ShardingSphere*).
        *   Data encryption and masking configurations *within ShardingSphere* (verifying that sensitive data is protected as expected *by ShardingSphere*).
        *   Different user roles and access patterns *as managed by ShardingSphere*.
        *   Error handling *within ShardingSphere* (e.g., what happens when a database shard is unavailable, and how ShardingSphere handles it).
    2.  **Develop Unit Tests (ShardingSphere Components):** Write unit tests for individual components *of ShardingSphere*, such as:
        *   Custom sharding algorithms (if implemented *within ShardingSphere*).
        *   Data encryption/masking logic *implemented within ShardingSphere*.
    3.  **Develop Integration Tests (ShardingSphere API/Proxy):** Write integration tests that *interact with ShardingSphere's API or proxy* to simulate real-world scenarios, including:
        *   Executing various SQL queries *through ShardingSphere* and verifying that the results are correct *according to ShardingSphere's configuration*.
        *   Testing different user roles and access permissions *managed by ShardingSphere*.
        *   Simulating database shard failures *and verifying ShardingSphere's response*.
    4.  **Automate Test Execution (ShardingSphere CI/CD):** Integrate the ShardingSphere-specific tests into a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The tests should run automatically whenever the *ShardingSphere configuration* is changed.
    5.  **ShardingSphere Configuration Validation Tools:** Explore using tools *provided by ShardingSphere* (if available) that can statically analyze the ShardingSphere configuration for common errors and inconsistencies. If no suitable tool exists, consider developing custom validation scripts *that specifically target ShardingSphere's configuration format*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfigured ShardingSphere Sharding Rules (Severity: High):** Prevents incorrect sharding rules *within ShardingSphere* from being deployed.
    *   **Misconfigured ShardingSphere Routing Rules (Severity: High):** Ensures that queries are routed correctly *by ShardingSphere*.
    *   **Incorrect ShardingSphere Encryption/Masking (Severity: Critical):** Verifies that sensitive data is properly protected *by ShardingSphere*.
    *   **Logic Errors in Custom ShardingSphere Algorithms (Severity: High):** Catches errors in custom sharding or routing logic *within ShardingSphere*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfigured Sharding/Routing Rules:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).
    *   **Incorrect Encryption/Masking:** Risk reduced significantly (70-80%).
    *   **Logic Errors:** Risk reduced significantly (60-70%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic unit tests exist for some custom sharding logic *within ShardingSphere*.
    *   No integration tests *specifically targeting ShardingSphere* are currently implemented.
    *   No CI/CD pipeline integration *for ShardingSphere tests*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive integration tests covering all ShardingSphere sharding, routing, and security configurations.
    *   Integration of ShardingSphere tests into a CI/CD pipeline.
    *   ShardingSphere-specific configuration validation tools or scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ShardingSphere SQL Firewall Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/shardingsphere_sql_firewall_configuration.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure and actively monitor ShardingSphere's built-in SQL firewall.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable the SQL Firewall:** Enable the SQL firewall in the ShardingSphere configuration (`sql-firewall.yaml` or equivalent, depending on the ShardingSphere version).
    2.  **Define Strict Rules:**
        *   Define strict rules that allow only necessary SQL operations and syntax. Start with a very restrictive set of rules and gradually add exceptions as needed.
        *   Regularly review and update the firewall rules to address new attack patterns.
        *   Consider using a "blacklist" approach (blocking known malicious patterns) or a "whitelist" approach (allowing only explicitly permitted patterns). A whitelist approach is generally more secure but requires more careful configuration.
    3.  **Monitoring and Alerting (ShardingSphere Logs):**
        *   Monitor the ShardingSphere SQL firewall logs for any blocked queries. Investigate any suspicious activity.
        *   Set up alerts *within ShardingSphere or a connected monitoring system* to notify administrators of any SQL firewall violations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (through ShardingSphere) (Severity: High):** The SQL firewall provides a layer of protection against SQL injection attempts that are passed through ShardingSphere.  It is *not* a replacement for parameterized queries at the application level.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks (through ShardingSphere) (Severity: High):** The SQL firewall may also help prevent other types of injection attacks, such as NoSQL injection or command injection, if they are attempted through the ShardingSphere proxy.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduced (provides a secondary layer of defense, 5-10% additional reduction).
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Risk reduction depends on the specific attack and the firewall rules (can be significant, 40-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The ShardingSphere SQL firewall is not enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Enabling and configuring the ShardingSphere SQL firewall.
    *   Monitoring and alerting for SQL firewall violations *within ShardingSphere's logging and monitoring system*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ShardingSphere Rate Limiting (if supported)](./mitigation_strategies/shardingsphere_rate_limiting__if_supported_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure rate limiting *within ShardingSphere* (if the feature is supported by the specific version in use).

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check for Support:** Verify if the specific version of ShardingSphere being used supports built-in rate limiting. Consult the official ShardingSphere documentation.
    2.  **Configuration (if supported):**
        *   If rate limiting is supported, configure it in the ShardingSphere configuration files (e.g., `server.yaml`, or a dedicated rate limiting configuration file).
        *   Use a suitable rate limiting algorithm (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket) *provided by ShardingSphere*.
        *   Set appropriate rate limits based on expected traffic patterns and system capacity. These limits should be specific to ShardingSphere's capabilities.
    3.  **Monitoring (ShardingSphere Metrics):** Monitor ShardingSphere's metrics (if provided) related to rate limiting to ensure it is functioning correctly and to adjust limits as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (targeting ShardingSphere) (Severity: High):** Rate limiting *within ShardingSphere* helps prevent attackers from overwhelming the ShardingSphere proxy itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced (effectiveness depends on the specific attack and the configured limits within ShardingSphere, 60-80% if properly configured).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No rate limiting is implemented within ShardingSphere.  (Need to verify if the current version supports it).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification of rate limiting support in the current ShardingSphere version.
    *   Configuration of rate limiting within ShardingSphere (if supported).
    *   Monitoring of ShardingSphere's rate limiting metrics.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Management *Integration with* ShardingSphere](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_management_integration_with_shardingsphere.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure ShardingSphere to *integrate with* a dedicated key management system (KMS) for encryption key retrieval.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a KMS:** Select a suitable KMS (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault).  This is *external* to ShardingSphere.
    2.  **ShardingSphere KMS Integration:** Configure ShardingSphere to use the chosen KMS for key retrieval. The specific integration steps will depend on the chosen KMS and the ShardingSphere version.  Consult ShardingSphere's documentation for the correct configuration procedures. This involves configuring ShardingSphere to *fetch* keys from the KMS, *not* storing them locally.
    3.  **Key Rotation (Managed by KMS, Triggered by ShardingSphere):** Configure the KMS (externally) to automatically rotate encryption keys.  ShardingSphere should be configured to *respect* and use the rotated keys, typically by periodically refreshing its connection to the KMS.
    4.  **Auditing (KMS and ShardingSphere):** Enable auditing in both the KMS (to track key access) and within ShardingSphere (to track when it retrieves keys).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Key Compromise (affecting ShardingSphere) (Severity: Critical):** Protects encryption keys used *by ShardingSphere* from being stolen or misused.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Decryption (via ShardingSphere) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from decrypting sensitive data handled *by ShardingSphere* even if they gain access to the encrypted data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Key Compromise:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).
    *   **Unauthorized Data Decryption:** Risk reduced significantly (80-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Encryption keys are currently stored in the ShardingSphere configuration files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Selection of a KMS.
    *   *Integration of ShardingSphere with the KMS* (configuring ShardingSphere to retrieve keys).
    *   Configuration of key rotation (in the KMS) and ensuring ShardingSphere uses rotated keys.
    *   Auditing of key retrieval within ShardingSphere.
