## Attack Tree Path: [A. Resource Exhaustion (Sharding/Parsing) - [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/a__resource_exhaustion__shardingparsing__-__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms ShardingSphere's parsing or sharding logic by sending complex or numerous queries. This consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory, network), leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Complex Queries:** Sending deeply nested SQL queries, queries with a large number of `OR` conditions, or queries that trigger complex sharding rule evaluations.
        *   **High Request Volume:** Flooding ShardingSphere with a large number of requests, exceeding its capacity to process them.
        *   **Exploiting Inefficient Sharding Rules:** If custom sharding rules are poorly designed, an attacker might craft queries that trigger excessive computation during rule evaluation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High (Denial of Service)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [B. Inject Malicious SQL (Data Source) - [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/b__inject_malicious_sql__data_source__-__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in the underlying database *accessed through* ShardingSphere.  This bypasses ShardingSphere's own SQL parsing if it's not configured to prevent this or if the database itself doesn't use parameterized queries.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Unsanitized Input:** If the application or ShardingSphere doesn't properly sanitize user input before passing it to the database, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
        *   **Vulnerable Database:** Even with ShardingSphere, if the underlying database has known SQL injection vulnerabilities and isn't using parameterized queries/prepared statements, it's susceptible.
        *   **Bypassing ShardingSphere's Parser:**  An attacker might try to craft a query that is misinterpreted by ShardingSphere's parser, allowing malicious SQL to reach the database. (Less likely, but possible).
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Highly dependent on underlying database security)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Data breach, potential RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [C. Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities - [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/c__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_-__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in ShardingSphere's settings (YAML, properties, etc.) to gain unauthorized access or disrupt service.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Weak Authentication:** Using default or easily guessable passwords for ShardingSphere's proxy or the underlying databases.
        *   **Exposed Management Interfaces:** Exposing ShardingSphere's management interface (if used) to the public internet without proper authentication or authorization.
        *   **Insecure Defaults:** Using default configurations that have known security weaknesses.
        *   **Incorrect Sharding Rules:** Defining sharding rules that inadvertently expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to specific shards.
        *   **Disabled Security Features:** Turning off built-in security features like SQL auditing or encryption without a valid reason.
        *   **Lack of Input Validation on Configuration:** If the configuration itself is loaded from an untrusted source without validation, an attacker could inject malicious settings.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
