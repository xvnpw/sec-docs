# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Database User for ShardingSphere](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_database_user_for_shardingsphere.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Least Privilege Database User for ShardingSphere
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Privileges:** Analyze the application's database operations performed through ShardingSphere (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Determine the minimum set of privileges required for ShardingSphere to function correctly on each backend database.
    2.  **Create Dedicated Database User:** For each backend database accessed by ShardingSphere, create a dedicated database user specifically for ShardingSphere connections. Avoid reusing administrative or overly privileged accounts.
    3.  **Grant Minimum Privileges:** Grant only the necessary privileges to the dedicated ShardingSphere database users on the specific tables, schemas, and operations accessed by the application within each backend database. Restrict privileges to the absolute minimum required for application functionality.
    4.  **Configure ShardingSphere Data Sources:** Configure ShardingSphere data sources to use these dedicated, least privileged database users for connecting to the backend databases.
    5.  **Regular Privilege Review:** Periodically review and audit the privileges granted to the ShardingSphere database users in each backend database. Remove any unnecessary privileges to maintain the principle of least privilege as application requirements evolve.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential damage from SQL injection attacks. Even if an attacker successfully injects SQL through ShardingSphere, the limited privileges of the ShardingSphere user restrict the scope of their actions within the backend databases.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity):** Prevents ShardingSphere (and potentially compromised applications using it) from accessing or modifying data beyond what is strictly necessary for its intended function in the backend databases.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Low Severity):** Reduces the potential for attackers to use a compromised ShardingSphere instance to gain broader access to backend databases if the ShardingSphere user has limited privileges within each database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Moderate reduction in impact. Limits the damage if SQL injection occurs via ShardingSphere.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Moderate reduction in risk. Restricts ShardingSphere's access to sensitive data in backend databases.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Low reduction in risk. Makes lateral movement from ShardingSphere to backend databases slightly more difficult.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   ShardingSphere connects to backend databases using dedicated database users.
    *   Basic privilege restrictions are in place, limiting access to application-specific schemas in some backend databases.

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Credential Management for Database Connections (within ShardingSphere)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:** Never hardcode database credentials directly in ShardingSphere configuration files (e.g., `server.yaml`, `config-*.yaml`).
    2.  **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store database credentials as environment variables and configure ShardingSphere data sources to retrieve credentials from environment variables. This separates credentials from configuration files and allows for easier management in different environments.
    3.  **Vault Integration (Recommended):** Integrate ShardingSphere with a secrets management vault solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault). Configure ShardingSphere to retrieve database credentials dynamically from the vault at runtime. This provides a centralized and secure way to manage and rotate credentials.
    4.  **Encrypted Configuration Files (Less Preferred, but better than plain text):** If vault integration is not immediately feasible, consider encrypting ShardingSphere configuration files that contain database credentials. Use strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices. However, vault integration is generally a more robust and scalable solution.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Configuration Access Needs:** Determine which users, roles, or systems require access to ShardingSphere configuration files and management interfaces. Differentiate between read-only access, modification access, and administrative access.
    2.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Configuration:** Implement RBAC for accessing ShardingSphere configuration files and management interfaces. Define roles with specific permissions for configuration access (e.g., `config-reader`, `config-editor`, `config-admin`).
    3.  **Restrict File System Permissions:** Restrict file system permissions on ShardingSphere configuration files to only allow access to authorized users and groups. Use operating system-level access controls to enforce least privilege.
    4.  **Secure Access to Management Interfaces:** Secure access to ShardingSphere management interfaces (e.g., web UI, command-line tools) using strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Enforce RBAC for management interface access.
    5.  **Regular Access Review:** Periodically review and audit access permissions for ShardingSphere configuration files and management interfaces to ensure the principle of least privilege is maintained and unauthorized access is prevented.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying ShardingSphere configurations, which could lead to security breaches, data leaks, or denial of service.
    *   **Credential Exposure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of sensitive credentials being exposed if unauthorized users gain access to configuration files.
    *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Mitigates insider threats by limiting configuration access to only authorized personnel with a legitimate need.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** High reduction in risk. Least privilege access control is crucial for protecting ShardingSphere configurations.
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Moderate reduction in risk. Limits credential exposure by restricting access to configuration files.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Moderate reduction in risk. Mitigates potential damage from insider threats by limiting access.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   File system permissions are partially restricted on ShardingSphere configuration files.
    *   Basic authentication is required for accessing ShardingSphere management interfaces.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular RBAC is not fully implemented for accessing ShardingSphere configuration files and management interfaces.
    *   Access permissions are not regularly reviewed and audited.
    *   Stronger authentication and authorization mechanisms could be implemented for management interfaces.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Configurations (for ShardingSphere)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_configurations__for_shardingsphere_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Default Configurations (for ShardingSphere)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default Configurations:** Thoroughly review ShardingSphere's default configurations for both the proxy and JDBC client. Identify any default settings that may pose security risks or are not aligned with security best practices.
    2.  **Change Default Passwords and Credentials:** Change all default passwords and credentials for ShardingSphere management interfaces, administrative users, and any other components that use default credentials. Use strong, unique passwords.
    3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features and Services:** Disable any unnecessary features, services, or modules in ShardingSphere that are not required for your application's functionality. This reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Harden Default Settings:** Harden default settings by applying security best practices. This may include:
        *   Disabling insecure protocols or ciphers.
        *   Setting appropriate timeouts and limits.
        *   Enabling security features by default (e.g., TLS/SSL, authentication).
    5.  **Document Configuration Hardening:** Document all changes made to default configurations for security hardening purposes. Maintain a checklist or guide for secure ShardingSphere deployment.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Default Credentials (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting default passwords or credentials to gain unauthorized access to ShardingSphere.
    *   **Unnecessary Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by disabling unnecessary features and services, minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Mitigates vulnerabilities arising from insecure default settings by hardening configurations according to security best practices.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Default Credentials:** High reduction in risk. Changing default credentials is a critical security measure.
    *   **Unnecessary Attack Surface:** Moderate reduction in risk. Disabling unnecessary features reduces potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** Moderate reduction in risk. Hardening default settings improves overall security posture.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Default passwords for ShardingSphere proxy administrative users have been changed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of all default ShardingSphere configurations for security hardening is not conducted.
    *   Unnecessary features and services are not systematically disabled.
    *   A documented configuration hardening guide or checklist is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Encryption (for Sensitive Data in ShardingSphere Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_encryption__for_sensitive_data_in_shardingsphere_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Encryption (for Sensitive Data in ShardingSphere Configuration)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Sensitive Data in Configuration:** Identify sensitive data elements within ShardingSphere configuration files, such as database credentials, API keys, encryption keys, or other secrets.
    2.  **Utilize ShardingSphere Encryption Features (if available):** Investigate if ShardingSphere provides built-in features for encrypting sensitive data within its configuration files. If available, utilize these features to encrypt sensitive configuration values.
    3.  **External Encryption Tools (if built-in features are lacking):** If ShardingSphere does not offer built-in encryption, use external encryption tools or libraries to encrypt sensitive data before storing it in configuration files. Choose strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices.
    4.  **Secure Key Management:** Implement secure key management practices for encryption keys used to protect sensitive configuration data. Store encryption keys separately from configuration files and restrict access to keys to authorized personnel and systems. Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) or key management services for enhanced key security.
    5.  **Decryption at Runtime:** Ensure that ShardingSphere can decrypt sensitive configuration data at runtime when it is needed. Configure ShardingSphere to access decryption keys securely and decrypt configuration values during startup or when configuration is loaded.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure in Configuration Files (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive credentials and other secrets from being exposed in plain text within ShardingSphere configuration files, even if configuration files are accessed by unauthorized individuals or systems.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches if ShardingSphere configuration files are compromised, as sensitive data within the configuration will be encrypted and protected.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure in Configuration Files:** High reduction in risk. Configuration encryption is a strong defense against credential exposure in configuration files.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Moderate reduction in risk. Limits the potential impact of configuration file compromise by protecting sensitive data within them.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No configuration encryption is currently implemented for sensitive data in ShardingSphere configuration files.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   ShardingSphere's built-in configuration encryption features (if any) are not explored or implemented.
    *   External encryption tools are not used to encrypt sensitive data in ShardingSphere configuration files.
    *   Secure key management practices for configuration encryption are not in place.
