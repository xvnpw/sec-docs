## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere [CRITICAL NODE - SQL Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities_in_shardingsphere__critical_node_-_sql_injection_.md)

SQL Injection is a consistently prevalent and impactful vulnerability type in web applications and database systems. ShardingSphere, while adding a layer of abstraction, does not inherently prevent SQL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Bypass Sharding Logic via SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__bypass_sharding_logic_via_sql_injection.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Craft SQL to access data across shards without authorization [CRITICAL NODE - Cross-Shard Access via SQLi]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__craft_sql_to_access_data_across_shards_without_authorization__critical_node_-_cross-shard_acc_34729da0.md)

*   **1.1.1. Craft SQL to access data across shards without authorization [CRITICAL NODE - Cross-Shard Access via SQLi]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit SQL injection flaws in application code or ShardingSphere configurations to craft malicious SQL queries. These queries are designed to bypass the intended sharding logic, allowing access to data across multiple shards without proper authorization.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to sensitive data distributed across the sharded database, potentially resulting in a significant data breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Inject malicious SQL through ShardingSphere Proxy [CRITICAL NODE - Proxy SQL Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__inject_malicious_sql_through_shardingsphere_proxy__critical_node_-_proxy_sql_injection_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Leverage insecure application code that passes unsanitized input to ShardingSphere Proxy [CRITICAL NODE - App-Level SQL Injection]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__leverage_insecure_application_code_that_passes_unsanitized_input_to_shardingsphere_proxy__cri_3d72b6b2.md)

*   **1.2.2. Leverage insecure application code that passes unsanitized input to ShardingSphere Proxy [CRITICAL NODE - App-Level SQL Injection]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The most common SQL injection scenario. Application code fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user inputs before constructing SQL queries that are then passed to ShardingSphere Proxy.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Application-level SQL injection is easy to exploit if input validation is weak or missing. It can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and even complete database takeover, especially when combined with ShardingSphere's distributed nature.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses in ShardingSphere](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses_in_shardingsphere.md)

Weaknesses in authentication and authorization controls can directly lead to unauthorized access, bypassing all other security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.3. Exploit misconfigurations allowing unauthorized access [CRITICAL NODE - Auth Misconfiguration]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_3__exploit_misconfigurations_allowing_unauthorized_access__critical_node_-_auth_misconfiguration_90d390a7.md)

*   **2.1.3. Exploit misconfigurations allowing unauthorized access [CRITICAL NODE - Auth Misconfiguration]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Misconfigurations in ShardingSphere Proxy or related components (like firewalls, network ACLs) that inadvertently expose the Proxy or its management interfaces to unauthorized networks or users.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations are common and often overlooked. They can provide direct, unauthenticated access to ShardingSphere Proxy, allowing attackers to bypass authentication entirely and potentially gain control over the sharded database.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.3. Circumvent authorization checks through SQL injection or other bypass techniques (see 1.1) [CRITICAL NODE - Auth Bypass via SQLi]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_3__circumvent_authorization_checks_through_sql_injection_or_other_bypass_techniques__see_1_1___c_e0088476.md)

*   **2.2.3. Circumvent authorization checks through SQL injection or other bypass techniques (see 1.1) [CRITICAL NODE - Auth Bypass via SQLi]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use SQL injection (as described in path 1) or other application-level bypass techniques to circumvent ShardingSphere's authorization checks. This allows them to perform actions or access data they are not authorized for.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Authorization bypass, especially through SQL injection, can undermine the entire security model. Even if authentication is strong, a successful bypass can grant attackers elevated privileges and access to sensitive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Configuration and Management Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_configuration_and_management_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

Configuration and management interfaces are critical points of control. Compromising them can have widespread and severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Access and manipulate unsecured ShardingSphere configuration files [CRITICAL NODE - Unsecured Config Files]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__access_and_manipulate_unsecured_shardingsphere_configuration_files__critical_node_-_unsecured_c_fe97b22d.md)

*   **3.1. Access and manipulate unsecured ShardingSphere configuration files [CRITICAL NODE - Unsecured Config Files]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the file system where ShardingSphere configuration files are stored. This could be through OS-level vulnerabilities, stolen credentials, or insider threats.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Configuration files often contain sensitive information like database credentials, connection strings, and security settings.  Access to these files allows attackers to steal credentials, modify configurations to gain further access, or disrupt the system's operation.
        *   **3.1.1. Gain unauthorized access to configuration files on disk:** This is a sub-node detailing the action of accessing the files.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1. Gain unauthorized access to configuration files on disk](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_configuration_files_on_disk.md)

This is a sub-node detailing the action of accessing the files.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Exploit vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere's governance center (ZooKeeper/Etcd) [CRITICAL NODE - Governance Center Vulnerability]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_shardingsphere's_governance_center__zookeeperetcd___critical_node_-__29aaffa1.md)

*   **3.2. Exploit vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere's governance center (ZooKeeper/Etcd) [CRITICAL NODE - Governance Center Vulnerability]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the governance center (ZooKeeper/Etcd) used by ShardingSphere. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper/Etcd itself, or misconfigurations that allow unauthorized access.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** The governance center is the central nervous system of a ShardingSphere cluster. Compromising it can lead to cluster-wide instability, data corruption, denial of service, and complete cluster takeover.
        *   **3.2.1. Compromise ZooKeeper/Etcd instance used by ShardingSphere [CRITICAL NODE - Compromised ZooKeeper/Etcd]:** Direct compromise of the ZooKeeper/Etcd instance.
        *   **3.2.2. Manipulate cluster metadata in ZooKeeper/Etcd to disrupt ShardingSphere operation [CRITICAL NODE - Metadata Manipulation]:**  Manipulating the data stored in ZooKeeper/Etcd to disrupt ShardingSphere's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1. Compromise ZooKeeper/Etcd instance used by ShardingSphere [CRITICAL NODE - Compromised ZooKeeper/Etcd]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1__compromise_zookeeperetcd_instance_used_by_shardingsphere__critical_node_-_compromised_zookeep_7c3783e4.md)

Direct compromise of the ZooKeeper/Etcd instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.2. Manipulate cluster metadata in ZooKeeper/Etcd to disrupt ShardingSphere operation [CRITICAL NODE - Metadata Manipulation]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_2__manipulate_cluster_metadata_in_zookeeperetcd_to_disrupt_shardingsphere_operation__critical_no_366c40cb.md)

Manipulating the data stored in ZooKeeper/Etcd to disrupt ShardingSphere's functionality.

DoS attacks can disrupt application availability, leading to business disruption and reputational damage. While not directly leading to data breaches, they are a significant threat to service continuity.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1. Resource Exhaustion attacks on ShardingSphere Proxy [CRITICAL NODE - Proxy Resource Exhaustion]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1__resource_exhaustion_attacks_on_shardingsphere_proxy__critical_node_-_proxy_resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **4.1. Resource Exhaustion attacks on ShardingSphere Proxy [CRITICAL NODE - Proxy Resource Exhaustion]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers overwhelm the ShardingSphere Proxy with requests, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, connections) and making it unresponsive.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** The Proxy is the entry point for application requests. A successful DoS attack on the Proxy effectively renders the entire application unavailable.
        *   **4.1.1. Send a large volume of requests to overload Proxy resources (CPU, memory, connections) [CRITICAL NODE - Volumetric DoS]:** Classic volumetric DoS attack.
        *   **4.1.2. Craft complex or slow SQL queries to consume excessive resources [CRITICAL NODE - Slow Query DoS]:**  Using application logic to send queries that are intentionally slow or resource-intensive.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.1. Send a large volume of requests to overload Proxy resources (CPU, memory, connections) [CRITICAL NODE - Volumetric DoS]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_1__send_a_large_volume_of_requests_to_overload_proxy_resources__cpu__memory__connections___criti_780e636d.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2. DoS attacks targeting ShardingSphere governance center [CRITICAL NODE - Governance Center DoS]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2__dos_attacks_targeting_shardingsphere_governance_center__critical_node_-_governance_center_dos_.md)

*   **4.2. DoS attacks targeting ShardingSphere governance center [CRITICAL NODE - Governance Center DoS]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the governance center (ZooKeeper/Etcd) with DoS attacks, aiming to disrupt cluster coordination and stability.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  Disrupting the governance center can lead to cluster-wide instability, ShardingSphere malfunction, and ultimately, service downtime.
        *   **4.2.1. Overload ZooKeeper/Etcd with excessive requests [CRITICAL NODE - ZooKeeper/Etcd Volumetric DoS]:** Volumetric DoS attack against the governance center.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1. Overload ZooKeeper/Etcd with excessive requests [CRITICAL NODE - ZooKeeper/Etcd Volumetric DoS]](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1__overload_zookeeperetcd_with_excessive_requests__critical_node_-_zookeeperetcd_volumetric_dos_.md)

Volumetric DoS attack against the governance center.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE - Dependency Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_shardingsphere_dependencies__critical_node_-_dependency_vulnerabilitie_352200db.md)

Modern applications rely heavily on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be easily exploited and have wide-ranging impacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1. Leverage known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by ShardingSphere [CRITICAL NODE - Known Dependency Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1__leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_shardingsphere__critical_node_-_85c0d4be.md)
