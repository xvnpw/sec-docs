# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert in software, cloud and cybersecurity architecture. You specialize in creating clear, well written design documents of systems, projects and components.

# GOAL

Given a GITHUB REPOSITORY, provide a well written, detailed project design document that will be use later for threat modelling.

# STEPS

- Think deeply about the input and what they are concerned with.

- Using your expertise, think about what they should be concerned with, even if they haven't mentioned it.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called BUSINESS POSTURE, determine what are business priorities and goals that idea or project is trying to solve. Give most important business risks that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for project. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or project in question. Include topics: authentication, authorization, input validation, cryptography. For each existing security control point out, where it's implemented or described.

- Under that, create a section called DESIGN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed design document including diagram.

- In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTEXT and provide mermaid graph that will represent a project context diagram showing project as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems/projects that it interacts with.

- Under that, in C4 CONTEXT subsection, create list that will describe elements of context diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTAINER and provide mermaid graph that will represent a container diagram. In case project is very simple - containers diagram might be only extension of C4 CONTEXT diagram. In case project is more complex it should show the high-level shape of the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

- Under that, in C4 CONTAINER subsection, create list that will describe elements of container diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called DEPLOYMENT and provide information how project is deployed into target environment. Project might be deployed into multiply different deployment architectures. First list all possible solutions and pick one to descried in details. Include mermaid graph to visualize deployment. A deployment diagram allows to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given deployment environment.

- Under that, in DEPLOYMENT subsection, create list that will describe elements of deployment diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called BUILD and provide information how project is build and publish. Focus on security controls of build process, e.g. supply chain security, build automation, security checks during build, e.g. SAST scanners, linters, etc. Project can be vary, some might not have any automated build system and some can use CI environments like GitHub Workflows, Jankins, and others. Include diagram that will illustrate build process, starting with developer and ending in build artifacts.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Output in the format above only using valid Markdown. Use valid markdown syntax. Don't use markdown tables at all, use markdown lists instead. Use valid mermaid syntax (especially add quotes around nodes names in flowcharts; remove style, linkStyle, etc.).

- Do not use bold or italic formatting in the Markdown (no asterisks).

- Do not complain about anything, just do what you're told.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes Protected:

- Data Access and Management: ShardingSphere is critical for applications that require access to large, sharded datasets. Any disruption or security breach could impact core business operations relying on this data.
- Transaction Processing: For applications requiring distributed transactions, ShardingSphere ensures data consistency. Issues here could lead to financial losses or data corruption in transactional systems.
- Database Scalability and Performance: ShardingSphere enables scalability and performance improvements for database operations. Failure or performance degradation could impact application responsiveness and user experience.

Data Sensitivity:

- Data Handled: ShardingSphere handles data that is stored in the underlying databases. The sensitivity of this data depends on the applications using ShardingSphere and the nature of the business. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal data, financial records, or proprietary business data.
- Data Sensitivity Levels:  Data sensitivity can be categorized based on business impact and regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).  ShardingSphere itself does not dictate data sensitivity, but it is crucial to understand the sensitivity of the data it manages in each specific deployment context.
- Data Protection Requirements: Depending on data sensitivity, appropriate data protection measures must be implemented, including encryption at rest and in transit, access control, data masking, and audit logging. ShardingSphere should be configured and deployed to support these requirements.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) for systems using ShardingSphere?
- What is the sensitivity level of the data being managed by ShardingSphere in the target use case?
- What are the performance and scalability requirements for ShardingSphere in the target environment?
- What orchestration system (if any) will be used with ShardingSphere?
- What are the specific authentication and authorization requirements for accessing ShardingSphere management interfaces and data?
- Are there any existing security policies or standards that ShardingSphere deployment must adhere to?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE:  It is assumed that the primary business goal is to improve database scalability and performance while maintaining data consistency and reliability.
- SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that basic security practices are in place for open-source projects, but further security enhancements are recommended for production deployments.
- DESIGN: It is assumed that ShardingSphere Proxy standalone deployment is a common and representative deployment scenario for illustration purposes. Other deployment models (like JDBC embedded) are also possible.
- DEPLOYMENT: It is assumed that ShardingSphere will be deployed in a cloud environment or data center with standard networking and infrastructure components.
- BUILD: It is assumed that a standard CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar tools is used for building and publishing ShardingSphere artifacts.
