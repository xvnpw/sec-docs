# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Attack Surface: [1. SQL Injection via Proxy Bypass/Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/1__sql_injection_via_proxy_bypassmisconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass ShardingSphere Proxy's intended SQL parsing and security checks, directly targeting backend databases with malicious SQL queries.
*   **ShardingSphere Contribution:** ShardingSphere Proxy is designed as a central SQL security enforcement point. Misconfigurations or network weaknesses that allow direct database access negate this protection, directly increasing the SQL injection attack surface.
*   **Example:** Firewall rules are misconfigured, permitting direct connections to backend database ports from outside the protected network. An attacker exploits this to inject SQL payloads directly, bypassing ShardingSphere Proxy's security measures.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service on backend databases.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Network Segmentation:** Implement robust firewall rules and network policies to *mandate* all database traffic flows through ShardingSphere Proxy.
    *   **Proxy Connection Enforcement:** Configure ShardingSphere Proxy to strictly accept connections only from authorized sources and applications.
    *   **Regular Configuration Audits:**  Perform frequent audits of ShardingSphere Proxy configurations, especially routing and network settings, to identify and rectify potential bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement database-level security measures (like database firewalls) as an additional layer of protection, even with ShardingSphere in place.

## Attack Surface: [2. Authentication Weaknesses in Proxy Access](./attack_surfaces/2__authentication_weaknesses_in_proxy_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weak or default credentials, or vulnerabilities in the Proxy's authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to ShardingSphere Proxy.
*   **ShardingSphere Contribution:** ShardingSphere Proxy introduces its own authentication layer, securing access to the sharded database infrastructure. Weaknesses in this layer directly expose the backend databases managed by ShardingSphere.
*   **Example:** Default administrator credentials for ShardingSphere Proxy are used without modification. An attacker leverages these default credentials to gain administrative access, potentially compromising the Proxy and backend databases.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend databases, data breach, data manipulation, service disruption via Proxy misconfiguration.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Mandate strong, unique passwords for all ShardingSphere Proxy users and administrator accounts.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of passwords and API keys used for Proxy authentication.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for administrative access to ShardingSphere Proxy to add an extra layer of security.
    *   **Utilize Robust Authentication:** Employ secure authentication methods beyond basic username/password, such as certificate-based authentication or integration with enterprise identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth 2.0).
    *   **Security Access Audits:** Regularly audit ShardingSphere Proxy authentication configurations and access logs to detect and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Proxy](./attack_surfaces/3__denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_proxy.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm ShardingSphere Proxy with excessive requests or resource-intensive queries, leading to service disruption for applications relying on it.
*   **ShardingSphere Contribution:** ShardingSphere Proxy acts as a critical central gateway for database traffic. Its availability is paramount. DoS attacks targeting the Proxy directly impact the availability of all sharded databases and dependent applications.
*   **Example:** An attacker initiates a flood of connection requests to ShardingSphere Proxy, exceeding its connection capacity and preventing legitimate application requests from being processed, causing a service outage.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, potential data unavailability during the attack, impacting business continuity.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Configure rate limiting on ShardingSphere Proxy to restrict request frequency from specific sources, mitigating flood-based DoS attacks.
    *   **Connection Pool Management:** Set appropriate connection pool limits within ShardingSphere Proxy to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive connection attempts.
    *   **Query Timeouts and Throttling:** Define query timeouts to prevent long-running or malicious queries from monopolizing resources. Implement query throttling mechanisms if necessary.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Establish comprehensive monitoring of Proxy resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) and configure alerts for unusual spikes indicative of a DoS attack.
    *   **Load Balancing and Scalability:** Deploy ShardingSphere Proxy in a load-balanced and horizontally scalable architecture to enhance resilience and handle increased traffic loads during potential attacks.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Utilize network-based IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious traffic patterns associated with DoS attacks targeting the Proxy.

## Attack Surface: [4. Configuration Injection/Manipulation via Proxy Management Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/4__configuration_injectionmanipulation_via_proxy_management_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere Proxy's management interfaces to inject malicious configurations or alter existing settings, compromising the Proxy's intended behavior and security posture.
*   **ShardingSphere Contribution:** ShardingSphere Proxy exposes management interfaces (e.g., REST APIs, CLI) for administrative tasks. Insecure management interfaces become a direct and highly impactful attack vector, allowing control over the core data sharding infrastructure.
*   **Example:** A REST API endpoint for Proxy configuration lacks proper authentication and input validation. An attacker exploits this to inject a malicious routing rule that redirects queries for sensitive data to an attacker-controlled database, leading to data exfiltration.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, complete compromise of the ShardingSphere infrastructure, potentially long-term damage and loss of trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Management Interface Access:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all management interfaces, ensuring only authorized administrators can access them.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation for all configuration parameters accepted by management interfaces to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Administration:** Restrict access to management interfaces to only essential administrators, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Enable detailed audit logging for all configuration changes made through management interfaces to track modifications and detect suspicious activity.
    *   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct routine security testing, including penetration testing, specifically targeting ShardingSphere Proxy management interfaces to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Interfaces:** Disable any management interfaces that are not actively required or if more secure alternative management methods are available.

## Attack Surface: [5. Configuration Vulnerabilities in Application Deployment (ShardingSphere JDBC)](./attack_surfaces/5__configuration_vulnerabilities_in_application_deployment__shardingsphere_jdbc_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive configuration data (database credentials, sharding rules) required for ShardingSphere JDBC is insecurely managed within the application's deployment environment.
*   **ShardingSphere Contribution:** While not a direct flaw in ShardingSphere JDBC code, its deployment often necessitates embedding configuration within the application. If this configuration is not handled securely, it becomes a significant vulnerability point, especially in distributed sharded environments.
*   **Example:** Database credentials for backend databases, used by ShardingSphere JDBC, are stored as plain text in environment variables or configuration files accessible to unauthorized users or processes within the application's runtime environment. An attacker gaining access to the application environment can retrieve these credentials and compromise backend databases.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to backend databases, potential compromise of the application and underlying infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Externalize Configuration Securely:** Utilize dedicated secure configuration management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Spring Cloud Config) to manage and externalize sensitive configuration data, separating it from the application code and deployment artifacts.
    *   **Secure Secrets Management:** Implement a robust secrets management strategy using dedicated secrets management solutions to securely store, access, and rotate database credentials and other sensitive information used by ShardingSphere JDBC.
    *   **Encrypt Configuration Data:** Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit, ensuring confidentiality even if storage is compromised.
    *   **Restrict Access to Configuration Storage:** Implement strict access control mechanisms to limit access to configuration files and storage locations to only authorized users and processes.
    *   **Environment Variable Security:** If using environment variables, ensure the application environment itself is securely configured and access-controlled to prevent unauthorized access to environment variables containing sensitive data.
    *   **Regular Security Reviews of Deployment:** Conduct periodic security reviews of the application deployment environment and configuration management practices to identify and address potential vulnerabilities related to ShardingSphere JDBC configuration.

## Attack Surface: [6. API Vulnerabilities in Control Plane Management APIs (If Deployed)](./attack_surfaces/6__api_vulnerabilities_in_control_plane_management_apis__if_deployed_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere Control Plane's management APIs to gain unauthorized access, manipulate configurations, or disrupt the ShardingSphere cluster.
*   **ShardingSphere Contribution:** The Control Plane, if deployed, provides centralized management via APIs. Vulnerable APIs in the Control Plane become a high-impact attack surface, allowing attackers to compromise the entire ShardingSphere ecosystem.
*   **Example:** A Control Plane API endpoint for adding new sharding rules is vulnerable to an injection attack due to insufficient input sanitization. An attacker injects malicious code through this API, gaining control over the Control Plane server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the ShardingSphere cluster, data breach, data manipulation, service disruption, loss of governance and control over the sharded infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
