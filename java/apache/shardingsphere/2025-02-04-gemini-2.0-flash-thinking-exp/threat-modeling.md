# Threat Model Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Threat: [Shard Key Injection](./threats/shard_key_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates input data used to determine the shard key. By injecting malicious code or crafted input, they aim to alter the intended shard key and gain access to unauthorized shards or bypass access controls. This is similar to SQL injection, but targets the sharding logic instead of SQL queries directly.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data across shards, potential data corruption if injection leads to unintended data modification in wrong shards.
*   **Affected Component:** Sharding Logic, Shard Key Parsing, Input Validation within Application
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all input data used for shard key generation or routing.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing shard key queries, especially if shard keys are derived from user input.
    *   Implement input validation at multiple layers (application and ShardingSphere configuration if possible).

## Threat: [Data Leakage due to Sharding Misconfiguration](./threats/data_leakage_due_to_sharding_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured sharding rules, algorithms, or data source mappings can lead to data being stored in unintended shards. This can result in sensitive data being accessible to users or applications that should not have access based on intended sharding logic.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, compliance violations, unauthorized data access, data exposure to unintended parties.
*   **Affected Component:** Sharding Configuration, Sharding Rules, Data Source Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test and validate sharding configurations in non-production environments before deploying to production.
    *   Implement robust configuration management and version control for ShardingSphere configurations.
    *   Regularly audit sharding rules and data distribution to ensure intended behavior.
    *   Use automated configuration validation tools if available.

## Threat: [Transaction Coordinator Vulnerabilities](./threats/transaction_coordinator_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The ShardingSphere Transaction Coordinator (if used) is a critical component. Vulnerabilities in the coordinator itself or its communication protocols could be exploited by attackers to disrupt transactions, manipulate data within transactions, or cause denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, potential for transaction manipulation, system instability.
*   **Affected Component:** Transaction Coordinator Module, Communication Protocols of Transaction Coordinator
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep ShardingSphere and its transaction coordinator components up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Secure communication channels between the transaction coordinator and shards (e.g., using TLS/SSL).
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the transaction coordinator.
    *   Harden the server hosting the transaction coordinator.

## Threat: [ShardingSphere Proxy Compromise](./threats/shardingsphere_proxy_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** If using ShardingSphere Proxy, compromising the proxy server grants attackers access to all backend databases managed by it. Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the proxy software, operating system, or gain access through compromised credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full data breach, complete control over backend databases, denial of service, data manipulation, system takeover.
*   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy Server, Proxy Application, Proxy Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Harden the ShardingSphere Proxy server (operating system and application).
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for proxy access (e.g., mutual TLS, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
    *   Regularly update and patch the proxy software and operating system.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems around the proxy.
    *   Limit network access to the proxy to only authorized clients.
    *   Regularly audit proxy logs and security configurations.

## Threat: [SQL Injection through Proxy](./threats/sql_injection_through_proxy.md)

*   **Description:** Although ShardingSphere is designed to prevent SQL injection, vulnerabilities in its SQL parsing, routing logic, or misconfiguration could potentially allow SQL injection attacks to bypass the proxy and reach backend databases. Attackers could craft malicious SQL queries that are not properly sanitized or parsed by the proxy.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote code execution on backend databases (depending on database vulnerabilities), unauthorized database access.
*   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy, SQL Parsing Module, Query Router
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure ShardingSphere is configured to use parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever possible.
    *   Regularly update ShardingSphere to benefit from security patches in SQL parsing and routing logic.
    *   Perform security testing specifically targeting SQL injection vulnerabilities through the proxy, including fuzzing and penetration testing.
    *   Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of the proxy to filter malicious SQL patterns.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass at Proxy Level](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_at_proxy_level.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the proxy's authentication or authorization mechanisms could allow attackers to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access to backend databases through the proxy. This could be due to flaws in the authentication logic, weak password policies, or misconfigurations.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential privilege escalation, security policy bypass.
*   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Proxy, Authentication Module, Authorization Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms for proxy access (e.g., mutual TLS, strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
    *   Implement robust authorization policies within the proxy, following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly audit and test proxy authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Enforce strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere Core or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_shardingsphere_core_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Like any software, ShardingSphere and its dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere core components or its third-party libraries to compromise the application or underlying systems.
*   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, from denial of service to remote code execution and data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** ShardingSphere Core Modules, Third-Party Dependencies
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Critical to High depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update ShardingSphere and its dependencies to the latest versions, applying security patches promptly.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for ShardingSphere and its ecosystem (e.g., Apache Security Mailing Lists).
    *   Perform vulnerability scanning on ShardingSphere components and dependencies using automated tools.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process to track and remediate identified vulnerabilities.
