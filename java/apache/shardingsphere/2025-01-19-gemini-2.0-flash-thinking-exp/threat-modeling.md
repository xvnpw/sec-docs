# Threat Model Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Threat: [SQL Injection Vulnerability Introduced by ShardingSphere's SQL Rewriting](./threats/sql_injection_vulnerability_introduced_by_shardingsphere's_sql_rewriting.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query that, when processed by ShardingSphere's SQL parsing and rewriting engine, results in a vulnerable SQL query being sent to the backend database. This could occur if ShardingSphere incorrectly handles special characters or escape sequences during the rewriting process, creating an injection point. The attacker can then execute arbitrary SQL commands on the backend databases.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to database resources, potential for complete database takeover.

**Affected Component:** ShardingSphere-Proxy (SQL Parser, SQL Rewriter), ShardingSphere-JDBC (SQL Parser, SQL Rewriter).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep ShardingSphere updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Thoroughly test the application with various SQL injection payloads to identify potential vulnerabilities introduced by ShardingSphere's rewriting.
* Report any suspected SQL injection vulnerabilities in ShardingSphere's rewriting engine to the Apache ShardingSphere project.
* While ShardingSphere aims to prevent this, standard SQL injection prevention practices in the application code are still crucial.

## Threat: [Distributed Transaction Inconsistency due to ShardingSphere Failures](./threats/distributed_transaction_inconsistency_due_to_shardingsphere_failures.md)

**Description:** During a distributed transaction managed by ShardingSphere, a failure occurs within ShardingSphere itself (e.g., network issue, process crash). If the transaction management is not robust, this could lead to inconsistencies where some shards commit the transaction while others do not, resulting in a corrupted data state across the distributed database. An attacker might intentionally try to trigger such failures to cause data inconsistencies.

**Impact:** Data corruption, loss of data integrity, application errors, financial losses due to incorrect data.

**Affected Component:** ShardingSphere-Proxy (Transaction Manager), ShardingSphere-JDBC (Transaction Manager).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure ShardingSphere's distributed transaction management (e.g., using XA or Saga) appropriately for the application's consistency requirements.
* Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms in the application to handle transaction failures gracefully.
* Monitor ShardingSphere's health and transaction status to detect and address potential issues promptly.
* Ensure the underlying database systems are reliable and have their own transaction management capabilities.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass or Weak Authentication in ShardingSphere Management Interface](./threats/authentication_bypass_or_weak_authentication_in_shardingsphere_management_interface.md)

**Description:** If ShardingSphere's management interface (if enabled) has weak authentication mechanisms or vulnerabilities allowing authentication bypass, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to manage ShardingSphere. This could allow them to modify configurations, potentially leading to further security compromises, such as altering routing rules or accessing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Complete control over ShardingSphere configuration, potential for data breaches by manipulating routing or accessing credentials, denial of service by misconfiguration.

**Affected Component:** ShardingSphere-Proxy (Management Interface).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure strong authentication is enabled and properly configured for ShardingSphere's management interface.
* Use strong, unique passwords for administrative accounts.
* Restrict access to the management interface to authorized networks or IP addresses.
* Regularly review and update the credentials used for accessing the management interface.
* Consider disabling the management interface if it's not actively needed.
