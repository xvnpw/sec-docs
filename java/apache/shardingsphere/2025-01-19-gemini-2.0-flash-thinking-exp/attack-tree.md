## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit ShardingSphere Proxy Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_shardingsphere_proxy_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Focus:** This path targets the ShardingSphere Proxy, which acts as the entry point for database interactions.
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   Identifying the Proxy Endpoint: This is usually straightforward as the application needs to know where to connect.
    *   Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Flaws [CRITICAL NODE]: This is the critical step. If successful, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the proxy.
        *   Bypassing Authentication Mechanisms [HIGH RISK PATH]: Attackers attempt to circumvent the login process.
            *   Exploiting Default Credentials (if any) [CRITICAL NODE]: If default credentials are not changed, this provides trivial access.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit ShardingSphere Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_shardingsphere_configuration_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Focus:** This path targets the configuration files or storage of ShardingSphere, which contain sensitive information.
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   Accessing ShardingSphere Configuration Files/Storage [CRITICAL NODE]: Gaining access to these files is the primary goal.
        *   Exploiting File System Permissions [HIGH RISK PATH]: Weak file system permissions make accessing configuration files easier.
    *   Extracting Sensitive Information from Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]: Once accessed, attackers look for valuable data.
        *   Obtaining Database Credentials [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]: This is a high-value target, granting direct access to backend databases.
    *   Modifying Configuration to Gain Access/Control [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]: Attackers alter the configuration to inject malicious data sources, redirect traffic, or disable security.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit ShardingSphere Governance/Management Interface Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_shardingsphere_governancemanagement_interface_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Focus:** This path targets the administrative interface of ShardingSphere, if exposed.
*   **Key Steps:**
    *   Identifying the Governance/Management Endpoint: Attackers need to find the entry point for administration.
    *   Exploiting Authentication/Authorization Flaws in Governance Interface [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]: Similar to the proxy, weak authentication here grants administrative control.
        *   Bypassing Authentication Mechanisms [HIGH RISK PATH]: Circumventing the login for the admin interface.
            *   Exploiting Default Credentials (if any) [CRITICAL NODE]: Default credentials on the admin interface are a major vulnerability.
    *   Exploiting Unsecured API Endpoints in Governance Interface [HIGH RISK PATH]: If the API is not properly secured, attackers can directly execute administrative actions.
        *   Executing Administrative Actions Remotely [CRITICAL NODE]: This allows attackers to take control of ShardingSphere without proper authentication.
