# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/shardingsphere

## Attack Surface: [ShardingSphere Proxy Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/shardingsphere_proxy_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the ShardingSphere Proxy's authentication mechanism to gain unauthorized access without valid credentials.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** The proxy acts as the central entry point, and weaknesses in its authentication implementation directly expose backend databases. Default or weak credentials configured during setup are a common issue.

**Example:** An attacker uses default credentials or exploits a known authentication flaw in a specific ShardingSphere version to connect to the proxy and execute arbitrary SQL.

**Impact:** Full access to backend databases, allowing data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong password policies for all ShardingSphere Proxy users.
* Disable or change default credentials immediately upon deployment.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
* Regularly update ShardingSphere to patch known authentication vulnerabilities.
* Review and restrict network access to the proxy.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via ShardingSphere Proxy](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_shardingsphere_proxy.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code through the ShardingSphere Proxy, which is then executed on the backend databases.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** If ShardingSphere doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize SQL queries before routing them to the backend, it can become a conduit for SQL injection attacks. Complex sharding logic might introduce new injection points.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within an application request that bypasses ShardingSphere's parsing and is executed directly on a sharded database, potentially dropping tables or exfiltrating data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation on backend databases.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce parameterized queries or prepared statements in the application layer.
* Ensure ShardingSphere's SQL parsing and rewriting logic is secure and up-to-date.
* Implement input validation and sanitization on the application side before sending queries to ShardingSphere.
* Regularly audit application code and ShardingSphere configurations for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [ShardingSphere Management Interface Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/shardingsphere_management_interface_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers bypass the authentication mechanism of the ShardingSphere management interface (if enabled) to gain administrative control.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** The management interface provides powerful administrative capabilities. Weak authentication here grants attackers full control over ShardingSphere's configuration and potentially the backend databases.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a default password or a vulnerability in the management interface's authentication to access the dashboard and reconfigure data sources or sharding rules.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the ShardingSphere setup, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and potential compromise of backend databases.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the management interface with strong, unique credentials.
* Restrict access to the management interface to authorized networks or IP addresses.
* Disable the management interface if it's not actively used.
* Regularly update ShardingSphere to patch vulnerabilities in the management interface.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain access to ShardingSphere configuration files or settings that contain sensitive information.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** ShardingSphere configuration often includes database credentials, encryption keys, and other sensitive details necessary for its operation. Improper storage or access control can lead to exposure.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a ShardingSphere configuration file on a compromised server, revealing database usernames and passwords, which can then be used to directly access the backend databases.

**Impact:** Direct access to backend databases, decryption of encrypted data, and potential for further system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store ShardingSphere configuration files securely with appropriate file system permissions.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use secure secrets management solutions.
* Encrypt sensitive data within configuration files if possible.
* Implement strict access control to configuration files and directories.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on ShardingSphere Proxy](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_shardingsphere_proxy.md)

**Description:** Attackers overwhelm the ShardingSphere Proxy with requests, causing it to become unavailable and disrupting application functionality.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:** As the central point of contact, the proxy is a target for DoS attacks. Inefficient resource handling or vulnerabilities in request processing can exacerbate the impact.

**Example:** An attacker floods the ShardingSphere Proxy with a large number of invalid or resource-intensive SQL queries, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.

**Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption, and potential financial losses.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the ShardingSphere Proxy.
* Deploy the proxy behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or load balancer with DoS protection capabilities.
* Optimize ShardingSphere's configuration for performance and resource utilization.
* Monitor proxy performance and resource consumption for anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Tampering](./attack_surfaces/configuration_tampering.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to modify ShardingSphere's configuration, potentially leading to security breaches or service disruption.

**How ShardingSphere Contributes:**  If access controls are weak, attackers can alter sharding rules, data source connections, or other settings to redirect data, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt operations.

**Example:** An attacker modifies the ShardingSphere configuration to redirect queries intended for a production database to a test database, leading to data corruption or exposure.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, service disruption, and potential compromise of backend databases.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access control for modifying ShardingSphere configurations.
* Use version control for configuration files to track changes and enable rollback.
* Implement an audit trail for configuration changes.
* Secure the environment where ShardingSphere configuration is managed.
