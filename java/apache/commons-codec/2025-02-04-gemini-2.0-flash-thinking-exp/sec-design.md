# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache Commons Codec library provides implementations of common encoders and decoders such as Base64, Hex, and various phonetic encoders.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide reliable and efficient encoding and decoding functionalities for Java applications.
  - Maintain a high level of code quality and stability to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.
  - Offer a comprehensive set of codec implementations to reduce the need for developers to implement these functionalities themselves.
  - Ensure the library is performant and does not introduce significant overhead to applications using it.
  - Maintain compatibility with widely used Java versions and platforms.
  - Foster an open and collaborative development environment through the Apache Software Foundation.

- Business Risks:
  - Vulnerabilities in encoding/decoding algorithms could lead to security breaches in applications using the library (e.g., data corruption, information disclosure, injection attacks).
  - Performance issues or bugs in the library could negatively impact the performance and stability of dependent applications.
  - Lack of maintenance or slow response to security issues could lead to developers choosing alternative libraries.
  - Incompatibility with new Java versions or platforms could limit the library's usability.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting the library's build or distribution process could compromise applications using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/apache/commons-codec) - Provides version control and transparency.
  - security control: Apache Software Foundation project - Benefits from ASF's established processes and infrastructure.
  - security control: Build process managed by Apache Maven - Standardized build process.
  - security control: Unit tests - Ensure basic functionality and detect regressions.
  - security control: Publicly available source code - Allows for community review and security audits.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities are publicly discoverable, potentially leading to faster exploitation if not addressed promptly.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security patches and vulnerability reports.
  - accepted risk: Potential for dependencies to introduce vulnerabilities (transitive dependencies).

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) in the build pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the project.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for changes related to encoding/decoding algorithms.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports and releasing security patches.
  - security control: Consider code signing build artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* the library, but not the library itself.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* the library, but not the library itself.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Implement robust input validation for all encoding and decoding methods to prevent injection attacks and handle malformed input gracefully.
    - Requirement: Clearly document expected input formats and potential error conditions for each codec.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use secure cryptographic practices when implementing cryptographic codecs (if any are included or added in the future).
    - Requirement: Ensure proper handling of cryptographic keys and sensitive data if cryptographic codecs are implemented.
    - Requirement: Follow established cryptographic standards and best practices for any cryptographic operations.
  - General Security:
    - Requirement: Adhere to secure coding practices to minimize common vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string bugs).
    - Requirement: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Provide clear documentation on security considerations for developers using the library.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Correct encoding and decoding of data in applications that depend on the Apache Commons Codec library. This is critical for data integrity, security, and application functionality.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - The Apache Commons Codec library itself does not directly handle or store sensitive data. However, it processes data provided by applications using it.
  - The sensitivity of the data being encoded/decoded depends entirely on the context of the application using the library. It could range from public information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
  - The primary concern is to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data processed by applications using the library, by ensuring the library itself is secure and functions correctly.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific types of applications that are the primary users of Apache Commons Codec? (e.g., web applications, data processing systems, etc.)
  - Are there any specific codecs within the library that are considered more critical or security-sensitive than others?
  - What is the current process for handling security vulnerability reports for Apache Commons Codec?
  - Are there any existing SAST or dependency scanning tools currently used in the build process?
  - Is artifact signing currently implemented for releases of Apache Commons Codec?

- Assumptions:
  - Assumption: The primary use case for Apache Commons Codec is within Java/JVM-based applications.
  - Assumption: Developers using the library are responsible for implementing application-level security controls, such as authentication, authorization, and data protection, in addition to using the library securely.
  - Assumption: The build and release process for Apache Commons Codec follows the standard Apache Software Foundation practices.
