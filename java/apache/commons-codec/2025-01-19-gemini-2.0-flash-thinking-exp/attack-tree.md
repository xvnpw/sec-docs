## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Encoding/Decoding Functionality -> Base64 Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Data via Base64 Encoding](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_encodingdecoding_functionality_-_base64_manipulation_-_inject_malicious_data__5a83e159.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker crafts a malicious payload and encodes it using Base64. The application decodes this payload without proper validation, allowing the malicious code or data to be processed, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or other security compromises.
    Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data via Base64 Encoding
        Impact: Critical - Potential for arbitrary code execution, sensitive data access, and complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Encoding/Decoding Functionality -> Hexadecimal Manipulation -> Inject Malicious Data via Hex Encoding](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_encodingdecoding_functionality_-_hexadecimal_manipulation_-_inject_malicious__73bacdcc.md)

Attack Vector: Similar to Base64, an attacker encodes a malicious payload using hexadecimal encoding. The application's failure to validate the decoded input allows the attacker to inject and execute malicious code or manipulate data.
    Critical Node: Inject Malicious Data via Hex Encoding
        Impact: Critical - Similar to Base64 injection, leading to potential code execution and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Encoding/Decoding Functionality -> URL Encoding/Decoding Vulnerabilities -> Double URL Encoding Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_encodingdecoding_functionality_-_url_encodingdecoding_vulnerabilities_-_doubl_88f23f41.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers double-encode malicious characters in a URL. Initial security checks might decode the URL once and find no malicious content. However, the application using `commons-codec` decodes it again, revealing the malicious characters and bypassing the initial security measures.
    Impact: High - Bypassing security controls can allow access to restricted resources or execution of malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Digest Algorithm Functionality -> Collision Attacks on Hashing Algorithms -> Forging Data Integrity Checks](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_digest_algorithm_functionality_-_collision_attacks_on_hashing_algorithms_-_fo_76098160.md)

Attack Vector: If the application uses a weak hashing algorithm (like MD5) for data integrity checks, an attacker can create a collision – a different piece of data that produces the same hash as the legitimate data. This allows them to replace legitimate data with malicious data without detection.
    Critical Node: Forging Data Integrity Checks
        Impact: Critical - Compromising data integrity can lead to data manipulation, financial fraud, and other serious consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Digest Algorithm Functionality -> Collision Attacks on Hashing Algorithms -> Password Reset Vulnerabilities via Hash Collision](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_digest_algorithm_functionality_-_collision_attacks_on_hashing_algorithms_-_pa_49567848.md)

Attack Vector: If a password reset mechanism relies on a weak hashing algorithm, an attacker might be able to generate a collision for a known password. This could allow them to reset other users' passwords and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
    Critical Node: Password Reset Vulnerabilities via Hash Collision
        Impact: Critical - Account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive user data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Digest Algorithm Functionality -> Length Extension Attacks -> Manipulating Authenticated Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_digest_algorithm_functionality_-_length_extension_attacks_-_manipulating_auth_dc0b133e.md)

Attack Vector: Certain hashing algorithms are susceptible to length extension attacks. If the application uses such an algorithm in a vulnerable way, an attacker can append data to a signed message without invalidating the signature, allowing them to manipulate authenticated data.
    Impact: High - Circumventing authentication mechanisms, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Binary Encoding/Decoding Functionality -> Improper Handling of Binary Data -> Buffer Overflow during Binary Decoding](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_binary_encodingdecoding_functionality_-_improper_handling_of_binary_data_-_bu_5b041eaa.md)

Attack Vector: When decoding binary data, if the application doesn't properly allocate buffer sizes, a crafted binary input that exceeds the buffer capacity can cause a buffer overflow. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    Critical Node: Buffer Overflow during Binary Decoding
        Impact: Critical - Arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Binary Encoding/Decoding Functionality -> Improper Handling of Binary Data -> Injection via Unsanitized Binary Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_binary_encodingdecoding_functionality_-_improper_handling_of_binary_data_-_in_07045a11.md)

Attack Vector: After decoding binary data, if the application processes it without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject malicious commands or data that are then interpreted by the application, leading to various injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection if the binary data is used in database queries).
    Impact: High - Potential for various injection attacks, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or code execution.
