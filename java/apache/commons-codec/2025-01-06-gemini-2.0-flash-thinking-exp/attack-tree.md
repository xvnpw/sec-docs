## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Commons-Codec](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_commons-codec.md)

* This represents the overall attacker goal and encompasses all the subsequent high-risk paths and critical nodes. It highlights the potential for complete application compromise by exploiting weaknesses in `commons-codec`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Encoding/Decoding Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_encodingdecoding_logic.md)

* This path focuses on directly exploiting implementation flaws within the various encoding and decoding algorithms provided by `commons-codec`. Successful exploitation can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Bugs in Base64 Encoding/Decoding](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_bugs_in_base64_encodingdecoding.md)

* This critical node represents the potential to trigger specific, unintended behaviors within the Base64 encoding or decoding implementations. This could lead to incorrect output, crashes, or even memory corruption, potentially opening avenues for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in Hex Decoding](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_hex_decoding.md)

* This specific high-risk path involves providing a specially crafted, excessively long hex-encoded string to the decoding function. If the decoding process doesn't properly manage buffer sizes, it can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
* As mentioned in the High-Risk Paths, this critical node represents a severe vulnerability where providing an overly long hex string can overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Other Encoding/Decoding Algorithm Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_other_encodingdecoding_algorithm_vulnerabilities.md)

* This critical node highlights the risk of vulnerabilities in less commonly used encoding or hashing algorithms within `commons-codec`. If an attacker identifies a flaw in algorithms like those in `DigestUtils` or `BinaryEncoder`, they could potentially compromise the application's integrity or confidentiality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Encoding/Decoding Functionality for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_encodingdecoding_functionality_for_malicious_purposes.md)

* This path focuses on misusing the intended functionality of `commons-codec` to achieve malicious goals. Instead of exploiting bugs in the algorithms themselves, the attacker leverages the encoding and decoding processes to introduce harmful data or bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection via Manipulated Encoding](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection_via_manipulated_encoding.md)

* This high-risk path involves crafting encoded data that, when decoded by the application, results in malicious input. For example, an attacker might encode a command injection payload using Base64. When the application decodes this data and uses it in a system call without proper sanitization, it can lead to arbitrary command execution on the server.
* This critical node represents a direct and often easily exploitable attack vector. By carefully crafting encoded malicious payloads, attackers can inject harmful commands or scripts into the application after decoding.

## Attack Tree Path: [Canonicalization Attacks via Encoding/Decoding](./attack_tree_paths/canonicalization_attacks_via_encodingdecoding.md)

* This high-risk path involves using encoding techniques to bypass security checks that rely on specific string representations. For example, encoding path traversal characters like `../` can allow an attacker to access files or directories outside of the intended scope, even if the application has basic checks for `../`.
* This critical node represents a common technique for bypassing security checks. By encoding data in a way that the security check doesn't recognize as malicious, but the application later decodes into a harmful form, attackers can gain unauthorized access or execute unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

* This critical node highlights the risk of attackers overwhelming the application by sending extremely large or complex data for encoding or decoding. This can consume excessive CPU, memory, or other resources, leading to a denial of service and making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
