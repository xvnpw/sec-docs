# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/commons-codec

## Attack Surface: [Weak Hashing Algorithm Usage](./attack_surfaces/weak_hashing_algorithm_usage.md)

*Description:* Using cryptographically weak hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-1) provided by Commons Codec for security-sensitive operations.
*Commons Codec Contribution:* The library *provides* these algorithms, making their misuse readily available.
*Example:* A developer uses `DigestUtils.md5Hex()` to hash user passwords.
*Impact:* An attacker can use precomputed rainbow tables or brute-force attacks to crack passwords, leading to unauthorized account access. Compromise of digital signatures if used for integrity.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (if used for passwords or other critical security functions). **High** (if used for less critical integrity checks).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** *Never* use MD5 or SHA-1 for security-sensitive hashing. Use strong algorithms like SHA-256, SHA-512, or SHA-3. For passwords, use a dedicated password hashing library (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt) *outside* of Commons Codec.

## Attack Surface: [Missing or Inadequate Salting (with Hashing)](./attack_surfaces/missing_or_inadequate_salting__with_hashing_.md)

*Description:* Using hashing functions provided by Commons Codec without a unique, randomly generated salt per item, especially for passwords.
*Commons Codec Contribution:* Commons Codec provides the hashing functions, but *does not* provide built-in salting mechanisms. This makes it easy to misuse the hashing functions insecurely.
*Example:* A developer uses `DigestUtils.sha256Hex(password)` without adding a salt.
*Impact:* Vulnerability to rainbow table attacks. If one password is cracked, all passwords with the same value are compromised.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical** (when used with passwords).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** Always use a unique, cryptographically secure random salt for each item being hashed (especially passwords). Store the salt alongside the hashed value. Use `java.security.SecureRandom` to generate salts.  Strongly prefer dedicated password hashing libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Character Encoding Mismatches](./attack_surfaces/character_encoding_mismatches.md)

*Description:* Inconsistent or unspecified character encoding when using string-based encoding/decoding methods provided by Commons Codec.
*Commons Codec Contribution:* Many encoding/decoding methods in Commons Codec (e.g., Base64, Hex) operate on strings and are therefore sensitive to character encoding.  The library provides methods that *don't* force explicit charset specification.
*Example:* A developer uses `Base64.encodeBase64String(data)` without specifying the character set, leading to different results on systems with different default charsets.
*Impact:* Data corruption, incorrect interpretation of data, potential for injection attacks if special characters are misinterpreted due to incorrect charset handling.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (potential for data corruption and injection vulnerabilities).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:** *Always* explicitly specify the character encoding (e.g., `StandardCharsets.UTF_8`) when using string-based encoding/decoding methods in Commons Codec.  For example: `Base64.encodeBase64String(data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))`.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Commons Codec Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_commons_codec_version.md)

*Description:* Using an old version of the Commons Codec library that contains known security vulnerabilities.
*Commons Codec Contribution:* The vulnerability exists *within* the library itself.
*Example:* Using a version of Commons Codec with a known CVE related to Base64 decoding that allows for denial-of-service.
*Impact:* Exposure to known exploits, potentially leading to a wide range of security breaches (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of the known vulnerabilities).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers/Administrators:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Commons Codec. Use dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle) to automate updates. Monitor security advisories (NIST NVD, Snyk).

## Attack Surface: [Digest Truncation](./attack_surfaces/digest_truncation.md)

*Description:* Shortening the output of a hash function provided by Commons Codec.
*Commons Codec Contribution:* While the library doesn't directly offer truncation, developers might manually shorten the output of methods like `DigestUtils.sha256Hex()`.
*Example:* A developer takes only the first 20 characters of a SHA-256 hash generated by `DigestUtils.sha256Hex()` to save space.
*Impact:* Significantly increases the chance of hash collisions, making brute-force attacks much easier.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:** Never truncate hash outputs. If a shorter hash is needed, choose a hash algorithm designed for that output length (e.g., SHA-256 instead of truncating SHA-512).
