## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Codec Usage](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_codec_usage.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category where the application uses a Commons Codec component in a way that creates a vulnerability, even if the codec itself is not flawed. The critical vulnerability here stems from how the *output* of the codec is subsequently handled.
*   **Focus:** The primary concern is the interaction between Commons Codec's decoding functions (e.g., Base64 decoding) and the application's deserialization process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization (if applicable) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization__if_applicable___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the *critical* node.  It represents the scenario where data decoded by Commons Codec is then passed to an unsafe deserialization mechanism.  This is *not* a vulnerability within Commons Codec itself, but rather a vulnerability in how the application uses the decoded output.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (dependent on whether the application performs deserialization after decoding).  If deserialization *is* used, the likelihood is high.
*   **Impact:** Very High (Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (finding a suitable gadget chain can be complex, but readily available tools and exploits exist).
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert (requires understanding of deserialization vulnerabilities and exploit development).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires careful code review and potentially dynamic analysis to identify vulnerable deserialization patterns).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid native Java serialization if at all possible.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, use a secure deserialization library (e.g., Jackson or Gson) with strict whitelisting of allowed classes.  *Never* deserialize untrusted data without strong safeguards.
    *   Implement robust input validation *before* deserialization to ensure the data conforms to expected types and structures.
    *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the potential impact of code execution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gadget Chain Injection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/gadget_chain_injection__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most direct and dangerous attack vector within insecure deserialization.  The attacker crafts a malicious payload that, when decoded by Commons Codec and *then* deserialized, triggers a "gadget chain."  A gadget chain is a sequence of carefully chosen class instantiations and method calls that ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if insecure deserialization is present).
*   **Impact:** Very High (Arbitrary Code Execution).
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires finding or crafting a suitable gadget chain; many publicly available gadget chains exist for common libraries).
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires deep understanding of the application's classpath and potential gadget chains).
    *   **Mitigation:** Same as for Insecure Deserialization. The best defense is to prevent insecure deserialization in the first place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Object Confusion](./attack_tree_paths/object_confusion.md)

* **Description:** The attacker manipulates the encoded data to cause the deserialization process to create unexpected objects. While not directly leading to RCE like a gadget chain, this can still lead to unexpected application behavior, potential logic flaws, or be a stepping stone to other vulnerabilities.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (if insecure deserialization is present, and the application logic is susceptible to unexpected object types).
* **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on how the application handles the unexpected objects; could range from minor misbehavior to more serious logic flaws).
* **Effort:** Medium.
* **Skill Level:** Advanced.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard.
* **Mitigation:** Same as for Insecure Deserialization, with a particular emphasis on strict type checking and validation *after* decoding and *before* deserialization.
