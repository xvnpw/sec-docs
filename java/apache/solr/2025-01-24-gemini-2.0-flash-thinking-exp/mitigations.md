# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/solr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Enforce Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_enforce_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable and Enforce Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an Authentication Plugin:** Select a suitable authentication plugin in Solr's `solr.xml` configuration file. Options include `BasicAuthPlugin`, `KerberosPlugin`, or `PKIAuthenticationPlugin`. For example, to enable Basic Authentication, add the following to `<security>` section in `solr.xml`:
        ```xml
        <authentication>
          <plugin class="solr.BasicAuthPlugin">
            <credentials>
              solr:J7HAz1t7iPIj/S/yvztPVg==
            </credentials>
          </plugin>
        </authentication>
        ```
        *(Note: Replace `solr:J7HAz1t7iPIj/S/yvztPVg==` with securely generated credentials.)*
    2.  **Configure Credentials:**  Set strong, unique usernames and passwords for Solr users. Store these credentials securely and avoid default credentials. For Basic Authentication, you can use the `bin/solr add-user` script to manage users and passwords.
    3.  **Enforce Authentication Globally:** Ensure that authentication is enforced for all critical Solr endpoints, including `/solr/admin/`, `/solr/core_name/update`, `/solr/core_name/select`, and any custom handlers. This is typically the default behavior when an authentication plugin is enabled.
    4.  **Test Authentication:** Verify that unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints are rejected with a 401 Unauthorized error. Test with valid credentials to confirm successful authentication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Data (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data stored in Solr collections.
    *   **Data Modification by Unauthorized Users (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying or deleting data in Solr.
    *   **Administrative Access by Unauthorized Users (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing Solr's administrative interface and performing administrative tasks.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data exfiltration by limiting access to authorized users only.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for all listed threats. Authentication is a fundamental security control within Solr.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic Authentication is enabled on the Solr Admin UI (`/solr/admin/`) in the development environment. Credentials are managed using `bin/solr add-user`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authentication is not enforced on the application-facing Solr endpoints used for querying and indexing (`/solr/core_name/select`, `/solr/core_name/update`) in all environments (staging and production).
    *   Stronger authentication mechanisms like Kerberos or PKI Authentication are not explored for production.
    *   Credential management process needs to be formalized and integrated with the application's user management system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authorization Plugin:** Configure an authorization plugin in `solr.xml` within the `<security>` section.  Solr provides `RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin`. Example:
        ```xml
        <authorization>
          <plugin class="solr.security.RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin">
            <userPermission name="solr" role="admin"/>
            <rolePermission role="admin" collection="collection1" path="/*" operations="all"/>
            <rolePermission role="read-only" collection="collection1" path="/select" operations="read"/>
          </plugin>
        </authorization>
        ```
    2.  **Define Roles:** Define roles that correspond to different levels of access needed within your application (e.g., `admin`, `indexer`, `read-only`, `application`).
    3.  **Assign Permissions to Roles:**  Define permissions for each role, specifying which collections, paths (endpoints), and operations (read, write, update, delete, admin) are allowed. Use the `<rolePermission>` tag in `solr.xml`.
    4.  **Assign Roles to Users:**  Assign roles to authenticated users. This is typically done within the authorization plugin configuration, often linked to the authentication mechanism. For `RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin`, user-role mappings are defined directly in `solr.xml` using `<userPermission>`. For more complex scenarios, consider integrating with external identity providers.
    5.  **Test Authorization Rules:** Thoroughly test the RBAC configuration to ensure that users are granted only the intended access levels. Verify that users with specific roles can access allowed resources and are denied access to restricted resources.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Prevents users from gaining unauthorized access to higher-level privileges or sensitive data within Solr.
    *   **Data Breach due to Over-Permissive Access (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by ensuring users only have access to the Solr data and operations they need.
    *   **Accidental Data Modification or Deletion (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential for accidental data corruption or deletion within Solr by restricting write access to authorized roles.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for privilege escalation and data breach; Medium reduction for accidental data modification. RBAC provides granular access control within Solr.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Authorization is not configured in any environment. All authenticated users currently have implicit full access based on authentication alone within Solr.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   RBAC needs to be implemented in all environments (development, staging, production) within Solr configuration.
    *   Roles need to be defined based on application requirements interacting with Solr (e.g., application user, admin user, data loader).
    *   Permissions need to be configured for each role, restricting access to specific Solr collections, endpoints, and operations.
    *   Integration with the application's user management system for dynamic role assignment in Solr should be considered for future implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize Queries](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_queries.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterize Queries
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Client Library Features:** Utilize the parameterized query features provided by your Solr client library (e.g., SolrJ for Java, pysolr for Python). These libraries typically offer methods to construct queries with placeholders for user input that are then safely handled by the library when interacting with Solr.
    2.  **Avoid String Concatenation:**  Never directly concatenate user input into Solr query strings. This is the primary source of Solr Query Language Injection vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Example (SolrJ - Java):** Instead of:
        ```java
        String userInput = request.getParameter("query");
        String queryString = "q=text:" + userInput; // Vulnerable!
        Query query = new SolrQuery(queryString);
        ```
        Use parameterized queries:
        ```java
        String userInput = request.getParameter("query");
        SolrQuery query = new SolrQuery();
        query.setQuery("text:?"); // Placeholder
        query.setParam("q.op", "AND"); // Example operator
        query.setParam("text", userInput); // Parameter value
        ```
    4.  **Example (pysolr - Python):**
        ```python
        user_query = request.GET.get('q')
        solr.search('text:{}'.format(user_query)) # Vulnerable!

        # Use parameterized query (pysolr doesn't have explicit parameterization, but escaping is crucial)
        import pysolr
        import urllib.parse
        user_query = request.GET.get('q')
        escaped_query = urllib.parse.quote_plus(user_query) # Escape special characters
        solr.search('text:{}'.format(escaped_query)) # Still better to use client library's escaping if available
        ```
        *(Note: While pysolr example shows escaping, true parameterization is generally safer and more robust. Check your client library for the best approach when interacting with Solr.)*
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Solr Query Language Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious Solr query syntax through user input to bypass security controls, access unauthorized data within Solr, or potentially execute commands (in rare, misconfigured scenarios within Solr).
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for Solr Query Language Injection. Parameterization is the primary defense against this type of injection when interacting with Solr.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. In some parts of the application, parameterized queries are used when interacting with Solr, especially in newer modules. However, older modules and some ad-hoc query constructions might still rely on string concatenation.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive code review is needed to identify and refactor all instances of direct string concatenation when building Solr queries across the entire application codebase that interacts with Solr.
    *   Development guidelines should be updated to mandate the use of parameterized queries and explicitly prohibit string concatenation for query construction when working with Solr.
    *   Static code analysis tools could be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential query injection vulnerabilities in code interacting with Solr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Sanitize User Input (for Solr)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_sanitize_user_input__for_solr_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate and Sanitize User Input (for Solr)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Input Validation:** Define strict validation rules for all user inputs that are used in Solr queries or indexing. This includes:
        *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure input conforms to the expected data type (e.g., string, number, date) that Solr expects.
        *   **Length Limits:** Enforce maximum length limits to prevent buffer overflows or excessively long queries sent to Solr.
        *   **Format Validation:** Validate input against expected formats (e.g., email address, phone number, date format) that are relevant to Solr data.
        *   **Allowed Character Sets (Whitelisting):**  Restrict input to a predefined set of allowed characters that are safe for Solr processing. This is more secure than blacklisting.
    2.  **Input Sanitization (Escaping for Solr):**  Even with validation, sanitize user input before using it in Solr queries or indexing. This involves escaping special characters that have meaning in Solr query syntax or data formats.
        *   **Solr Query Syntax Escaping:** Escape characters like `+`, `-`, `&`, `|`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `"`, `~`, `*`, `?`, `:`, `\` and spaces if they are not intended as operators in Solr queries. Client libraries often provide functions for this.
        *   **HTML/XML Encoding (for indexed content in Solr):** If indexing HTML or XML content into Solr, properly encode special characters to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the indexed data is later displayed in a web page served by the application (indirectly related to Solr, but important for data integrity).
    3.  **Server-Side Validation:** Perform validation and sanitization on the server-side, not just on the client-side (client-side validation is easily bypassed) before sending data to Solr.
    4.  **Example (Java - Input Validation):**
        ```java
        String userInput = request.getParameter("searchTerms");
        if (userInput == null || userInput.length() > 255 || !userInput.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9\\s]*")) {
            // Input validation failed, handle error (e.g., return error message)
            return "Invalid search terms.";
        }
        // Proceed with sanitized input for Solr
        String sanitizedInput = StringEscapeUtils.escapeQueryChars(userInput); // Example sanitization using Apache Commons Text for Solr query characters
        ```
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Solr Query Language Injection (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk by preventing injection of special characters into Solr queries, although parameterization is a stronger defense.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Malformed Input (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks caused by excessively long or complex input that can overwhelm Solr.
    *   **Data Corruption (Low Severity):** Reduces the risk of data corruption within Solr due to unexpected or malformed input during indexing.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Indirect (Low Severity):** If indexed data in Solr is displayed without proper output encoding, sanitization during indexing can reduce the risk of storing XSS payloads in Solr.
*   **Impact:** Medium reduction for Solr Query Injection and DoS; Low reduction for data corruption and indirect XSS. Validation and sanitization are important defense-in-depth measures when interacting with Solr.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation (e.g., length checks) is present in some input fields used with Solr. Sanitization for Solr is inconsistently applied, and not all input fields are thoroughly validated before being sent to Solr.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization needs to be implemented for all user inputs used with Solr, both for querying and indexing.
    *   A centralized input validation and sanitization library or utility functions should be created to ensure consistency and reusability when dealing with Solr input.
    *   Specific validation rules and sanitization methods need to be defined for each input field based on its expected data type and usage within Solr.
    *   Regularly review and update validation rules to address new attack vectors and evolving security best practices related to Solr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Secure VelocityResponseWriter](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_secure_velocityresponsewriter.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable or Secure VelocityResponseWriter
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Check `solrconfig.xml`:** Examine your `solrconfig.xml` file for any `<queryResponseWriter>` configurations that use `VelocityResponseWriter`.
    2.  **Disable (Recommended):** If `VelocityResponseWriter` is not essential for your application's interaction with Solr, disable it by commenting out or removing its configuration in `solrconfig.xml`.
        ```xml
        <!--
        <queryResponseWriter name="velocity" class="solr.VelocityResponseWriter">
          <str name="template.base.dir">...</str>
        </queryResponseWriter>
        -->
        ```
    3.  **Secure (If Required):** If you must use `VelocityResponseWriter` in Solr, implement the following security measures:
        *   **Restrict Access:** Use Solr's authentication and authorization mechanisms to strictly control access to endpoints that use `VelocityResponseWriter`. Limit access to only trusted administrators interacting with Solr.
        *   **Template Directory Restriction:** Configure `<str name="template.base.dir">` to point to a directory that is strictly controlled and only contains trusted Velocity templates used by Solr. Prevent uploading or modifying templates by untrusted users.
        *   **Disable External Access:** Ensure that the template directory used by Solr is not accessible from the web or any untrusted network.
        *   **Input Sanitization in Templates:** If Velocity templates process any user input, rigorously sanitize and validate that input within the templates to prevent injection vulnerabilities within the template processing itself in Solr. However, avoid using user input in Velocity templates if possible.
    4.  **Restart Solr:** After making changes to `solrconfig.xml`, restart your Solr instance for the changes to take effect.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):**  `VelocityResponseWriter` in Solr, if misconfigured or accessible to attackers, can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the Solr server. This is a critical vulnerability within Solr.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for RCE if disabled. If secured, the risk is reduced, but proper configuration and ongoing vigilance are crucial. Disabling is the most effective mitigation for this Solr-specific vulnerability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in development and staging environments. `VelocityResponseWriter` is disabled by commenting out its configuration in `solrconfig.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Verification is needed to ensure `VelocityResponseWriter` is also disabled in the production environment's `solrconfig.xml`.
    *   Documentation should be updated to explicitly state that `VelocityResponseWriter` is disabled for security reasons and should only be enabled with extreme caution and proper security measures if absolutely necessary for Solr functionality.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure DataImportHandler (DIH)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_dataimporthandler__dih_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure DataImportHandler (DIH)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Access to DIH Endpoints:** Use Solr's authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to DIH endpoints (e.g., `/solr/core_name/dataimport`). Only authorized users or applications should be able to trigger data imports into Solr.
    2.  **Secure DIH Configuration:**
        *   **Validate Configuration Sources:** If DIH configurations are loaded from external sources (e.g., URLs), ensure these sources are trusted and properly secured (HTTPS) for Solr.
        *   **Limit Data Sources:** Restrict DIH to only import data from trusted and necessary data sources into Solr. Avoid allowing DIH to import data from arbitrary or untrusted URLs or file paths.
        *   **Disable Script Transformers (If Unnecessary):**  Script transformers in DIH (using scripting languages like JavaScript or Python) can be a significant RCE risk if not carefully controlled within Solr. If script transformers are not essential, disable them by removing or commenting out `<script>` transformers in your DIH configuration in `solrconfig.xml`.
        *   **Sanitize DIH Configuration:** If DIH configurations are dynamically generated or include user input, carefully sanitize and validate the configuration to prevent injection vulnerabilities in the DIH configuration itself within Solr.
    3.  **Input Validation for Data Sources:** If DIH imports data from external sources into Solr, implement robust input validation and sanitization on the data being imported to prevent malicious data from being indexed in Solr.
    4.  **Regularly Review DIH Configurations:** Periodically review DIH configurations in `solrconfig.xml` to ensure they are still secure and necessary for Solr. Remove or disable any unnecessary or insecure configurations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) through DIH Script Transformers (Critical Severity):**  Script transformers in DIH within Solr can be exploited for RCE if attackers can control DIH configuration or data sources used by Solr.
    *   **Data Injection/Manipulation through DIH (High Severity):** Attackers might be able to inject or manipulate data during the import process into Solr if DIH configurations or data sources are compromised.
    *   **Information Disclosure through DIH Configuration (Medium Severity):**  DIH configurations in Solr might contain sensitive information (e.g., database credentials) if not properly secured.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for RCE and data injection if DIH is properly secured within Solr. Medium reduction for information disclosure. Securing DIH is crucial if it's used in Solr.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Access to DIH endpoints is restricted to authenticated users in development and staging environments. However, script transformers are still enabled in some DIH configurations within Solr.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Access to DIH endpoints needs to be restricted in the production environment as well within Solr.
    *   Script transformers in DIH configurations should be reviewed and disabled if not strictly necessary in all environments within Solr.
    *   A thorough review of all DIH configurations is needed to ensure they are secure and follow best practices for Solr.
    *   Documentation should be created to guide developers on secure DIH configuration and usage within Solr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Access to Admin UI and API](./mitigation_strategies/control_access_to_admin_ui_and_api.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control Access to Admin UI and API
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to Solr's Admin UI (`/solr/admin/`) and API endpoints. This is covered in Mitigation Strategies 1 and 2.
    2.  **Network Segmentation:**  Place Solr servers in a secured network segment, isolated from public networks and untrusted zones. Use firewalls to restrict network access to Solr ports (default 8983) to only authorized networks and IP addresses.
    3.  **Disable Remote Access (If Possible):** If remote access to the Admin UI and API is not required for external management of Solr, disable it by configuring firewalls or network access control lists (ACLs) to only allow access from specific internal management networks or jump hosts.
    4.  **Use VPN or SSH Tunneling:** For remote administrative access to Solr, require the use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or SSH tunneling to establish a secure and encrypted connection to the Solr server. Avoid exposing the Admin UI and API directly to the public internet.
    5.  **Regularly Review Access Logs:** Monitor access logs for the Admin UI and API for any suspicious or unauthorized access attempts to Solr administration.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing Solr's administrative interface and performing administrative tasks, potentially leading to system compromise of Solr.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers modifying Solr configurations through the Admin UI or API, which could lead to security vulnerabilities or service disruption of Solr.
    *   **Information Disclosure through Admin UI/API (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from gaining sensitive information about the Solr instance, configuration, or data through the Admin UI or API.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for unauthorized administrative access and configuration tampering; Medium reduction for information disclosure. Controlling access to Solr's admin interfaces is a critical security measure.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Authentication is enabled for the Admin UI in development and staging. Network segmentation is in place, but specific firewall rules for Solr ports might need review.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authentication and authorization need to be fully implemented and enforced for the Admin UI and API in the production environment of Solr.
    *   Firewall rules for Solr ports should be reviewed and hardened to restrict access to only necessary networks and IP addresses in all environments.
    *   VPN or SSH tunneling should be mandated for all remote administrative access to Solr in production.
    *   Regular monitoring of Admin UI and API access logs should be implemented for Solr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Features and Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_features_and_plugins.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary Features and Plugins
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review `solrconfig.xml`:** Examine your `solrconfig.xml` file and identify all enabled request handlers, query response writers, and other plugins within Solr configuration.
    2.  **Identify Unused Features:** Determine which Solr features and plugins are not actively used by your application. Consult with developers and application requirements to identify unnecessary components within Solr.
    3.  **Disable Unused Components:** Disable unnecessary features and plugins by commenting out or removing their configurations in `solrconfig.xml`. Examples of Solr components that might be disabled if not needed:
        *   `VelocityResponseWriter` (already discussed)
        *   `DataImportHandler` (if not used for data import)
        *   `clustering` request handler
        *   `update/json/docs` request handler (if not using JSON document updates)
        *   Any other custom or default handlers or plugins within Solr that are not required.
    4.  **Restart Solr:** After making changes to `solrconfig.xml`, restart your Solr instance.
    5.  **Regularly Review Enabled Features:** Periodically review the list of enabled features and plugins in `solrconfig.xml` to ensure that only necessary Solr components are active. As application requirements evolve, some features might become obsolete and should be disabled in Solr.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Overall Risk Reduction for Solr):** Disabling unnecessary features reduces the overall attack surface of the Solr instance. Fewer features mean fewer potential vulnerabilities to exploit within Solr.
    *   **Reduced Complexity (Overall Risk Reduction for Solr):**  A simpler Solr configuration is easier to manage and secure. Disabling unused features reduces complexity and potential configuration errors in Solr.
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium overall risk reduction for Solr. While disabling features doesn't directly mitigate specific high-severity vulnerabilities, it reduces the overall attack surface and complexity of Solr, making the system more secure in the long run.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `VelocityResponseWriter` is disabled. Some initial review of Solr features has been done, but a comprehensive review is needed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A systematic review of all enabled features and plugins in `solrconfig.xml` needs to be conducted in all environments (development, staging, production) for Solr.
    *   Unnecessary Solr features and plugins should be identified and disabled in all environments.
    *   Documentation should be created to list the disabled Solr features and the rationale behind disabling them.
    *   This review process should be incorporated into regular security audits and maintenance procedures for Solr.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Default Configurations](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_default_configurations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Review and Harden Default Configurations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configuration Review:**  Thoroughly review all Solr configuration files, especially `solr.xml`, `solrconfig.xml` (for each core/collection), and `managed-schema` (or `schema.xml`).
    2.  **Identify Default Settings:** Identify any settings that are still at their default values in Solr configuration. Default settings are often less secure or not optimized for production environments.
    3.  **Harden Security-Related Settings:** Focus on hardening security-related settings within Solr:
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Configure and enable authentication and authorization (Mitigation Strategies 1 and 2).
        *   **Network Bind Address:** Ensure Solr binds to the correct network interface and IP address, limiting exposure to unnecessary networks.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure Solr resource limits (e.g., query timeouts, max Boolean clauses) to prevent DoS attacks against Solr.
        *   **Logging Configuration:** Configure comprehensive and security-relevant logging within Solr.
        *   **Disable Default Admin User (if applicable):** If your authentication plugin creates a default admin user in Solr, change its password or disable it.
        *   **Remove Example Configurations:** Remove any example configurations or comments in Solr configuration that might reveal sensitive information or increase attack surface.
    4.  **Follow Security Best Practices:** Consult Solr security documentation and security best practices guides for recommended configuration settings.
    5.  **Document Configuration Changes:** Document all Solr configuration changes made for security hardening purposes.
    6.  **Regularly Review Configurations:** Periodically review Solr configurations to ensure they remain hardened and aligned with security best practices.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities due to Default Settings (Medium to High Severity):** Default Solr configurations might contain known vulnerabilities or be less secure than hardened configurations.
    *   **Information Disclosure through Default Configurations (Low to Medium Severity):** Default Solr configurations might reveal information about the system or application.
    *   **DoS due to Unrestricted Resources (Medium Severity):** Default Solr resource limits might be insufficient to prevent DoS attacks against Solr.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High overall risk reduction for Solr. Hardening default configurations addresses potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses inherent in default Solr settings.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some initial configuration hardening has been done (e.g., disabling `VelocityResponseWriter`). However, a comprehensive review of all Solr configuration files and settings is still needed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A systematic and detailed review of all Solr configuration files in all environments is required.
    *   A checklist of security hardening settings should be created and used to guide the Solr configuration review process.
    *   Configuration management tools should be used to ensure consistent and hardened Solr configurations across all environments.
    *   Documentation of hardened Solr configurations and the rationale behind them is needed.
