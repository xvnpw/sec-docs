Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Solr, with High and Critical risk severity:

**Key Attack Surfaces (High & Critical, Directly Involving Solr):**

*   **Description:** Solr Query Language (SQL) Injection
    *   **How Solr Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Solr's query language allows for complex searches and filtering. If user-provided input is directly incorporated into queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, it can be manipulated to execute unintended commands within Solr's context.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious query in a search field like `*:* OR id:evil' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users --`. If not properly handled by Solr, this could bypass intended search logic and potentially extract sensitive data managed by Solr or the underlying data source.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to information managed by Solr, potential for further system compromise depending on the underlying data and permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Parameterize Queries:** Use Solr's built-in mechanisms for parameterizing queries to separate code from data.
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into queries.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Limit the permissions of the Solr user accessing the underlying data.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review query construction logic for potential injection points.

*   **Description:** Malicious File Uploads via Data Import Handler
    *   **How Solr Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Solr's Data Import Handler (DIH) can be configured to fetch data from external sources, including file uploads. If not properly secured within Solr's configuration, attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., XML with embedded scripts) that Solr attempts to process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted XML file through the DIH that contains embedded JavaScript or other executable content. When Solr processes this file, the malicious code could be executed within the Solr server's environment.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Solr server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Unnecessary DIH Functionality:** If file uploads are not required, disable this functionality in the DIH configuration within Solr.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of uploaded files within Solr, including file type, size, and content.
        *   **Secure File Storage:** If file uploads are necessary, configure Solr to store them in a secure location with restricted access and prevent direct execution from that location.

*   **Description:** Insecure Configuration of the Solr Admin UI
    *   **How Solr Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Solr provides a powerful administrative interface for managing cores, configurations, and data. If not properly secured within Solr's settings, it becomes a prime target for attackers to directly manipulate the Solr instance.
    *   **Example:**  Default administrative credentials for Solr are not changed, allowing an attacker to log in and modify configurations, potentially leading to data deletion, service disruption, or the introduction of malicious components within Solr.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the Solr instance, data manipulation within Solr, denial of service of the Solr service, potential for further lateral movement within the network starting from the compromised Solr server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change all default administrative usernames and passwords for the Solr Admin UI.
        *   **Enable Authentication and Authorization:** Configure strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., BasicAuth, Kerberos) and implement granular authorization rules within Solr to restrict access to the Admin UI.
        *   **Restrict Network Access:** Limit network access to the Solr Admin UI to authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review Solr Admin UI access controls and user permissions.

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Solr Plugins and Custom Components
    *   **How Solr Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Solr's extensibility through plugins and custom components introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within these extensions that directly affect the Solr instance.
    *   **Example:** A third-party plugin used for custom query processing within Solr contains a known security flaw that allows for remote code execution on the Solr server.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability, but can range from denial of service and data breaches within Solr to remote code execution on the Solr server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Reputable Plugins:** Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources for your Solr instance.
        *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update plugins used by Solr to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Review of Custom Components:** Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of any custom-developed components integrated with Solr before deployment.
        *   **Principle of Least Functionality:** Only install and enable necessary plugins within Solr.

*   **Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    *   **How Solr Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Solr's query processing and indexing mechanisms can be resource-intensive. Maliciously crafted or excessively complex queries directed at the Solr instance can consume significant CPU, memory, and I/O, leading to service degradation or unavailability of Solr.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a series of extremely complex and broad wildcard queries directly to the Solr endpoint that force Solr to process a massive amount of data, overwhelming the server.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption of the Solr service, impacting applications relying on Solr.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the impact of Solr service disruption)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Analysis and Optimization:** Analyze and optimize common query patterns to improve Solr's efficiency.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on incoming requests to the Solr service to prevent excessive query load.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Solr server resources (CPU, memory, I/O) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
        *   **Query Timeouts:** Configure appropriate query timeouts within Solr to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
        *   **Restrict Query Complexity:**  Implement limitations within Solr on query complexity or the use of certain resource-intensive features for untrusted users.
