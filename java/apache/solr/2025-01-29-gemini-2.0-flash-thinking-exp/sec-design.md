Most important business risks associated with Apache Solr include:
- Data breaches due to vulnerabilities in Solr or its configuration, leading to exposure of sensitive indexed data.
- Service disruption caused by misconfiguration, denial-of-service attacks, or infrastructure failures, impacting business operations reliant on search functionality.
- Data integrity issues resulting from indexing errors or data corruption, leading to inaccurate search results and potentially flawed business decisions.
- Performance degradation under heavy load, impacting user experience and application responsiveness.
- Compliance violations if sensitive data is not handled and secured according to relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls and accepted risks for the Apache Solr project are based on common practices for open-source software and typical deployment scenarios.

- security control: Access control to Solr administrative interfaces and APIs, typically configured through authentication and authorization mechanisms within Solr itself or at the network level. (Implemented in Solr configuration files and deployment environment)
- security control: Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks (e.g., query injection, XML External Entity attacks). (Implemented within Solr core search engine and data processing logic)
- security control: Secure communication channels using TLS/SSL for network traffic between clients and Solr servers, and between Solr nodes in a cluster. (Configured in Solr and network infrastructure)
- security control: Regular security updates and patching of Solr software and underlying operating systems and libraries to address known vulnerabilities. (Operational procedure, documented in Solr release notes and security advisories)
- security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to Solr resources and functionalities. (Implemented within Solr security framework)
- accepted risk: Complexity of Solr configuration and security settings, potentially leading to misconfigurations and security gaps if not properly managed.
- accepted risk: Reliance on underlying infrastructure security (network, operating system, virtualization platform) for overall security posture.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by Solr, requiring ongoing monitoring and updates.

Recommended security controls to implement:
- security control: Automated vulnerability scanning of Solr deployments and underlying infrastructure to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and assess the effectiveness of security controls.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes protected by Apache Solr:
- Search functionality for customer-facing applications (e.g., e-commerce search, website search).
- Internal search applications for knowledge management and data discovery.
- Data analytics and reporting based on indexed data.
- Real-time data ingestion and indexing for operational dashboards and monitoring.

Data being protected and its sensitivity:
- Indexed data: This is the primary data protected by Solr. Sensitivity depends on the type of data indexed. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal data, financial data, or confidential business information.
- Configuration data: Solr configuration files contain sensitive information such as authentication credentials, API keys, and connection strings. Exposure of this data can lead to unauthorized access and system compromise.
- Logs: Solr logs may contain sensitive information, including user queries, system events, and error messages. Access to logs should be restricted, and logs should be protected from unauthorized disclosure and tampering.

Data sensitivity levels should be classified based on organizational policies and compliance requirements. For example:
- Public: Publicly available information, low sensitivity.
- Internal: Internal business data, moderate sensitivity.
- Confidential: Sensitive business data, high sensitivity.
- Restricted: Highly sensitive personal data or regulated data (e.g., PII, PHI), critical sensitivity.

The security controls implemented should be proportionate to the sensitivity of the data being protected.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the sensitivity level of the data that will be indexed by Solr in the target deployment environment?
- What are the specific compliance requirements that need to be met (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
- What authentication and authorization mechanisms are currently in use within the organization that Solr needs to integrate with?
- What are the performance and scalability requirements for the Solr deployment?
- What is the expected deployment environment (on-premise, cloud, hybrid)?
- Are there any specific security policies or guidelines within the organization that need to be followed?
- What is the incident response plan in case of a security breach or service disruption related to Solr?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide reliable and scalable search functionality for applications. Security and data protection are important considerations but not the sole priority.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security controls like authentication, authorization, and TLS/SSL are expected to be implemented. However, advanced security features and proactive security measures may not be fully in place. The organization has a moderate risk appetite and is willing to accept some level of security risk in exchange for agility and speed of deployment.
- DESIGN: Solr will be deployed in a distributed cluster for high availability and scalability. Kubernetes will be used as the container orchestration platform in a cloud environment. The build process will be automated using CI/CD pipelines and include basic security checks.
