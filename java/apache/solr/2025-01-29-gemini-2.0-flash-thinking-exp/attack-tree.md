## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Solr Exploitation [ROOT - CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_solr_exploitation__root_-_critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:** This is the overall goal. All subsequent paths are attack vectors leading to this compromise.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement comprehensive security measures across all areas outlined in the sub-tree. Focus on defense-in-depth.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Solr Configuration/Management Interfaces [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_solr_configurationmanagement_interfaces__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * Targeting the Solr Admin UI for unauthorized access and control.
    * Abusing Solr APIs due to lack of authentication or weak authorization.
    * Exploiting insecure default configurations that expose management interfaces or features.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the Solr Admin UI with strong authentication and access controls.
    * Implement robust authentication and authorization for all Solr APIs.
    * Review and harden default configurations, disabling unnecessary features and securing exposed interfaces.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsecured Solr Admin UI Access [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/unsecured_solr_admin_ui_access__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Accessible Admin UI + Default Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attacker accesses the Admin UI (if exposed) and logs in using default credentials (e.g., `solr:SolrRocks`).
    * **Accessible Admin UI + Credential Brute-Force/Dictionary Attack:** Attacker attempts to guess credentials through brute-force or dictionary attacks if default credentials have been changed but are still weak.
    * **Accessible Admin UI + Known Admin UI Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Admin UI itself (e.g., CSRF, XSS, or authentication bypasses in older versions).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Immediately change default Admin UI credentials.**
    * **Restrict access to the Admin UI to trusted networks or IP addresses only.**
    * **Implement strong password policies and account lockout mechanisms.**
    * **Consider multi-factor authentication for Admin UI access.**
    * **Regularly update Solr to the latest version and apply security patches.**
    * **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks in the Admin UI.**

## Attack Tree Path: [API Access Control Bypass [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/api_access_control_bypass__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Unauthenticated API Access (e.g., Config API, Core Admin API) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attacker directly accesses sensitive Solr APIs (like Config API, Core Admin API, or Update API) without any authentication required.
    * **Weak API Authentication Mechanisms:** Exploiting weak authentication methods used for APIs (e.g., basic authentication over HTTP, easily guessable API keys).
    * **Authorization Vulnerabilities in APIs:** Bypassing or escalating privileges within the API authorization system to perform actions beyond the attacker's intended permissions.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Implement authentication and authorization for all Solr APIs.**
    * **Use Solr's built-in security features (Authentication Plugins, Authorization Plugins).**
    * **Avoid basic authentication over HTTP. Use secure methods like Kerberos, OAuth 2.0, or client certificates.**
    * **Enforce strong API keys if API keys are used, and manage them securely.**
    * **Implement fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Solr.**
    * **Regularly audit and review API access permissions.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configuration Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configuration_exploitation__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Enabled JMX/RMI without Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** If JMX/RMI is enabled (often for monitoring) and not secured with authentication, attackers can exploit JMX/RMI for Remote Code Execution.
    * **Verbose Logging Exposing Sensitive Information:** Default or misconfigured logging levels might expose sensitive data (credentials, API keys, PII) in Solr logs, which can be accessed if logs are not properly secured.
    * **Insecure Default Ports Exposed to Public Network:** Exposing default Solr ports (e.g., 8983) directly to the public internet increases the attack surface and makes it easier for attackers to discover and exploit vulnerabilities.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable JMX/RMI if not needed.**
    * **If JMX/RMI is required, secure it with authentication and encryption.**
    * **Review and configure logging levels to minimize exposure of sensitive data in logs.**
    * **Secure log storage and access to prevent unauthorized log access.**
    * **Ensure Solr ports are not directly exposed to the public internet unless absolutely necessary. Use firewalls and network segmentation to restrict access.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Solr Query/Indexing Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_solr_queryindexing_functionality__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Solr Query Language Injection (SQLi-like in Solr Query Syntax) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Applications failing to sanitize user input used in Solr queries can be vulnerable to query injection. Attackers can manipulate queries to bypass security, exfiltrate data, or cause Denial of Service.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Queries:** Crafting complex or expensive queries that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to performance degradation or service unavailability.
    * **Exploiting Specific Solr Query Parser Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting bugs or vulnerabilities within Solr's query parsers to achieve code execution, DoS, or other malicious outcomes.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Sanitize and validate all user inputs used in Solr queries.**
    * **Use parameterized queries or query builders to prevent query injection.**
    * **Implement input validation on the application side before sending queries to Solr.**
    * **Implement query complexity limits and timeouts in Solr.**
    * **Monitor Solr resource usage to detect and mitigate DoS attacks.**
    * **Use query rewriting and optimization techniques.**
    * **Implement rate limiting on queries to prevent abuse.**
    * **Regularly update Solr to patch any known query parser vulnerabilities.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Underlying System/Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_underlying_systemdependencies__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Dependency Vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4j, other libraries used by Solr) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Solr (like Log4j, Jackson, etc.). These vulnerabilities can often lead to Remote Code Execution.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Underlying Java Runtime Environment (JRE) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment that Solr runs on. JRE vulnerabilities can also lead to RCE.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Embedded Web Server (e.g., Jetty if used) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If using the embedded Jetty server, vulnerabilities in Jetty itself can be exploited for RCE or other attacks.
    * **Operating System Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system hosting Solr. OS vulnerabilities can lead to system compromise, privilege escalation, and RCE.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regularly scan Solr dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.**
    * **Use dependency management tools to track and update dependencies.**
    * **Promptly update vulnerable libraries and dependencies when patches are released.**
    * **Keep the JRE updated to the latest security patches.**
    * **Keep the embedded web server (Jetty) updated. Consider using a standalone, hardened application server.**
    * **Harden the operating system hosting Solr.**
    * **Keep the OS and system libraries updated with security patches.**
