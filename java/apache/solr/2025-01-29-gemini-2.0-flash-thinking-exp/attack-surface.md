# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/solr

## Attack Surface: [Query Injection](./attack_surfaces/query_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how user input is incorporated into Solr queries, allowing attackers to manipulate query logic and potentially access or modify data beyond intended permissions.
*   **Solr Contribution:** Solr's powerful query language (Lucene syntax) and flexible query parsing are inherently vulnerable if input sanitization is insufficient.
*   **Example:**  A user inputting a crafted query string that bypasses intended search filters and retrieves sensitive data from fields they should not have access to, or using function queries to execute arbitrary code (in specific configurations).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, denial of service, potential command execution in vulnerable configurations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into Solr queries.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Query Builder APIs:** Utilize parameterized queries or Solr's Query Builder APIs to construct queries programmatically, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Data Access):** Implement robust authorization mechanisms to ensure users only have access to the data they are explicitly permitted to view or modify.
    *   **Disable or Restrict Risky Query Features:**  If not necessary, disable or restrict the use of potentially dangerous query features like function queries or script execution.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Admin UI Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_admin_ui_access.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving the Solr Admin UI accessible without proper authentication and authorization, granting attackers full control over the Solr instance.
*   **Solr Contribution:** Solr provides a powerful Admin UI for management, which becomes a critical vulnerability if exposed without security measures.
*   **Example:** An attacker accessing the Solr Admin UI (e.g., `/solr/#/`) without credentials and creating malicious cores, modifying configurations, or potentially exploiting features to gain server-level access.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Solr instance, including data exfiltration, data manipulation, denial of service, and potential server takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Authentication and Authorization:**  Always enable and enforce authentication for the Solr Admin UI. Implement strong, role-based access control.
    *   **Network Access Control:** Restrict access to the Admin UI to authorized networks or IP addresses using firewalls or network segmentation.
    *   **Disable Admin UI in Production (If Feasible):** If the Admin UI is not required for production operations, consider disabling it entirely to eliminate this high-risk attack vector.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via External File/URL Access](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_external_fileurl_access.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Solr features that allow fetching external resources (files or URLs) to force Solr to make requests to unintended internal or external targets.
*   **Solr Contribution:** Solr features like the `file:` and `url:` parameters in certain handlers or configurations can be abused to perform SSRF attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafting a request to a vulnerable Solr endpoint with a `file:` parameter pointing to sensitive local files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) or internal network resources, attempting to read data or probe internal systems.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading internal files, network configurations), internal network scanning, potential access to internal services and sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable or Restrict External Resource Access Features:**  Disable or severely restrict features that allow fetching external resources via `file:` or `url:` parameters unless absolutely necessary for legitimate application functionality.
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  If external resource access is required, rigorously validate and sanitize all input used in these features to prevent manipulation of target paths or URLs.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Firewalling:** Isolate the Solr server from sensitive internal networks and use firewalls to restrict outbound traffic from the Solr server to only necessary destinations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Solr Process):** Run the Solr process with minimal necessary permissions to limit the potential impact of SSRF if exploited.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials and Weak Security Settings](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials_and_weak_security_settings.md)

*   **Description:** Using default credentials for Solr authentication or deploying Solr with weak or disabled security features.
*   **Solr Contribution:**  Solr, like many applications, can be deployed with default configurations that are insecure if not actively hardened.
*   **Example:** Deploying Solr with default usernames and passwords for basic authentication, or failing to enable authentication and authorization mechanisms altogether, allowing trivial unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Solr instance, leading to full compromise, data breaches, and potential system takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately Change Default Credentials:**  Change all default usernames and passwords for Solr authentication upon initial deployment.
    *   **Enable and Enforce Authentication and Authorization:**  Enable and properly configure robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all Solr access points (Admin UI, APIs).
    *   **Follow Security Hardening Best Practices:**  Adhere to official Solr security documentation and best practices for hardening the Solr installation, including disabling unnecessary features and securing configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Misconfigured Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_misconfigured_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Utilizing Solr plugins that contain security vulnerabilities or misconfiguring plugins in a way that introduces new attack vectors.
*   **Solr Contribution:** Solr's plugin architecture, while providing extensibility, can introduce security risks if plugins are not carefully vetted and managed.
*   **Example:** Using a vulnerable plugin with a known remote code execution vulnerability, or misconfiguring a plugin to expose sensitive information or unintended functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data compromise, denial of service, and other impacts depending on the specific plugin vulnerability or misconfiguration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Plugin Security Audits:**  Carefully vet and audit all plugins before deployment. Prioritize plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:**  Regularly update all installed plugins to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Plugin Permissions):** Configure plugins with the minimal necessary permissions and access rights.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Plugins:**  Disable any plugins that are not actively required for application functionality to reduce the overall attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [ZooKeeper Vulnerabilities (SolrCloud Deployments)](./attack_surfaces/zookeeper_vulnerabilities__solrcloud_deployments_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the ZooKeeper cluster that SolrCloud relies upon for coordination and cluster management.
*   **Solr Contribution:** SolrCloud's fundamental dependency on ZooKeeper means that ZooKeeper security directly impacts the overall security and availability of the SolrCloud environment.
*   **Example:** Exploiting a known vulnerability in the ZooKeeper service itself to gain unauthorized access to the ZooKeeper cluster, leading to disruption of SolrCloud operations, data corruption, or unauthorized access to Solr data.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of the SolrCloud cluster, data corruption or loss, unauthorized access to Solr data and configurations, potential cluster takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for SolrCloud deployments)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure ZooKeeper Deployment:**  Harden the ZooKeeper deployment by strictly following ZooKeeper security best practices, including enabling authentication and authorization, using secure communication channels, and implementing robust access controls.
    *   **Keep ZooKeeper Updated:**  Regularly update ZooKeeper to the latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor ZooKeeper Security:**  Implement security monitoring for the ZooKeeper cluster, including log analysis and anomaly detection, to identify and respond to suspicious activity.
    *   **Restrict ZooKeeper Access:**  Limit access to the ZooKeeper cluster to only authorized Solr nodes and administrators, using network segmentation and access control lists.
