# Threat Model Analysis for apache/solr

## Threat: [Data Exposure in Index](./threats/data_exposure_in_index.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft specific queries or exploit vulnerabilities in access controls *within Solr* to retrieve sensitive data stored within the Solr index. They could leverage this to gain unauthorized access to confidential information.

**Impact:** Confidential data breach, potential reputational damage, and legal repercussions due to exposure of sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Query Parser, Search Handler, Security Plugin (if enabled).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms *for accessing Solr*.
*   Utilize field-level security *within Solr* to restrict access to sensitive fields.
*   Consider data masking or encryption for sensitive data within the index.
*   Regularly review and audit access control configurations *within Solr*.

## Threat: [Index Corruption](./threats/index_corruption.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in indexing processes or access control weaknesses *within Solr* to directly modify or delete data within the Solr index, leading to data integrity issues.

**Impact:** Data loss, search inconsistencies, application malfunction due to inaccurate or missing data.

**Affected Component:** Update Handler, Replication Handler, Core Management API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls *for indexing operations within Solr*.
*   Regularly back up the Solr index to facilitate recovery.
*   Monitor *Solr* for unauthorized changes to the index.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit insecure default configurations *of Solr* (e.g., default passwords, enabled-by-default features) to gain unauthorized access to the Solr instance and its data.

**Impact:** Full control over the Solr instance, potential data breach, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Solr Core, Admin UI, Authentication/Authorization modules (if not configured).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change all default passwords *for Solr* immediately after installation.
*   Disable unnecessary features and endpoints *in Solr*.
*   Configure authentication and authorization mechanisms *within Solr*.
*   Follow security hardening guidelines *for Solr*.

## Threat: [Exposed Admin UI](./threats/exposed_admin_ui.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to the Solr Admin UI if it's exposed without proper authentication or from untrusted networks. This allows them to manage the Solr instance, potentially leading to severe consequences.

**Impact:** Full control over the Solr instance, data manipulation, remote code execution through configuration changes or plugin management.

**Affected Component:** Solr Admin UI, Authentication/Authorization modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to the Solr Admin UI to trusted networks only.
*   Enforce strong authentication for accessing the Admin UI.
*   Consider disabling the Admin UI in production environments if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Configuration](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate Solr's configuration settings (e.g., through the Admin UI or API if not secured) to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Solr. This could involve exploiting features like the `VelocityResponseWriter` if not properly secured.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, and the ability to pivot to other systems.

**Affected Component:** Config API, Plugin Management, potentially VelocityResponseWriter.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure access to configuration endpoints and the Admin UI.
*   Disable or restrict the use of potentially dangerous features like `VelocityResponseWriter` if not required.
*   Implement strict input validation for configuration parameters.

## Threat: [Query Injection](./threats/query_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious queries using Solr's query syntax to bypass security checks or extract unintended data. This is similar to SQL injection but specific to Solr's query language.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, information disclosure, potential for denial of service by crafting resource-intensive queries.

**Affected Component:** Query Parser (Lucene syntax), Request Handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing Solr queries from user input.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for query parameters.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to search users.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Controls](./threats/insufficient_access_controls.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper authentication or authorization mechanisms *within Solr* for accessing Solr resources (e.g., APIs, data) can allow unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, depending on the level of access granted to the attacker.

**Affected Component:** Authentication/Authorization modules, all Solr APIs and functionalities.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., Kerberos, OAuth) *for Solr*.
*   Configure fine-grained authorization rules *within Solr* to control access to specific resources and actions.
*   Regularly review and audit access control configurations *within Solr*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations *in Solr* to cause a denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. This could involve various attack vectors, such as exploiting indexing processes or configuration endpoints.

**Impact:** Application downtime, business disruption, loss of revenue or productivity.

**Affected Component:** Various Solr components depending on the attack vector.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement rate limiting for API requests *to Solr*.
*   Monitor Solr resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
*   Properly configure Solr to handle high loads.
*   Keep Solr updated with the latest security patches to mitigate known DoS vulnerabilities.
