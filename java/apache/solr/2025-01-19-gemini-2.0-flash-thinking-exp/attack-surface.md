# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/solr

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Solr Admin UI and APIs](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_solr_admin_ui_and_apis.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthenticated Access to Solr Admin UI and APIs
    *   **How Solr Contributes:** Solr, by default, might not enforce authentication on its administrative interface and APIs, allowing anyone with network access to manage the Solr instance.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/solr/#/` interface or uses the CoreAdmin API to create new cores, delete existing ones, or modify configurations without any credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Solr instance, including data manipulation, deletion, and potential server takeover if features like the Config API are abused.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication and authorization for the Solr Admin UI and APIs using built-in mechanisms (e.g., BasicAuth, Kerberos) or by integrating with external authentication providers.
        *   Restrict network access to the Solr instance to only trusted sources using firewalls or network segmentation.

## Attack Surface: [Solr Query Parser Injection](./attack_surfaces/solr_query_parser_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Solr Query Parser Injection
    *   **How Solr Contributes:** Solr's query parser interprets user-provided search queries. If not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious syntax that can lead to unexpected behavior or information disclosure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a query like `*:* OR id:evil^1000000` which could cause excessive resource consumption or bypass intended search logic. More severe examples could involve function queries leading to code execution in older versions.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion, information disclosure by bypassing access controls, or potentially remote code execution in vulnerable versions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific vulnerability and Solr version)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before passing it to the Solr query parser.
        *   Use parameterized queries or the SolrJ API to construct queries programmatically, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input.
        *   Restrict the use of potentially dangerous query parser features or functions.
        *   Keep Solr updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Data Import Handler (DIH) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/data_import_handler__dih__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Data Import Handler (DIH) Vulnerabilities
    *   **How Solr Contributes:** The DIH allows importing data from various sources. If configured with untrusted sources or using vulnerable configurations, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates the DIH configuration to load data from a malicious external source that contains executable code or exploits XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Solr server, access to local files, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control and validate the configuration of the Data Import Handler.
        *   Only allow DIH to import data from trusted sources.
        *   Disable or restrict the use of features that allow executing external commands or accessing local files within DIH configurations.
        *   Ensure proper XML parsing configurations to prevent XXE attacks.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in Update Handlers](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_in_update_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in Update Handlers
    *   **How Solr Contributes:** Solr's update handlers process XML data for indexing. If not properly configured, they can be vulnerable to XXE attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted XML document to the `/update` endpoint containing an external entity definition that allows reading local files on the Solr server.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive files from the Solr server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable external entity processing in Solr's XML parser configuration.
        *   Ensure that the application sending data to Solr also sanitizes XML to prevent XXE.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Components](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_custom_components.md)

*   **Description:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Components
    *   **How Solr Contributes:** If custom request handlers, update processors, or other Solr components are developed and handle serialized Java objects, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a malicious serialized Java object to a custom endpoint, leading to arbitrary code execution on the Solr server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Solr server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization techniques and libraries.
        *   Regularly audit and review custom Solr components for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Solr Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_solr_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Solr Plugins
    *   **How Solr Contributes:** Using third-party or custom Solr plugins introduces the risk of vulnerabilities within those plugins.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code or bypass authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution, depending on the plugin and vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the plugin and vulnerability (**High** to **Critical**)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully evaluate the security of any third-party plugins before using them.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly audit and review custom plugins for potential security flaws.
