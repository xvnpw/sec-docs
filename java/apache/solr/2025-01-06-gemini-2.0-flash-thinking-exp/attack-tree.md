## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Solr API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_solr_api_vulnerabilities.md)

This path represents a broad range of attacks targeting weaknesses in Solr's interfaces for interacting with data and functionalities. It's high-risk because APIs are often directly exposed and vulnerabilities can lead to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks.md)

A sub-path within API vulnerabilities, this is high-risk due to the prevalence of injection flaws in web applications and the potential for significant impact, including data breaches and remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Import Handler Injection](./attack_tree_paths/data_import_handler_injection.md)

This specific injection vector is high-risk because it involves manipulating data at the source, potentially leading to persistent compromise and making detection more difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

This path is inherently high-risk as successful exploitation grants unauthorized access, circumventing intended security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Solr Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_solr_configuration_weaknesses.md)

Misconfigurations are common and can create significant security gaps, making this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configurations.md)

Relying on default settings is a common oversight, making this a high-risk path that can be easily exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Security Settings](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_security_settings.md)

Incorrectly configured security features undermine the intended protection, creating a high-risk scenario.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

Failing to apply security updates leaves known vulnerabilities exposed, making this a consistently high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Solr Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_solr_exploitation.md)

This is the ultimate goal and represents a critical failure of security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious query parameters](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_query_parameters.md)

While the immediate impact is moderate, this is a critical entry point for further exploitation and information gathering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in data import handler configurations (e.g., script injection)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_data_import_handler_configurations__e_g___script_injection_.md)

This directly leads to Remote Code Execution, a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target specific request handlers with known vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/target_specific_request_handlers_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution or direct data access, both critical impacts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit default credentials (if not changed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

This provides immediate, full access to Solr, a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms (e.g., API key leakage)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_authentication_mechanisms__e_g___api_key_leakage_.md)

Circumventing authentication provides full access, a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

Any path leading to RCE is considered a critical node due to the potential for complete server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in specific Solr components (e.g., VelocityResponseWriter)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_specific_solr_components__e_g___velocityresponsewriter_.md)

Any path leading to RCE is considered a critical node due to the potential for complete server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage insecure configurations allowing script execution](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_configurations_allowing_script_execution.md)

Any path leading to RCE is considered a critical node due to the potential for complete server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit deserialization vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

Any path leading to RCE is considered a critical node due to the potential for complete server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Solr Admin UI exposed without proper authentication](./attack_tree_paths/solr_admin_ui_exposed_without_proper_authentication.md)

This provides a direct and often powerful interface for attackers, leading to critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure default settings for data import handlers or other features](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_settings_for_data_import_handlers_or_other_features.md)

These settings can directly enable Remote Code Execution or data manipulation, leading to significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inadequate authentication or authorization rules](./attack_tree_paths/inadequate_authentication_or_authorization_rules.md)

This allows unauthorized access and manipulation, a significant security breach.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific Solr version](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_specific_solr_version.md)

Exploiting known vulnerabilities can lead to a range of critical impacts, including RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage public exploits for unpatched security flaws](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_public_exploits_for_unpatched_security_flaws.md)

Similar to the above, readily available exploits make this a critical concern.
