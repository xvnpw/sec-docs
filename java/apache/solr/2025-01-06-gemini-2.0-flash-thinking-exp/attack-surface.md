# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/solr

## Attack Surface: [Solr Query Language (SQL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/solr_query_language__sql__injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Solr query parameters, potentially bypassing authorization, retrieving sensitive data, or even executing commands on the server.
    * **How Solr Contributes:** Solr's powerful query language, if not handled carefully, can interpret user-provided input as executable code. Features like the `stream` handler amplify this risk.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL like `/solr/my_collection/select?q={!frange l=0 u=100}$_GET.get('cmd')}` where the `cmd` parameter contains a system command. If the `stream` handler is enabled and not restricted, this could lead to remote code execution.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, remote code execution, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data, especially in query parameters.
        * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when constructing Solr queries programmatically.
        * Disable or restrict access to potentially dangerous query handlers like `stream` if not strictly necessary.
        * Enforce strict authorization rules to limit the data accessible by different users or applications.
        * Regularly update Solr to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Velocity Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/velocity_template_injection.md)

* **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into Velocity templates used for response transformations, leading to arbitrary code execution on the Solr server.
    * **How Solr Contributes:** Solr allows the use of Velocity templates for customizing response formats. If user-controlled data is incorporated into these templates without proper escaping, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies the `wt` (writer type) parameter to use a Velocity template containing malicious code: `/solr/my_collection/select?q=*:*&wt=velocity&v.template=file:///${user.dir}/malicious.vm`.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data exfiltration.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using Velocity templates with user-provided data if possible.
        * If Velocity templates are necessary, ensure all user input is properly escaped before being used in the template.
        * Implement strict access controls on template files.
        * Consider alternative response transformation mechanisms that are less prone to injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Solr Admin UI](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_solr_admin_ui.md)

* **Description:** The Solr Admin UI, if not properly secured with authentication and authorization, allows unauthorized access to sensitive configurations and management functions.
    * **How Solr Contributes:** Solr provides a powerful web-based interface for managing the instance. If left unsecured, it becomes a prime target for attackers.
    * **Example:** An attacker accesses the Solr Admin UI without credentials and can modify collection configurations, reload cores, or even execute commands via the "Core Admin" or "System" pages.
    * **Impact:** Full control over the Solr instance, data manipulation, denial of service, potential access to underlying server resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enable Authentication:** Configure and enforce authentication for the Solr Admin UI. Use strong passwords and consider multi-factor authentication.
        * **Implement Authorization:** Define roles and permissions to restrict access to specific functionalities within the Admin UI based on user roles.
        * **Restrict Network Access:** Limit access to the Solr Admin UI to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        * Regularly review and update access control configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Data Import Handler (DIH) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/data_import_handler__dih__vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in the Data Import Handler can allow attackers to inject malicious data, access sensitive information from data sources, or cause denial of service.
    * **How Solr Contributes:** DIH facilitates importing data from various sources. If not configured securely, it can become an entry point for attacks.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious data source configuration for DIH that attempts to access sensitive files on the Solr server or execute arbitrary code during the import process.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to data sources, denial of service, potential remote code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully review and restrict the data sources configured for DIH.
        * Implement strict input validation on data being imported.
        * Avoid using file-based data sources accessible to untrusted users.
        * Secure the credentials used to access data sources.
        * Disable or restrict access to DIH endpoints if not actively used.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Replication API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_replication_api.md)

* **Description:** If the Solr replication API is not properly secured, attackers might be able to manipulate the replication process, potentially injecting malicious data or causing inconsistencies within the Solr cluster.
    * **How Solr Contributes:** Solr's replication mechanism allows for synchronizing data between nodes. If the API endpoints are exposed without authentication, it can be abused.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious replication request to a Solr replica, injecting corrupted data that is then propagated to other nodes.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistencies across the Solr cluster, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enable Authentication for Replication:** Configure authentication for replication requests to ensure only authorized nodes can participate.
        * **Secure Network Communication:** Use TLS/SSL to encrypt replication traffic and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
        * Restrict network access to replication endpoints to trusted nodes within the cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Solr Plugins and Extensions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_solr_plugins_and_extensions.md)

* **Description:** Third-party or custom plugins used with Solr might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
    * **How Solr Contributes:** Solr's extensibility through plugins increases the attack surface if these plugins are not secure.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable plugin allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the Solr server or execute commands.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, depending on the plugin's functionality.
    * **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only use plugins from trusted sources.
        * Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Conduct security reviews and penetration testing of custom plugins.
        * Implement a process for vetting and approving new plugins before deployment.
