# Threat Model Analysis for apache/solr

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection via Indexing](./threats/malicious_data_injection_via_indexing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious payloads (e.g., commands for remote code execution if processed insecurely later) into documents during the indexing process by exploiting insufficient input validation in the application's data handling before sending it to Solr.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for data corruption or further exploitation depending on how the indexed data is used by the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Solr's Update Request Handlers (e.g., `/update`, `/update/json`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Solr's built-in features for field type validation and analysis chains to further sanitize data during indexing.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Indexing Overload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_indexing_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the Solr instance with a large number of indexing requests or very large documents, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:**  Solr service disruption, leading to application downtime or degraded performance for search functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Solr's Update Request Handlers, potentially the underlying Lucene indexing engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Monitor Solr's resource usage and configure appropriate hardware resources.
        *   Consider using Solr's replication features to distribute the load.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex or Malicious Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_or_malicious_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft complex or deeply nested queries, or queries using computationally expensive features (e.g., wildcard queries on large fields, excessive faceting), that consume significant resources on the Solr server, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Solr slowdown, unresponsiveness, or crashes, impacting application performance and availability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Solr's Query Parser, Search Handlers (e.g., `/select`, `/query`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query complexity limits (e.g., maximum clause count, maximum expansion terms).
        *   Set appropriate timeout values for queries.
        *   Monitor Solr's resource usage during query processing.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Query Exploitation](./threats/information_disclosure_via_query_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** If access controls within Solr are not properly configured or enforced, an attacker might be able to craft queries that bypass intended security measures and retrieve data they are not authorized to access. This could involve exploiting flaws in filtering or permission checks.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to privacy breaches or other security incidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** Solr's Query Parser, Search Handlers, Security Plugins (if used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement and enforce robust authentication and authorization mechanisms within Solr.
        *   Utilize Solr's security plugins or external authentication/authorization providers.
        *   Carefully design and test query filters and permission checks.
        *   Apply field-level security if necessary to restrict access to specific data within documents.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Vulnerable Query Parsers or Functions](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_vulnerable_query_parsers_or_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Historically, vulnerabilities have been discovered in Solr's query parsers or specific functions that could be exploited by crafting malicious queries to execute arbitrary code on the Solr server. While these are typically patched, outdated or misconfigured instances remain vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Solr server, potentially allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, modify configurations, or pivot to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Query Parsers (e.g., the Legacy Lucene query parser), potentially certain function queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Solr updated to the latest stable version with security patches applied.
        *   Restrict the use of potentially vulnerable query parsers or functions if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Solr Admin UI and API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_solr_admin_ui_and_api.md)

*   **Description:** If the Solr Admin UI or API endpoints are accessible without proper authentication or authorization, attackers could gain administrative control over the Solr instance. This could be due to default configurations, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**  Full control over the Solr instance, allowing attackers to modify configurations, create or delete cores/collections, access or modify data, and potentially execute arbitrary code if vulnerabilities exist.
    *   **Affected Component:** Solr Admin UI, Solr Admin API endpoints (e.g., `/solr/admin/cores`, `/solr/admin/collections`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and configure strong authentication for the Solr Admin UI and API (e.g., using BasicAuth, Kerberos, or other authentication providers).
        *   Restrict access to the Admin UI and API to authorized users and IP addresses.
        *   Change default credentials immediately upon installation.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Solr Plugins](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_solr_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses third-party Solr plugins, these plugins might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability within the plugin, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, or other security issues.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Specific third-party Solr plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep all Solr plugins updated to their latest versions with security patches.
        *   Carefully vet and evaluate the security of third-party plugins before installation.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in used plugins.
        *   Only install necessary plugins and remove unused ones.
