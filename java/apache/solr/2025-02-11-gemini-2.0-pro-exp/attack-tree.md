## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Node 2.1: Velocity Template Injection (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__node_2_1_velocity_template_injection__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits vulnerabilities in the VelocityResponseWriter to achieve Remote Code Execution. This is a direct path to full system compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on usage and configuration of Velocity)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable the VelocityResponseWriter if not absolutely necessary.
    *   If Velocity is required, use a secure `uberspector` and strictly validate all user-supplied input.
    *   Ensure Solr is patched against known Velocity vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2019-17558).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Node 3.2: Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__node_3_2_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for the Solr admin interface or other components. This provides direct, unauthorized access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (unfortunately, still common)
*   **Impact:** Very High (full access)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Change all default credentials immediately upon installation.
    *   Use strong, unique passwords.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK] Node 2.3: Unpatched CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk__node_2_3_unpatched_cves.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known, unpatched Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the specific Solr version.
*   **Likelihood:** High (if not patched)
*   **Impact:** Variable (depends on the CVE, but many allow RCE or data exfiltration)
*   **Effort:** Low (often public exploits are available)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice/Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium (Easy with vulnerability scanning, Medium with logs)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Maintain an up-to-date Solr installation.
    *   Subscribe to Solr security announcements and apply patches immediately.
    *   Use a vulnerability scanner.

## Attack Tree Path: [Node 1.2: Guess/Brute-Force Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/node_1_2_guessbrute-force_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Attempting to guess usernames and passwords or using brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on password policies and rate limiting)
*   **Impact:** High (full access)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    * Enforce strong password policies.
    * Implement account lockout mechanisms.
    * Use multi-factor authentication.
    * Monitor for failed login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Node 1.4: Leakage of Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/node_1_4_leakage_of_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Finding credentials exposed in source code, configuration files, logs, or through other information disclosure vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (full access)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never hardcode credentials.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management tools.
    *   Regularly audit code and configurations for exposed credentials.
    *   Implement proper access controls to sensitive files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Node 3.1: Unnecessary Features Enabled](./attack_tree_paths/node_3_1_unnecessary_features_enabled.md)

* **Description:** Having features like the Admin UI, example collections, or unnecessary request handlers enabled increases the attack surface.
* **Likelihood:** High
* **Impact:** Medium
* **Effort:** Very Low
* **Skill Level:** Novice
* **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
* **Mitigation:**
    * Disable all unnecessary features and request handlers.
    * Regularly review the enabled features and disable anything not strictly required.

## Attack Tree Path: [Node 3.4: Overly Permissive Configs](./attack_tree_paths/node_3_4_overly_permissive_configs.md)

* **Description:** Using overly broad permissions or allowing access from untrusted networks. This includes things like allowing updates from any IP address.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Novice
* **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
* **Mitigation:**
    * Use the principle of least privilege.
    * Restrict network access to Solr using firewalls and Solr's built-in security features (IP filtering).
    * Regularly review and audit Solr configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: `3.2 -> Unauthorized Access -> 2.1/2.3`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1__3_2_-_unauthorized_access_-_2_12_3_.md)

Default credentials provide direct access, enabling exploitation of Velocity RCE or unpatched CVEs.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: `2.3 -> Direct Compromise`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2__2_3_-_direct_compromise_.md)

Unpatched CVEs can directly lead to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: `3.1 + 3.4 -> Increased Attack Surface -> 2.1`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3__3_1_+_3_4_-_increased_attack_surface_-_2_1_.md)

Unnecessary features and permissive configs make it easier to exploit vulnerabilities like Velocity RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: `1.4 -> Unauthorized Access -> 2.1/2.3`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4__1_4_-_unauthorized_access_-_2_12_3_.md)

Leaked credentials provide direct access, enabling exploitation of Velocity RCE or unpatched CVEs.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5: `1.2 -> Unauthorized Access -> 2.1/2.3`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5__1_2_-_unauthorized_access_-_2_12_3_.md)

Successful brute-force or credential guessing also grants unauthorized access, leading to the same exploitation possibilities.
