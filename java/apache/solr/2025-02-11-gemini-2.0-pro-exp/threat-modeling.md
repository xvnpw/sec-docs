# Threat Model Analysis for apache/solr

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Admin UI/API Access](./threats/unauthenticated_admin_uiapi_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker directly accesses the Solr Admin UI or API endpoints (e.g., `/solr/admin/`, `/solr/<collection>/select`) without providing any credentials. The attacker can then issue arbitrary commands, view data, modify configurations, or even shut down the Solr instance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete data breach (read all indexed data).
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Service disruption (DoS, shutdown).
    *   System compromise (if RCE vulnerabilities exist).
*   **Affected Solr Component:**
    *   Solr Admin UI (web interface).
    *   Solr API endpoints (all request handlers).
    *   Authentication and Authorization plugins (if misconfigured or disabled).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Implement Solr's built-in authentication (Basic Auth, Kerberos, etc.) using the `security.json` file. Use strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the Solr Admin UI and API to a trusted internal network using firewall rules (e.g., `iptables`, AWS Security Groups). Do *not* expose Solr directly to the public internet.
    *   **IP Whitelisting:** Configure Solr to only accept connections from specific, trusted IP addresses or ranges.
    *   **Disable Admin UI (if possible):** If the Admin UI is not strictly required for operational tasks, disable it entirely via configuration.
    *   **Use a Reverse Proxy:** Place a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of Solr to handle authentication and authorization before requests reach Solr.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Query Parameters](./threats/information_disclosure_via_query_parameters.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious queries using specific Solr query parameters to reveal sensitive information. Examples:
    *   `fl=*`: Returns all fields, potentially exposing internal or sensitive data.
    *   `debugQuery=on`: Reveals detailed query parsing and scoring information, including field names and internal structures.
    *   `facet.field=<sensitive_field>`: Enumerates all values of a sensitive field, even if the user doesn't have direct access to read that field's data.
    *   Using `terms` component to enumerate field values.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Leakage of sensitive data (PII, internal IDs, etc.).
    *   Exposure of index structure and internal field names.
    *   Facilitates further attacks (e.g., crafting more targeted queries).
*   **Affected Solr Component:**
    *   Query Parsers (e.g., `Standard`, `DisMax`, `eDisMax`).
    *   Request Handlers (e.g., `/select`, `/query`).
    *   Faceting components.
    *   Terms component.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Strictly validate and sanitize *all* user-supplied input used in Solr queries. Use a whitelist approach for allowed parameters and values.
    *   **Parameter Whitelisting:** Implement a strict whitelist of allowed query parameters and their permitted values. Reject any requests containing unauthorized parameters.
    *   **Field List Control (`fl`):** Never use `fl=*` in production. Explicitly specify the required fields in the `fl` parameter.
    *   **Disable Debugging (`debugQuery`):** Ensure `debugQuery=on` (and similar debugging options) is *disabled* in production environments.
    *   **Facet Restrictions:** Limit faceting to specific, non-sensitive fields. Control the number of facet values returned (`facet.limit`). Consider using the JSON Facet API for more granular control.
    *   **Request Handler Configuration:** Configure request handlers to restrict the use of potentially dangerous parameters.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Expensive Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_via_expensive_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits computationally expensive queries designed to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Examples:
    *   Queries with leading wildcards (e.g., `*sensitive`).
    *   Complex regular expressions.
    *   Deeply nested boolean queries.
    *   Queries with very large `rows` values.
    *   Excessive faceting requests.
    *   Joins or graph queries on large datasets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Solr server becomes unresponsive.
    *   Legitimate users are unable to access the service.
    *   Potential for cascading failures if Solr is a critical component.
*   **Affected Solr Component:**
    *   Query Parsers.
    *   Request Handlers.
    *   Caching mechanisms (if overwhelmed).
    *   Underlying JVM and operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Query Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for Solr queries (e.g., using `timeAllowed` parameter) to prevent long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure Solr and the underlying JVM to limit the resources (CPU, memory) that can be consumed by a single query or request.
    *   **Disable/Restrict Expensive Query Types:** If leading wildcard queries, complex regular expressions, or other expensive query types are not essential, disable them or restrict their use to trusted users/roles.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting (at the application or network level) to prevent attackers from submitting a large number of requests in a short period.
    *   **Caching:** Use Solr's caching mechanisms effectively to reduce the load on the server. However, ensure the cache itself is not vulnerable to DoS.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor Solr's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, query latency) to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via VelocityResponseWriter](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_velocityresponsewriter.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in older versions of Solr's `VelocityResponseWriter` to execute arbitrary code on the Solr server. This typically involves injecting malicious Velocity template code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Data theft, modification, or deletion.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Use of the compromised server for further attacks.
*   **Affected Solr Component:**
    *   `VelocityResponseWriter` (specifically, older, vulnerable versions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Upgrade Solr:** This is the *primary* and most effective mitigation. Upgrade to a recent, patched version of Solr where this vulnerability has been addressed.
    *   **Disable VelocityResponseWriter:** If upgrading is not immediately possible, *disable* the `VelocityResponseWriter` entirely if it is not absolutely required for your application. This can be done in `solrconfig.xml`.
    *   **Input Validation (if VelocityResponseWriter *must* be used):** If you *must* use an older, vulnerable version and cannot disable the component, implement extremely rigorous input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious Velocity template code. This is a *very* risky approach and should be avoided if at all possible.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits a malicious XML document to a Solr endpoint that is configured to process XML. The XML contains external entity references that, when processed, can lead to:
    *   Reading local files on the Solr server.
    *   Accessing internal network resources.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure (local files, internal network data).
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Potential for server-side request forgery (SSRF).
*   **Affected Solr Component:**
    *   Any Solr component that processes XML input (e.g., Update handlers, DataImportHandler).
    *   XML Query Parser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Entities:** Configure Solr's XML parser to *disable* the processing of external entities and DTDs. This is the most effective mitigation. This can often be done through JVM system properties (e.g., `-Djavax.xml.accessExternalDTD="" -Djavax.xml.accessExternalSchema=""`) or within `solrconfig.xml`.
    *   **Use JSON:** Prefer JSON over XML for data exchange with Solr. JSON parsers are generally less susceptible to XXE attacks.
    *   **Input Validation:** If XML input is unavoidable, validate the XML against a strict schema *before* passing it to Solr.

## Threat: [Index Corruption/Deletion](./threats/index_corruptiondeletion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the Solr index (either through compromised credentials or a misconfigured authorization system) intentionally corrupts or deletes the index data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data loss.
    *   Service disruption.
    *   Loss of search functionality.
*   **Affected Solr Component:**
    *   Update Handlers (e.g., `/update`, `/update/json`, `/update/csv`).
    *   Solr Admin UI (if write access is granted).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Authorization:** Implement strict authorization rules using Solr's authorization framework. Limit write access to the index to only authorized users and roles. Use the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy for the Solr index. Regularly back up the index data to a secure location. Test the restoration process.
    *   **Replication:** Use Solr's replication feature to create redundant copies of the index. This provides high availability and fault tolerance, allowing you to quickly recover from index corruption or deletion.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Enable detailed audit logging to track all write operations to the index. This can help identify the source of any malicious activity.

## Threat: [Misconfigured DataImportHandler (DIH)](./threats/misconfigured_dataimporthandler__dih_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfigured DataImportHandler to:
    *   Upload malicious files to the Solr server.
    *   Inject arbitrary data into the index.
    *   Execute arbitrary code (if the DIH is configured to use scripting).
*   **Impact:**
    *   System compromise (if malicious files are executed).
    *   Data corruption.
    *   Information disclosure.
*   **Affected Solr Component:**
    *   DataImportHandler (DIH).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure DIH Configuration:** Carefully review and secure the DIH configuration (`data-config.xml`).
    *   **Restrict File Access:** If the DIH is used to import data from files, restrict the directories that Solr can access. Do *not* allow Solr to read files from arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
    *   **Disable Scripting (if possible):** If scripting is not required, disable it in the DIH configuration. If scripting is necessary, use a secure scripting engine and carefully validate any user-supplied input.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all data imported through the DIH.
    *   **Authorization:** Restrict access to the DIH to authorized users and roles.
