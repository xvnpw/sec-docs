# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/solr

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization__rbac_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Strong Authentication *within Solr*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Authentication Method:** Select a Solr-supported authentication method. Prioritize Kerberos or PKI if feasible. If using Basic Authentication, *always* enforce HTTPS (this is external, but essential). JWT is an option if integrating with an existing identity provider.
    2.  **Configure Authentication Plugin:** In Solr's `security.json`, configure the chosen authentication plugin (e.g., `BasicAuthPlugin`, `KerberosPlugin`). Provide necessary parameters (e.g., realm, keytab file for Kerberos).
    3.  **Define Roles:** Identify distinct user roles within your application (e.g., "searcher," "indexer," "administrator," "analyst"). Document these roles clearly.
    4.  **Define Permissions:** For each role, define specific permissions. Use Solr's authorization framework (typically Rule-Based Authorization). Permissions should specify:
        *   **Collection:** Which Solr collections the role can access.
        *   **Path:** Which Solr API endpoints (e.g., `/select`, `/update`, `/admin/cores`) the role can access.
        *   **Method:** Which HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) are allowed for each path.
        *   **Params:** (Optional) Restrict access based on specific query parameters.
    5.  **Assign Permissions to Roles:** In `security.json`, create authorization rules that map roles to permissions. Use the `"role"` property to specify the role and the `"permissions"` property to list the allowed actions.
    6.  **Assign Users to Roles:** Associate users with their appropriate roles. The mechanism for this depends on the authentication method. For Basic Authentication, you might manage users and roles directly in `security.json`. For Kerberos or JWT, user-role mapping might be handled by your identity provider (external, but the mapping is used by Solr).
    7.  **Enable Authorization:** Ensure that the authorization plugin is enabled in `security.json`.
    8.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test all roles and permissions to ensure they function as expected. Try to access resources with different users and roles to verify access control.
    9.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update roles and permissions to reflect changes in the application or user base.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing Solr data or performing administrative actions *via Solr's API*.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Limits the scope of potential data breaches by restricting access to sensitive data based on roles.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents users from gaining access to resources or performing actions beyond their authorized privileges *within Solr*.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of malicious or accidental actions by authorized users by limiting their permissions *within Solr*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible with proper implementation).
    *   **Data Breaches:** Impact of a breach significantly reduced, as attackers can only access data permitted by the compromised user's role.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced, as users cannot elevate their privileges beyond their assigned role.
    *   **Insider Threats:** Impact reduced, as users are limited in the actions they can perform.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic Authentication with HTTPS is implemented on the staging server (`staging.example.com`).  (HTTPS is external, but the authentication is configured in Solr).
    *   Rule-Based Authorization is partially implemented, with roles defined for "reader" and "writer" on the `products` collection.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Kerberos authentication is not implemented, but is planned for the production environment.
    *   Authorization is missing for the `logs` collection.
    *   Path-based permissions are not fully implemented; only collection-level permissions are in place.
    *   Regular review process for roles and permissions is not yet formalized.
    *   No authorization implemented on development servers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Parameterized Queries (within Solr Client Code)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_parameterized_queries__within_solr_client_code_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strict Input Validation and Use Parameterized Queries *in the code that interacts with Solr*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify All Input Points:** Identify all points in your application code where user-supplied data is used to construct Solr queries.
    2.  **Use Parameterized Queries:** *Never* build Solr queries by directly concatenating user input with query strings. Instead, use Solr's parameterized query features *through your client library*:
        *   Use the client library's methods for setting the `q` parameter.
        *   Use the client library's methods for setting `fq` (filter query) parameters.
        *   Use the client library's methods for setting other named parameters (e.g., `sort`, `start`, `rows`).
        *   Use Solr client libraries (e.g., SolrJ for Java) which provide methods for safely constructing queries with parameters.  This is *crucial*.
    3.  **Whitelist Allowed Parameters:** In your application code, create a whitelist of allowed query parameters for each endpoint. Reject any requests containing unexpected parameters.
    4.  **Validate Input Types:** For each parameter, validate that the user-supplied input conforms to the expected data type (e.g., integer, date, string with a maximum length). Use appropriate validation libraries or functions *within your application code*.
    5.  **Sanitize Input (if necessary):** If you must handle potentially dangerous input (e.g., HTML), use a robust sanitization library (e.g., OWASP Java Encoder) *in your application code* to remove or escape malicious characters. *Never* rely on simple string replacements.
    6.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test all input points with various inputs, including valid, invalid, and potentially malicious inputs. Use fuzz testing techniques to generate a wide range of inputs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Solr Injection Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into Solr queries *through your application*.
    *   **XXE Attacks (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of XXE attacks by controlling how XML input is processed *before it reaches Solr*.
    *   **RCE via Velocity/RunExecutable (Severity: Critical):** By controlling input *before it reaches Solr*, reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in these components.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from using injection attacks to extract sensitive data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Solr Injection Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low/Negligible with proper implementation).
    *   **XXE/RCE Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced, although other mitigations (disabling vulnerable components) are also crucial.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The main search endpoint (`/search`) uses parameterized queries with SolrJ.
    *   Basic input type validation is implemented for the `q` parameter (string length limit).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Whitelisting of allowed parameters is not implemented.
    *   Input validation is not implemented for all API endpoints.
    *   Sanitization of HTML input is not implemented (currently, HTML input is rejected).
    *   Fuzz testing is not part of the regular testing process.
    *   No input validation on development servers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Solr Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_solr_features.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Disable or Secure Unnecessary Solr Features *in Solr's configuration*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Unused Features:** Review the Solr configuration (`solrconfig.xml`, `security.json`) and identify any features that are not required for the application. Common candidates include:
        *   `RemoteStreaming`
        *   Config API
        *   Admin UI (disabling *within Solr*, not just blocking network access)
        *   `VelocityResponseWriter`
        *   `RunExecutableListener`
        *   Update Request Processors (custom ones)
    2.  **Disable Features:** For each unused feature, disable it in the configuration. This often involves setting a configuration property to `false` or removing the relevant configuration section.  For example, in `solrconfig.xml`, you might remove request handlers or response writers.
    3.  **Secure Features (if needed):** If a feature *must* be used, ensure it is configured securely *within Solr*:
        *   **Config API:** Restrict access using authorization rules in `security.json`.
        *   **Admin UI:**  Disable it entirely in `solrconfig.xml` if possible. If not, restrict access using authorization rules in `security.json`.
        *   **`VelocityResponseWriter`:** Use a patched Solr version and consider alternatives.  If used, configure it securely.
        *   **`RunExecutableListener`:** Use a patched Solr version and consider alternatives. If used, configure it securely.
        *   **Update Request Processors:** Carefully review and audit any custom update request processors.  Restrict their capabilities using Solr's security features.
    4.  **Test Thoroughly:** After disabling or securing features, test the application thoroughly to ensure that functionality is not affected and that the security measures are effective.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RCE via Velocity/RunExecutable (Severity: Critical):** Disabling these features eliminates the risk of exploitation *through these specific components*.
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Severity: High):** Securing the Config API prevents unauthorized modifications *via the API*.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Disabling or securing the Admin UI prevents unauthorized access to system information *through the UI*.
    *   **Exploitation of Unknown Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable):** Reducing the attack surface by disabling unused features reduces the likelihood of exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities *in those features*.
    *   **Remote Streaming Exploitation (Severity: High):** Disabling remote streaming prevents potential data leaks or RCE *through this feature*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk eliminated for disabled features. Risk significantly reduced for secured features.
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Exploitation of Unknown Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `VelocityResponseWriter` is disabled in `solrconfig.xml`.
    *   `RunExecutableListener` is disabled in `solrconfig.xml`.
    *   Admin UI access is restricted via network firewall rules on the staging server (this is external, but the *ideal* solution is to disable it in `solrconfig.xml`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `RemoteStreaming` is not explicitly disabled (should be verified in `solrconfig.xml`).
    *   Config API is not secured with authorization rules in `security.json`.
    *   Admin UI is not disabled in `solrconfig.xml` on development servers.
    *   A comprehensive review of all Solr features and their security implications has not been conducted recently.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Solr Configuration Audits and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/solr_configuration_audits_and_patching.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Conduct Regular Security Audits of Solr's Configuration and Apply Patches Promptly *to the Solr installation*.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the Apache Solr security announcements mailing list to be notified of new vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Patching Schedule:** Establish a regular patching schedule for Solr. Apply security patches as soon as possible after they are released. This involves downloading and installing the updated Solr version.
    3.  **Testing Patches:** Before deploying patches to production, test them thoroughly in a non-production environment (staging, QA). This involves running your application against the patched Solr instance.
    4.  **Configuration Reviews:** Regularly review Solr's configuration files (`solrconfig.xml`, `security.json`, and any other relevant configuration files) for security vulnerabilities. This is a manual process of examining the configuration for best practices and potential misconfigurations.
    5.  **Dependency Management:** Keep all Solr dependencies (including the JVM) up-to-date. This involves updating the JVM and any libraries used by Solr.
    6. **Log Review (Solr Logs):** Regularly review Solr logs for suspicious activity. This involves examining the logs generated by Solr itself.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, depends on the vulnerability):** Patching addresses known vulnerabilities *in Solr itself*.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Severity: Variable):** Security audits can identify misconfigurations *in Solr's configuration files* that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weaknesses in Custom Code (Severity: Variable):** Code reviews can identify security flaws in custom Solr components (if any are used).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced by timely patching.
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Risk reduced by identifying and correcting misconfigurations.
    *   **Weaknesses in Custom Code:** Risk reduced by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The team subscribes to the Solr security announcements mailing list.
    *   Patches are applied to the staging server within one week of release.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal patching schedule for production is not yet defined.
    *   Regular, formal configuration reviews are not performed.
    *   Dependency management is not automated.
    *   Regular Solr log review is not formalized.
    *   No patching or security audits on development servers.
