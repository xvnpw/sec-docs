## Attack Tree Path: [[[Attacker Goal: RCE or Significant Information Disclosure]]](./attack_tree_paths/__attacker_goal_rce_or_significant_information_disclosure__.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or to gain access to sensitive information. RCE allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands, potentially taking full control of the system. Significant Information Disclosure could involve leaking database credentials, API keys, user data, or internal system details.
*   **Likelihood:** (Implicitly High, as it's the overall goal)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies greatly depending on the specific vulnerability exploited and the attacker's stealth.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Vulnerabilities in HttpCore]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_httpcore__.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on flaws *within* the Apache HttpComponents Core library's code itself. These are vulnerabilities inherent to the library, regardless of how the application uses it.
*   **Likelihood:** Generally lower than misconfiguration issues, but depends on the specific version and patching status.
*   **Impact:** Potentially Very High (if RCE is possible)
*   **Effort:** Can range from Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to Very High (for discovering new zero-days).
*   **Skill Level:** Can range from Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to Very High (for discovering new zero-days).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Can range from Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to Very High (for zero-days).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Misconfigurations in HttpCore Usage]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_misconfigurations_in_httpcore_usage__.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on how the *application* uses HttpCore. Even if HttpCore itself is secure, the application might use it in a way that introduces vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Generally higher than finding vulnerabilities within HttpCore itself.
*   **Impact:** Potentially Very High (if RCE is possible)
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific misconfiguration.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies depending on the specific misconfiguration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[3. RCE via Deserialization (if applicable)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__3__rce_via_deserialization__if_applicable___.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical vulnerability where HttpCore *itself* might be deserializing untrusted data from the network. This is highly unlikely in the core functionality of a well-designed HTTP library, but could occur in custom extensions or through severe misconfiguration. If present, it allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (in core HttpCore), but potentially higher in custom extensions or misconfigured setups.
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to High (for crafting new exploits).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to High (for crafting new exploits).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to High (for new exploits).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[3a. Exploit Known Deserialization Vulnerability]]](./attack_tree_paths/__3a__exploit_known_deserialization_vulnerability__.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages a publicly known and documented deserialization vulnerability (e.g., a CVE) in a specific version of HttpCore. This requires the application to be using an unpatched version.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (assuming prompt patching)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[3b. Craft Malicious Payload]](./attack_tree_paths/_3b__craft_malicious_payload_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a custom serialized object payload designed to exploit a deserialization vulnerability, even if it's not a publicly known one. This often involves "gadget chains" â€“ sequences of existing classes within the application or its dependencies that, when combined in a specific way during deserialization, lead to unintended code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[[5. Unsafe Deserialization (if applicable)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__5__unsafe_deserialization__if_applicable___.md)

*   **Description:** This is similar to [3], but the vulnerability lies in the *application's* code, not HttpCore itself. The application receives data via HttpCore (which is just acting as a transport) and then *unsafely* deserializes that data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (more common than vulnerabilities in HttpCore itself)
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to High (for bypassing security restrictions).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to High (for bypassing security restrictions).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (for known vulnerabilities) to High (for bypassing security restrictions).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[5a. Exploit Known Deserialization Vulnerability]]](./attack_tree_paths/__5a__exploit_known_deserialization_vulnerability__.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 3a, but the vulnerability is in the application's code, not HttpCore.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[5b. Bypass Security Restrictions]](./attack_tree_paths/_5b__bypass_security_restrictions_.md)

*   **Description:** The application might have implemented security measures to mitigate deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., class whitelisting, input validation). The attacker attempts to find flaws in these measures and bypass them.
*   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [[7. Header Injection/Smuggling]](./attack_tree_paths/_7__header_injectionsmuggling_.md)

*   **Description:** This involves manipulating HTTP headers to either inject malicious data (header injection) or to cause the request to be interpreted differently by different servers in the request chain (HTTP request smuggling).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Header Injection) to Low (Smuggling)
*   **Impact:** Medium-High (Header Injection) to High (Smuggling) - Can range from XSS and session hijacking to bypassing security controls and accessing unauthorized resources.
*   **Effort:** Medium (Header Injection) to High (Smuggling)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (Header Injection) to High (Smuggling)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Header Injection) to High (Smuggling)
