# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-core

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep HttpComponents Core Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_httpcomponents_core_up-to-date.md)

*   **1. Mitigation Strategy: Keep HttpComponents Core Up-to-Date**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Dependency Management Setup:** Integrate a dependency management tool (Maven, Gradle) and define `httpcomponents-core` (and related artifacts like `httpclient`) as dependencies with specific versions.
        2.  **Automated Dependency Checking:** Integrate a vulnerability scanning tool (OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, Dependabot) into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to scan `httpcomponents-core` and its *transitive* dependencies.
        3.  **Alerting and Reporting:** Configure alerts for vulnerabilities found in `httpcomponents-core`, prioritizing based on CVSS scores.
        4.  **Update Process:** Establish a process for updating `httpcomponents-core`, including reviewing release notes, thorough testing, and rollback capabilities.
        5.  **Emergency Patching:** Define a process for rapid deployment of `httpcomponents-core` updates for critical vulnerabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):** Exploitation of known `httpcomponents-core` vulnerabilities.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** `httpcomponents-core` vulnerabilities leading to crashes or unresponsiveness.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium):** `httpcomponents-core` vulnerabilities leaking sensitive information.
        *   **Bypass Security Restrictions (Medium/High):** `httpcomponents-core` vulnerabilities allowing bypass of security controls.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low/Negligible).
        *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
        *   **Bypass Security Restrictions:** Risk reduced (Medium/High to Low).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Maven dependency management in `pom.xml`.
        *   OWASP Dependency-Check in Jenkins CI pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`).
        *   Basic email alerting.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formalized emergency patching process.
        *   Slack integration for alerts.
        *   Regression testing suite specifically for `httpcomponents-core` updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of HttpCore Components](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_httpcore_components.md)

*   **2. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Configuration of HttpCore Components**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Connection Management:**
            *   Use `PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager` for connection reuse.
            *   Configure `setMaxTotal` and `setDefaultMaxPerRoute` appropriately.
            *   Set connection timeouts (connect, socket, connection request) using `RequestConfig.Builder`.
            *   Configure keep-alive timeouts.
        2.  **SSL/TLS Configuration:**
            *   *Always* use HTTPS.
            *   Create a custom `SSLContext` using `SSLContextBuilder`.
            *   Load trusted certificates.
            *   Disable weak ciphers and protocols (e.g., `SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `DES`, `RC4`). Prefer `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3`.
            *   Use `setSSLProtocols` and `setSSLCipherSuites` on the `SSLContextBuilder`.
            *   Enable hostname verification using `DefaultHostnameVerifier`.
        3.  **Cookie Handling:**
            *   Use `CookieSpecs.STANDARD` or `CookieSpecs.STRICT` for the cookie policy.
        4.  **Redirect Handling:**
            *   Enable redirects: `RequestConfig.Builder.setRedirectsEnabled(true)`.
            *   Limit redirects: `RequestConfig.Builder.setMaxRedirects(int)`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Critical):** Weak TLS or lack of certificate validation.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Poor connection management.
        *   **Session Hijacking (High):** Insecure cookie handling (indirectly, as HttpCore manages cookie *policies*).
        *   **Open Redirect (Medium):** Unvalidated redirects (partially mitigated by limiting redirects).

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **MITM:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low).
        *   **DoS:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low).
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced (by enforcing secure cookie policies).
        *   **Open Redirect:** Risk reduced (by limiting the number of redirects).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager` in `HttpClientFactory.java`.
        *   Basic connection timeouts.
        *   HTTPS usage.
        *   Redirects enabled with a limit.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Custom `SSLContext` with explicit cipher/protocol configuration.
        *   Hostname verification.
        *   Explicit cookie policy configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid using deprecated HttpCore APIs](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_using_deprecated_httpcore_apis.md)

*   **3. Mitigation Strategy: Avoid using deprecated HttpCore APIs**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Code Review:** Check for deprecated `httpcomponents-core` API usage.
        2.  **Compiler Warnings:** Treat warnings about deprecated `httpcomponents-core` API usage as errors.
        3.  **Static Analysis:** Use tools to identify deprecated `httpcomponents-core` API usage.
        4.  **Regular Refactoring:** Replace deprecated `httpcomponents-core` APIs with recommended alternatives.
        5.  **Documentation:** List commonly used `httpcomponents-core` APIs and their non-deprecated equivalents.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** In deprecated `httpcomponents-core` APIs.
        *   **Security Weaknesses (Variable Severity):** Inherent in deprecated `httpcomponents-core` APIs.
        *   **Compatibility Issues (Low):** Deprecated `httpcomponents-core` APIs may be removed.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Security Weaknesses:** Risk reduced.
        *   **Compatibility Issues:** Risk eliminated.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Code reviews are conducted.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Compiler warnings for deprecated APIs are not errors.
        *   Static analysis tools not configured for this.
        *   Regular refactoring sessions not scheduled.
        *   Internal documentation not maintained.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of HttpCore-Specific Input](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of_httpcore-specific_input.md)

* **4. Mitigation Strategy:  Careful Handling of HttpCore-Specific Input**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Header Parsing:** Use the strictest parsing options available in HttpCore when processing headers.  For example, use `BasicHeaderValueParser.INSTANCE` with strict parsing enabled.
        2.  **URL Construction:**  Always use `URIBuilder` to construct URLs, especially when incorporating any data that might influence the final URL.  *Never* directly concatenate strings.
        3. **Request Body Size Limits:** Set maximum request body size limits using `RequestConfig.Builder` methods related to expect-continue and header counts. This is *directly* configuring HttpCore's handling of the request.
        4. **Chunked Transfer Encoding:** If handling chunked transfer encoding, ensure that chunk sizes are validated to prevent buffer overflows or other issues. This involves careful use of HttpCore's input stream handling.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **HTTP Request Smuggling (High/Critical):** Malformed headers or chunked encoding.
        *   **Header Injection (Medium/High):** Injecting malicious headers (partially mitigated by strict parsing).
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Large request bodies.
        * **Buffer Overflow (High/Critical):** If chunked transfer-encoding is mishandled.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** Risk significantly reduced (High/Critical to Low).
        *   **Header Injection:** Risk reduced (Medium/High to Low/Medium).
        *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
        * **Buffer Overflow:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `URIBuilder` is used in `HttpClientWrapper.java`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Strictest header parsing options are not explicitly configured.
        *   Maximum request body size limits are not consistently enforced via `RequestConfig`.
        *   Explicit validation of chunked transfer encoding is not implemented.
