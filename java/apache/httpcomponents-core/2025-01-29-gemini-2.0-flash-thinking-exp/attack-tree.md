## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing/Processing Vulnerabilities - Header Injection Attacks - CRLF Injection in Headers - Inject malicious headers (e.g., Set-Cookie, Location)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsingprocessing_vulnerabilities_-_header_injection_attacks_-_crlf_injection_in_headers_-_i_3a43c26c.md)

*   **Attack Name:** CRLF Injection for Malicious Header Injection
*   **Description:** Attacker injects CRLF characters into input that is used to construct HTTP headers. This allows them to inject arbitrary headers like `Set-Cookie` (for session hijacking) or `Location` (for open redirect/XSS).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Session hijacking, XSS, Open Redirect)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing/Processing Vulnerabilities - Header Injection Attacks - Improper Header Value Sanitization - Malicious characters in header values leading to unexpected behavior](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsingprocessing_vulnerabilities_-_header_injection_attacks_-_improper_header_value_sanitiz_0df37aaa.md)

*   **Attack Name:** Improper Header Value Sanitization leading to unexpected behavior
*   **Description:** Application fails to properly sanitize header values, allowing attackers to inject malicious characters that cause unexpected behavior in the application or downstream systems. This can lead to errors, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Application errors, denial of service, information disclosure)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Connection Management Issues - Connection Pool Exhaustion - Send numerous requests to exhaust connection pool](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_connection_management_issues_-_connection_pool_exhaustion_-_send_numerous_requests_to_exhaus_33ce9614.md)

*   **Attack Name:** Connection Pool Exhaustion via Request Flooding
*   **Description:** Attacker sends a large number of requests to the application, rapidly consuming all available connections in the connection pool. This leads to denial of service as the application becomes unable to handle legitimate requests.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Denial of Service)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of httpcomponents-core - Incorrect Usage Patterns - Improper handling of exceptions and errors from httpcomponents-core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_httpcomponents-core_-_incorrect_usage_patterns_-_improper_handling_8131a6d3.md)

*   **Attack Name:** Improper Exception Handling leading to Instability/Information Disclosure/DoS
*   **Description:** Application does not properly handle exceptions and errors raised by httpcomponents-core. This can lead to application crashes, exposure of sensitive error messages (information disclosure), or denial of service if error handling logic is flawed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Low to Medium (Application instability, information disclosure, denial of service)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of httpcomponents-core - Incorrect Usage Patterns - Not properly validating input before using it in HTTP requests (e.g., URLs, headers)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_httpcomponents-core_-_incorrect_usage_patterns_-_not_properly_vali_bff8d4de.md)

*   **Attack Name:** Input Validation Failure in HTTP Request Construction
*   **Description:** Application fails to validate input (especially from external sources) before using it to construct HTTP requests using httpcomponents-core. This can lead to vulnerabilities like header injection, open redirect (if URLs are user-controlled), and other injection-based attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Header injection, open redirect)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of httpcomponents-core - Incorrect Usage Patterns - Incorrectly configuring timeouts, connection pooling, or other parameters](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_httpcomponents-core_-_incorrect_usage_patterns_-_incorrectly_confi_bac78687.md)

*   **Attack Name:** Misconfiguration of Timeouts/Connection Pooling leading to DoS/Performance Issues
*   **Description:** Application incorrectly configures timeouts, connection pool settings, or other parameters of httpcomponents-core. This can lead to denial of service (e.g., excessively long timeouts), performance degradation, or resource exhaustion.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Denial of Service, performance degradation)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Misuse of httpcomponents-core - Dependency Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in libraries used by httpcomponents-core (e.g., logging, utilities)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationmisuse_of_httpcomponents-core_-_dependency_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerabilities_50bf31f3.md)

*   **Attack Name:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in httpcomponents-core Dependencies
*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in libraries that httpcomponents-core depends on (e.g., logging frameworks, utility libraries). Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Varies - Low to Critical (RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (with vulnerability scanning tools)
