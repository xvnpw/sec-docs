### 4. Deep Analysis of HTTP Header Injection Attack Surface

#### 4.1. Understanding HTTP Header Injection

HTTP Header Injection is a vulnerability that arises when an attacker can control or influence the content of HTTP headers in requests or responses. This control allows attackers to manipulate the structure and behavior of HTTP communication, potentially leading to severe security consequences.

The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-controlled input before it is incorporated into HTTP headers. HTTP headers are separated by newline characters (`\r\n`), and the header section is terminated by an empty line (`\r\n\r\n`). By injecting these control characters into header values, an attacker can:

*   **Introduce new headers:**  Start a new header line within an existing header value.
*   **Terminate the header section prematurely:**  Insert `\r\n\r\n` to end the headers and inject content into the body, even if the application intended to send only headers.

#### 4.2. How `httpcomponents-core` Contributes to the Attack Surface

`httpcomponents-core` is a powerful library for building HTTP clients and servers in Java. It provides flexible APIs for constructing and processing HTTP messages, including the ability to set and modify headers programmatically.  While `httpcomponents-core` itself is not inherently vulnerable, its APIs can be misused by developers, creating opportunities for HTTP Header Injection.

Specifically, the following aspects of `httpcomponents-core` contribute to this attack surface:

*   **Direct Header Manipulation APIs:**  Methods like `HttpRequest.setHeader(String name, String value)`, `HttpResponse.setHeader(String name, String value)`, and similar methods in `HeaderGroup` directly allow developers to set header names and values as strings.  If the `value` parameter is derived from unsanitized user input, it becomes a potential injection point.
*   **Flexibility and Low-Level Control:**  `httpcomponents-core` is designed to provide fine-grained control over HTTP communication. This flexibility, while powerful, also places the responsibility for security squarely on the developer. The library does not enforce automatic sanitization or encoding of header values.
*   **Potential for Chaining and Forwarding:** Applications often use `httpcomponents-core` to build proxies, API gateways, or microservices that forward requests or responses. In such scenarios, headers from incoming requests (potentially user-controlled) might be directly copied or modified and then forwarded using `httpcomponents-core`. This creates a pathway for header injection if the forwarding logic is not carefully implemented.

**It's crucial to understand that `httpcomponents-core` is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used securely or insecurely. The vulnerability lies in how developers *use* the library, not in the library itself.**

#### 4.3. Detailed Attack Vectors and Examples

Let's explore the attack vectors mentioned and provide more detailed examples in the context of `httpcomponents-core`.

##### 4.3.1. HTTP Response Splitting

**Mechanism:** An attacker injects newline characters (`\r\n`) into a header value that is used in an HTTP response constructed using `httpcomponents-core`. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary headers and even the response body into the server's response.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine an application that sets a custom header based on user input in an HTTP response:

```java
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.ClassicHttpResponse;
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.HttpStatus;
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.io.entity.StringEntity;
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.protocol.HttpContext;
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.protocol.HttpProcessorContext;
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.protocol.HttpRequestHandler;

import java.io.IOException;

public class VulnerableResponseHandler implements HttpRequestHandler {
    @Override
    public void handle(ClassicHttpRequest request, ClassicHttpResponse response, HttpContext context) throws IOException {
        String userInput = request.getFirstHeader("User-Input").getValue(); // Assume user input from request header

        response.setCode(HttpStatus.SC_OK);
        response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
        response.setHeader("Custom-Header", userInput); // Vulnerable line - directly using user input

        response.setEntity(new StringEntity("Hello, World!"));
    }
}
```

**Attack:**

An attacker sends a request with the following header:

```
User-Input: Injected-Header: Malicious-Value\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<html><body><h1>XSS</h1><script>alert('XSS')</script></body></html>
```

**Resulting Vulnerable Response (Conceptual):**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Custom-Header: Injected-Header: Malicious-Value
Content-Type: text/html

<html><body><h1>XSS</h1><script>alert('XSS')</script></body></html>
Hello, World!
```

**Explanation:**

The attacker's input, containing `\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n...`, is directly inserted into the `Custom-Header`. This input injects a new `Content-Type` header and then starts the response body with HTML and JavaScript.  The browser, upon receiving this response, might interpret the injected HTML, leading to XSS.  The original "Hello, World!" body might be ignored or treated as part of the injected content depending on browser parsing behavior.

##### 4.3.2. HTTP Request Smuggling

**Mechanism:**  In scenarios where `httpcomponents-core` is used to build a proxy or client that forwards requests, header injection can be used to smuggle requests. This is more complex and typically involves manipulating headers like `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding` in conjunction with header injection to desynchronize the request parsing between the frontend and backend servers.

**Conceptual Example (Simplified):**

Imagine a proxy built with `httpcomponents-core` that forwards requests to a backend.

Vulnerable Proxy Logic (Conceptual):

```java
// ... proxy receives request ...
ClassicHttpRequest backendRequest = new BasicClassicHttpRequest(request.getMethod(), backendUri);
// ... copy headers from incoming request to backendRequest ...
for (Header header : request.getHeaders()) {
    backendRequest.setHeader(header.getName(), header.getValue()); // Potentially vulnerable header copying
}
// ... forward backendRequest using httpcomponents-core client ...
```

**Attack (Simplified):**

An attacker crafts a request to the proxy with injected headers that manipulate `Content-Length` and inject a second, "smuggled" request within the body.  The proxy might forward this malformed request to the backend. The backend server, depending on its parsing logic, might interpret the smuggled request as a separate request, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security breaches.

**Impact of Request Smuggling:**

*   **Bypass Security Controls:**  Smuggled requests might bypass frontend security checks.
*   **Access Control Violations:**  Attackers might be able to access resources they shouldn't.
*   **Cache Poisoning:**  Smuggled requests can poison caches with malicious content.
*   **Denial of Service:**  By sending malformed requests, attackers can disrupt backend server processing.

##### 4.3.3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Header Injection

As demonstrated in the Response Splitting example, header injection can directly lead to XSS if the injected content is interpreted as HTML and JavaScript by the browser.  Specifically, injecting headers like `Content-Type: text/html` followed by HTML content can trigger XSS.

##### 4.3.4. Cache Poisoning

If an application uses caching mechanisms (e.g., reverse proxies, CDNs), header injection can be used to poison the cache. By injecting malicious headers that influence caching behavior (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Expires`), an attacker can cause the cache to store and serve malicious responses to other users.

**Example:** Injecting `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` along with malicious content could cause a public cache to store the malicious response for an hour, affecting all users accessing the cached resource.

#### 4.4. Risk Severity: High

HTTP Header Injection is classified as a **High** severity risk due to the potential for significant and wide-ranging impacts:

*   **Direct Code Execution (XSS):**  Response Splitting can directly lead to XSS, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, potentially stealing credentials, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of users.
*   **Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Request Smuggling):** Request Smuggling can compromise backend servers, bypass security controls, and lead to data breaches or denial of service.
*   **Widespread Impact (Cache Poisoning):** Cache Poisoning can affect a large number of users by serving malicious content from caches.
*   **Difficult to Detect and Mitigate (if not addressed proactively):**  Header injection vulnerabilities can be subtle and challenging to detect without thorough code review and security testing.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies for Applications Using `httpcomponents-core`

To effectively mitigate HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities in applications using `httpcomponents-core`, developers must implement robust security practices:

##### 4.5.1. Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial)

**This is the most critical mitigation strategy.**  All user-provided input that is intended to be used in HTTP headers *must* be rigorously validated and sanitized.

**Key Actions:**

*   **Identify User Input Sources:**  Pinpoint all locations in the code where user input (from requests, databases, external systems, etc.) is used to set HTTP headers using `httpcomponents-core` APIs.
*   **Restrict Allowed Characters:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters for header values.  **Critically, reject or remove newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) and other control characters (ASCII control codes 0-31 and 127).**
*   **Input Validation Libraries/Functions:**  Utilize robust input validation libraries or create dedicated functions to sanitize header values.  Regular expressions can be helpful, but ensure they are carefully crafted to prevent bypasses.
*   **Context-Specific Validation:**  Consider the specific header being set. Some headers might have stricter value requirements than others.

**Example (Java - Conceptual Sanitization):**

```java
public static String sanitizeHeaderValue(String input) {
    if (input == null) {
        return ""; // Or handle null appropriately
    }
    // Whitelist approach: Allow only alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore, space, colon, period
    StringBuilder sanitizedValue = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : input.toCharArray()) {
        if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(c) || c == '-' || c == '_' || c == ' ' || c == ':' || c == '.') {
            sanitizedValue.append(c);
        } // else: Drop invalid characters - or you could throw an exception
    }
    return sanitizedValue.toString();
}

// Usage example:
String userInput = request.getFirstHeader("User-Input").getValue();
String sanitizedInput = sanitizeHeaderValue(userInput);
response.setHeader("Custom-Header", sanitizedInput);
```

**Important Note:**  Blacklisting newline characters is generally less robust than whitelisting allowed characters. Whitelisting provides a more secure and predictable approach.

##### 4.5.2. Safe Header Encoding (Consider Alternatives if `httpcomponents-core` lacks direct encoding)

While `httpcomponents-core`'s basic `setHeader()` methods do not automatically encode header values to prevent injection, you should consider encoding strategies if appropriate for your use case.

*   **URL Encoding (Percent Encoding):**  For some header values, URL encoding might be applicable.  However, it's not a universal solution for all header injection scenarios and might not be suitable for all header types.
*   **Custom Encoding/Escaping:**  If URL encoding is not appropriate, you might need to implement custom encoding or escaping logic to handle special characters in header values.  This requires careful design and testing to ensure it is effective and doesn't introduce new vulnerabilities.
*   **Consider Header Type:**  The need for encoding depends on the specific header and its intended use.  For some headers, strict validation might be sufficient, while others might benefit from encoding.

**Note:**  It's crucial to understand that simply URL encoding *all* header values might not be correct or necessary and could even break functionality.  Carefully evaluate if encoding is the right approach for each specific header and context.

##### 4.5.3. Review Header Usage and Code Audits

*   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on all instances where `httpcomponents-core` header manipulation APIs are used.  Look for patterns where user input is directly or indirectly used to set header values without proper validation or sanitization.
*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):**  Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential header injection vulnerabilities. Configure SAST tools to flag usages of `setHeader()` and related methods where input sources are not properly validated.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Perform DAST to test the running application for header injection vulnerabilities.  DAST tools can send crafted requests with injected header values to identify exploitable injection points.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to conduct penetration testing to manually identify and exploit header injection vulnerabilities in the application.

##### 4.5.4. Principle of Least Privilege and Secure Design

*   **Minimize Header Manipulation:**  Only set headers that are absolutely necessary. Avoid setting custom headers based on user input unless there is a strong and validated business need.
*   **Secure by Default:**  Design the application with security in mind from the beginning.  Assume that user input is potentially malicious and implement robust input validation and sanitization as a core security principle.
*   **Regular Security Training:**  Provide regular security training to the development team on common web application vulnerabilities, including HTTP Header Injection, and secure coding practices when using libraries like `httpcomponents-core`.

### 5. Conclusion
