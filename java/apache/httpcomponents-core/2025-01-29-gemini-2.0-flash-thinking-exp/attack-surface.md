# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-core

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTTP headers by manipulating user-controlled input that is improperly handled when constructing HTTP requests or responses using `httpcomponents-core` APIs.
*   **How httpcomponents-core contributes:** `httpcomponents-core` provides APIs like `HttpRequest.setHeader()` and `HttpResponse.setHeader()` for setting HTTP headers.  If applications directly use these APIs with unsanitized user input, they become vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An application uses `httpcomponents-core` to forward requests and sets a custom header based on user input using `HttpRequest.setHeader(userInput)`. An attacker provides input like `X-Custom-Header: value\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\n\r\nMalicious Content`. This could lead to HTTP Response Splitting if the application then sends this crafted request.
*   **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting, HTTP Request Smuggling, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cache Poisoning.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Before using `httpcomponents-core`'s header setting APIs, rigorously validate and sanitize all user-provided input.  Focus on preventing newline characters (`\r`, `\n`) and other control characters that can be used for header injection.
    *   **Use Safe Header Encoding (if available):** While `httpcomponents-core` doesn't offer automatic header value encoding in basic `setHeader`, ensure that any custom encoding logic applied before using `setHeader` is robust and prevents injection.
    *   **Review Header Usage:** Carefully review all places in the application code where `httpcomponents-core`'s header manipulation APIs are used and ensure proper input handling is in place.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Response Smuggling/Splitting](./attack_surfaces/http_response_smugglingsplitting.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting potential vulnerabilities in `httpcomponents-core`'s HTTP response parsing logic to inject malicious content or manipulate the HTTP stream. This can lead to misinterpretation of response boundaries by clients or intermediaries.
*   **How httpcomponents-core contributes:** `httpcomponents-core` is responsible for parsing HTTP responses received from servers.  Bugs or weaknesses in its parsing implementation, especially when dealing with edge cases, malformed responses, or protocol ambiguities, could be exploited.
*   **Example:** A malicious server sends a crafted HTTP response with ambiguous `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers that exploits a parsing flaw in `httpcomponents-core`. This could cause `httpcomponents-core` to misinterpret the response boundary, leading to the smuggling of a subsequent, attacker-controlled response.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, cache poisoning, XSS, information disclosure, session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep httpcomponents-core Updated:**  Immediately apply updates and security patches for `httpcomponents-core`. Vulnerabilities in HTTP parsing libraries are often targeted, so staying up-to-date is critical.
    *   **Robust Server-Side Validation (Defense in Depth):** While the primary issue is in `httpcomponents-core`'s parsing, implement server-side validation and anomaly detection to identify and reject suspicious or malformed HTTP responses before they are processed by the application using `httpcomponents-core`.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Defense in Depth):** Deploy a WAF that can inspect HTTP traffic and potentially detect and block response smuggling/splitting attempts, providing an additional layer of security.

## Attack Surface: [TLS/SSL Configuration Weaknesses](./attack_surfaces/tlsssl_configuration_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:**  Applications using `httpcomponents-core` are vulnerable if they are configured with weak or insecure TLS/SSL settings, weakening the encryption and allowing for potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
*   **How httpcomponents-core contributes:** `httpcomponents-core` relies on the underlying Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) for TLS/SSL. The application's configuration of `httpcomponents-core`'s `HttpClient` (specifically SSLContext and related parameters) directly determines the TLS/SSL security posture. Misconfigurations directly expose vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An application using `httpcomponents-core` configures an `HttpClient` to accept any certificate (`TrustStrategy.TRUST_ALL_STRATEGY`) or uses outdated TLS protocols (like TLS 1.0). This makes the application susceptible to MITM attacks, as it will connect to and trust even malicious servers presenting forged certificates or using weak encryption.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, data breaches, eavesdropping, data manipulation, loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure TLS/SSL Configuration:**  Configure `httpcomponents-core`'s `HttpClient` to use strong TLS/SSL protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher). Explicitly set supported protocols and cipher suites to secure options.
    *   **Strict Certificate Validation:**  Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled. Use the default `SSLConnectionSocketFactory` or customize it to enforce hostname verification and use a trusted `TrustManager` that validates certificates against a trusted Certificate Authority. **Never** use `TrustStrategy.TRUST_ALL_STRATEGY` in production.
    *   **Disable Weak Cipher Suites:**  Explicitly disable weak or outdated cipher suites. Configure the `SSLContext` to only use strong, modern ciphers.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of TLS Configuration:** Periodically review and audit the TLS/SSL configuration of applications using `httpcomponents-core` to ensure they adhere to security best practices and industry standards.
