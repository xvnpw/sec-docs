# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `httpcomponents-core`, provides a foundational HTTP client library for Java. It aims to offer a robust, efficient, and flexible set of components for building HTTP-based applications and services.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a reliable and performant HTTP client library for Java developers.
  - Offer a flexible and extensible architecture to accommodate diverse HTTP use cases.
  - Maintain compatibility and stability across different Java environments.
  - Foster an active open-source community around the project.
  - Ensure the library is secure and addresses common HTTP-related vulnerabilities.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could impact a wide range of applications relying on it.
  - Performance issues could lead to degraded application performance.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could make the library outdated and less reliable.
  - Compatibility problems with newer Java versions or other libraries could limit adoption.
  - Bugs or defects could cause application instability or incorrect behavior.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Security Audit - The project is open source, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented through public code repository and community contributions.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Project uses Maven for dependency management, allowing for controlled inclusion of external libraries. Described in `pom.xml` files.
  - security control: Code Review -  Likely implemented through pull request reviews within the development process, although not explicitly documented in the repository. Assumed based on standard open-source practices.
  - security control: Static Code Analysis -  Likely used by developers during development, although not explicitly integrated into a CI/CD pipeline visible in the repository. Assumed based on standard software development practices.
  - security control: Unit and Integration Testing -  Extensive test suite is present in the repository. Implemented in `src/test/java` and executed during build process.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the code base due to complexity of HTTP protocol and library implementation.
  - accepted risk: Security of applications using the library is ultimately the responsibility of the application developers.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline (e.g., SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using the library.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: The library itself does not implement authentication mechanisms, but it provides the building blocks for applications to implement various HTTP authentication schemes (e.g., Basic, Digest, OAuth). Security Requirement: Applications using this library MUST implement appropriate authentication mechanisms when required.
  - Authorization: The library does not enforce authorization policies. Security Requirement: Applications using this library MUST implement appropriate authorization mechanisms to control access to resources.
  - Input Validation: The library performs some level of input validation to ensure correct HTTP protocol handling. Security Requirement: Applications using this library MUST perform thorough input validation on data received from external sources before using it in HTTP requests or responses.
  - Cryptography: The library supports HTTPS and TLS/SSL for secure communication. Security Requirement: Applications handling sensitive data MUST use HTTPS and ensure proper TLS/SSL configuration when communicating over the network. Security Requirement: If application needs to implement custom cryptography, it should be done using well-vetted and established cryptographic libraries, not implemented from scratch.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For `httpcomponents-core` itself, the critical business process is providing a secure and reliable HTTP client library to the Java community. Failure to do so can impact a vast number of applications and services that depend on it.
  - For applications using `httpcomponents-core`, critical business processes will vary depending on the application's purpose. However, any process that relies on network communication and data exchange using HTTP is potentially at risk if the underlying HTTP client library is vulnerable.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - `httpcomponents-core` itself does not directly handle application data. However, applications using it may handle sensitive data transmitted over HTTP. The sensitivity of this data depends entirely on the application's context. Examples include:
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    - Financial data
    - Authentication credentials
    - Business-critical data

  - The library's security is crucial to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data handled by applications using it. Vulnerabilities in the library could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruptions.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the vulnerability reporting and response process for `httpcomponents-core`? (Assumption: There is a process, but details are not readily available in the repository).
  - Are there regular security audits conducted for the project? (Assumption: Likely not on a frequent schedule due to open-source nature, but might happen occasionally).
  - What static analysis and security scanning tools are used in the CI/CD pipeline? (Assumption: Some basic checks are in place, but details are not explicitly documented).
  - Are there specific security guidelines for developers contributing to the project? (Assumption: General open-source best practices are followed, but no explicit security-focused guidelines are documented).

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a reliable and secure HTTP client library for the Java community. Security is a high priority due to the library's widespread use.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source security practices are generally followed, including code review and testing. However, there is room for improvement in automated security scanning and documented security processes.
  - DESIGN: The C4 diagrams and descriptions are based on a general understanding of HTTP client library architecture and common deployment patterns for applications using such libraries. Specific implementation details within `httpcomponents-core` are assumed based on common practices for similar projects.
