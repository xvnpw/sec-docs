# Attack Tree Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-core

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to application data, disrupt application functionality, or execute arbitrary code on the application server by exploiting vulnerabilities in the `httpcomponents-core` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

This path focuses on manipulating the HTTP requests sent by the application using `httpcomponents-core`. The ease of manipulation and the potential for significant impact make this a high-risk area.

*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Headers**
    *   **Attack Vector: Inject CRLF sequences for HTTP Response Splitting**
        *   **Description:** An attacker injects Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF) characters into HTTP headers. This allows them to insert arbitrary headers or even the response body into the HTTP stream.
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
            *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts that are executed in the victim's browser.
            *   Cache Poisoning: Injecting malicious content that is cached by proxies or the client's browser, affecting other users.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires inspection of raw HTTP traffic)
    *   **Attack Vector: Inject arbitrary headers to bypass security checks**
        *   **Description:** An attacker injects specific HTTP headers to circumvent security measures implemented by the application or the server.
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
            *   Access Control Bypass: Spoofing headers like `Origin` or `Referer` to bypass CORS or referrer-based authentication.
            *   Other Security Bypasses: Manipulating other headers to circumvent various security checks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires understanding of application logic)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TLS/SSL Implementation Weaknesses (if used by application via httpcomponents-core)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tlsssl_implementation_weaknesses__if_used_by_application_via_httpcomponents-core_.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities in the secure communication layer if the application uses HTTPS via `httpcomponents-core`. Compromising TLS/SSL can have severe consequences for data confidentiality and integrity.

*   **Attack Vector: Force Downgrade Attacks**
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the TLS handshake process to force the application to use older, weaker TLS versions that have known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities present in the downgraded protocol, potentially leading to:
        *   Interception of communication.
        *   Decryption of sensitive data.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on server configuration and client capabilities)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires inspection of TLS handshake)
*   **Critical Node: Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (if certificate validation is weak or disabled)**
    *   **Description:** If the application does not properly validate the server's SSL/TLS certificate or allows insecure connections, an attacker can intercept the communication between the application and the server.
    *   **Impact:** This allows the attacker to:
        *   Intercept and read sensitive data being transmitted.
        *   Modify data being transmitted, potentially injecting malicious content or altering transactions.
        *   Impersonate either the client or the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on application configuration)
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (if proper monitoring is in place)
