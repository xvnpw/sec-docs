# Threat Model Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-core

## Threat: [HTTP Header Injection](./threats/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a request by manipulating user-supplied data that is not properly sanitized *before being used by `httpcomponents-core` to construct headers*. This can be done by including newline characters and additional header fields in the input.

**Impact:**
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Injecting `Set-Cookie` or `Content-Type` headers can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser.
*   **Session fixation:** Injecting a specific `Cookie` header can force a user to use a known session ID.
*   **Cache poisoning:** Manipulating caching directives can cause the server or intermediary caches to store malicious responses.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.hc.core5.http.HttpRequest` (specifically header manipulation during request construction).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input validation:** Strictly validate and sanitize all user-supplied data *before* using it to construct HTTP headers with `httpcomponents-core`.
*   **Use parameterized requests or dedicated header-setting methods:** Avoid directly concatenating user input into header strings when using the library's API.

## Threat: [Insufficient Certificate Validation](./threats/insufficient_certificate_validation.md)

**Description:** If the application doesn't configure `httpcomponents-core` to perform proper SSL/TLS certificate validation, it can be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker can intercept communication by presenting a fraudulent certificate.

**Impact:**
*   **Confidentiality breach:** Sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS can be intercepted and read by the attacker.
*   **Integrity compromise:** The attacker can modify data in transit without the client or server knowing.
*   **Authentication bypass:** The attacker can impersonate the legitimate server.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.hc.client5.http.ssl.SSLConnectionSocketFactory` and related classes involved in SSL/TLS configuration within `httpcomponents-core`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Configure proper SSL/TLS context:** Ensure that `SSLConnectionSocketFactory` is configured to validate server certificates against a trusted certificate authority (CA).
*   **Avoid disabling certificate validation:** Never disable certificate validation in production environments when configuring `httpcomponents-core`.
*   **Consider certificate pinning:** For highly sensitive applications, consider certificate pinning when configuring `httpcomponents-core` to further restrict accepted certificates.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS Protocol Negotiation](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ssltls_protocol_negotiation.md)

**Description:** Using outdated or insecure SSL/TLS protocols or cipher suites *when configuring `httpcomponents-core`* can expose the application to various attacks like POODLE, BEAST, or downgrade attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Confidentiality breach:** Attackers can exploit weaknesses in older protocols or cipher suites to decrypt communication.
*   **Integrity compromise:** Attackers might be able to modify data in transit.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.hc.client5.http.ssl.SSLConnectionSocketFactory` and related classes involved in SSL/TLS configuration within `httpcomponents-core`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Configure secure protocols and cipher suites:** Configure `SSLConnectionSocketFactory` to use only strong and up-to-date TLS protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) and secure cipher suites within `httpcomponents-core`.
*   **Disable insecure protocols and cipher suites:** Explicitly disable older and vulnerable protocols like SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 when configuring `httpcomponents-core`.

## Threat: [Use of Deprecated or Vulnerable Versions of `httpcomponents-core`](./threats/use_of_deprecated_or_vulnerable_versions_of__httpcomponents-core_.md)

**Description:** Using outdated versions of the library exposes the application to known vulnerabilities that have been fixed in later versions *within `httpcomponents-core` itself*.

**Impact:**
*   **Various security vulnerabilities:** Depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version, attackers could exploit them to compromise the application.

**Affected Component:** The entire `httpcomponents-core` library.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the known vulnerabilities).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep `httpcomponents-core` updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version.
*   **Monitor security advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities affecting `httpcomponents-core`.
*   **Use dependency management tools:** Utilize tools like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and easily update `httpcomponents-core`.
