## Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: HTTP Response Splitting via Header Injection

**Vulnerability Deep Dive:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the application's implicit trust of data received from an upstream server, specifically HTTP response headers. `httpcomponents-core` provides the means to access these headers, which is necessary for many legitimate use cases (e.g., caching, proxying). However, if the application directly copies or forwards these headers without proper scrutiny, it opens a pathway for attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.

**How `httpcomponents-core` Facilitates the Attack:**

`httpcomponents-core` provides access to response headers through objects like `HttpResponse`. Methods like `getAllHeaders()`, `getFirstHeader(String)`, and `getHeaders(String)` allow the application to retrieve header information. The vulnerability arises when the application takes the *values* of these headers and directly inserts them into its own outgoing HTTP response headers.

**Detailed Attack Scenario:**

1. **Attacker Manipulation of Upstream Server:** The attacker controls or influences the upstream server that the application interacts with.
2. **Crafting a Malicious Upstream Response:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP response from the upstream server. This response includes a header with carefully crafted content containing control characters (`\r` for carriage return and `\n` for line feed), which are used to delimit HTTP headers.
3. **Example Malicious Header:**  As provided in the description, a malicious header might look like:
    ```
    X-Custom-Value: malicious\r\nSet-Cookie: attacker=evil\r\nContent-Type: text/html
    ```
4. **Application Processing with `httpcomponents-core`:** The application uses `httpcomponents-core` to receive the response from the upstream server. It retrieves the `X-Custom-Value` header using methods provided by the library.
5. **Vulnerable Header Inclusion:** The application, without proper sanitization, takes the value of `X-Custom-Value` and includes it in its own response header. For example:
    ```java
    HttpResponse upstreamResponse = httpClient.execute(httpGet);
    Header customHeader = upstreamResponse.getFirstHeader("X-Custom-Value");
    if (customHeader != null) {
        httpResponse.setHeader("Custom-Forwarded-Header", customHeader.getValue()); // Vulnerable line
    }
    ```
6. **HTTP Response Splitting:** Due to the injected `\r\n` sequences, the single `Custom-Forwarded-Header` is interpreted by the client browser as multiple headers:
    ```
    Custom-Forwarded-Header: malicious
    Set-Cookie: attacker=evil
    Content-Type: text/html
    ```
7. **Exploitation:** The injected headers can be used for various malicious purposes:
    *   **Setting Arbitrary Cookies:** The `Set-Cookie` header allows the attacker to set cookies in the user's browser under the application's domain. This can be used for session fixation, tracking, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Injecting HTML Content (XSS):** By injecting headers like `Content-Type: text/html` followed by HTML content, the attacker can potentially inject arbitrary HTML into the response body, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **Manipulating Response Behavior:** Attackers can inject other headers to manipulate the browser's behavior, such as `Cache-Control` to bypass caching mechanisms or `Location` for redirection attacks.

**Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By injecting `Content-Type: text/html` and subsequent HTML content, attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the application's context. This can lead to stealing sensitive information (session cookies, credentials), defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
*   **Session Fixation:** Attackers can inject a `Set-Cookie` header with a known session ID, forcing the user to use that session. This allows the attacker to hijack the user's session after they log in.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers can manipulate caching mechanisms, potentially serving malicious content to other users or causing denial-of-service by overloading the server.
*   **Open Redirection:** Injecting a `Location` header can redirect users to attacker-controlled websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers might be able to inject headers that reveal sensitive information about the application or the upstream server.

**Risk Severity Justification:**

The risk severity is **High** due to:

*   **Ease of Exploitation:** If the application naively forwards headers, exploitation is relatively straightforward for an attacker who can influence the upstream server.
*   **Significant Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to severe security breaches, including XSS, session hijacking, and data compromise.
*   **Potential for Widespread Vulnerability:** If the pattern of blindly forwarding headers is repeated throughout the application, multiple entry points for this attack may exist.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and `httpcomponents-core` Specific):**

1. **Strict Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Never directly copy or forward response headers without validation.** Implement strict checks on the content of upstream headers before incorporating them into the application's responses.
    *   **Validate for Control Characters:**  Specifically check for the presence of `\r` and `\n` characters within header values. Reject or escape these characters.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define a strict set of allowed characters for header values and reject any header containing characters outside this set.
    *   **Consider Encoding:**  Encode header values before setting them in the response. However, be cautious as incorrect encoding can lead to other issues.

2. **Utilize Framework-Provided Header Setting Methods:**
    *   **Prefer using the application framework's built-in methods for setting response headers.** These methods often include built-in security measures to prevent header injection. For example, in a servlet environment, use `HttpServletResponse.setHeader(String name, String value)`.
    *   **Avoid directly manipulating the raw header output stream if possible.**

3. **Contextual Encoding/Escaping:**
    *   If dynamic content needs to be included in headers, ensure it is properly encoded or escaped based on the context. For example, URL-encode values that are part of a URL within a header.

4. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks. CSP allows you to define trusted sources of content, reducing the attacker's ability to execute malicious scripts.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically looking for instances where upstream header values are being used in the application's responses.
    *   Educate developers about the risks of HTTP Response Splitting and the importance of secure header handling.

6. **Specific `httpcomponents-core` Considerations:**
    *   When retrieving headers using `httpcomponents-core`, treat the retrieved values as untrusted input.
    *   Avoid directly using `header.getValue()` without validation.
    *   If you need to forward specific headers, carefully select and sanitize their values before setting them in the outgoing response.

**Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Vulnerable Code:**

```java
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.ClassicHttpResponse;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

// ... inside a servlet or similar component ...

ClassicHttpResponse upstreamResponse = httpClient.execute(httpGet);
Header customHeader = upstreamResponse.getFirstHeader("X-Custom-Value");
if (customHeader != null) {
    httpResponse.setHeader("Forwarded-Custom", customHeader.getValue()); // Vulnerable
}
```

**Mitigated Code:**

```java
import org.apache.hc.core5.http.ClassicHttpResponse;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import org.apache.commons.text.StringEscapeUtils; // Example library for escaping

// ... inside a servlet or similar component ...

ClassicHttpResponse upstreamResponse = httpClient.execute(httpGet);
Header customHeader = upstreamResponse.getFirstHeader("X-Custom-Value");
if (customHeader != null) {
    String headerValue = customHeader.getValue();
    // Sanitize by removing control characters
    headerValue = headerValue.replaceAll("[\\r\\n]", "");
    // Or, more robustly, whitelist allowed characters
    if (headerValue.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9-]+")) {
        httpResponse.setHeader("Forwarded-Custom", headerValue);
    } else {
        // Log the potentially malicious header and do not forward
        System.err.println("Potentially malicious header value detected: " + headerValue);
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:**

The HTTP Response Splitting via Header Injection vulnerability is a significant risk for applications using `httpcomponents-core` if they blindly trust and forward upstream response headers. By understanding how `httpcomponents-core` provides access to these headers and implementing robust validation, sanitization, and secure coding practices, development teams can effectively mitigate this attack surface and protect their applications and users. Prioritizing the use of framework-provided header setting methods and incorporating security audits into the development lifecycle are crucial steps in preventing this vulnerability.
