# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-core

## Attack Surface: [Malformed HTTP Header Processing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_http_header_processing.md)

**Description:** The application using `httpcomponents-core` receives and processes HTTP headers from external sources. Malformed or excessively large headers can lead to vulnerabilities.

**How httpcomponents-core Contributes:** The library is responsible for parsing and interpreting these headers. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic or lack of robust size limits can be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious server sends a response with a header like `X-Custom-Header: ` followed by an extremely long string (e.g., several megabytes). `httpcomponents-core` might attempt to allocate excessive memory to store this header, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact:** Denial of service (resource exhaustion), potential for unexpected behavior or crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure `httpcomponents-core` with appropriate limits on header sizes.
*   Implement robust error handling for header parsing failures.
*   Consider using a security-focused HTTP parsing library or a wrapper around `httpcomponents-core` that provides additional validation.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Response Splitting via Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_response_splitting_via_header_injection.md)

**Description:** If the application takes header values from the upstream server (received via `httpcomponents-core`) and incorporates them into its own HTTP responses without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers.

**How httpcomponents-core Contributes:** The library provides access to the raw response headers received from the server. If the application naively trusts and forwards these headers, it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** The upstream server sends a response with a header like `X-Custom-Value: malicious\r\nSet-Cookie: attacker=evil`. If the application blindly includes `X-Custom-Value` in its own response header, it will inject the `Set-Cookie` header, potentially allowing the attacker to set cookies in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), session fixation, other browser-based attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never directly copy or forward response headers received from external sources without thorough validation and sanitization.
*   Use dedicated methods provided by the application framework for setting response headers, which often include built-in security measures.
*   Encode or escape any dynamic content being added to response headers.

## Attack Surface: [URI Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/uri_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application might use `httpcomponents-core` to make requests to external URIs. If these URIs are constructed from user input without proper validation, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

**How httpcomponents-core Contributes:** The library handles the construction and parsing of URIs for making HTTP requests. If the application provides a malicious URI to the library, it will attempt to connect to that URI.

**Example:** User input is used to construct a URI like `http://untrusted.site/../../sensitive/data`. If not properly validated, `httpcomponents-core` will attempt to connect to this potentially malicious URI, leading to information disclosure or other attacks.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), arbitrary code execution (depending on the target URI).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into URIs.
*   Use allow-lists of allowed domains or paths instead of relying on blacklists.
*   Avoid constructing URIs by concatenating strings directly. Use URI builder classes provided by the library or the platform.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** While `httpcomponents-core` relies on the underlying Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) for TLS, improper configuration when creating the `SSLConnectionSocketFactory` can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How httpcomponents-core Contributes:** The library provides mechanisms to configure the TLS settings used for secure connections. Incorrect configuration choices directly impact the security of these connections.

**Example:** The application configures `httpcomponents-core` to accept any SSL certificate without proper validation or uses weak cipher suites. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to intercept and decrypt communication.

**Impact:** Data breaches, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2 or higher).
*   Use strong and recommended cipher suites.
*   Enable proper certificate validation and hostname verification.
*   Regularly review and update TLS configuration based on security best practices.
