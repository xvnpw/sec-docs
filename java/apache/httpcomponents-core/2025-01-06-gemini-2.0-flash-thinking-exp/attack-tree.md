## Attack Tree Path: [Header Injection via Malformed Response](./attack_tree_paths/header_injection_via_malformed_response.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious server sends a crafted HTTP response containing malicious headers.
*   **Exploitation:** The `httpcomponents-core` library processes the response, and if the application doesn't properly sanitize these headers, they can be used to exploit vulnerabilities such as:
    *   Session Fixation: Injecting a specific session ID to hijack a user's session.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts that are executed in the user's browser.
    *   Other security bypasses depending on how the application uses HTTP headers.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Session hijacking, XSS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Chunked Transfer Encoding Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_chunked_transfer_encoding_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious server sends a response using chunked transfer encoding with malformed chunks.
*   **Exploitation:** Vulnerabilities in how `httpcomponents-core` parses chunked responses can lead to:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): By sending excessively large or malformed chunks, causing the library to consume excessive resources or crash.
    *   Buffer Overflows (in older versions): Improper handling of chunk sizes could lead to buffer overflows, potentially allowing for remote code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (DoS, potentially remote code execution in older versions)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Compression Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_compression_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If `httpcomponents-core` handles response decompression, a malicious server sends a specially crafted compressed response.
*   **Exploitation:** Vulnerabilities in the decompression logic can lead to:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Using "decompression bombs" (highly compressed data that expands to a very large size) to exhaust server resources.
    *   Other potential vulnerabilities depending on the specific decompression library used.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (DoS due to excessive resource consumption)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies (Indirect)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_dependencies__indirect_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** `httpcomponents-core` relies on other libraries. These dependencies may have their own vulnerabilities.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in the dependencies used by `httpcomponents-core`. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. This could range from DoS to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Varies (From DoS to Remote Code Execution)
*   **Effort:** Varies (Depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies

## Attack Tree Path: [Malformed Request Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/malformed_request_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends crafted HTTP requests designed to trigger vulnerabilities or resource exhaustion within `httpcomponents-core`.
*   **Exploitation:** By sending requests with unexpected formats, excessively large headers, or other malformed elements, an attacker can cause the library to consume excessive CPU, memory, or other resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Application unavailability)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Malformed Response Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/malformed_response_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious server sends a malformed HTTP response.
*   **Exploitation:** When `httpcomponents-core` attempts to parse this malformed response, it can lead to errors, excessive resource consumption, or crashes, resulting in a denial of service for the application.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Application unavailability)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Header Injection via Malformed Response](./attack_tree_paths/header_injection_via_malformed_response.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious server sends a crafted HTTP response containing malicious headers.
*   **Exploitation:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize these headers after `httpcomponents-core` processes the response, it can lead to vulnerabilities like session fixation or XSS. This is critical due to the direct impact on application security.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Session hijacking, XSS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
