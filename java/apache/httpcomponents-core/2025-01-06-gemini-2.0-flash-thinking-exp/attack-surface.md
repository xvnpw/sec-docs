# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-core

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection (CRLF Injection)](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection__crlf_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application constructs HTTP responses using data directly from incoming requests (e.g., reflecting a header value in a response header) without proper sanitization, attackers can inject carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`) to add arbitrary headers.
    *   **How httpcomponents-core Contributes:** It parses the incoming request headers, making the unsanitized data available to the application. If the application then uses this data to set response headers, the vulnerability is introduced.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a request with a crafted `User-Agent` header containing `\r\nSet-Cookie: malicious=true\r\n`. If the application reflects this in a response header without sanitization, the attacker can set arbitrary cookies on the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting, Session Hijacking (through malicious cookie setting), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Output Encoding:**  Ensure all data originating from user input (including request headers) is properly encoded or sanitized before being used to construct HTTP response headers.
        *   **Avoid Direct Reflection:**  Minimize the practice of directly reflecting request header values in response headers. If necessary, use a predefined set of allowed values.
        *   Utilize secure header setting mechanisms provided by the application framework or web server that automatically handle encoding.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The application might be configured to use weak or outdated TLS/SSL protocols or cipher suites when establishing HTTPS connections using `httpcomponents-core`.
    *   **How httpcomponents-core Contributes:** It provides the mechanisms for configuring TLS/SSL settings for HTTP clients. Improper configuration exposes the application to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** The application is configured to allow SSLv3 or weak cipher suites like RC4, making it susceptible to attacks like POODLE or BEAST.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive communication, data interception and manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strong TLS Versions:** Configure `httpcomponents-core` to use only TLS 1.2 or higher.
        *   **Use Secure Cipher Suites:**  Select a strong set of cipher suites that prioritize forward secrecy and authenticated encryption. Disable weak or known-to-be-vulnerable ciphers.
        *   Regularly review and update TLS/SSL configurations based on current security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Certificate Validation](./attack_surfaces/improper_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Description:** When acting as an HTTP client, the application might not be configured to properly validate the server certificates of the remote hosts it connects to via HTTPS using `httpcomponents-core`.
    *   **How httpcomponents-core Contributes:** It handles the certificate validation process based on the configured SSL context. Incorrect configuration bypasses or weakens this validation.
    *   **Example:** The application is configured to trust all certificates, even self-signed or expired ones, allowing an attacker to perform a MITM attack with a fraudulent certificate.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, interception of sensitive data sent to remote servers, potential for data injection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Default or Strict Certificate Validation:** Rely on the default certificate validation mechanisms or configure a truststore with the necessary Certificate Authorities (CAs).
        *   **Avoid Trusting All Certificates:** Never configure the application to blindly trust all certificates.
        *   Implement certificate pinning for critical connections if the set of expected server certificates is known and stable.
