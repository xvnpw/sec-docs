# Threat Model Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-core

## Threat: [Server Spoofing via Trust Manager Misconfiguration](./threats/server_spoofing_via_trust_manager_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker sets up a malicious server presenting a fraudulent or self-signed certificate. If the application uses a custom `TrustManager` that doesn't properly validate certificates or is misconfigured to trust all certificates, the application will establish a connection with the malicious server, believing it to be legitimate. The attacker can then intercept or manipulate communication.

**Impact:** Confidential data sent by the application can be intercepted by the attacker. The attacker can also send malicious data to the application, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLConnectionSocketFactory`, `javax.net.ssl.TrustManager` (when custom implementation is used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust certificate validation in custom `TrustManager` implementations. Prefer using the default system trust store. Consider certificate pinning for critical connections. Regularly update the trust store.

## Threat: [Client Spoofing via Incorrect Authentication Handling](./threats/client_spoofing_via_incorrect_authentication_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to legitimate client credentials (e.g., through phishing or a compromised system) and uses them with the application's `CredentialsProvider` or authentication handling logic built on top of HttpComponents Core. This allows the attacker to impersonate a legitimate client and access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, manipulation of data on behalf of the legitimate client.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.http.client.CredentialsProvider`, specific authentication schemes used (e.g., `BasicAuthCache`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Securely store and manage client credentials. Implement multi-factor authentication where possible. Enforce strong password policies. Monitor for suspicious activity and credential usage.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks due to Insecure TLS Configuration](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_due_to_insecure_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application and a server. If the application doesn't enforce HTTPS or uses weak TLS configurations (e.g., allowing insecure protocols or cipher suites) when making requests using HttpComponents Core, the attacker can decrypt and potentially modify the traffic.

**Impact:** Confidential data can be intercepted and read. Data in transit can be modified, leading to data corruption or malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLConnectionSocketFactory`, `org.apache.http.client.HttpClient` configuration related to TLS/SSL.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enforce HTTPS for all sensitive communication. Configure `SSLConnectionSocketFactory` to use strong TLS protocols and cipher suites. Disable insecure protocols (like SSLv3). Consider using HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) on the server-side.

## Threat: [Cookie Manipulation via Insecure Cookie Management](./threats/cookie_manipulation_via_insecure_cookie_management.md)

**Description:** If the application uses HttpComponents Core to handle cookies and doesn't properly set security attributes like `HttpOnly` or `Secure` when receiving or sending cookies, an attacker could potentially manipulate cookies. This could involve stealing session cookies (if `HttpOnly` is not set), or intercepting cookies over insecure connections (if `Secure` is not set).

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive information stored in cookies.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.http.client.CookieStore`, `org.apache.http.cookie.CookieSpec`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure that `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are set for sensitive cookies. Use HTTPS to protect cookies in transit. Implement proper session management techniques.
