## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Zookeeper Directly](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_zookeeper_directly.md)

This path encompasses attacks that directly target the Zookeeper service itself, bypassing the application's logic. Successful exploitation grants the attacker significant control over Zookeeper, impacting all dependent applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Zookeeper Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_zookeeper_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Zookeeper being used. They then find or develop exploit code and leverage network access to execute the exploit, potentially gaining full control over the Zookeeper instance.
    * Identify Known Vulnerability (CVE)
    * Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability Exists
    * Exploit Code Available
    * Target Zookeeper Version is Vulnerable
    * Network Access to Zookeeper
    * Execute Exploit

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Zookeeper Authentication/Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_zookeeper_authenticationauthorization.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how Zookeeper authenticates and authorizes access. Success allows attackers to interact with Zookeeper without proper credentials or with elevated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to log in to Zookeeper using default usernames and passwords that were not changed after installation. This provides immediate, unauthorized access.
    * Default Credentials Not Changed
    * Attempt Default Credentials

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Passwords](./attack_tree_paths/weak_passwords.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers use brute-force or dictionary attacks to guess weak passwords used for Zookeeper authentication. Successful attempts grant unauthorized access.
    * Brute-force/Dictionary Attack
    * Network Access to Zookeeper
    * Attempt Password Combinations

## Attack Tree Path: [Network-Based Attacks on Zookeeper](./attack_tree_paths/network-based_attacks_on_zookeeper.md)

This path involves exploiting network protocols and configurations to attack Zookeeper.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Zookeeper](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attack_on_zookeeper.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers overwhelm the Zookeeper service with excessive requests or malformed packets, causing it to become unavailable and disrupting dependent applications.
    * Resource Exhaustion
        * Send Excessive Requests
        * Network Access to Zookeeper

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Use of Zookeeper](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_use_of_zookeeper.md)

This path focuses on exploiting how the application interacts with Zookeeper, even if Zookeeper itself is secure. Attackers manipulate data or features used by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Manipulation in Zookeeper](./attack_tree_paths/data_manipulation_in_zookeeper.md)

This path involves attackers gaining the ability to modify data stored in Zookeeper, directly impacting the application's behavior and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/modify_configuration_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain write access to Zookeeper nodes containing application configuration data and alter these values. This can lead to application malfunction, security breaches, or other unintended consequences.
    * **Critical Node: Gain Write Access to Configuration Nodes** - This is a prerequisite for modifying configuration data and highlights the importance of access control.
        * Exploit Zookeeper Weakness (see above) OR Application Misconfiguration
        * Alter Configuration Values
        * Application Reads Modified Configuration

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain write access to Zookeeper nodes used for storing application data and inject malicious payloads. When the application processes this data, it can lead to various vulnerabilities like code injection or data corruption.
    * **Critical Node: Gain Write Access to Data Nodes** -  This is a prerequisite for data injection and emphasizes the need for strong access controls.
        * Exploit Zookeeper Weakness (see above) OR Application Misconfiguration
        * Inject Malicious Payloads
        * Application Processes Malicious Data

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Create Access (within Abuse of Zookeeper Features - Node Flooding)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_create_access__within_abuse_of_zookeeper_features_-_node_flooding_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain the ability to create nodes in Zookeeper and exploit this by creating an excessive number of nodes (node flooding). This can degrade Zookeeper's performance, impacting the application's availability and stability.
    * Exploit Zookeeper Weakness (see above) OR Application Misconfiguration
    * Create Excessive Number of Nodes
    * Degrade Zookeeper Performance
    * Impact Application Availability
