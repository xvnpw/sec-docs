# Threat Model Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Zookeeper Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_zookeeper_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weak or default credentials, or a vulnerability in Zookeeper's authentication mechanism, to gain unauthorized access to the Zookeeper ensemble. This allows them to read sensitive configuration data, service discovery information, or distributed lock details by using readily available Zookeeper client libraries or crafting custom network requests.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application configurations (database credentials, API keys), disruption of service discovery leading to application failures, manipulation of leader election processes, and interference with distributed locking mechanisms causing deadlocks or race conditions.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, Authorization module (ACLs), Network communication layer.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication using Kerberos or SASL.
    *   Configure granular Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to specific znodes based on user or application identity.
    *   Regularly review and update Zookeeper access credentials.
    *   Ensure secure network communication between clients and the Zookeeper ensemble using TLS/SSL.

## Threat: [Data Tampering in Zookeeper](./threats/data_tampering_in_zookeeper.md)

*   **Description:** After gaining unauthorized access or exploiting a vulnerability in Zookeeper, an attacker could modify data stored within Zookeeper znodes. This could involve changing configuration settings, altering service registration information, or manipulating lock states using Zookeeper client commands or direct API calls.
*   **Impact:** Application misconfiguration leading to unexpected behavior or failures, redirection of service calls to malicious endpoints, creation of phantom services, and deadlocks or race conditions due to manipulated lock data, potentially causing data corruption or inconsistency.
*   **Affected Component:** Data storage layer (ZNodes), Write request processing, Authorization module (ACLs).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization as mentioned above.
    *   Enforce strict data validation on any data written to Zookeeper.
    *   Consider using Zookeeper's audit logging feature to track data modifications.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unexpected changes in Zookeeper data.

## Threat: [Zookeeper Ensemble Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/zookeeper_ensemble_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could flood the Zookeeper ensemble with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network). This could be achieved by exploiting a lack of request rate limiting within Zookeeper or by leveraging compromised client connections.
*   **Impact:** The Zookeeper ensemble becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to a complete application outage as core functionalities like configuration retrieval, service discovery, and synchronization become unavailable.
*   **Affected Component:** Request processing pipeline, Network communication layer, Leader election mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement request rate limiting on the Zookeeper ensemble.
    *   Configure appropriate resource limits for the Zookeeper processes.
    *   Implement network security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems) to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Monitor Zookeeper performance metrics (latency, request queue size) to detect potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Compromised Zookeeper Client Connection](./threats/compromised_zookeeper_client_connection.md)

*   **Description:** If an application instance's connection to Zookeeper is compromised (e.g., due to vulnerabilities in the application or the underlying infrastructure), an attacker could leverage this established connection to perform malicious actions as if they were a legitimate client interacting with Zookeeper.
*   **Impact:** Similar to unauthorized access and data tampering, but potentially more difficult to detect as the connection appears legitimate. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or manipulation of distributed processes managed by Zookeeper.
*   **Affected Component:** Client API, Session management, Authorization module (ACLs - if not properly configured to restrict actions based on client identity).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the infrastructure where application clients are running.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization even for established client connections.
    *   Regularly audit and secure application code that interacts with the Zookeeper client API.
    *   Use secure methods for storing and managing Zookeeper connection credentials.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Zookeeper Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_zookeeper_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the Zookeeper software itself. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or exploiting weaknesses in specific Zookeeper components.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Zookeeper servers, data breaches, service disruption, or complete compromise of the Zookeeper ensemble, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Various Zookeeper modules and functions depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., request parsing, data handling, network communication).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for remote code execution vulnerabilities), High (for other exploitable flaws).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Zookeeper updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for security advisories related to Zookeeper.
    *   Implement network segmentation to limit the blast radius if a Zookeeper server is compromised.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Zookeeper Security](./threats/misconfiguration_of_zookeeper_security.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured access controls (ACLs), authentication mechanisms, or other security settings within Zookeeper can create vulnerabilities. For example, leaving default passwords, overly permissive ACLs, or disabling authentication entirely within the Zookeeper configuration.
*   **Impact:** Unintentional exposure of sensitive data managed by Zookeeper, unauthorized access to Zookeeper data and functionality, and potential for malicious manipulation due to a weak Zookeeper security posture.
*   **Affected Component:** Configuration management, Authentication module, Authorization module (ACLs).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow Zookeeper security best practices and guidelines during configuration.
    *   Avoid using default credentials and ensure strong passwords or key-based authentication for Zookeeper.
    *   Regularly review and audit Zookeeper configuration settings.
    *   Use configuration management tools to enforce consistent and secure Zookeeper configurations.

## Threat: [Zookeeper Quorum Instability/Loss leading to Split-Brain](./threats/zookeeper_quorum_instabilityloss_leading_to_split-brain.md)

*   **Description:** Network partitions or failures of Zookeeper server nodes can lead to a situation where the Zookeeper ensemble loses quorum (majority of servers), making it unavailable for write operations. In a worst-case scenario, a "split-brain" situation could occur within the Zookeeper ensemble where two independent quorums form, potentially leading to data inconsistency within Zookeeper's data store.
*   **Impact:** Inability to update configuration, register new services, or acquire locks managed by Zookeeper. In a split-brain scenario, data inconsistencies within Zookeeper can arise, potentially leading to application failures or data corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Leader election mechanism, Quorum voting protocol, Network communication layer.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure a stable and reliable network infrastructure for the Zookeeper ensemble.
    *   Deploy Zookeeper servers in different availability zones to mitigate the impact of localized failures.
    *   Monitor Zookeeper quorum status and implement alerting for quorum loss.
    *   Follow best practices for Zookeeper deployment and maintenance to ensure resilience.
