# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access to Zookeeper Cluster](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access_to_zookeeper_cluster.md)

*   **Description:** The Zookeeper cluster allows connections without requiring any authentication.
    *   **How Zookeeper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Zookeeper, by default or through misconfiguration, might not enforce authentication, making it directly accessible to anyone who can reach its network ports.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network (or through an exposed port) connects to the Zookeeper port (e.g., 2181) and can read or modify data without any credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the data stored in Zookeeper, leading to application disruption, data corruption, and potential privilege escalation if Zookeeper manages access control information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and configure strong authentication mechanisms in Zookeeper (e.g., using SASL).
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to Zookeeper ports to only authorized clients.
        *   Regularly audit Zookeeper configurations to ensure authentication is enabled and correctly configured.

## Attack Surface: [Data Manipulation and Corruption via Unauthorized Access](./attack_surfaces/data_manipulation_and_corruption_via_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized users or compromised applications can create, delete, or modify data within the Zookeeper data tree.
    *   **How Zookeeper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Zookeeper stores critical application state, configuration, and coordination data. If access controls are weak or non-existent, this data can be tampered with.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access and modifies a configuration node that dictates the behavior of critical application components, leading to application malfunction or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, incorrect behavior, denial of service, and potential security breaches due to manipulated configurations or access control data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Zookeeper to restrict access to specific nodes based on user or application identity.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to clients.
        *   Regularly review and audit Zookeeper ACLs.
        *   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of data read from Zookeeper.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Zookeeper Server Software](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_zookeeper_server_software.md)

*   **Description:**  Known security vulnerabilities in the Zookeeper server software itself can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Zookeeper Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Like any software, Zookeeper can have vulnerabilities that, if not patched, can be exploited. Running an outdated version significantly increases this risk.
    *   **Example:** A remote attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of Zookeeper to gain remote code execution on the Zookeeper server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Zookeeper server, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, and the ability to pivot to other systems on the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Zookeeper server software up-to-date by applying security patches and upgrades promptly.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories related to Apache Zookeeper to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on Zookeeper Cluster](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_zookeeper_cluster.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Zookeeper cluster with requests, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable.
    *   **How Zookeeper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Zookeeper's role as a central coordination service makes it a critical target for DoS attacks. If unavailable, dependent applications can fail.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of connection requests or data modification requests, exhausting the Zookeeper server's resources (CPU, memory, network).
    *   **Impact:**  Unavailability of the Zookeeper cluster, leading to the failure of dependent applications and services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   ** mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on client connections and requests.
        *   Configure resource limits for Zookeeper processes.
        *   Deploy Zookeeper in a highly available configuration with multiple servers.
        *   Use network firewalls and intrusion prevention systems to filter malicious traffic.
