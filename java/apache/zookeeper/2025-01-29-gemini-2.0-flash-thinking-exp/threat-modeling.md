# Threat Model Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks on ZooKeeper Ensemble](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_on_zookeeper_ensemble.md)

- **Description:** An attacker floods the ZooKeeper ensemble with a high volume of connection requests or operations, overwhelming ZooKeeper servers' resources and making the service unresponsive to legitimate clients.
- **Impact:** Application unavailability, loss of critical functionalities dependent on ZooKeeper, potential data inconsistencies.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Server (Network Listener, Request Processing Pipeline)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement rate limiting on client connections.
    - Utilize Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict connections to authorized clients.
    - Deploy ZooKeeper behind a firewall.
    - Monitor ZooKeeper server resource utilization and set up alerts.
    - Ensure sufficient hardware resources are allocated.

## Threat: [ZooKeeper Ensemble Partitioning](./threats/zookeeper_ensemble_partitioning.md)

- **Description:** Network failures or server outages can partition the ZooKeeper ensemble, preventing quorum establishment and leading to service unavailability. An attacker might intentionally trigger network disruptions to cause partitioning.
- **Impact:** Application unavailability, loss of coordination, potential data inconsistencies.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Ensemble (Leader Election, Quorum System, Network Communication)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Ensure network redundancy and stability.
    - Deploy ZooKeeper servers in geographically diverse locations (within latency constraints).
    - Use an odd number of ZooKeeper servers for fault tolerance.
    - Implement robust monitoring of network connectivity between ZooKeeper servers.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to ZooKeeper Data](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_zookeeper_data.md)

- **Description:**  Lack of proper Access Control Lists (ACLs) or misconfigured ACLs can allow unauthorized users or applications to read sensitive data stored in ZooKeeper.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data, potential compromise of application security, unauthorized modification of application behavior.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Access Control (ACLs)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strong ACLs to restrict access based on least privilege.
    - Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
    - Use authentication mechanisms to verify client identities.

## Threat: [Data Exposure in Transit](./threats/data_exposure_in_transit.md)

- **Description:** Communication between clients and ZooKeeper servers, and between ZooKeeper servers, might not be encrypted, allowing attackers to intercept and read sensitive data in transit via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive application data during transmission, potential compromise of application security, interception of authentication credentials.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Network Communication
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enable TLS encryption for client-to-server and server-to-server communication.
    - Enforce the use of encrypted connections for all clients.
    - Regularly review and verify TLS configuration.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification.md)

- **Description:**  Insufficiently restrictive ACLs can allow unauthorized users or applications to modify data in ZooKeeper, leading to application misbehavior or security vulnerabilities.
- **Impact:** Application malfunction, data corruption, potential security breaches if configuration or access control data is modified.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Access Control (ACLs), Data Model (Znodes)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strong ACLs to restrict write access based on least privilege.
    - Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
    - Use authentication mechanisms to verify client identities for write operations.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks Leading to Data Modification](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_leading_to_data_modification.md)

- **Description:** If communication is not encrypted, attackers performing MITM attacks can intercept and modify data in transit between clients and ZooKeeper or between ZooKeeper servers, potentially corrupting data or altering application behavior.
- **Impact:** Data corruption, application malfunction, potential security breaches.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Network Communication
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enable TLS encryption for all ZooKeeper communication.
    - Enforce the use of encrypted connections.
    - Regularly review and verify TLS configuration.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Authentication](./threats/weak_or_missing_authentication.md)

- **Description:** Using weak authentication mechanisms or disabling authentication entirely allows unauthorized access to ZooKeeper.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to ZooKeeper data, potential data modification or deletion, DoS attacks, compromise of application security.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Authentication (SASL, Digest Authentication, Kerberos)
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos or SASL/GSSAPI.
    - Enforce authentication for all client connections.
    - Avoid weak digest authentication; enforce strong password policies if used.
    - Regularly review and update authentication configurations.

## Threat: [Insufficient Authorization (ACLs)](./threats/insufficient_authorization__acls_.md)

- **Description:** ACLs might be too permissive or incorrectly configured, granting excessive privileges or failing to restrict access as intended, leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data, potential data modification or deletion, security breaches due to excessive privileges, application malfunction.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Authorization (ACLs)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement granular ACLs based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
    - Use role-based access control (RBAC) principles.

## Threat: [Credential Compromise](./threats/credential_compromise.md)

- **Description:** ZooKeeper credentials (usernames, passwords, Kerberos tickets, SASL tokens) can be compromised, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate clients and gain unauthorized access.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to ZooKeeper, potential data breaches, data modification or deletion, DoS attacks, full compromise of application security.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Authentication, Credential Management
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Enforce strong password policies.
    - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) if possible.
    - Securely store and manage ZooKeeper credentials.
    - Regularly rotate ZooKeeper credentials.
    - Monitor for suspicious activity and credential usage.

## Threat: [Inadequate Patching and Updates](./threats/inadequate_patching_and_updates.md)

- **Description:** Failure to apply security patches and updates to ZooKeeper software leaves known vulnerabilities exposed to exploitation.
- **Impact:** Security vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers, potential compromise of ZooKeeper and the application, data breaches, DoS attacks.
- **ZooKeeper Component Affected:** ZooKeeper Software (All Components)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly monitor for security advisories and updates for ZooKeeper.
    - Establish a process for timely patching and updates.
    - Test patches in non-production environments before applying to production.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_zookeeper_software.md)

    - Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
    - Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing.
