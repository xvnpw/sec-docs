## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known Zookeeper Vulnerability (CVE):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_zookeeper_vulnerability__cve_.md)

**High-Risk Path:** Exploit Known Zookeeper Vulnerability (CVE) -> Execute Exploit against Zookeeper Instance
*   **Critical Node:** Execute Exploit against Zookeeper Instance
*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers identify publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the deployed Zookeeper version.
    *   They obtain or develop an exploit for the identified CVE.
    *   The exploit is executed against the Zookeeper instance.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Zookeeper server, data manipulation, Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update Zookeeper to the latest patched version. Implement vulnerability scanning and patching processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Unsecured Access Control:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_unsecured_access_control.md)

**High-Risk Path:** Exploit Zookeeper Misconfiguration -> Exploit Unsecured Access Control
*   **Critical Node:** Exploit Unsecured Access Control
*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   **Identify Weak or Missing Authentication:**
        *   **Anonymous Access Enabled:** Zookeeper is configured to allow connections without any authentication.
            *   **Critical Node:** Anonymous Access Enabled
            *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:** Attackers can connect to Zookeeper without providing credentials and potentially perform actions based on ACLs, which might be misconfigured.
            *   **Mitigation:** Disable anonymous access. Enable authentication using SASL mechanisms like Kerberos or Digest.
        *   **Default/Weak Credentials Used:** Authentication is enabled, but default or easily guessable credentials are used.
            *   **Critical Node:** Default/Weak Credentials Used
            *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:** Attackers can brute-force or guess default/weak credentials to gain authenticated access to Zookeeper.
            *   **Mitigation:** Change default credentials immediately upon deployment. Enforce strong password policies.
    *   **Identify Insecure ACLs:**
        *   **World-Readable/Writable Nodes:** Critical zNodes are configured with world-readable or world-writable permissions.
            *   **Critical Node:** World-Readable/Writable Nodes
            *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:** Any authenticated user (or anonymous if enabled) can read or modify sensitive data stored in these zNodes, leading to data breaches or application disruption.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement a least-privilege ACL model. Restrict access to zNodes based on roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
        *   **Overly Permissive ACLs for Critical Nodes:** ACLs grant excessive permissions to users or groups that should not have access to critical zNodes.
            *   **Critical Node:** Overly Permissive ACLs for Critical Nodes
            *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:** Attackers can leverage compromised accounts or insider threats with overly broad permissions to access or manipulate critical data.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement a least-privilege ACL model. Grant only necessary permissions. Regularly review and audit ACL configurations, ensuring they align with the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Exploit Lack of Network Segmentation:**
        *   **Zookeeper Accessible from Untrusted Network:** Zookeeper is directly accessible from the internet or other untrusted networks.
            *   **Critical Node:** Zookeeper Accessible from Untrusted Network
            *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:** Exposing Zookeeper to untrusted networks significantly increases the attack surface, making it easier for attackers to discover and exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
            *   **Mitigation:** Deploy Zookeeper in a dedicated, isolated network segment. Use firewalls to restrict access to Zookeeper ports only from authorized clients and servers within the application's infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Unencrypted Communication:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_unencrypted_communication.md)

**High-Risk Path:** Exploit Zookeeper Misconfiguration -> Exploit Unencrypted Communication -> Sniff Unencrypted Network Traffic
*   **Critical Node:** Exploit Unencrypted Communication, Sniff Unencrypted Network Traffic
*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   **Capture Authentication Credentials:** Zookeeper communication is unencrypted, and authentication credentials are transmitted in plaintext or easily reversible formats.
        *   **Critical Node:** Capture Authentication Credentials
        *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:** Attackers can sniff network traffic to capture authentication credentials (e.g., SASL tokens) and bypass authentication.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all Zookeeper communication.
    *   **Capture Sensitive Application Data in Transit:** Sensitive application data is stored in Zookeeper and transmitted unencrypted.
        *   **Critical Node:** Capture Sensitive Application Data in Transit
        *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:** Attackers can sniff network traffic to intercept sensitive application data being transmitted between clients and Zookeeper servers, leading to data breaches.
        *   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all Zookeeper communication. Avoid storing highly sensitive data directly in Zookeeper if possible, or encrypt it at the application level before storing it in Zookeeper.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Session Hijacking via Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic:](./attack_tree_paths/4__session_hijacking_via_sniffing_unencrypted_traffic.md)

**High-Risk Path:** Exploit Zookeeper Protocol Weaknesses -> Session Hijacking -> Capture Valid Session ID -> Sniff Network Traffic (if unencrypted)
*   **Critical Node:** Sniff Network Traffic (if unencrypted)
*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   Zookeeper communication is unencrypted, and session IDs are transmitted in plaintext.
    *   Attackers sniff network traffic to capture valid Zookeeper session IDs.
    *   Attackers use the captured session ID to impersonate a legitimate client and perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Unauthorized access to Zookeeper data and functionality, data manipulation, application disruption.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all Zookeeper communication to protect session IDs in transit. Implement robust session management and consider session invalidation mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Request Flooding/DoS via Protocol Exploitation (`create` or `setData` storms):](./attack_tree_paths/5__request_floodingdos_via_protocol_exploitation___create__or__setdata__storms_.md)

**High-Risk Path:** Exploit Zookeeper Protocol Weaknesses -> Request Flooding/DoS via Protocol Exploitation -> Identify Resource-Intensive Zookeeper Request -> Exploit `create` or `setData` storms
*   **Critical Node:** Exploit `create` or `setData` storms
*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   Attackers identify that flooding Zookeeper with a large number of `create` or `setData` requests can overwhelm the server resources.
    *   They launch a flood of these requests from compromised clients or attacker-controlled machines.
    *   This overwhelms the Zookeeper server, leading to resource exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Potential Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on client requests to Zookeeper, especially for `create` and `setData` operations. Monitor Zookeeper server performance and resource utilization. Implement DoS detection and prevention mechanisms.
