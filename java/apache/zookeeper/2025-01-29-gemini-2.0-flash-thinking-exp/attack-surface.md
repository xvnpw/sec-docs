# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between ZooKeeper clients and servers, or between ZooKeeper servers themselves, is not encrypted.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:** ZooKeeper, by default, uses unencrypted TCP for communication, exposing data in transit.
*   **Example:** An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic and intercepts sensitive configuration data being exchanged between a client application and a ZooKeeper server.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential for Man-in-the-Middle attacks to modify data in transit.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS Encryption:** Configure ZooKeeper to enforce TLS encryption for both client-server and server-server communication.
    *   **Secure Configuration:** Ensure TLS is properly configured and enabled on all ZooKeeper nodes and clients.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate ZooKeeper traffic within a secure network segment.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm ZooKeeper servers with requests, making them unavailable to legitimate clients and disrupting application functionality.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:** ZooKeeper servers are network services susceptible to resource exhaustion and flooding attacks due to their role in handling client requests and maintaining state.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods ZooKeeper ports with connection requests, exceeding connection limits and preventing legitimate clients from connecting and performing operations.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime, loss of coordination and configuration management, impacting application availability and functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Rate Limiting:** Implement network-level rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from specific sources.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Use firewalls to restrict access to ZooKeeper ports to only authorized sources and networks.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure ZooKeeper resource limits (e.g., connection limits, request timeouts) to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns and trigger alerts for potential DoS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [ZooKeeper Port Exposure](./attack_surfaces/zookeeper_port_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** ZooKeeper ports are directly accessible from untrusted networks, increasing the attack surface and potential for exploitation of ZooKeeper vulnerabilities.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:** ZooKeeper listens on well-known ports (2181, 2888, 3888 by default) which become potential entry points for attackers if exposed.
*   **Example:** An attacker from the public internet attempts to connect to an exposed ZooKeeper port and exploit known vulnerabilities in the ZooKeeper service or brute-force authentication if enabled but weak.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, system compromise, DoS attacks, potentially leading to full control of the ZooKeeper ensemble and dependent applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate ZooKeeper within a private network, inaccessible from the public internet.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewalls to strictly block access to ZooKeeper ports from untrusted networks.
    *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to ZooKeeper ports to only authorized clients and servers within your infrastructure using network access control lists (ACLs) and security groups.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Misconfigured Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_misconfigured_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Authentication mechanisms are not enabled, weakly configured, or use default credentials, allowing unauthorized clients to connect and interact with ZooKeeper.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:** ZooKeeper offers authentication mechanisms (like SASL and Digest), but they are not enabled by default and require explicit and secure configuration. Misconfiguration weakens the security posture.
*   **Example:** ZooKeeper is deployed without authentication enabled, or with easily guessable default credentials, allowing any client to connect, read, and manipulate data, regardless of authorization.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, data breaches, system compromise, potentially allowing attackers to take control of the ZooKeeper ensemble and disrupt dependent applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Strong Authentication:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms like SASL/Kerberos or Digest authentication.
    *   **Strong Credentials:** Use strong, unique, and randomly generated credentials for authentication. Avoid default or easily guessable passwords.
    *   **Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate authentication credentials to limit the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary authentication privileges to clients and services that genuinely require access to ZooKeeper.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass via ACL Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_via_acl_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Access Control Lists (ACLs) are incorrectly configured, granting excessive permissions or failing to restrict access appropriately to zNodes, leading to unauthorized actions.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:** ZooKeeper's ACL system controls access to zNodes, and misconfiguration or overly permissive ACLs directly undermine the intended security model.
*   **Example:** An ACL is mistakenly configured to grant "world:anyone" read and write permissions to a critical zNode containing sensitive application configuration, allowing any client to modify it and disrupt the application.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, data deletion, information disclosure, application malfunction, potentially leading to security breaches and system instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege ACLs:** Implement a strict least-privilege ACL model, granting only the minimum necessary permissions to specific users, roles, or applications for each zNode.
    *   **Regular ACL Audits:** Regularly review and audit ACL configurations to identify and correct misconfigurations, ensuring they align with the intended access control policy.
    *   **ACL Testing:** Thoroughly test ACL configurations in a staging environment to ensure they are working as intended and effectively restrict access before deploying to production.
    *   **Default Deny:**  Adopt a default deny policy for ACLs, explicitly granting permissions only when absolutely necessary, rather than starting with permissive settings and trying to restrict them later.

## Attack Surface: [Data Corruption or Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/data_corruption_or_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers with unauthorized access, gained through compromised authentication or authorization, modify or corrupt critical data stored in ZooKeeper zNodes, leading to application errors or security breaches.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:** ZooKeeper is designed to store and manage critical configuration and coordination data. If access controls are weak, it becomes a prime target for data manipulation attacks to disrupt dependent systems.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized write access to ZooKeeper and modifies connection strings or critical application settings stored in zNodes, causing the application to connect to malicious services or malfunction in a way that leads to a security breach.
*   **Impact:** Application instability, data inconsistencies, security breaches, potential system compromise depending on the nature and criticality of the manipulated data and its role in the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization controls (as described above) to rigorously prevent unauthorized access and data modification.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks:** Implement application-level mechanisms to validate the integrity and expected format of critical data retrieved from ZooKeeper before using it.
    *   **Data Backup and Recovery:** Regularly back up ZooKeeper data to enable rapid recovery from data corruption or malicious modification, minimizing downtime and data loss.
    *   **Immutable Data (where applicable):** Design applications to treat certain critical configuration data as immutable after initial setup to reduce the potential impact of runtime modifications, even if unauthorized.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Unauthorized Access](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as configuration details, connection strings, or internal application secrets, stored in ZooKeeper is exposed to unauthorized parties due to weak access controls or misconfigurations.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:** ZooKeeper can inadvertently become a repository for sensitive information if not managed with strict access control and awareness of the data being stored.
*   **Example:** Connection strings to databases, API keys, or other sensitive credentials are stored directly in ZooKeeper zNodes with overly permissive ACLs, allowing unauthorized users or services to access and potentially misuse them.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for further attacks leveraging disclosed information to compromise other systems or data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Least Privilege ACLs:** Apply the principle of least privilege to ACLs to strictly restrict access to zNodes containing sensitive data, ensuring only authorized entities can access them.
    *   **Secret Management:** Avoid storing highly sensitive secrets directly in ZooKeeper zNodes. Utilize dedicated secret management solutions (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) and reference secrets indirectly from ZooKeeper if necessary.
    *   **Data Encryption at Rest (if applicable):** Consider encrypting sensitive data stored in ZooKeeper at rest if supported and deemed necessary to add an extra layer of protection against data breaches.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify and remediate potential information disclosure vulnerabilities related to data stored in ZooKeeper.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated ZooKeeper Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_zookeeper_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of ZooKeeper that contains known, publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
*   **ZooKeeper Contribution:**  Using older, unpatched versions of ZooKeeper directly exposes the system to any vulnerabilities present in that version, as ZooKeeper itself is the vulnerable component.
*   **Example:** A team continues to operate an old ZooKeeper version that has a publicly known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code on the ZooKeeper server, potentially compromising the entire system and dependent applications.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, remote code execution, data breaches, DoS attacks, depending on the nature and severity of the specific vulnerability present in the outdated version.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Maintain ZooKeeper by consistently updating to the latest stable version released by the Apache ZooKeeper project.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Proactively subscribe to security advisories and monitor for newly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting ZooKeeper and its dependencies.
    *   **Patch Management Process:** Establish a robust and timely patch management process to promptly apply security patches and updates as soon as they are released.
    *   **Automated Updates (with testing):** Consider implementing automated update mechanisms for ZooKeeper, coupled with thorough testing in a staging environment before deploying updates to production, to ensure timely patching while minimizing disruption.
