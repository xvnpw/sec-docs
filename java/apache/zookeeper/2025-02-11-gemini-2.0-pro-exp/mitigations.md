# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication and Authorization (ACLs) within ZooKeeper](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_and_authorization__acls__within_zookeeper.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication (zoo.cfg):** Modify the `zoo.cfg` file on *all* ZooKeeper servers.  Set `authProvider.1=org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider` (or a similar provider like `DigestAuthenticationProvider`).  If using Kerberos, configure Kerberos settings (realm, `jaasLoginRenew`, keytab files, etc.) directly within `zoo.cfg` and related JAAS configuration files. If using digest authentication, create users and passwords using the `zkCli.sh` tool (`addauth digest user:password`).
    2.  **Configure ACLs (zkCli.sh or API):**  For *each* znode (or a parent znode to apply recursively), use the `zkCli.sh` tool or the ZooKeeper API (e.g., `setACL()` method) to set ACLs.  Specify the scheme (e.g., `sasl` for Kerberos, `digest` for username/password), the identifier (e.g., Kerberos principal, username), and the permissions (read, write, create, delete, admin â€“ represented as `cdrwa`).  Example (zkCli.sh): `setAcl /myznode sasl:myuser:cdrwa,sasl:anotheruser:r`. Example (Java API): `zooKeeper.setACL("/myznode", acls, -1);`
    3.  **Client Authentication (Connection String/API):** Configure client applications to authenticate with ZooKeeper. This involves providing credentials (Kerberos ticket, username/password) in the client's connection string or through API calls (e.g., `zooKeeper.addAuthInfo("digest", "user:password".getBytes());`). The specific method depends on the client library.
    4.  **Regular ACL Review (zkCli.sh):**  Periodically (e.g., quarterly) review the ACLs on all znodes using the `getAcl` command in `zkCli.sh` to ensure they still adhere to the principle of least privilege. Example: `getAcl /myznode`.
    5.  **Dynamic ACLs (Custom AuthenticationProvider):** If access patterns are dynamic, explore using dynamic ACLs. This involves implementing a custom `org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.AuthenticationProvider` and configuring it in `zoo.cfg`. This provider will dynamically determine permissions based on runtime context.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** (Severity: **Critical**)
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification:** (Severity: **Critical**)
    *   **Unauthorized ZNode Creation/Deletion:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Unauthorized Actions:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Replay Attacks (with Kerberos):** (Severity: **High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.
    *   **Unauthorized ZNode Creation/Deletion:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **DoS via Unauthorized Actions:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low** (with Kerberos).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Authentication is enabled using Digest authentication in the `dev` environment (`zoo.cfg`).
    *   Basic ACLs are set on a few key znodes in `dev` (using `zkCli.sh`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Kerberos authentication is not implemented (`zoo.cfg` and JAAS configuration).
    *   Comprehensive ACLs are missing for many znodes (requires `zkCli.sh` or API calls for each znode).
    *   Dynamic ACLs are not considered (requires custom `AuthenticationProvider`).
    *   Regular ACL reviews are not formally scheduled (`getAcl` via `zkCli.sh`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Communication (TLS/SSL) Configuration in ZooKeeper](./mitigation_strategies/secure_communication__tlsssl__configuration_in_zookeeper.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure ZooKeeper Servers (zoo.cfg):**  In the `zoo.cfg` file on *each* server:
        *   Set `secureClientPort` to a port for secure client connections (e.g., 2182).
        *   Set `ssl.keyStore.location` to the path of the server's keystore file.
        *   Set `ssl.keyStore.password` to the password for the keystore.
        *   Set `ssl.keyStore.type` to keystore type (e.g., JKS).
        *   Set `ssl.trustStore.location` to the path of the server's truststore file.
        *   Set `ssl.trustStore.password` to the password for the truststore.
        *   Set `ssl.trustStore.type` to truststore type (e.g., JKS).
        *   Set `ssl.clientAuth=need` to require client authentication (or `want` for optional).
        *   For server-to-server communication, configure similar settings under `sslQuorum.*` (e.g., `sslQuorum.keyStore.location`, `sslQuorum.trustStore.location`, etc.).
    2.  **Client Connection (Connection String/API):** Configure client applications to connect to the `secureClientPort` and to use TLS/SSL.  This involves providing the client's keystore and truststore (if client authentication is enabled) in the connection string or through API calls. The specific method depends on the client library.  For example, in the Java API, you might use system properties like `-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore`, `-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore`, etc., or configure an `SSLContext` and pass it to the ZooKeeper constructor.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: **Critical**)
    *   **Eavesdropping:** (Severity: **Critical**)
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit:** (Severity: **Critical**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.
    *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS/SSL is enabled for client-server communication in the `dev` environment (`zoo.cfg` settings for `secureClientPort`, keystore, and truststore).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   TLS/SSL is *not* enabled for server-to-server communication (`sslQuorum.*` settings in `zoo.cfg`).
    *   TLS/SSL is not consistently enforced; unencrypted connections are still possible (requires ensuring all clients use `secureClientPort`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit ZNode Data Size (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_znode_data_size__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `jute.maxbuffer` (zoo.cfg):** In the `zoo.cfg` file on *all* ZooKeeper servers, set the `jute.maxbuffer` property to a reasonable value (in bytes) to limit the maximum size of data that can be stored in a single znode.  For example, `jute.maxbuffer=4194304` sets the limit to 4MB.  This is a *global* setting for the entire ZooKeeper ensemble.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large ZNodes:** (Severity: **Medium**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Large ZNodes:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `jute.maxbuffer` is set to a default value in `zoo.cfg`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The default `jute.maxbuffer` value may be too high; it should be reviewed and potentially lowered based on application requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to Four Letter Words](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_four_letter_words.md)

*   **Description:**
    1. **Identify Sensitive Commands:** Understand which Four Letter Words (FLWs) expose sensitive information or could be misused.  `dump`, `conf`, and `srvr` are examples that might need restriction.
    2. **Use ACLs (zkCli.sh or API):**  Use ZooKeeper's ACL mechanism to restrict access to the `/zookeeper/config` znode (and potentially other relevant znodes).  By default, this znode is world-readable.  Change the ACL to allow only authorized users or roles to read it.  Example (zkCli.sh): `setAcl /zookeeper/config sasl:zookeeper-admin:cdrwa,world:anyone:`. This restricts access to the `zookeeper-admin` user.
    3. **Consider `readonlymode.enabled` (zoo.cfg):** If you want to completely disable write operations via FLWs, you can set `readonlymode.enabled=true` in `zoo.cfg`. This prevents commands like `conf` from modifying the configuration. However, this is a global setting and affects all clients.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Disclosure:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents unauthorized users from viewing sensitive configuration details.
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification (with `readonlymode.enabled`):** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents unauthorized modification of the configuration via FLWs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Disclosure:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low** (with `readonlymode.enabled`).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   ACLs are not set on `/zookeeper/config` (requires `setAcl` via `zkCli.sh` or API).
    *   `readonlymode.enabled` is not set (requires modification of `zoo.cfg`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits (Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `maxClientCnxns` (zoo.cfg):** In the `zoo.cfg` file on *all* ZooKeeper servers, set the `maxClientCnxns` property to a reasonable value to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections from a single IP address.  For example, `maxClientCnxns=60`.  This is a per-IP limit.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Connection Exhaustion (DoS):** (Severity: **High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Connection Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `maxClientCnxns` is set to a default value in `zoo.cfg`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The default `maxClientCnxns` value may not be appropriate; it should be reviewed and potentially adjusted based on the expected number of clients and the capacity of the servers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening (zoo.cfg)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening__zoo_cfg_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Disable Unnecessary Features (zoo.cfg):** Review the `zoo.cfg` file and disable any ZooKeeper features that are not required.  For example, if you are not using dynamic reconfiguration, ensure it's disabled (check for related settings). If you are not using snapshots, you might adjust snapshot-related settings.
    2.  **Review Timeouts (zoo.cfg):** Set appropriate values for timeouts:
        *   `tickTime`: The basic time unit in milliseconds.
        *   `initLimit`: The time (in ticks) allowed for followers to connect and sync with the leader.
        *   `syncLimit`: The time (in ticks) allowed for followers to sync with the leader.
    3.  **Avoid Default Ports (zoo.cfg):** Change the default ZooKeeper ports (2181, 2888, 3888) to non-standard values using `clientPort` and the `server.X` settings.
    4. **Configure Logging (zoo.cfg and log4j.properties):** Set appropriate log levels (`logLevel` in `zoo.cfg` and in `log4j.properties`), configure log rotation, and ensure logs are written to a secure location.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Features:** (Severity: **Medium**)
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: **High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Unnecessary Features:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging is configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A comprehensive review of `zoo.cfg` for unnecessary features and hardening opportunities has not been performed.
    *   Default ports are still used (`clientPort` and `server.X` settings).
    *   Timeout values (`tickTime`, `initLimit`, `syncLimit`) may not be optimally configured.
    *   Log rotation and secure log storage are not fully addressed.
