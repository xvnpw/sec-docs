# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Attack Surface: [1. Network Exposure (Client & Server Ports)](./attack_surfaces/1__network_exposure__client_&_server_ports_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exposure of ZooKeeper's essential network ports to unauthorized access.
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** ZooKeeper *requires* open ports for client communication (default 2181) and inter-server communication (defaults 2888, 3888). This is inherent to its operation.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans for open port 2181 and attempts to connect to a ZooKeeper instance without proper authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to ZooKeeper data, potential for data modification, denial-of-service, or compromise of the entire ZooKeeper ensemble.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if unauthenticated/unauthorized access is possible) or **High** (if authentication is weak or misconfigured).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  *Strictly* limit access to ZooKeeper ports (2181, 2888, 3888) to *only* authorized client and server IPs/networks. Use a dedicated, isolated network segment.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate ZooKeeper from the public internet and other untrusted networks.
    *   **VPN/Tunneling:**  Require clients to connect via a VPN or secure tunnel.
    *   **mTLS (Mutual TLS):**  Implement mTLS for inter-server communication.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on connection attempts.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unauthenticated/Weak Authentication](./attack_surfaces/2__unauthenticatedweak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**  Lack of strong authentication for client connections to ZooKeeper.
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** ZooKeeper *supports* authentication (SASL: Kerberos, DIGEST-MD5), but it is *not* enabled by default.  It is the administrator's responsibility to configure it.
*   **Example:**  A client connects to ZooKeeper without credentials, and the server allows it because authentication is not enforced.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized read/write access to ZooKeeper data, leading to data breaches, configuration poisoning, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Strong Authentication:**  *Mandatory*: Enable a strong authentication mechanism. Kerberos is strongly recommended. DIGEST-MD5 is significantly weaker and should only be considered in very limited, low-risk scenarios with strong password policies.
    *   **Credential Management:**  Implement secure credential storage and rotation.

## Attack Surface: [3. Insufficient Authorization (ACLs)](./attack_surfaces/3__insufficient_authorization__acls_.md)

*   **Description:**  Poorly configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) granting excessive permissions.
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** ZooKeeper *uses* ACLs to control access to znodes.  Proper ACL configuration is entirely the responsibility of the administrator.
*   **Example:**  A client has read/write access to a znode it shouldn't, containing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:**  Data leakage, unauthorized configuration modification, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant *only* the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Specific ACLs:**  Avoid overly permissive defaults. Define specific ACLs for each znode.
    *   **Regular ACL Review:**  Periodically review and audit ACLs.

## Attack Surface: [4. Unencrypted Communication](./attack_surfaces/4__unencrypted_communication.md)

*   **Description:**  Data transmitted without encryption (client-server and server-server).
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** By default, ZooKeeper communication is *unencrypted*.  TLS must be explicitly configured.
*   **Example:**  An attacker on the network captures sensitive data transmitted in plain text.
*   **Impact:**  Eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, data manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS:**  *Mandatory*: Enable TLS for *both* client-server and server-server communication. Use strong cipher suites.

## Attack Surface: [5. Data Exposure (Snapshots & Logs)](./attack_surfaces/5__data_exposure__snapshots_&_logs_.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access to ZooKeeper's data files on the server's file system.
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** ZooKeeper *stores* its data and transaction history in files on the local file system.
*   **Example:** An attacker with file system access reads the ZooKeeper data files.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, exposing sensitive configuration data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File System Permissions:**  Use strict permissions to restrict access to the ZooKeeper data directory.
    *   **Data Encryption at Rest:**  Consider encrypting the ZooKeeper data directory.
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Detect unauthorized modifications to data files.

## Attack Surface: [6. ZooKeeper Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/6__zookeeper_code_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitable vulnerabilities within the ZooKeeper software.
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** ZooKeeper, like any software, can have vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A newly discovered RCE vulnerability in ZooKeeper is exploited.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial-of-service, information disclosure, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Stay Updated:**  *Mandatory*: Keep ZooKeeper up-to-date with security patches.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Consider using vulnerability scanners.

## Attack Surface: [7. Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/7__misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure ZooKeeper configuration settings.
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** ZooKeeper has many configuration options; incorrect settings create weaknesses.
*   **Example:** Setting `maxClientCnxns` too high (DoS vulnerability) or leaving "Four Letter Words" unrestricted.
*   **Impact:**  Denial-of-service, information disclosure, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review and understand all configuration options.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure with minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Use tools for consistent, secure configurations.
    *   **Restrict Four Letter Words:** Use `4lw.commands.whitelist` to control allowed commands.

## Attack Surface: [8. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/8__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks to make ZooKeeper unavailable to legitimate clients.
*   **How ZooKeeper Contributes:** ZooKeeper is a critical component; its unavailability disrupts the system.
*   **Example:** Flooding the server with connections, exceeding `maxClientCnxns`.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Limits:** Configure appropriate `maxClientCnxns`.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting and connection throttling.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor resources to detect DoS attempts.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Consider a load balancer for resilience.
