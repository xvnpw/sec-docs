# Deep Analysis: Insufficient Authorization (ACLs) in Apache ZooKeeper

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with insufficient authorization (specifically, misconfigured Access Control Lists or ACLs) in Apache ZooKeeper deployments, and to provide actionable recommendations for development and operations teams to mitigate these risks.  We aim to move beyond a superficial understanding and delve into the practical implications and best practices.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface related to ZooKeeper's ACL mechanisms.  It covers:

*   How ZooKeeper's ACLs work.
*   Common misconfigurations and their consequences.
*   Specific attack scenarios exploiting weak ACLs.
*   Detailed mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration best practices.
*   Monitoring and auditing techniques for ACLs.

This analysis *does not* cover other ZooKeeper security aspects like authentication, network security, or data encryption in transit/at rest, except where they directly relate to ACL enforcement.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Technical Documentation Review:**  Thorough examination of the official Apache ZooKeeper documentation, focusing on ACLs, authentication schemes, and security best practices.
2.  **Code Analysis (Illustrative):**  Review of simplified, illustrative code snippets (primarily Java, as it's the most common client language) demonstrating both vulnerable and secure ACL configurations.  This is *not* a full code audit of ZooKeeper itself, but rather examples of how applications *use* ZooKeeper.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigation of known vulnerabilities and exploits related to ZooKeeper ACL misconfigurations (CVEs, blog posts, security advisories).  This helps understand real-world attack patterns.
4.  **Best Practices Compilation:**  Gathering and synthesizing best practices from various sources, including the ZooKeeper documentation, security guides, and industry standards.
5.  **Scenario Analysis:**  Developing realistic attack scenarios to illustrate the potential impact of insufficient authorization.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Insufficient Authorization (ACLs)

### 4.1. ZooKeeper ACL Fundamentals

ZooKeeper uses a hierarchical namespace (like a file system) where each node (znode) can have associated data and ACLs.  ACLs control which clients (identified by their authentication scheme) can perform which operations on a znode.

An ACL in ZooKeeper consists of a list of *pairs*:

*   **Scheme:**  The authentication method used to identify the client. Common schemes include:
    *   `world`:  Anyone (including unauthenticated clients).  Often used with the `anyone` ID.
    *   `auth`:  Any authenticated client (regardless of specific identity).
    *   `digest`:  Username/password authentication.
    *   `ip`:  Restriction based on client IP address.
    *   `x509`: client certificate authentication.
*   **ID:**  The specific identity within the scheme.  Examples:
    *   `anyone` (for the `world` scheme).
    *   A username (for the `digest` scheme).
    *   An IP address or CIDR block (for the `ip` scheme).
    *   A Distinguished Name (DN) from a certificate (for the `x509` scheme)
*   **Permissions:**  A combination of the following:
    *   `CREATE` (c):  Allows creating child znodes.
    *   `READ` (r):  Allows reading the znode's data and listing its children.
    *   `WRITE` (w):  Allows modifying the znode's data.
    *   `DELETE` (d):  Allows deleting the znode.
    *   `ADMIN` (a):  Allows setting the znode's ACLs.

**Example ACL:**

```
scheme:digest, id:user1:password1, perms:cdrwa
scheme:ip, id:192.168.1.0/24, perms:r
scheme:world, id:anyone, perms:
```

This ACL grants:

*   `user1` (authenticated via digest) full permissions (create, read, write, delete, admin).
*   Any client from the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet read-only access.
*   Everyone else (including unauthenticated clients) no access.

### 4.2. Common Misconfigurations and Consequences

The following are common mistakes that lead to insufficient authorization:

1.  **Overly Permissive `world:anyone` ACLs:**  The most frequent error.  Setting `world:anyone:cdrwa` on a sensitive znode effectively disables all security for that znode.  Even `world:anyone:r` can leak sensitive configuration data.

2.  **Using `auth` Without Specific IDs:**  While `auth` requires authentication, it doesn't distinguish *which* authenticated client.  If *any* authenticated client has write access, a compromised or malicious client can modify critical data.

3.  **Incorrect Permission Combinations:**  Granting `WRITE` without `READ` is usually pointless, but granting `CREATE` or `DELETE` without sufficient restrictions on parent znodes can lead to denial-of-service or data loss.

4.  **Ignoring the Principle of Least Privilege:**  Granting more permissions than necessary increases the attack surface.  A client that only needs to read data should *not* have write or admin permissions.

5.  **Lack of ACL Inheritance Understanding:**  By default, newly created znodes inherit the ACLs of their parent.  If the root znode (`/`) has overly permissive ACLs, all znodes will inherit them unless explicitly overridden.

6.  **Hardcoded Credentials in Clients:** If digest authentication is used, and credentials are hardcoded and compromised, the attacker gains the permissions associated with those credentials.

7. **Using default Zookeeper ACLs:** Zookeeper comes with default ACLs that might be too open for production environment.

### 4.3. Attack Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Data Leakage via `world:anyone:r`**

*   **Setup:** A znode `/config/database` stores database connection strings.  The ACL is set to `world:anyone:r`.
*   **Attack:** An unauthenticated attacker connects to the ZooKeeper ensemble and reads the data from `/config/database`, obtaining the database credentials.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the database, potential data breach.

**Scenario 2: Configuration Tampering via `auth::rw`**

*   **Setup:** A znode `/config/application` stores application settings.  The ACL is set to `auth::rw`.  Multiple clients are authenticated to ZooKeeper.
*   **Attack:** One of the authenticated clients is compromised (e.g., through a vulnerability in the client application).  The attacker uses the compromised client to modify the settings in `/config/application`, potentially disabling security features or redirecting traffic.
*   **Impact:**  Application compromise, denial of service, data manipulation.

**Scenario 3: Denial of Service via `CREATE` on Root**

*   **Setup:** The root znode (`/`) has an ACL that allows `auth::c`.
*   **Attack:** A compromised authenticated client creates a massive number of child znodes under `/`, exhausting ZooKeeper's resources.
*   **Impact:**  ZooKeeper becomes unresponsive, affecting all applications that rely on it.

**Scenario 4: Privilege Escalation via `ADMIN`**

* **Setup:** A znode `/app/user_data` has ACL `digest:userA:passA:rwa`.
* **Attack:** `userA` uses granted `ADMIN` permission to change ACL to `world:anyone:cdrwa`.
* **Impact:** `userA` escalated privileges and granted access to everyone.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Enforced):**
    *   **Code Example (Java):**

        ```java
        // GOOD: Only grant read access
        List<ACL> readOnlyAcl = ZooDefs.Ids.READ_ACL_UNSAFE;
        zooKeeper.create("/my_znode", data, readOnlyAcl, CreateMode.PERSISTENT);

        // BAD: Grants full access to everyone
        List<ACL> openAcl = ZooDefs.Ids.OPEN_ACL_UNSAFE;
        zooKeeper.create("/my_znode", data, openAcl, CreateMode.PERSISTENT);

        // GOOD: Using specific digest authentication and limited permissions
        List<ACL> specificAcl = new ArrayList<>();
        specificAcl.add(new ACL(Perms.READ | Perms.WRITE, new Id("digest", "user1:hashed_password")));
        zooKeeper.create("/my_znode", data, specificAcl, CreateMode.PERSISTENT);
        ```

    *   **Configuration:**  Always start with the most restrictive ACL possible and add permissions only as needed.  Avoid `world:anyone` unless absolutely necessary (and even then, only with `READ` if data is truly public).

2.  **Specific ACLs (Always):**
    *   Use `digest`, `ip`, or `x509` schemes with specific IDs whenever possible.  Avoid `auth` unless you genuinely intend to grant access to *any* authenticated client.
    *   **Hashing Passwords:**  When using `digest` authentication, *never* store plain-text passwords.  ZooKeeper expects a base64-encoded SHA1 hash of the `username:password` string.  Use a secure hashing library.

3.  **Regular ACL Review and Auditing (Automated):**
    *   Implement a process to regularly review and audit ACLs.  This can be done manually or, preferably, through automated scripts.
    *   **Monitoring:**  Monitor ZooKeeper logs for ACL-related events (e.g., unauthorized access attempts).  ZooKeeper's four-letter commands (like `stat`) can provide information about znodes and their ACLs.
    *   **Tools:** Consider using tools that can visualize and analyze ZooKeeper's namespace and ACLs.

4.  **Secure Credential Management:**
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in client applications.
    *   Use a secure credential store (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) to manage ZooKeeper credentials.
    *   Rotate credentials regularly.

5.  **ACL Inheritance Awareness:**
    *   Explicitly set ACLs on all znodes, even if they inherit from a parent.  This avoids unintended consequences if the parent's ACLs are changed.
    *   Consider setting restrictive ACLs on the root znode (`/`) to prevent accidental exposure of new znodes.

6.  **Use a Dedicated ZooKeeper User:**
    *   Don't use the ZooKeeper superuser for application clients. Create dedicated users with limited privileges.

7. **Use chroot:**
    * Use chroot to limit the zookeeper access to only part of tree.

8. **Limit number of connections:**
    * Limit number of connections from single source to prevent DoS attacks.

### 4.5 Monitoring and Auditing

*   **ZooKeeper's Four-Letter Words:** Use commands like `stat` (to get znode metadata, including ACLs) and `mntr` (for monitoring metrics) to gather information about the ZooKeeper ensemble.
*   **Logging:** Enable detailed logging in ZooKeeper to track access attempts and ACL changes.  Analyze these logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Auditing Tools:**  Develop or use existing scripts to periodically scan the ZooKeeper namespace and report on ACL configurations.  These scripts should:
    *   Identify znodes with overly permissive ACLs (e.g., `world:anyone`).
    *   Check for inconsistent ACLs (e.g., granting `WRITE` without `READ`).
    *   Verify that ACLs adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    *   Generate reports that can be reviewed by security personnel.
* **JMX Monitoring:** Use JMX to monitor ZooKeeper.

## 5. Conclusion

Insufficient authorization, stemming from misconfigured ACLs, is a significant security risk in Apache ZooKeeper deployments.
