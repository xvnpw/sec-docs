# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable ZooKeeper Authentication using Kerberos](./mitigation_strategies/enable_zookeeper_authentication_using_kerberos.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Kerberos Setup:** Ensure a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is set up and accessible to ZooKeeper servers and clients.
    2.  **ZooKeeper Server Configuration:**
        *   Modify `zoo.cfg` on each ZooKeeper server.
        *   Set `authProvider.1=org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider`.
        *   Set `requireClientAuthScheme=sasl`.
        *   Configure Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) configuration file (`java.env` or command line) for ZooKeeper server to use Kerberos principal and keytab.
    3.  **ZooKeeper Client Configuration:**
        *   Configure JAAS configuration file for client applications to use Kerberos principal and keytab.
        *   Modify client connection string to include SASL authentication scheme (e.g., `sasl:kerberos`).
        *   Ensure client applications are configured to obtain Kerberos tickets before connecting to ZooKeeper.
    4.  **Restart ZooKeeper Ensemble:** Restart all ZooKeeper servers in the ensemble for changes to take effect.
    5.  **Test Client Connectivity:** Verify that clients can connect to ZooKeeper using Kerberos authentication.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized clients from connecting to the ZooKeeper ensemble and accessing sensitive data or performing administrative operations.
        *   Data Breaches (High Severity) - Reduces the risk of unauthorized access leading to exposure of sensitive configuration data or application state stored in ZooKeeper.
        *   Data Manipulation (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized modification or deletion of critical ZooKeeper data by malicious actors or compromised systems.
        *   Spoofing (Medium Severity) - Kerberos helps prevent spoofing attacks by verifying the identity of both clients and servers.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access: High Reduction
        *   Data Breaches: High Reduction
        *   Data Manipulation: High Reduction
        *   Spoofing: Medium Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not currently implemented in the project. Authentication is not enforced for client applications connecting to ZooKeeper.

        *   Kerberos integration for ZooKeeper client authentication is completely missing.
        *   No JAAS configuration for clients or servers for Kerberos.
        *   No client-side code changes to handle Kerberos authentication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Fine-grained ACLs (Access Control Lists) on ZNodes](./mitigation_strategies/implement_fine-grained_acls__access_control_lists__on_znodes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Access Requirements:** Analyze application components and determine the necessary access levels for each component to specific ZNodes (read, write, create, delete, admin).
    2.  **Define ACLs:** For each ZNode, define specific ACLs using ZooKeeper CLI or client API.
        *   Use `setAcl` command in ZooKeeper CLI or equivalent client API methods.
        *   Specify the authentication scheme (e.g., `sasl`, `digest`) and permissions (e.g., `rwcda`) for each user or group.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions.
    3.  **Apply ACLs to All ZNodes:** Ensure that ACLs are explicitly set for all ZNodes, including the root ZNode if necessary. Avoid relying on default open permissions.
    4.  **Regularly Review and Update ACLs:** Periodically review and update ACL configurations as application requirements change or new components are added.
    5.  **Document ACL Structure:** Document the ACL structure and permissions for each ZNode for maintainability and auditing purposes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized application components or users from accessing ZNodes they are not supposed to access.
        *   Data Breaches (Medium Severity) - Limits the scope of potential data breaches by restricting access to sensitive data to only authorized entities.
        *   Data Manipulation (Medium Severity) - Prevents accidental or malicious modification of ZNodes by components with excessive permissions.
        *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of privilege escalation by ensuring components only have the necessary permissions.

        *   Configure SSL properties in `zoo.cfg` to specify keystore path, password, truststore path, and password.
        *   Optionally configure desired cipher suites and protocols.
    3.  **ZooKeeper Client Configuration:**
        *   Configure SSL properties in client connection parameters or client configuration files to specify truststore path and password.
        *   Ensure client applications are configured to use TLS when connecting to ZooKeeper.
    4.  **Restart ZooKeeper Ensemble:** Restart all ZooKeeper servers in the ensemble for changes to take effect.
    5.  **Test Client Connectivity:** Verify that clients can connect to ZooKeeper using TLS encryption.
    6.  **Enforce TLS Only Connections (Optional but Recommended):** Configure ZooKeeper to reject non-TLS connections if possible to ensure all communication is encrypted.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Eavesdropping (High Severity) - Prevents eavesdropping on communication between clients and ZooKeeper servers, protecting sensitive data in transit.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity) - Mitigates man-in-the-middle attacks by encrypting communication and verifying server certificates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement ZooKeeper Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/implement_zookeeper_quotas.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Quota Needs:** Determine appropriate quotas for different application components based on their expected usage of ZooKeeper resources (number of child nodes, data size).
    2.  **Set Node Quotas:** Use ZooKeeper CLI or client API to set node quotas on specific ZNodes.
        *   Use `setquota -n <limit> <path>` command in ZooKeeper CLI or equivalent client API methods.
        *   Specify the maximum number of child nodes allowed under a given ZNode path.
    3.  **Set Data Quotas:** Use ZooKeeper CLI or client API to set data quotas on specific ZNodes.
        *   Use `setquota -b <limit> <path>` command in ZooKeeper CLI or equivalent client API methods.
        *   Specify the maximum total data size (in bytes) allowed under a given ZNode path.
    4.  **Monitor Quota Usage:** Implement monitoring to track quota usage and alert administrators when quotas are approaching limits.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Adjust Quotas:** Periodically review and adjust quotas based on application growth and changing resource requirements.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity) - Prevents a single client or application component from consuming excessive ZooKeeper resources (nodes, data).
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity) - Mitigates DoS attacks caused by malicious or misbehaving clients attempting to exhaust ZooKeeper resources.
        *   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity) - Prevents performance degradation caused by uncontrolled resource consumption.

    2.  **Monitor Security Vulnerability Databases:** Regularly monitor security vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, vendor security advisories) for reported vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper.
    3.  **Establish Patching Schedule:** Define a regular schedule for applying security patches and updates to ZooKeeper.
    4.  **Test Patches in Non-Production Environment:** Before applying patches to production, thoroughly test them in a non-production environment to ensure compatibility and stability.
    5.  **Apply Patches Promptly:** Once patches are tested and validated, apply them promptly to the production ZooKeeper ensemble.
    6.  **Document Patching Process:** Document the patching process and maintain a record of applied patches for auditing and tracking purposes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper software.
        *   Zero-Day Attacks (Medium Severity) - While not directly preventing zero-day attacks, regular patching reduces the window of opportunity for exploitation after a vulnerability is discovered and patched.
        *   Data Breaches (High Severity) - Vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. Patching mitigates these risks.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity) - Some vulnerabilities can be exploited to cause DoS. Patching addresses these vulnerabilities.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formalized security patching policy and schedule for ZooKeeper.
        *   Automated vulnerability scanning and patch tracking.
        *   Integration of patching into the regular maintenance cycle.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper ZooKeeper Ensemble Configuration and Sizing](./mitigation_strategies/proper_zookeeper_ensemble_configuration_and_sizing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Ensemble Size:**  Based on application requirements for fault tolerance and performance, determine the appropriate size for the ZooKeeper ensemble (typically 3, 5, or 7 servers for production).
    2.  **Configure `zoo.cfg` Correctly:**
        *   Ensure each server has a unique `server.X` entry in `zoo.cfg` defining its ID, address, and ports for leader election and follower communication.
        *   Configure `tickTime`, `initLimit`, `syncLimit` parameters appropriately for the network environment.
        *   Set `dataDir` and `dataLogDir` to dedicated storage with sufficient performance.
    3.  **Network Configuration:**
        *   Ensure proper network connectivity and low latency between ZooKeeper servers.
        *   Consider network segmentation to isolate ZooKeeper traffic.
    4.  **Resource Allocation:**
        *   Allocate sufficient CPU, memory, and disk I/O resources to each ZooKeeper server based on expected load.
        *   Monitor resource utilization and adjust as needed.
    5.  **Quorum Configuration:** Verify that the ensemble is configured to maintain a quorum (majority of servers) for fault tolerance.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity) - Prevents DoS due to resource exhaustion or instability caused by undersized or misconfigured ensemble.
        *   Availability Issues (High Severity) - Ensures high availability and fault tolerance by proper ensemble configuration, mitigating risks of service disruption due to server failures.
        *   Performance Degradation (Medium Severity) - Prevents performance degradation due to resource contention or inefficient configuration.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Reduction
        *   Availability Issues: High Reduction
        *   Performance Degradation: Medium Reduction

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure ZooKeeper Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_zookeeper_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Exposed Ports:**  Restrict network access to ZooKeeper ports (2181, 2888, 3888 by default) to only authorized clients and servers using firewalls.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Review `zoo.cfg` and disable any ZooKeeper features or functionalities that are not required by your application to reduce the attack surface. (Example: disabling the AdminServer if not needed and exposing it on a separate secured port if required).
    3.  **Secure JMX Configuration:** If JMX is enabled for monitoring, secure JMX access with authentication and TLS to prevent unauthorized access to monitoring data and control.
    4.  **Limit Command Exposure:** If using the AdminServer, restrict access to potentially dangerous commands and ensure proper authentication is in place.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update Configuration:** Periodically review your `zoo.cfg` and related configurations to ensure they align with security best practices and update them as needed to address new threats or vulnerabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity) - Prevents unauthorized access through exposed ports or misconfigured features.
        *   Information Disclosure (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of information disclosure through unsecured monitoring interfaces or exposed configuration details.
        *   Remote Code Execution (Low to Medium Severity) - In extreme cases, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in exposed features could potentially lead to remote code execution.
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity) - Misconfigurations could potentially be exploited to cause DoS.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access: Medium Reduction
