**Impact:** Full administrative control over Zookeeper, allowing manipulation of data, configuration, and potentially disrupting the service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization Settings [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_authenticationauthorization_settings__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Zookeeper's authentication mechanisms are weak or authorization rules (ACLs) are too permissive, attackers can bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to Zookeeper's data and operations.
**Impact:**  Allows attackers to read, modify, or delete critical data within Zookeeper.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Permissions or ACLs [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_permissions_or_acls__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** After gaining unauthorized access, attackers can modify the Access Control Lists (ACLs) on ZNodes to grant themselves further privileges or deny access to legitimate users or applications.
**Impact:**  Can lead to complete control over specific data within Zookeeper, enabling manipulation of application behavior or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unsecured Communication Channels [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unsecured_communication_channels__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If communication between the application and Zookeeper is not encrypted (e.g., using TLS), attackers can intercept network traffic to eavesdrop on sensitive data or inject malicious commands.
**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information, potential for session hijacking, and the ability to manipulate data being exchanged.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data or Commands [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_or_commands__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** By intercepting unencrypted communication, attackers can inject malicious data or commands into the stream, potentially causing the application or Zookeeper to behave unexpectedly.
**Impact:** Data corruption, application errors, or even remote code execution if the injected data is processed unsafely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data within Zookeeper [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_within_zookeeper__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This category focuses on attacks where the attacker gains the ability to modify data stored within Zookeeper.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Write Access to Critical ZNodes [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_write_access_to_critical_znodes__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in authentication or authorization to obtain the necessary permissions to write data to ZNodes that contain critical application information (e.g., configuration, service discovery).
**Impact:**  A prerequisite for many data manipulation attacks, allowing attackers to directly influence the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (see above) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__see_above___high-risk_path_.md)

This refers back to the methods described under "Exploit Zookeeper Configuration Weaknesses" to gain the necessary write access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Configuration Data, Service Discovery Information, etc. [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_configuration_data__service_discovery_information__etc___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once write access is obtained, attackers can modify critical data within ZNodes. This could involve changing application configuration settings, altering service discovery information to redirect traffic, or injecting malicious data.
**Impact:**  Can lead to application misconfiguration, redirection of traffic to malicious services, or the introduction of vulnerabilities through manipulated data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Zookeeper Service Availability [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_zookeeper_service_availability__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

This category focuses on attacks that aim to make the Zookeeper service unavailable, impacting the applications that rely on it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Zookeeper [HIGH-RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__attack_on_zookeeper__high-risk_path_start_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers flood the Zookeeper servers with a large volume of requests (e.g., connection requests, data requests) to overwhelm its resources and make it unresponsive.
**Impact:**  Application downtime, as applications cannot connect to or retrieve data from Zookeeper.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwhelm Zookeeper with Requests (e.g., connection requests, data requests) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/overwhelm_zookeeper_with_requests__e_g___connection_requests__data_requests___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Utilizing various tools and techniques to generate a high volume of requests targeting the Zookeeper servers.
**Impact:**  Causes the Zookeeper service to become overloaded and unavailable, leading to application failures.
