# Threat Model Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Threat: [Zookeeper Service Unavailability](./threats/zookeeper_service_unavailability.md)

**Description:** An attacker might exploit a software bug in Zookeeper to crash the ensemble or make it unresponsive. This could also be achieved by exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities within Zookeeper itself, such as overwhelming the request processing or connection handling mechanisms.

**Impact:** The application relying on Zookeeper will be unable to perform core functions such as configuration retrieval, leader election, and distributed coordination, leading to service disruptions, data inconsistencies due to lack of coordination, and potential cascading failures in dependent systems.

**Affected Component:** Zookeeper Ensemble (specifically the quorum of servers), Zookeeper Request Processing, Connection Handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure appropriate resource limits and monitoring for the Zookeeper servers.
*   Harden the operating system and network configuration of the Zookeeper servers.
*   Ensure proper quorum configuration and sufficient redundancy within the Zookeeper ensemble.
*   Keep the Zookeeper server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Data Corruption/Tampering in Zookeeper](./threats/data_corruptiontampering_in_zookeeper.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the Zookeeper ensemble could directly modify the data stored in znodes, injecting malicious configurations, altering leader election data, or disrupting the application's state. This could be achieved through exploiting authentication weaknesses or vulnerabilities in Zookeeper's authorization mechanisms.

**Impact:** The application's behavior will be unpredictable and potentially harmful, leading to incorrect operations, data corruption within the application, security breaches if configuration data is compromised, and denial of service if critical coordination data is altered.

**Affected Component:** Znode Data, Zookeeper Data Tree, Authentication and Authorization System.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for clients connecting to Zookeeper (e.g., Kerberos, SASL).
*   Enforce strict access control lists (ACLs) on znodes to restrict write access to only authorized clients.
*   Regularly audit Zookeeper configurations and access logs.
*   Consider using secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for client connections.
*   Implement checksums or other integrity checks on critical data stored in Zookeeper.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Zookeeper Security Settings](./threats/misconfiguration_of_zookeeper_security_settings.md)

**Description:**  Administrators might unintentionally configure Zookeeper with weak security settings, such as disabling authentication, using default credentials, or setting overly permissive ACLs. This creates opportunities for attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the service.

**Impact:**  The Zookeeper ensemble becomes vulnerable to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks, impacting the availability and integrity of the applications relying on it.

**Affected Component:** Zookeeper Configuration (zoo.cfg), Authentication and Authorization System.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow security best practices when configuring Zookeeper.
*   Disable default or unnecessary features.
*   Avoid using default credentials and enforce strong password policies.
*   Regularly review and audit Zookeeper configurations.
*   Use configuration management tools to ensure consistent and secure configurations across the ensemble.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Zookeeper Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_zookeeper_itself.md)

**Description:**  Like any software, Zookeeper itself may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:**  The entire Zookeeper ensemble and the applications relying on it could be compromised, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Various Zookeeper Modules and Functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if a severe vulnerability is discovered).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Zookeeper server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for the Zookeeper project.
*   Follow security best practices for deploying and managing the Zookeeper ensemble.
*   Consider using intrusion detection/prevention systems to detect and block exploitation attempts.
