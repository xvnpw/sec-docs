# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/zookeeper

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Zookeeper Ports](./attack_surfaces/exposed_zookeeper_ports.md)

*   **Description:** Zookeeper uses specific ports (2181, 2888, 3888 by default) for its core functionalities. Leaving these ports open to untrusted networks allows unauthorized connection attempts directly to the Zookeeper service.
    *   **How Zookeeper Contributes:** Zookeeper's fundamental operation relies on these ports for client interaction and internal ensemble communication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans a public IP range and discovers an open port 2181. They attempt to connect to the Zookeeper instance without proper authorization, potentially using known exploits or attempting default credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Zookeeper ensemble, potentially leading to complete data manipulation, deletion, or denial of service. Compromise of Zookeeper can disrupt all dependent applications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to Zookeeper ports only from trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        *   Utilize VPNs or other secure tunnels for remote access to Zookeeper.
        *   Regularly audit and review firewall configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** If authentication is not enabled or uses easily compromised credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the Zookeeper ensemble.
    *   **How Zookeeper Contributes:** Zookeeper provides authentication mechanisms (like SASL), but it's the responsibility of the administrator to enable and configure them securely. A lack of or weak configuration directly exposes the service.
    *   **Example:** A Zookeeper instance is deployed without enabling SASL authentication. An attacker connects to the open port and gains full administrative access to the Zookeeper data and configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Zookeeper data and functionality. Attackers can read, modify, or delete any data, disrupt the service, and potentially gain control over applications relying on Zookeeper's coordination.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Mandatory enforcement of strong authentication mechanisms like SASL.
        *   Implement robust password policies for all Zookeeper users.
        *   Regularly rotate authentication credentials.
        *   Absolutely avoid using default or easily guessable credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured ACLs on ZNodes grant excessive permissions to unauthorized clients, allowing them to read, write, or delete sensitive data or critical configuration.
    *   **How Zookeeper Contributes:** Zookeeper's data model relies on ACLs to control access to individual ZNodes. Misconfiguration directly leads to unauthorized data access or manipulation within Zookeeper itself.
    *   **Example:** An ACL on a ZNode containing sensitive application secrets is set to "world:anyone:cdrwa," granting any connecting client full control over that ZNode.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to and potential modification or deletion of sensitive application data or critical configuration stored in Zookeeper, leading to application errors, security breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring ACLs. Grant only the necessary permissions to specific, authenticated users or groups.
        *   Implement regular audits and reviews of ACL configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations.
        *   Favor more restrictive and granular ACL schemes over overly permissive ones.
