### High and Critical Struts Threats

* **Threat:** OGNL Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker can manipulate input parameters (e.g., URL parameters, form data) that are processed by the Struts framework's Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) interpreter. By crafting malicious OGNL expressions, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This often involves exploiting vulnerabilities in how Struts handles user input and evaluates OGNL expressions.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, install malware, or cause a denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:**  OGNL interpreter within the Struts framework, particularly when processing parameters in Actions, ValueStack, or tag attributes.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Upgrade Struts:**  Immediately upgrade to the latest stable and patched version of Apache Struts.
        * **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied data before it reaches the Struts framework.
        * **Avoid Dynamic OGNL Evaluation:**  Minimize or eliminate the use of dynamic OGNL evaluation where user input is directly incorporated.
        * **Use Parameter Interceptors Carefully:**  Configure parameter interceptors to restrict the parameters that can be set.
        * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF with rules to detect and block known OGNL injection patterns.
        * **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly audit the application and conduct penetration testing to identify potential OGNL injection points.

* **Threat:** Namespace Collision Leading to Unintended Action Execution
    * **Description:** An attacker can craft requests with specific namespaces and action names that collide with internal or unintended actions within the Struts framework or application. This can lead to the execution of actions that were not meant to be publicly accessible or that perform sensitive operations without proper authorization. This often exploits wildcard mappings or dynamic method invocation configurations.
    * **Impact:** Execution of unintended application logic, bypassing security checks, potential data manipulation or disclosure, and potentially leading to further exploitation.
    * **Affected Component:**  Struts ActionMapper, Namespace handling, and Action invocation mechanism.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Dynamic Method Invocation:** Explicitly define action mappings in `struts.xml` instead of relying on dynamic method invocation.
        * **Restrict Wildcard Mappings:** Carefully define wildcard mappings and ensure they don't expose sensitive actions or namespaces.
        * **Use Namespaces Effectively:** Organize actions into logical and well-defined namespaces to minimize the risk of collision.
        * **Regularly Review Action Mappings:** Periodically review and audit action mappings in `struts.xml` for potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure actions are only accessible to authorized users based on their roles.

* **Threat:** File Upload Vulnerabilities (Unrestricted File Upload or Path Traversal)
    * **Description:** An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in the Struts file upload interceptor to upload malicious files to arbitrary locations on the server. This can be due to insufficient validation of file names, content types, or upload paths, allowing for path traversal attacks (e.g., using "..") to write files outside the intended upload directory.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution by uploading and executing malicious scripts (e.g., web shells), defacement of the website, or denial of service by filling up disk space.
    * **Affected Component:**  Struts File Upload Interceptor.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Upgrade Struts:** Ensure the application uses a patched version of Struts that addresses known file upload vulnerabilities.
        * **Strict File Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of uploaded files, including file name (sanitize and avoid special characters), extension (whitelist allowed extensions), content type (verify using magic numbers, not just the `Content-Type` header), and size.
        * **Secure File Storage:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot and ensure they are not directly accessible via HTTP.
        * **Randomize File Names:** Rename uploaded files to prevent predictable file names that could be guessed by attackers.
        * **Anti-Virus Scanning:** Integrate anti-virus scanning for uploaded files before they are stored.
        * **Limit Upload Size:** Enforce reasonable limits on the size of uploaded files.
        * **Restrict Upload Paths:**  Explicitly define and restrict the allowed upload directories.

* **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Struts is used for handling serialized objects)
    * **Description:** If the application uses Struts to handle serialized Java objects from untrusted sources (e.g., via HTTP parameters or cookies), attackers can craft malicious serialized objects. When these objects are deserialized by the application, they can execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    * **Affected Component:**  Struts components involved in handling serialized objects, potentially including interceptors or custom action code.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  If possible, avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        * **Use Secure Serialization Mechanisms:**  Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers, which are less prone to deserialization attacks.
        * **Implement Deserialization Filters:**  If deserialization is necessary, implement robust deserialization filters to prevent the instantiation of dangerous classes.
        * **Keep Libraries Up-to-Date:** Ensure all serialization libraries used by the application are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful deserialization attack.
