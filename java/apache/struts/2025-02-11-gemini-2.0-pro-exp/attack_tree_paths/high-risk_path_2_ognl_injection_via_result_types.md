# Deep Analysis of Apache Struts Attack Tree Path: OGNL Injection via Result Types

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the attack vector represented by "High-Risk Path 2: OGNL Injection via Result Types" in the Apache Struts attack tree.  This includes:

*   Identifying the specific vulnerabilities and conditions that enable this attack.
*   Understanding the attacker's methods and potential payloads.
*   Determining the potential impact of a successful attack.
*   Recommending concrete mitigation strategies and best practices to prevent this type of attack.
*   Providing actionable insights for developers to secure their Struts applications.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Apache Struts Framework:**  We are concerned with vulnerabilities within the Struts framework itself, particularly versions susceptible to OGNL injection.  We will consider Struts 2, as it's the most commonly used version.
*   **Result Types:**  The analysis centers on vulnerabilities related to how Struts processes and renders results, especially those using template engines.
*   **OGNL Injection:**  We will examine how attackers can inject malicious OGNL expressions through result types.
*   **Freemarker Template Engine:**  This analysis will use Freemarker as a primary example of a vulnerable template engine, but the principles apply to other template engines (e.g., Velocity) as well.
*   **Code-Level Analysis:** We will consider the underlying code mechanisms that make this attack possible.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** We will focus on practical, code-level and configuration-level mitigations.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors against Struts (e.g., CSRF, XSS, unless directly related to this specific OGNL injection path).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *not* directly related to Struts' result processing.
*   Network-level attacks (e.g., DDoS).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Review known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to OGNL injection in Struts, particularly those involving result types and Freemarker.  Examples include CVE-2017-5638, CVE-2013-2251, and CVE-2018-11776.
2.  **Code Analysis:** Examine the relevant Struts source code (available on GitHub) to understand the internal mechanisms that handle result processing and template rendering.  This will involve looking at classes like `ActionSupport`, `Result`, `FreeMarkerResult`, and the OGNL library itself.
3.  **Exploit Analysis:** Analyze publicly available exploit code and proof-of-concept examples to understand how attackers craft and deliver OGNL injection payloads.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Determine the potential consequences of a successful attack, including remote code execution (RCE), data breaches, and system compromise.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Develop and document specific, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this type of attack. This will include code changes, configuration adjustments, and best practices.
6.  **Documentation:**  Present the findings in a clear, concise, and well-structured report (this document).

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

Let's break down each step of the attack tree path:

### 2.1 [Exploit Class Loading/OGNL Injection Vulnerabilities]

*   **Description:** This is the entry point.  Struts has a history of vulnerabilities related to how it handles class loading and evaluates OGNL expressions.  These vulnerabilities often stem from insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is later used in OGNL contexts.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Class Loading:**  Struts uses a complex class loading mechanism to instantiate actions, results, and other components.  Vulnerabilities can arise if an attacker can manipulate this process to load arbitrary classes or execute malicious code during class initialization.
    *   **OGNL Evaluation:** OGNL is a powerful expression language that allows access to object properties and methods.  Struts uses OGNL extensively for data binding and result rendering.  If user input is directly incorporated into OGNL expressions without proper sanitization, it can be exploited.
*   **CVE Examples:**
    *   CVE-2017-5638 (Content-Type header OGNL injection) is a classic example, although it's not *directly* a result-type vulnerability, it demonstrates the power of OGNL injection.
    *   CVE-2018-11776 (Result-based OGNL injection) is a more direct example related to this attack path.
*   **Underlying Issue:** The core issue is the *trust* placed in user-supplied data.  Struts, in vulnerable configurations, treats user input as potentially safe for inclusion in OGNL expressions.

### 2.2 [OGNL Expression Injection]

*   **Description:** This is the core of the attack.  The attacker crafts a malicious OGNL expression and injects it into the application.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Injection Points:**  The attacker needs to find a way to get their OGNL expression into a context where Struts will evaluate it.  In this attack path, the injection point is within the result configuration or data passed to the result.
    *   **Payload Crafting:**  The OGNL expression is designed to execute arbitrary code on the server.  Common payloads involve:
        *   Accessing the `java.lang.Runtime` class to execute system commands.
        *   Creating new objects or modifying existing objects in memory.
        *   Accessing sensitive data or resources.
    *   **Example Payload (simplified):**
        ```ognl
        #_memberAccess['allowStaticMethodAccess']=true
        @java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec('whoami')
        ```
        This payload (if successfully injected and evaluated) would attempt to execute the `whoami` command on the server.  The first line is often necessary to bypass security restrictions in older Struts versions.
*   **Key Concept:**  The attacker leverages the power of OGNL and the lack of input validation to execute code within the context of the Struts application.

### 2.3 [Vulnerable Result Types]

*   **Description:**  Certain Struts result types are more prone to this vulnerability.  These are typically result types that involve template engines.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Template Engines:**  Template engines (like Freemarker, Velocity) are designed to generate dynamic content by evaluating expressions embedded within templates.  These expressions are often evaluated using OGNL in Struts.
    *   **Unsafe Data Inclusion:**  If user-supplied data is directly included in these template expressions without proper escaping or sanitization, the attacker can inject OGNL code.
    *   **Result Configuration:**  The vulnerability can exist in the Struts configuration file (`struts.xml`) where result types are defined, or in the code that passes data to the result.
*   **Example (struts.xml):**
    ```xml
    <result name="success" type="freemarker">
        <param name="location">/WEB-INF/views/userProfile.ftl</param>
    </result>
    ```
    This configuration defines a Freemarker result.  If `userProfile.ftl` contains an expression like `${userInput}`, and `userInput` is controlled by the attacker, it's vulnerable.

### 2.4 [e.g., Freemarker]

*   **Description:** Freemarker is a widely used template engine often integrated with Struts.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Expression Evaluation:** Freemarker evaluates expressions within `${...}` blocks.  These expressions can be OGNL expressions in a Struts context.
    *   **Directives:** Freemarker also has directives (e.g., `<#if>`, `<#list>`) that can be used to control the template's logic.  While less directly exploitable for OGNL injection, they can be misused if user input influences their behavior.
    *   **Example (userProfile.ftl):**
        ```html
        <h1>Welcome, ${user.name}!</h1>
        ```
        If `user.name` is populated from unsanitized user input, an attacker could inject OGNL code.  For example, if the attacker provides the `user.name` value as:
        ```
        ${#_memberAccess['allowStaticMethodAccess']=true,@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec('id')}
        ```
        The server would attempt to execute the `id` command.
*   **Key Point:**  The vulnerability is not in Freemarker itself, but in how Struts *uses* Freemarker (or any other template engine) without proper input validation.

## 3. Impact Assessment

A successful OGNL injection attack via result types can have severe consequences:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  This is the most critical impact.  The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server, including database credentials, user information, and application configuration.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker can modify system files, install malware, or use the compromised server as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not the primary goal, the attacker could potentially disrupt the application's availability by executing resource-intensive commands.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization running the vulnerable application.

## 4. Mitigation Recommendations

Preventing OGNL injection requires a multi-layered approach:

1.  **Upgrade Struts:**  The most crucial step is to use a patched and up-to-date version of Struts.  Ensure you are using a version that addresses known OGNL injection vulnerabilities.  Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:**  Implement strict input validation based on whitelists.  Only allow expected characters and patterns for each input field.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Context-Specific Escaping:**  Escape user input appropriately for the context in which it will be used.  For example, if user input is displayed in HTML, use HTML escaping.  If it's used in a database query, use parameterized queries or appropriate database escaping.
    *   **Avoid Direct Inclusion in OGNL:**  *Never* directly embed user-supplied data into OGNL expressions, especially within result templates.

3.  **Secure Result Configuration:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Result Parameters:**  Minimize the use of dynamic parameters in result configurations (e.g., avoid passing user input directly as the `location` of a Freemarker template).
    *   **Use Safe Result Types:**  Prefer result types that are less susceptible to OGNL injection, such as `redirectAction` or `dispatcher`.
    *   **Configure Template Engines Securely:**  If using template engines, configure them to be as restrictive as possible.  For example, in Freemarker, you can disable the evaluation of unsafe methods.

4.  **OGNL Expression Sandboxing (Advanced):**
    *   **SecurityManager:**  Consider using a Java SecurityManager to restrict the capabilities of OGNL expressions.  This is a complex but powerful approach.
    *   **Custom OGNL Security Interceptor:**  Develop a custom Struts interceptor that intercepts OGNL evaluation and applies security checks.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   **Signature-Based Detection:**  A WAF can help detect and block known OGNL injection payloads based on signatures.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Some WAFs can detect unusual patterns in requests that might indicate an OGNL injection attempt.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities, including OGNL injection risks.
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in your application's security.

7.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Application User:** Run the Struts application with the least privileged user account necessary.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.
    *   **Database User:**  Use a database user with limited privileges for the application's database access.

8. **Disable Unused Features:** If your application does not require certain Struts features, disable them to reduce the attack surface.

## 5. Example Code Fix (Illustrative)

Let's revisit the vulnerable Freemarker example:

**Vulnerable Code (Action):**

```java
public class UserProfileAction extends ActionSupport {
    private String userInput;

    // Getters and setters for userInput

    public String execute() {
        // ... (some logic) ...
        return SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

**Vulnerable Template (userProfile.ftl):**

```html
<h1>Welcome, ${userInput}!</h1>
```

**Mitigated Code (Action):**

```java
public class UserProfileAction extends ActionSupport {
    private String userInput;
    private String escapedUserInput; // Add a new field for the escaped value

    // Getters and setters for userInput and escapedUserInput

    public String execute() {
        // ... (some logic) ...

        // Sanitize the input (using a hypothetical escapeHtml function)
        escapedUserInput = escapeHtml(userInput);

        return SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

**Mitigated Template (userProfile.ftl):**

```html
<h1>Welcome, ${escapedUserInput}!</h1>
```

**Explanation of Fix:**

*   We introduce a new field, `escapedUserInput`, to store the sanitized version of the user input.
*   Inside the `execute()` method, we call a hypothetical `escapeHtml()` function to sanitize the `userInput` and store the result in `escapedUserInput`.  In a real application, you would use a proper HTML escaping library (e.g., OWASP Java Encoder).
*   The template now uses the `escapedUserInput` variable, ensuring that any potentially malicious characters are properly escaped before being rendered in the HTML.

This example demonstrates a simple but effective mitigation strategy:  **always sanitize user input before using it in any potentially vulnerable context.**
