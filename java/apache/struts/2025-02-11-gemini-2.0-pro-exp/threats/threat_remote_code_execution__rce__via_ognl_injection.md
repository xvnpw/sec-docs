# Deep Analysis: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via OGNL Injection in Apache Struts

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of OGNL injection vulnerabilities in Apache Struts.
*   Identify specific code-level weaknesses that contribute to this vulnerability.
*   Analyze the effectiveness of proposed mitigation strategies.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers to prevent and remediate OGNL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Determine how an attacker might bypass implemented defenses.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on OGNL injection vulnerabilities within the context of Apache Struts applications.  It covers:

*   Vulnerable Struts components and their interaction with OGNL.
*   Common attack vectors and payloads.
*   The impact of different Struts configurations.
*   The effectiveness of various mitigation techniques.
*   Analysis of known CVEs related to Struts OGNL injection.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General web application security best practices (beyond those directly relevant to OGNL injection).
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *unless* they directly interact with Struts' OGNL handling.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:** Examination of the Apache Struts source code (particularly the OGNL integration points) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This includes reviewing relevant classes like `OgnlValueStack`, `ParametersInterceptor`, and result types.
*   **Vulnerability Research:** Analysis of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) and exploit techniques related to Struts OGNL injection.  This includes studying write-ups, proof-of-concept exploits, and patch diffs.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  While we won't be performing live dynamic analysis in this document, we will conceptually describe how dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., fuzzing, debugging) could be used to identify and exploit OGNL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Mitigation Analysis:** Evaluation of the effectiveness of each proposed mitigation strategy, considering potential bypasses and limitations.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Using the existing threat model as a starting point, we will expand on the threat details and explore various attack scenarios.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1. Understanding OGNL

Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) is a powerful expression language used in Struts to access and manipulate data in the `ValueStack`.  It allows developers to:

*   Access object properties (e.g., `user.name`).
*   Call methods (e.g., `user.calculateAge()`).
*   Create new objects (e.g., `#@java.util.ArrayList@{}`).
*   Perform type conversions.

The power of OGNL is also its weakness.  If an attacker can inject arbitrary OGNL expressions, they can leverage these capabilities to execute malicious code.

### 2.2. Attack Vectors

Several common attack vectors exist for OGNL injection:

*   **Unvalidated Action Parameters:** The most common vector.  An attacker injects an OGNL expression into an HTTP request parameter that is directly used in an OGNL expression within the Struts application.  For example:

    ```
    http://example.com/action.action?name=%23%7B%23_memberAccess%5B%22allowStaticMethodAccess%22%5D%3Dtrue%2C%23a%3D%40java.lang.Runtime%40getRuntime().exec('id')%2C%23b%3D%23a.getInputStream()%2C%23c%3Dnew%20java.io.InputStreamReader(%23b)%2C%23d%3Dnew%20java.io.BufferedReader(%23c)%2C%23e%3Dnew%20char%5B50000%5D%2C%23d.read(%23e)%2C%23matt%3D%23context.get(%27com.opensymphony.xwork2.dispatcher.HttpServletResponse%27)%2C%23matt.getWriter().println(%20new%20java.lang.String(%23e))%2C%23matt.getWriter().flush()%2C%23matt.getWriter().close()%7D
    ```
    This URL-encoded payload attempts to execute the `id` command on the server.  It leverages several OGNL features:
    * `#_memberAccess["allowStaticMethodAccess"]=true`: Enables access to static methods (often restricted).
    * `@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec('id')`: Executes the `id` command.
    * The rest of the payload handles reading the output of the command and writing it to the HTTP response.

*   **Double Evaluation:**  Sometimes, Struts might evaluate an OGNL expression twice, leading to vulnerabilities even if the initial input is seemingly sanitized.  This can occur with certain result types or configurations.

*   **Exploiting Type Conversions:**  Struts' type conversion mechanisms can be tricked into executing OGNL expressions.  For example, if a parameter is expected to be an integer, but an attacker provides an OGNL expression, the conversion process might inadvertently evaluate the expression.

*   **Vulnerable Result Types:**  Result types like `redirectAction` and `chain` often use OGNL to determine the next action to execute.  If an attacker can control the parameters used in these result types, they can inject OGNL.

* **Vulnerable Interceptors:** Interceptors like `params` are responsible for populating action properties from request parameters.  Vulnerabilities in these interceptors can allow attackers to inject OGNL.

### 2.3. Code-Level Weaknesses

Several code-level weaknesses contribute to OGNL injection vulnerabilities:

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The core issue is often a lack of proper input validation.  If user-supplied data is directly used in OGNL expressions without proper sanitization or escaping, injection is possible.
*   **Overly Permissive `ValueStack` Access:**  The `ValueStack` provides access to a wide range of objects and methods.  If attackers can inject OGNL, they can potentially access and manipulate sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.
*   **Dynamic Method Invocation:**  Enabling dynamic method invocation (`struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation=true`) allows attackers to call arbitrary methods on objects in the `ValueStack`, significantly increasing the attack surface.
*   **Insecure Type Conversion Handling:**  Weaknesses in how Struts handles type conversions can lead to OGNL evaluation when it's not intended.
*   **Lack of Context Awareness:**  OGNL expressions are often evaluated without sufficient context about the expected data type or format.  This makes it difficult to detect and prevent malicious input.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategy Analysis

Let's analyze the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies:

*   **Update Struts:**  **Highly Effective (Essential).**  This is the most crucial step.  Security patches address known vulnerabilities and often improve the overall security of the OGNL handling mechanisms.  *Limitations:*  Zero-day vulnerabilities may exist, and updates might not be immediately available.

*   **Strict Input Validation:**  **Highly Effective.**  Whitelist-based validation, checking for type, length, format, and allowed characters, prevents a wide range of injection attacks.  *Limitations:*  Complex validation logic can be error-prone, and it's crucial to validate *all* input, not just parameters that are obviously used in OGNL.  Developers must understand all potential OGNL injection points.

*   **OGNL Hardening:**  **Effective (but difficult).**  Sanitizing and escaping input before using it in OGNL can prevent injection.  However, correctly escaping OGNL is complex and error-prone.  Using a safer alternative (e.g., a templating engine that doesn't allow arbitrary code execution) is often a better approach. *Limitations:*  Proper escaping requires a deep understanding of OGNL syntax and potential bypasses.

*   **Disable Dynamic Method Invocation:**  **Effective (if feasible).**  This significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing attackers from calling arbitrary methods.  *Limitations:*  Some applications may rely on dynamic method invocation, making this mitigation impossible.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  **Supplementary Defense.**  A WAF can detect and block known OGNL injection patterns.  *Limitations:*  WAF rules can be bypassed, and they don't address the underlying vulnerability.  A WAF should be considered a secondary layer of defense, not a primary solution.

*   **Security Audits:**  **Essential.**  Regular security audits and penetration tests can identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other methods.  *Limitations:*  Audits are only as good as the auditor's expertise and the scope of the audit.

### 2.5. Bypassing Mitigations

Attackers constantly seek ways to bypass security measures.  Here are some potential bypass techniques:

*   **WAF Bypasses:**  Attackers might use obfuscation techniques, character encoding tricks, or alternative OGNL syntax to evade WAF rules.
*   **Input Validation Bypasses:**  If input validation is not comprehensive or contains flaws, attackers might find ways to inject malicious code.  For example, they might exploit edge cases in the validation logic or use unexpected character encodings.
*   **Double Evaluation Exploits:**  Even with input validation, double evaluation vulnerabilities can still be exploited.
*   **Zero-Day Exploits:**  Attackers might discover and exploit new vulnerabilities before patches are available.

### 2.6. CVE Examples

Several CVEs highlight the severity of OGNL injection vulnerabilities in Struts:

*   **CVE-2017-5638:**  A critical vulnerability in the Jakarta Multipart parser allowed RCE via a crafted `Content-Type` header.  This was a widely exploited vulnerability.
*   **CVE-2018-11776:**  A vulnerability in the `struts2-showcase` plugin allowed RCE due to insufficient validation of user input.
*   **CVE-2016-3081:**  A vulnerability related to dynamic method invocation allowed RCE.
*   **CVE-2013-2251:** ParametersInterceptor vulnerability.

Analyzing these CVEs and their associated patches provides valuable insights into the specific code-level weaknesses and how they were addressed.

## 3. Recommendations

Based on this deep analysis, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Prioritize Updates:**  Maintain an up-to-date Struts version.  Implement a process for promptly applying security patches.
2.  **Comprehensive Input Validation:**  Implement rigorous, whitelist-based input validation for *all* user-supplied data.  Use a centralized validation mechanism to ensure consistency.
3.  **Minimize OGNL Usage:**  Avoid using OGNL to directly evaluate user-supplied data.  Consider safer alternatives like templating engines.
4.  **Disable Dynamic Method Invocation (if possible):**  Set `struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation` to `false` unless absolutely necessary.
5.  **Secure Configuration:**  Review and harden the Struts configuration, paying close attention to result types and interceptors.
6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
7.  **WAF as a Supplementary Defense:**  Use a WAF with rules specifically designed for Struts OGNL injection, but do not rely on it as the sole defense.
8.  **Developer Training:**  Educate developers about OGNL injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
9.  **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect potential exploitation attempts.
10. **Use a Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tool:** Integrate a SAST tool into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for OGNL injection vulnerabilities during development.
11. **Use a Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST) tool:** Regularly run DAST scans against your deployed application to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by SAST.
