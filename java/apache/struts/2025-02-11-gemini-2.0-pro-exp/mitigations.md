# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/struts

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict OGNL Expression Validation (Whitelist Approach)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_ognl_expression_validation__whitelist_approach_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify All OGNL Usages:**  Thoroughly review all JSPs, action configurations (`struts.xml`), and any custom tag libraries to identify *every* instance where OGNL expressions are used.  This includes implicit uses (e.g., within `<s:property>` tags).
    2.  **Define Allowed Expressions:** For each identified OGNL usage, create a precise whitelist of *exactly* what is allowed.  This should be as restrictive as possible.  For example, instead of allowing `user.address.*`, allow only `user.address.street`, `user.address.city`, `user.address.zip`.
    3.  **Implement Validation:**
        *   **Option A (Preferred): Custom `SecurityMemberAccess`:** Create a custom implementation of the `com.opensymphony.xwork2.security.SecurityMemberAccess` interface.  Override the `isAccessible()` method to enforce your whitelist.  This provides the most granular control.  Register this custom implementation in your `struts.xml` or `struts.properties`.
        *   **Option B (Less Preferred, but easier): `params` Interceptor:** Use the `params` interceptor's `excludeParams` and `allowedMethods` parameters to *restrict* access.  This is a *blacklist* approach, so it's less secure than a whitelist, but it can be a useful starting point.  *Combine this with Option A for best results.*
        *   **Option C (Least Preferred): Hardcoded Checks:**  As a last resort, you could add hardcoded checks within your action classes to validate OGNL expressions before they are used.  This is error-prone and difficult to maintain.
    4.  **Testing:**  Thoroughly test each OGNL usage with both valid and invalid inputs to ensure the whitelist is working correctly.  Include negative tests (attempts to access disallowed properties or methods).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **OGNL Injection (Remote Code Execution - RCE):**  Severity: **Critical**.  Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Data Exposure:** Severity: **High**.  Attackers could potentially access sensitive data not intended for display.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Severity: **High**.  Attackers might be able to elevate their privileges within the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **OGNL Injection (RCE):** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low** (with a well-implemented whitelist).
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** `params` interceptor configured in `struts.xml` with a basic `excludeParams` list (blacklist approach).  Custom `SecurityMemberAccess` *not* implemented.  Hardcoded checks in `UserAction` for specific OGNL expressions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Critical:**  A comprehensive custom `SecurityMemberAccess` implementation is missing.  This is the highest priority.
    *   **High:**  The `excludeParams` list in `struts.xml` needs to be reviewed and expanded to be more comprehensive (even though it's a blacklist).
    *   **Medium:**  Hardcoded checks in action classes should be replaced with the `SecurityMemberAccess` implementation.
    *   **Low:** A full audit of *all* OGNL usage points is needed to ensure no expressions are missed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Class Loader Access](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_class_loader_access.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Potentially Dangerous Classes/Packages:**  Create a list of classes and packages that should *never* be accessible through Struts' class loading mechanisms.  This includes classes related to system administration, reflection, networking, and file I/O.
    2.  **Configure `struts.excludedClasses` and `struts.excludedPackageNames`:**  In your `struts.properties` or `struts.xml` file, use these properties to specify the classes and packages to exclude.  This is a *blacklist* approach.
    3.  **Testing:**  Attempt to access restricted classes through Struts (e.g., using OGNL expressions) to verify that the restrictions are working.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Class Loading (RCE):** Severity: **Critical**.  Attackers could instantiate arbitrary classes, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Resource Access Violations:** Severity: **High**.  Attackers might gain access to files, network resources, or other system resources they shouldn't have access to.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Class Loading (RCE):** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Medium** (with a well-maintained blacklist).
    *   **Resource Access Violations:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Medium**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** Basic `struts.excludedClasses` and `struts.excludedPackageNames` configuration in `struts.properties`, but the list is incomplete.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **High:**  The `struts.excludedClasses` and `struts.excludedPackageNames` lists need to be thoroughly reviewed and expanded.  This should be an ongoing process as new potential attack vectors are discovered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Parameter Filtering (Whitelist Approach)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_parameter_filtering__whitelist_approach_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify All Action Methods:**  List all methods in your action classes that are intended to be invoked by user requests.
    2.  **Define Allowed Methods:**  Use the `params` interceptor's `allowedMethods` parameter in `struts.xml` to explicitly list the allowed methods for each action.  This is a *whitelist* approach.
    3.  **Define Allowed Action Names (if applicable):** If you use action names (e.g., in URLs), use the `allowedActionNames` parameter to restrict which action names are allowed.
    4.  **Disable Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI):**  Set `struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation` to `false` in `struts.properties` to prevent attackers from invoking arbitrary methods.
    5.  **Testing:**  Attempt to invoke disallowed methods or action names through URLs or form submissions to verify the restrictions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Parameter Tampering (Method Invocation):** Severity: **High**.  Attackers could invoke unintended methods on your action classes.
    *   **Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) Attacks:** Severity: **High**.  Attackers could invoke arbitrary methods.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Parameter Tampering (Method Invocation):** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.
    *   **DMI Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **None** (if DMI is disabled).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** `struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation` is set to `false`.  `allowedMethods` is *not* used.  `excludeParams` is used (blacklist), but not comprehensively.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Critical:**  Implement `allowedMethods` in `struts.xml` for all actions.  This is the most important missing piece.
    *   **Medium:**  Review and improve the `excludeParams` configuration (even though it's a blacklist).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Redirect URLs and Avoid `chain` Result](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_redirect_urls_and_avoid__chain__result.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid `chain`:**  Do not use the `chain` result type.  Use `redirectAction` or `redirect` instead.
    2.  **Identify Redirect Usages:**  Find all instances where `redirect` or `redirectAction` are used.
    3.  **Validate Redirect Targets:**
        *   **Option A (Preferred): Whitelist:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed redirect URLs or URL patterns within your Struts configuration or application logic. Only redirect to URLs that match the whitelist.
        *   **Option B (Less Preferred): Sanitization:** If a whitelist is not feasible, thoroughly sanitize any user-supplied data that is used to construct the redirect URL within your Struts action. Remove or escape any characters that could be used for open redirect attacks (e.g., `//`, `\`, etc.). *This is less secure than a whitelist.*
        *   **Option C (Avoid): Relative Redirects:** Use relative redirects whenever possible. This reduces the attack surface.
    4.  **Testing:**  Attempt to inject malicious URLs into redirect parameters to verify that the validation/sanitization is working.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect:** Severity: **Medium**.  Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (in some cases):** Severity: **High**.  Open redirects can sometimes be used to inject malicious scripts.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirect:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low** (with a whitelist) or **Medium-Low** (with sanitization).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced indirectly (by preventing open redirects that could be used for XSS).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:** `chain` result type is *not* used.  Some basic sanitization of redirect URLs is performed, but no whitelist is used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **High:**  Implement a whitelist of allowed redirect URLs if feasible, ideally within the Struts configuration.
    *   **Medium:**  Improve the sanitization logic to be more robust and comprehensive.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Struts Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_struts_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Security Announcements:** Subscribe to the Apache Struts security mailing list and monitor other security advisories.
    2.  **Use Dependency Management:** Use a tool like Maven or Gradle to manage Struts dependencies.
    3.  **Regular Updates:**  Establish a regular schedule for updating Struts to the latest stable version.  Apply security patches *immediately* upon release.
    4.  **Testing:**  After updating Struts, thoroughly test the application to ensure that the update did not introduce any regressions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All Known Struts Vulnerabilities:** Severity: Varies (from **Low** to **Critical**).  This mitigates *all* vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and patched.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All Known Struts Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (depending on the specific vulnerabilities patched).  This is the *single most important* mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Example:**  Struts is updated periodically, but not immediately upon the release of security patches.  Dependency management is used (Maven).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **High:**  Establish a process for applying security patches *immediately* upon release.
    *   **Medium:**  Improve the testing process after Struts updates to ensure comprehensive regression testing.
