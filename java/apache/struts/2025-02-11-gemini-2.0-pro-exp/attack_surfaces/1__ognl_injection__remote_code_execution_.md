# Deep Analysis: OGNL Injection in Apache Struts

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the OGNL Injection vulnerability in Apache Struts, identify specific attack vectors within a Struts-based application, and provide actionable recommendations for developers to mitigate this critical risk.  This analysis goes beyond general descriptions and delves into the technical details of how Struts uses OGNL and how attackers exploit it.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on OGNL Injection vulnerabilities within the context of Apache Struts.  It covers:

*   The role of OGNL in Struts' architecture.
*   Common injection points and attack patterns.
*   Struts-specific configuration and code-level vulnerabilities.
*   Detailed mitigation strategies, including code examples and configuration best practices.
*   Limitations of various mitigation approaches.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) unless they directly relate to OGNL exploitation.
*   General web application security best practices that are not directly related to OGNL.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *unless* they are commonly used in conjunction with Struts and exacerbate OGNL vulnerabilities.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis is based on a combination of:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Reviewing publicly disclosed CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related to OGNL injection in Struts (e.g., CVE-2017-5638, CVE-2018-11776, CVE-2013-2251, and many others).  Examining exploit code and proof-of-concept demonstrations.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analyzing hypothetical Struts application code snippets to identify potential injection points.  This includes examining Struts configuration files (`struts.xml`, annotations), Action classes, and JSP pages.  We'll assume a representative Struts application.
3.  **Struts Documentation Analysis:**  Deeply understanding the official Apache Struts documentation, particularly sections related to OGNL, expression language, tag libraries, and security configurations.
4.  **Best Practices Review:**  Incorporating industry-standard security best practices for input validation, whitelisting, and secure coding.
5.  **Tool-Assisted Analysis (Conceptual):**  Describing how static analysis tools (e.g., FindSecBugs, SonarQube) and dynamic analysis tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) *could* be used to identify and test for OGNL injection vulnerabilities.  We won't perform actual tool-based analysis, but we'll explain the methodology.

## 4. Deep Analysis of OGNL Injection Attack Surface

### 4.1. OGNL's Role in Struts

OGNL is deeply integrated into Struts for several key purposes:

*   **Value Stack Access:**  The Value Stack is Struts' central data repository.  OGNL provides the mechanism to access and manipulate objects on the Value Stack from JSPs, configuration files, and Action classes.
*   **Data Binding:**  OGNL is used to bind user input from HTTP requests (parameters, headers) to Action class properties.  This is where the primary injection risk lies.
*   **Tag Library Evaluation:**  Struts' tag libraries (e.g., `<s:textfield>`, `<s:form>`) heavily rely on OGNL to evaluate expressions and render dynamic content.  Attributes of these tags are often evaluated as OGNL expressions.
*   **Result Type Processing:**  Struts uses OGNL in result types (e.g., `redirect`, `redirectAction`, `chain`) to determine the next action or view to render.  Dynamic values in these result types can be injection points.
*   **Type Conversion:** OGNL handles type conversion between strings (from HTTP requests) and Java objects.

### 4.2. Common Injection Points and Attack Patterns

Attackers exploit OGNL injection by injecting malicious OGNL expressions into any input that Struts processes.  Here are the most common injection points:

*   **URL Parameters:**  The most frequent attack vector.  Attackers craft malicious URL parameters that are then used in OGNL expressions.  Example: `http://example.com/action.action?name=${exploit_code}`.
*   **Form Fields:**  Input fields in HTML forms are another common target.  If the form data is not properly validated before being used in an OGNL expression, an attacker can inject malicious code.
*   **HTTP Headers:**  Less common, but still possible.  Attackers can manipulate HTTP headers (e.g., `Cookie`, `Referer`) to inject OGNL expressions.
*   **Struts Tag Attributes:**  Many Struts tags have attributes that are evaluated as OGNL expressions.  For example, the `value` attribute of `<s:textfield>` or the `action` attribute of `<s:a>`.
*   **Result Type Parameters:**  Dynamic parameters in result types like `redirect` and `redirectAction` are particularly vulnerable.  Example: `<result type="redirectAction">${malicious_expression}</result>`.
* **Double Evaluation:** Some configurations or coding practices can lead to OGNL expressions being evaluated *twice*, significantly increasing the risk. This often happens when user input is used to construct an OGNL expression that is *then* evaluated.

**Attack Patterns:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The most severe attack.  Attackers use OGNL to execute arbitrary operating system commands.  This often involves using Java reflection to bypass security restrictions.  The example in the original prompt demonstrates this.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can use OGNL to access sensitive data on the Value Stack or from the server's environment.  For example, they might access database credentials or system properties.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can inject OGNL expressions that cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Bypassing Security Mechanisms:**  Attackers can use OGNL to disable or bypass Struts' security features, making the application more vulnerable to other attacks.

### 4.3. Struts-Specific Configuration and Code-Level Vulnerabilities

Several Struts configuration settings and coding practices can increase the risk of OGNL injection:

*   **Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI):**  DMI allows methods to be called directly from URL parameters.  While convenient, it's a major security risk and should be disabled unless absolutely necessary.  Configuration: `struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation = false` (in `struts.xml` or `struts.properties`).
*   **`altSyntax` Enabled:**  The `altSyntax` feature (enabled by default in older Struts versions) allows OGNL expressions to be embedded directly within tag attributes without the `${...}` delimiters.  This makes it easier for attackers to inject code.  Configuration: `struts.tag.altSyntax = false`.
*   **Insufficient `SecurityMemberAccess` Configuration:**  `SecurityMemberAccess` is Struts' primary mechanism for controlling which classes and methods can be accessed via OGNL.  A poorly configured `SecurityMemberAccess` (or the default configuration) can allow attackers to access dangerous classes like `java.lang.Runtime`.  This requires careful whitelisting.
*   **Using User Input to Construct OGNL Expressions:**  The most dangerous practice.  *Never* concatenate user input directly into an OGNL expression.  Example (Vulnerable): `String expression = "user." + userInput + ".name";`.  Example (Safer): `user.name` (if `userInput` is not needed).
*   **Improper Use of `TextParseUtil.translateVariables`:** This utility method can evaluate OGNL expressions. If used with untrusted input, it's a direct injection point.
*   **Vulnerable Result Types:** Using `redirect` or `redirectAction` with parameters derived from user input without proper validation. Example (Vulnerable): `<result type="redirect">${userInput}</result>`.
* **Outdated Struts Version:** Using an outdated version of Struts that contains known OGNL injection vulnerabilities is a critical risk.

### 4.4. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

Here are detailed mitigation strategies, with code examples and configuration best practices:

1.  **Immediate Security Patching (Highest Priority):**

    *   **Action:**  Subscribe to the Apache Struts security announcements and apply patches *immediately* upon release.  This is the single most important ongoing mitigation.
    *   **Verification:**  Regularly check the Struts website for security advisories and use a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to ensure you're using the latest patched version.

2.  **Strict OGNL Whitelisting with `SecurityMemberAccess`:**

    *   **Action:**  Configure `SecurityMemberAccess` to *strictly* whitelist allowed classes, methods, and packages.  Start with a very restrictive configuration and add only what's absolutely necessary.
    *   **Example (`struts.xml`):**

        ```xml
        <bean type="com.opensymphony.xwork2.ognl.SecurityMemberAccess" name="mySecurityMemberAccess" class="com.opensymphony.xwork2.ognl.SecurityMemberAccess" static="true">
            <property name="allowStaticMethodAccess" value="false"/>
            <property name="excludedClasses" value="java.lang.Runtime, java.lang.Process, java.lang.ProcessBuilder, ..."/>
            <property name="excludedPackageNames" value="java.lang, java.net, ..."/>
            <property name="excludedPackageNamePatterns" value="^java\.io\..*, ^javax\..*"/>
            <property name="allowPackageProtectedAccess" value="false"/>
            <property name="allowProtectedAccess" value="false"/>
            <property name="allowPrivateAccess" value="false"/>
        </bean>

        <constant name="struts.ognl.securityMemberAccess" value="mySecurityMemberAccess"/>
        ```
        *Explanation:* This example shows a basic configuration.  You'll need to customize `excludedClasses`, `excludedPackageNames`, and `excludedPackageNamePatterns` based on your application's specific needs.  The goal is to prevent access to any classes or methods that could be used to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive resources.  It is *highly recommended* to use a whitelist approach instead of a blacklist approach.  This example shows a blacklist for demonstration, but a whitelist is far more secure.

    *   **Limitations:**  `SecurityMemberAccess` can be complex to configure correctly.  It's possible to accidentally block legitimate access or miss a dangerous class.  Regular testing and security reviews are essential.

3.  **Input Validation (Framework Level):**

    *   **Action:**  Use Struts' built-in validation framework (Validators) to enforce strict input validation *before* any data reaches OGNL evaluation.
    *   **Example (using annotations in Action class):**

        ```java
        import com.opensymphony.xwork2.validator.annotations.*;

        public class MyAction extends ActionSupport {

            private String username;

            @RequiredStringValidator(message = "Username is required.")
            @RegexFieldValidator(expression = "^[a-zA-Z0-9]{4,16}$", message = "Username must be 4-16 alphanumeric characters.")
            public void setUsername(String username) {
                this.username = username;
            }

            public String getUsername() {
                return username;
            }

            // ... other action methods ...
        }
        ```
        *Explanation:* This example uses `@RequiredStringValidator` to ensure the `username` field is not empty and `@RegexFieldValidator` to enforce a specific pattern (4-16 alphanumeric characters).  Struts provides a wide range of built-in validators.  You can also create custom validators.

    *   **Example (using XML validation in `validation.xml`):**
        ```xml
        <!DOCTYPE validators PUBLIC
                "-//Apache Struts//XWork Validator 1.0.3//EN"
                "http://struts.apache.org/dtds/xwork-validator-1.0.3.dtd">
        <validators>
            <field name="username">
                <field-validator type="requiredstring">
                    <message>Username is required.</message>
                </field-validator>
                <field-validator type="regex">
                    <param name="expression"><![CDATA[[a-zA-Z0-9]{4,16}]]></param>
                    <message>Username must be 4-16 alphanumeric characters.</message>
                </field-validator>
            </field>
        </validators>
        ```
    *   **Limitations:**  Input validation can be bypassed if the validation rules are not comprehensive enough or if there are flaws in the validation logic.  It's crucial to test all validation rules thoroughly.

4.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:**

    *   **Action:**  Disable Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI) and `altSyntax` if they are not strictly required.
    *   **Example (`struts.xml`):**

        ```xml
        <constant name="struts.enable.DynamicMethodInvocation" value="false"/>
        <constant name="struts.tag.altSyntax" value="false"/>
        ```

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF) (Supplementary):**

    *   **Action:**  Deploy a WAF to help detect and block common OGNL injection patterns.
    *   **Configuration:**  Configure the WAF with rules specifically designed to detect OGNL injection attempts.  Many WAFs have pre-built rules for Struts vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limitations:**  A WAF is a *supplementary* defense, not a primary one.  Attackers can often bypass WAF rules with sophisticated techniques.  A WAF should *never* be relied upon as the sole protection against OGNL injection.

6.  **Secure Coding Practices:**

    *   **Avoid Dynamic OGNL:**  Do not construct OGNL expressions dynamically using user input.  Use direct property access whenever possible.
    *   **Sanitize User Input:**  Even with framework-level validation, consider sanitizing user input before using it in any context, including logging or display.  This can help prevent other types of injection attacks.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application runs with the least necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they successfully exploit an OGNL injection vulnerability.

7. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Action:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including OGNL injection.
    * **Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools (FindSecBugs, SonarQube) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase. Employ dynamic analysis tools (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP) to test for OGNL injection during runtime.

### 4.5. Tool-Assisted Analysis (Conceptual)

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   **Tools:** FindSecBugs (a FindBugs/SpotBugs plugin), SonarQube, Fortify SCA.
    *   **Methodology:** These tools analyze the application's source code (Java, JSP, XML configuration) to identify potential OGNL injection vulnerabilities.  They look for patterns like:
        *   User input being used directly in OGNL expressions.
        *   Calls to `TextParseUtil.translateVariables` with untrusted input.
        *   Misconfigured `SecurityMemberAccess`.
        *   Use of DMI or `altSyntax`.
    *   **Limitations:** Static analysis tools can produce false positives (reporting vulnerabilities that don't actually exist) and false negatives (missing real vulnerabilities).  Manual review of the results is essential.

*   **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Tools:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Acunetix.
    *   **Methodology:** These tools intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses to test for OGNL injection vulnerabilities.  They can:
        *   Automatically inject common OGNL payloads into parameters, headers, and form fields.
        *   Monitor the application's responses for signs of successful injection (e.g., error messages, unexpected output, command execution).
        *   Fuzz the application with a wide range of inputs to discover edge cases.
    *   **Limitations:** Dynamic analysis requires a running application and may not cover all possible code paths.  It's also important to configure the tools correctly to avoid false positives and negatives.

## 5. Conclusion

OGNL injection is a critical vulnerability in Apache Struts that can lead to complete server compromise.  Mitigating this risk requires a multi-layered approach, including immediate security patching, strict OGNL whitelisting, rigorous input validation, disabling unnecessary features, secure coding practices, and regular security testing.  Developers must understand the role of OGNL in Struts and the specific ways attackers exploit it to effectively protect their applications.  A proactive and defense-in-depth strategy is essential to minimize the attack surface and prevent OGNL injection attacks.
