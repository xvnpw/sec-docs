# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache Struts project is a mature, open-source framework for building enterprise-grade Java web applications. It's been around for a long time and has a large, established user base. Given its maturity and widespread use, the business posture emphasizes stability, maintainability, and backward compatibility, while also needing to address evolving security threats.

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Maintainability: Ensure the framework is easy to maintain and update, given its long lifespan and the volunteer nature of many contributors.
*   Stability: Provide a stable and reliable platform for existing applications. Many organizations rely on Struts, and breaking changes can have significant consequences.
*   Security: Address security vulnerabilities promptly and effectively. Struts has been the target of high-profile security exploits in the past, making security a top priority.
*   Community Support: Foster a vibrant and active community to support users and contributors.
*   Backward Compatibility (where possible): Minimize breaking changes to avoid disrupting existing applications.
*   Modernization: Incrementally modernize the framework to support newer Java features and web development practices, without sacrificing stability.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Reputational Damage: Another major security breach could severely damage the reputation of the Apache Struts project and the Apache Software Foundation.
*   Loss of User Base: If the framework becomes too difficult to maintain or use, or if security concerns are not addressed, users may migrate to other frameworks.
*   Contributor Burnout: Reliance on volunteer contributors can lead to burnout and slow down development and maintenance.
*   Legacy Codebase: Maintaining a large, mature codebase can be challenging and may hinder the adoption of new technologies and practices.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC): The Apache Software Foundation has general security guidelines, and the Struts project likely follows some form of SSDLC, though specifics may vary. This includes vulnerability reporting processes and security advisories. (Described in Apache Security guidelines and Struts security documentation).
*   security control: Input Validation: Struts provides mechanisms for validating user input, such as the Validation Framework and declarative validation using XML or annotations. (Described in Struts documentation).
*   security control: Output Encoding: Struts encourages proper output encoding to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. (Described in Struts documentation).
*   security control: Regular Security Updates: The Struts team releases security updates to address vulnerabilities as they are discovered. (Described in Struts security advisories).
*   security control: Community Security Reporting: A process for reporting security vulnerabilities to the Struts security team. (Described in Struts security documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity: The framework's complexity can make it challenging to fully understand and secure all possible attack vectors.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies: Struts relies on third-party libraries, which may introduce their own security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: User Misconfiguration: Struts can be misconfigured by users, leading to security vulnerabilities. This is a common issue with frameworks.
*   accepted risk: Legacy Features: Some older features of Struts may be less secure than newer alternatives, but are maintained for backward compatibility.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to track and manage third-party dependencies and identify known vulnerabilities in those libraries.
*   security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Regularly perform DAST scans on running instances of Struts applications to identify vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Security Training for Contributors: Provide regular security training to contributors to improve security awareness and coding practices.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Struts itself does not provide a built-in authentication mechanism. It relies on the underlying application server or a separate security framework (like Spring Security or Apache Shiro) for authentication.
    *   Requirement: Integrate with a robust authentication system that supports industry-standard protocols and best practices.
*   Authorization:
    *   Struts provides basic interceptor-based authorization capabilities.
    *   Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to restrict access to resources based on user roles and permissions. Consider using a dedicated authorization framework for more complex scenarios.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Struts provides built-in validation mechanisms.
    *   Requirement: Thoroughly validate all user input on both the client-side (for usability) and server-side (for security) to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Struts does not handle cryptography directly but relies on Java's built-in cryptographic libraries or external libraries.
    *   Requirement: Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries for all sensitive data, including passwords, session tokens, and any data transmitted over the network. Follow best practices for key management.

```

Build Process Description:

2.  Local Build: Developer performs a local build using Maven or Gradle to compile the code, run unit tests, and package the application.
3.  Git Commit: Developer commits the code changes to a local Git repository.
4.  Git Push: Developer pushes the changes to a remote Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
5.  CI Server Trigger: The push to the remote repository triggers the CI/CD pipeline on a CI server (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
6.  Build: The CI server checks out the code and executes the build process (using Maven or Gradle).
7.  SAST: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools (e.g., FindBugs, SonarQube) are run to analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities.
8.  Unit & Integration Tests: Unit and integration tests are executed to verify the functionality of the code.
9.  SCA: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) are run to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
10. Package: The application is packaged into a WAR or JAR file.
11. Docker Build: A Docker image is built, containing the packaged application and its dependencies.
12. Docker Push: The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   SAST: Identifies potential vulnerabilities in the source code.
*   SCA: Identifies known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   Automated Testing: Ensures code quality and helps prevent regressions.
*   Secure CI/CD Configuration: Access controls and secure configuration of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Image Scanning: Scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
