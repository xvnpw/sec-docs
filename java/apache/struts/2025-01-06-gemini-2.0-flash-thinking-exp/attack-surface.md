# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/struts

## Attack Surface: [OGNL Injection](./attack_surfaces/ognl_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions into input fields or parameters. When Struts processes these expressions, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**How Struts Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Struts extensively uses OGNL for data access, type conversion, and workflow management. This deep integration makes it a prime target for OGNL injection if input is not properly sanitized. Certain Struts tags and configurations directly evaluate OGNL expressions.

**Example:** An attacker might craft a URL like `http://example.com/index.action?name=%{T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('malicious_command')}` where the `name` parameter is processed as an OGNL expression, executing the `malicious_command` on the server.

**Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic OGNL Evaluation:**  Whenever possible, avoid allowing user-controlled input to be directly evaluated as OGNL expressions.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user input before it's processed by Struts. Use allow-lists rather than deny-lists.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode output data to prevent the interpretation of malicious scripts or commands.
    *   **Update Struts:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of Struts, which includes patches for known OGNL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** If Struts is configured to deserialize untrusted data without proper validation, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

**How Struts Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  Certain Struts features or plugins might involve the deserialization of data, such as session management or data transfer. If this deserialization process doesn't adequately protect against malicious payloads, it becomes an attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker could send a crafted serialized Java object within a request. If Struts deserializes this object without proper checks, the malicious code embedded within the object can be executed.

**Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, similar to OGNL injection.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  Minimize or eliminate the need to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
    *   **Use Safe Deserialization Mechanisms:** If deserialization is necessary, use secure alternatives or carefully validate the data being deserialized. Consider using allow-lists for expected classes.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Ensure all libraries used by Struts, including those handling deserialization, are updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   **Implement Security Managers:**  Configure and enforce Java Security Manager policies to restrict the actions that deserialized objects can perform.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Improper handling of file uploads can allow attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells), overwrite critical system files, or cause denial-of-service.

**How Struts Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Struts provides built-in mechanisms for handling file uploads. If these mechanisms are not configured and implemented securely, they can become an attack vector. This includes issues with file type validation, file size limits, and storage location.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image. If the server doesn't properly validate the file content and saves it in a publicly accessible directory, the attacker can then access and execute the web shell.

**Impact:** High. Can lead to remote code execution (through web shells), data breaches, or service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation to ensure only expected file types are accepted. Do not rely solely on client-side validation.
    *   **Content-Based Validation:**  Inspect the actual content of the uploaded file (e.g., using magic numbers) rather than just relying on the file extension.
    *   **Randomized Filenames:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent attackers from predicting filenames and accessing them directly.
    *   **Secure Storage Location:** Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location that is not directly accessible by web requests.
    *   **File Size Limits:** Enforce appropriate file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **Anti-Virus Scanning:** Integrate with anti-virus software to scan uploaded files for malware.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Struts Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_struts_plugins.md)

**Description:**  Third-party or even official Struts plugins can contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

**How Struts Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Struts' modular architecture allows for the use of plugins to extend its functionality. If these plugins are not developed or maintained securely, they can introduce new attack vectors.

**Example:** The Struts REST plugin has had several known vulnerabilities related to handling XML and JSON data, leading to remote code execution.

**Impact:** Medium to Critical. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the plugin. Remote code execution is a possibility.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   **Use Reputable Plugins:** Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update all Struts plugins to the latest versions, which often include security patches.
    *   **Security Audits of Plugins:** If developing custom plugins, conduct thorough security audits and follow secure coding practices.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only install and enable necessary plugins to reduce the attack surface.
