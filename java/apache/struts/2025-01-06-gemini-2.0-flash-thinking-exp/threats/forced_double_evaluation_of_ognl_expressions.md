## Deep Analysis: Forced Double Evaluation of OGNL Expressions in Apache Struts

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Forced Double Evaluation of OGNL Expressions" threat within the context of an application using Apache Struts. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the threat, its potential impact, and effective mitigation strategies.

**1. Understanding the Threat:**

The core of this threat lies in the way Apache Struts utilizes the Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) for data access and manipulation. OGNL expressions are powerful, allowing access to object properties, method calls, and even static members. However, if an attacker can manipulate the context in which an OGNL expression is evaluated, and force a second evaluation, they can potentially bypass initial security checks or trigger unintended actions.

**Key Concepts:**

* **OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language):** A powerful expression language used by Struts to access and manipulate data within the application's Value Stack.
* **Value Stack:** A runtime data structure in Struts that holds objects related to the current request, including the Action, model, and request/session/application attributes. OGNL expressions operate on this stack.
* **Interceptors:** Components in the Struts framework that intercept requests before and after the Action execution. They are often used for security checks, data validation, and other pre/post-processing tasks.
* **Evaluation Context:** The environment in which an OGNL expression is evaluated, including the Value Stack and other relevant objects.

**How Double Evaluation Occurs:**

The double evaluation typically happens due to specific configurations or coding patterns that unintentionally trigger the evaluation of an OGNL expression more than once within the same request lifecycle. This can manifest in several ways:

* **Interceptor Chaining and Value Stack Manipulation:** An initial interceptor might evaluate an OGNL expression for validation or data binding. Subsequently, another interceptor or the Action itself might re-evaluate a similar or the same expression, but with a potentially altered Value Stack due to the first evaluation.
* **Configuration Issues:** Incorrectly configured Struts components or custom interceptors might lead to redundant evaluation logic.
* **Developer Coding Errors:**  Developers might inadvertently write code that triggers the evaluation of OGNL expressions multiple times, especially when dealing with dynamic forms or complex data binding scenarios.
* **Exploiting Specific Struts Features:** Certain Struts features, if not used carefully, can create opportunities for double evaluation. For example, features related to dynamic method invocation or parameter injection could be vulnerable.

**2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through various attack vectors, often involving manipulating user input or request parameters:

* **Malicious Form Input:** An attacker could craft malicious input in form fields that, when processed by Struts, leads to an initial OGNL evaluation for validation. They then manipulate other parameters or input fields that, during a subsequent evaluation, bypass the initial checks or trigger malicious actions.
* **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Similar to form input, attackers can manipulate URL parameters to influence the evaluation context and force a double evaluation.
* **Header Manipulation:** In some scenarios, attackers might be able to manipulate HTTP headers to influence the evaluation process, although this is less common.

**Example Scenario (Simplified):**

Imagine an application with an interceptor that checks if a user has "admin" privileges based on an OGNL expression like `#session.user.role == 'admin'`.

1. **First Evaluation:** The interceptor evaluates this expression based on the initial state of the session.
2. **Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a request that, through another part of the application logic (e.g., a vulnerable action or another interceptor), allows them to modify the `session.user.role` value.
3. **Second Evaluation:** A subsequent evaluation of the same or a similar OGNL expression (perhaps in the Action execution or another interceptor) now occurs with the modified `session.user.role`, potentially bypassing the initial security check.

**3. Impact Analysis:**

The impact of a successful "Forced Double Evaluation of OGNL Expressions" attack can be severe:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical impact. If the attacker can manipulate the evaluation context to execute arbitrary code on the server, they gain complete control over the application and the underlying system. This can be achieved by manipulating OGNL expressions to call static methods or access system resources.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers can elevate their privileges within the application by bypassing authentication or authorization checks through double evaluation. They could gain access to functionalities or data they are not normally authorized to access.
* **Data Breach:** By manipulating the evaluation context, attackers might be able to access or modify sensitive data stored within the application's Value Stack or backend systems.
* **Bypassing Security Checks:** The core mechanism of this attack is the ability to circumvent security measures implemented using OGNL expressions. This can lead to various other vulnerabilities being exploited.

**4. Risk Severity Assessment:**

As stated in the threat description, the risk severity is **High**. This is due to the potential for critical impacts like RCE and privilege escalation. The ease of exploitation can vary depending on the specific application logic and configuration, but the potential consequences warrant a high-risk classification.

**5. Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing forced double evaluation requires a multi-layered approach focusing on secure coding practices, proper configuration, and leveraging Struts' security features:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before it is used in OGNL expressions or any application logic. This can prevent attackers from injecting malicious payloads that manipulate the evaluation context.
* **Output Encoding:** Encode data before displaying it to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which can sometimes be related to OGNL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the application components and users only the necessary permissions. This limits the potential damage if an attacker manages to exploit a vulnerability.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid Redundant OGNL Evaluation:** Carefully review the application's code and configuration to identify and eliminate scenarios where OGNL expressions are evaluated multiple times unnecessarily.
    * **Minimize OGNL Usage in Security-Critical Contexts:** When possible, avoid relying solely on OGNL expressions for critical security checks. Implement robust authorization mechanisms that are less susceptible to manipulation.
    * **Be Cautious with Dynamic OGNL:** Avoid constructing OGNL expressions dynamically based on user input. This significantly increases the risk of injection attacks.
    * **Thoroughly Test Interceptor Logic:** Ensure that interceptors are designed and implemented in a way that prevents unintended side effects or manipulation of the Value Stack that could lead to double evaluation.
* **Leverage Struts Security Features:**
    * **`struts.ognl.allowStaticMethodAccess`:**  Carefully manage the `struts.ognl.allowStaticMethodAccess` setting. Disabling it (setting it to `false`) significantly reduces the attack surface by preventing the execution of arbitrary static methods through OGNL.
    * **`struts.mapper.alwaysSelectFullNamespace`:**  Ensure this setting is properly configured to prevent namespace manipulation vulnerabilities.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to mitigate XSS attacks, which can sometimes be a precursor to or related to OGNL injection.
* **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep the Apache Struts framework and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches. Many known OGNL-related vulnerabilities have been addressed in newer versions.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious requests that attempt to exploit OGNL injection vulnerabilities. WAFs can often identify patterns associated with known attacks.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities, including those related to OGNL double evaluation. Focus on reviewing interceptor logic, data binding mechanisms, and any code that involves OGNL expression evaluation.
* **Consider Alternative Technologies:** If the complexity and security risks associated with OGNL are a significant concern, consider alternative technologies for data access and manipulation within the application.

**6. Detection and Monitoring:**

While prevention is crucial, implementing detection and monitoring mechanisms can help identify potential attacks in progress or after they have occurred:

* **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to track OGNL expression evaluations, especially those associated with security-sensitive operations. Monitor logs for suspicious patterns or unexpected evaluations.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Configure IDS/IPS to detect patterns associated with OGNL injection attempts.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate application logs with a SIEM system to correlate security events and identify potential attacks.
* **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP):** Consider using RASP solutions that can monitor application behavior in real-time and detect and prevent exploitation attempts, including those related to OGNL.

**7. Responsibilities and Actions:**

* **Development Team:**
    * Thoroughly understand the risks associated with OGNL and the potential for double evaluation.
    * Implement the mitigation strategies outlined above during the development process.
    * Conduct thorough code reviews and security testing, specifically focusing on areas where OGNL is used.
