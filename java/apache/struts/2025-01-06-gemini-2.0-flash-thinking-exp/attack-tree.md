## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OGNL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ognl_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Inject malicious OGNL expressions in parameter values:** Attackers manipulate URL parameters to inject malicious OGNL expressions. When Struts processes these expressions, it can lead to arbitrary code execution or the reading of sensitive files.
*   **Inject malicious OGNL expressions in form data:** Similar to parameter tampering, but the malicious OGNL expressions are injected into form fields submitted by the user.
*   **Craft malicious input that manipulates the value stack:** Attackers craft specific input, often leveraging Struts tags, to manipulate the OGNL value stack in a way that allows for arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.
*   **Execute arbitrary system commands:** This is the direct consequence of successful OGNL injection, allowing the attacker to run any command on the server.
*   **Read sensitive files:**  Successful OGNL injection can also be used to read files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Craft malicious serialized objects containing exploit payloads:** Attackers create specially crafted serialized Java objects that, when deserialized by the application, trigger the execution of malicious code.
*   **Utilize known gadget chains (e.g., Commons Collections, BeanUtils):** Attackers leverage existing classes within the application's dependencies (gadget chains) to construct a sequence of operations that ultimately leads to remote code execution during deserialization.
*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution:** The successful exploitation of deserialization vulnerabilities allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities (Specific to Struts' Handling)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities__specific_to_struts'_handling_.md)

*   **Upload malicious executable files (e.g., JSP, WAR):** Attackers bypass file type restrictions to upload malicious files, such as JSP web shells, which can then be accessed to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution:**  Once a malicious executable file is uploaded and accessible, the attacker can execute code on the server through it.
*   **Overwrite critical system files or deploy malicious files to arbitrary locations:** Attackers exploit path traversal vulnerabilities in file saving mechanisms to overwrite critical system files or place malicious files in locations from which they can be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Struts Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_struts_plugins.md)

*   **Exploit identified vulnerabilities (e.g., OGNL injection within the plugin):**  Similar to core Struts vulnerabilities, plugins can also contain vulnerabilities, such as OGNL injection points, that can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.
*   **Achieve Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of plugin vulnerabilities can grant the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Modify configurations to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors:** Although less common as a direct attack, if an attacker gains write access to Struts configuration files, they can modify them to introduce vulnerabilities or create backdoors for persistent access.
