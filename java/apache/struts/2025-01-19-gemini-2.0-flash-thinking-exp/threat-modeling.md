# Threat Model Analysis for apache/struts

## Threat: [OGNL Injection leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/ognl_injection_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions within user-supplied input (e.g., URL parameters, form fields, headers). When Struts processes this input and evaluates the OGNL expression, it executes arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web application. This can be done by manipulating parameters that are used in Struts tags or through vulnerabilities in specific Struts components.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including data breach, data manipulation, installation of malware, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the network.
*   **Affected Component:** OGNL evaluator within the Struts framework, particularly when processing parameters, results, or tag attributes. This often involves the `ActionContext` and the interceptor stack.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Struts Updated: Upgrade to the latest stable version of Struts, ensuring all security patches are applied.
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input on the server-side before it is processed by Struts.
    *   Avoid Dynamic OGNL Evaluation: Minimize or eliminate the use of dynamic OGNL expressions, especially with user-controlled data.
    *   Use Parameter Interceptors Carefully: Configure parameter interceptors to prevent the injection of malicious OGNL expressions. Consider using allowlists for parameter names.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): While not a direct mitigation for OGNL injection, a strong CSP can limit the damage if code execution occurs in the browser due to other vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/malicious_file_upload_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., a web shell, executable) through a vulnerable file upload mechanism in the Struts application. If the application does not properly validate the file type, content, and destination, the attacker can execute this file on the server. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the `FileUpload` interceptor or custom file upload handling logic.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, similar to OGNL injection, allowing for data breach, manipulation, malware installation, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `FileUpload` interceptor, file upload handling logic within Actions, and potentially the temporary directory used for file uploads.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict File Type Validation: Validate file types based on content (magic numbers) rather than just the file extension. Use allowlists of acceptable file types.
    *   Secure File Storage: Store uploaded files outside the webroot or in a location with restricted execution permissions.
    *   Generate Unique and Unpredictable Filenames: Avoid using user-provided filenames directly. Generate unique and random filenames to prevent overwriting existing files or predictable access paths.
    *   Limit File Size: Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    *   Sanitize Filenames: Remove or encode potentially dangerous characters from filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [URL Manipulation and Action Chaining Exploits](./threats/url_manipulation_and_action_chaining_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the URL or request parameters to bypass intended application flow or execute unintended actions. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how Struts maps URLs to actions or how action chaining is implemented. Attackers might be able to access actions they are not authorized for or execute a sequence of actions that leads to a security breach.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to functionality, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation, and in some cases, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Struts' ActionMapper, URL rewriting mechanisms, and the action chaining functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Action Mappings: Carefully define and restrict action mappings in the `struts.xml` configuration file.
    *   Avoid Relying Solely on URL Parameters for Security: Implement robust authorization checks within the action logic, not just based on the accessed URL.
    *   Validate Request Parameters: Thoroughly validate all request parameters to prevent manipulation that could lead to unintended action execution.
    *   Be Cautious with Dynamic Action Chaining: If using action chaining, ensure proper authorization checks are in place for each chained action.
