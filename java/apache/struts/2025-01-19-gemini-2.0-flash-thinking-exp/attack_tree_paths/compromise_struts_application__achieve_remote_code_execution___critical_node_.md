### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Compromise Struts Application (Achieve Remote Code Execution)

Achieving Remote Code Execution on a Struts application is a critical security breach, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service. Here's a breakdown of common attack vectors and techniques:

**4.1. Exploiting OGNL Injection Vulnerabilities:**

* **Description:**  Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) is an expression language used by Struts. Several critical vulnerabilities have arisen from the insecure handling of user-provided input that is evaluated as OGNL expressions. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious OGNL code into parameters, headers, or other input fields.
* **Attack Steps:**
    1. **Identify an entry point:** Attackers look for input fields or parameters that are processed by the Struts framework and potentially evaluated as OGNL. This could be form fields, URL parameters, or even HTTP headers.
    2. **Craft a malicious OGNL payload:**  The attacker constructs a specially crafted OGNL expression that, when evaluated by the server, executes arbitrary commands. Common techniques involve using OGNL's ability to access static methods and constructors to execute system commands.
    3. **Inject the payload:** The attacker sends a request containing the malicious OGNL payload to the vulnerable endpoint.
    4. **Server-side evaluation:** The Struts framework, due to the vulnerability, evaluates the injected OGNL expression.
    5. **Remote Code Execution:** The malicious OGNL code executes commands on the server, granting the attacker control.
* **Example OGNL Payload:**  A common example involves using the `Runtime` class to execute commands:
   ```ognl
   %{
       (#cmd='whoami').(#iswin=(@java.lang.System@getProperty('os.name').toLowerCase().contains('win'))).(#cmds=(#iswin?{'cmd.exe','/c',#cmd}:{'/bin/bash','-c',#cmd})).(#p=new java.lang.ProcessBuilder(#cmds)).(#p.redirectErrorStream(true)).(#process=#p.start()).(@org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils@toString(#process.getInputStream()))
   }
   ```
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Upgrade Struts Framework:**  Ensure the application is using the latest stable version of Struts, which includes patches for known OGNL injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before it is processed by the Struts framework. Avoid directly evaluating user input as OGNL expressions.
    * **Use Parameter Interceptors Carefully:**  If using parameter interceptors, ensure they are configured securely and do not allow arbitrary OGNL evaluation.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of successful RCE.
    * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF with rules to detect and block common OGNL injection attempts.

**4.2. Exploiting File Upload Vulnerabilities:**

* **Description:**  If the Struts application allows users to upload files without proper validation, attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., web shells, executable code) and then execute them on the server.
* **Attack Steps:**
    1. **Identify an upload endpoint:** The attacker finds a part of the application that allows file uploads.
    2. **Craft a malicious file:** The attacker creates a file containing malicious code. This could be a JSP file containing a web shell, a compiled executable, or other script types.
    3. **Upload the malicious file:** The attacker uploads the crafted file to the server.
    4. **Determine the file's location:** The attacker needs to know where the uploaded file is stored on the server's file system. This might be predictable or discoverable through other vulnerabilities.
    5. **Execute the malicious file:** The attacker accesses the uploaded file through a web request, triggering the execution of the malicious code and achieving RCE.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict File Type Validation:**  Implement robust validation to ensure only expected file types are allowed. Use whitelisting instead of blacklisting.
    * **Content Scanning:**  Scan uploaded files for malware and malicious content using antivirus or other security tools.
    * **Rename Uploaded Files:**  Rename uploaded files to prevent direct execution.
    * **Store Uploaded Files Outside Web Root:**  Store uploaded files in a location that is not directly accessible through the web server.
    * **Restrict Execution Permissions:**  Ensure the directory where uploaded files are stored has restricted execution permissions.

**4.3. Exploiting Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**

* **Description:**  If the Struts application deserializes untrusted data without proper safeguards, attackers can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
* **Attack Steps:**
    1. **Identify a deserialization point:** The attacker looks for areas where the application deserializes data, such as through HTTP cookies, session objects, or other input streams.
    2. **Craft a malicious serialized object:** The attacker creates a serialized object containing instructions to execute arbitrary commands. This often involves leveraging known "gadget chains" within the application's dependencies.
    3. **Send the malicious object:** The attacker sends the crafted serialized object to the application.
    4. **Server-side deserialization:** The Struts application deserializes the malicious object.
    5. **Remote Code Execution:** The deserialization process triggers the execution of the malicious code.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  The best defense is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
    * **Use Secure Serialization Libraries:** If deserialization is necessary, use secure serialization libraries and techniques.
    * **Implement Integrity Checks:**  Use digital signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) to verify the integrity of serialized data.
    * **Restrict Classes Allowed for Deserialization:**  Configure the deserialization process to only allow specific, safe classes to be deserialized.

**4.4. Exploiting Configuration Vulnerabilities:**

* **Description:**  Misconfigurations in the Struts framework or the application's deployment can create vulnerabilities that lead to RCE.
* **Examples:**
    * **Development Mode Enabled in Production:** Leaving development mode enabled can expose debugging endpoints or sensitive information that attackers can exploit.
    * **Insecure Default Configurations:** Using default passwords or configurations for administrative interfaces can provide easy access for attackers.
    * **Exposed Actuator Endpoints (if using Spring Boot with Struts):**  If Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are exposed without proper authentication, they can be abused to gain information or even execute commands.
* **Attack Steps:**
    1. **Information Gathering:** The attacker scans the application for exposed configuration details or administrative interfaces.
    2. **Exploitation:**  The attacker leverages the misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access or execute commands.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Configuration Management:**  Implement secure configuration practices, including disabling development mode in production, changing default passwords, and properly securing administrative interfaces.
    * **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate configuration vulnerabilities.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only necessary permissions to users and applications.

**4.5. Chaining Vulnerabilities:**

* **Description:**  Attackers may combine multiple less severe vulnerabilities to achieve RCE. For example, an attacker might exploit an information disclosure vulnerability to gain knowledge about the application's internal structure, which then helps them craft a more effective OGNL injection payload.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Comprehensive Security Testing:**  Perform thorough security testing, including penetration testing, to identify chains of vulnerabilities.
    * **Address All Vulnerabilities:**  Prioritize and remediate all identified vulnerabilities, even those that seem less severe individually.

### 5. Conclusion

Achieving Remote Code Execution on a Struts application is a significant security risk with potentially devastating consequences. Understanding the various attack vectors, particularly those related to OGNL injection, file uploads, deserialization, and configuration issues, is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies.

The development team should prioritize:

* **Staying up-to-date with the latest Struts security advisories and patches.**
* **Implementing robust input validation and sanitization techniques.**
* **Following secure coding practices and configuration guidelines.**
* **Conducting regular security assessments and penetration testing.**

By proactively addressing these potential vulnerabilities, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of a successful RCE attack and protect the application and its users.
