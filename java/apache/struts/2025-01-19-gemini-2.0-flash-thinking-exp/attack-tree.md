## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Struts Application (Achieve Remote Code Execution) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_struts_application__achieve_remote_code_execution___critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Struts Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_struts_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

This represents the broad category of attacks that leverage publicly known weaknesses in the Struts framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit OGNL Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ognl_injection_vulnerabilities__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious OGNL expressions into vulnerable input fields, URL parameters, or HTTP headers. When processed by Struts, these expressions are evaluated, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Full control of the server, data breaches, service disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Vulnerable Input Vector [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_vulnerable_input_vector__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers probe the application to find input points that are processed by the Struts framework and are susceptible to OGNL injection. This involves analyzing request parameters, form fields, and headers.
    * **Impact:**  Enables the OGNL injection attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious OGNL Expression [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_ognl_expression__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers construct OGNL expressions designed to execute specific commands, read/write files, or access sensitive data on the server.
    * **Impact:** Determines the actions performed after successful OGNL injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute OGNL Expression [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_ognl_expression__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a crafted request containing the malicious OGNL expression to the vulnerable endpoint, triggering its execution by the Struts framework.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File Upload Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_upload_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

This represents attacks that leverage weaknesses in how the application handles file uploads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unrestricted File Upload [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/unrestricted_file_upload__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application allows users to upload files without sufficient restrictions on file type or content. Attackers upload malicious executable files (e.g., webshells).
    * **Impact:**  Ability to execute arbitrary code on the server by accessing the uploaded malicious file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses__high_risk_.md)

This represents attacks that leverage insecure configurations of the Struts framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize DevMode Enabled in Production [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_devmode_enabled_in_production__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The `devMode` setting in Struts is enabled in a production environment. This exposes debugging information and often allows for arbitrary code execution through specific debugging features.
    * **Impact:**  Direct Remote Code Execution through exposed debugging functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute arbitrary code through debugging features [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_through_debugging_features__high_risk_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers utilize the debugging features exposed by `devMode` to execute arbitrary commands or code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Outdated Struts Version [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_outdated_struts_version__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

This represents attacks that target applications running older, vulnerable versions of the Struts framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Struts version in use [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_struts_version_in_use__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to determine the version of Struts being used by the application. This can be done through HTTP headers, error messages, or probing for version-specific behaviors.
    * **Impact:** Enables targeted exploitation of known vulnerabilities for that specific version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known vulnerabilities for that specific version [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_for_that_specific_version__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once the Struts version is identified, attackers leverage publicly available exploits for known vulnerabilities present in that specific version. This often includes OGNL injection, file upload vulnerabilities, or deserialization flaws specific to that version.
    * **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution or other significant compromises depending on the vulnerability.
