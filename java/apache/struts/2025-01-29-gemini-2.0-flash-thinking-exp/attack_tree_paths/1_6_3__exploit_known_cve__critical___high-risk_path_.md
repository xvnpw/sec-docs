### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Path: Exploiting Known CVEs in Apache Struts

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Utilizing Exploits (Public or Custom) to Target Known CVEs in the Struts Application

##### 4.1.1. Description

This attack vector relies on the existence of publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of the Apache Struts framework. Attackers leverage readily available information about these vulnerabilities, including:

*   **CVE Details:** Publicly documented vulnerabilities with CVE identifiers, descriptions, affected versions, and severity scores.
*   **Exploit Code:**  Often, proof-of-concept (PoC) or fully functional exploit code is publicly available on platforms like Exploit-DB, GitHub, or security blogs shortly after a CVE is disclosed. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for attackers.
*   **Metasploit Framework Modules:**  The Metasploit Framework, a widely used penetration testing tool, often includes modules that automate the exploitation of known Struts CVEs, making it trivial for even less sophisticated attackers to launch attacks.

Attackers scan target systems (web applications) to identify if they are running vulnerable versions of Apache Struts. This can be done through:

*   **Banner Grabbing:** Analyzing HTTP headers or server responses to identify the Struts version.
*   **Path Probing:** Sending specific requests to known Struts endpoints or using vulnerability scanners that check for known Struts signatures.
*   **Error Message Analysis:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities that might reveal version information in error messages.

Once a vulnerable Struts application is identified, attackers utilize exploits to target the specific CVE.

##### 4.1.2. Exploit Types (Public vs. Custom)

*   **Public Exploits:** These are readily available exploits that are widely disseminated after a CVE is published. They are often:
    *   **Easily Accessible:** Found on exploit databases, security blogs, and within penetration testing frameworks like Metasploit.
    *   **Well-Documented:**  Often accompanied by detailed explanations of how the vulnerability works and how the exploit functions.
    *   **Generic:** Designed to work against a range of vulnerable installations, making them highly effective for broad scanning and opportunistic attacks.

*   **Custom Exploits:** While public exploits are common, sophisticated attackers might develop custom exploits for known CVEs. This could be done for several reasons:
    *   **Circumventing Detection:**  Custom exploits might be designed to evade generic signatures used by Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) that are configured to detect public exploits.
    *   **Targeting Specific Configurations:**  Custom exploits can be tailored to exploit vulnerabilities in specific configurations or environments that might not be fully covered by public exploits.
    *   **Zero-Day Development (Related Concept):** Although this analysis is about *known* CVEs, the skills to create custom exploits for known vulnerabilities are similar to those needed to develop zero-day exploits.

In the context of Struts CVE exploitation, **public exploits are the most common and significant threat** due to their ease of access and effectiveness.

##### 4.1.3. Common CVE Categories in Struts

Apache Struts has been historically targeted by various types of vulnerabilities. Some common categories of CVEs include:

*   **OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) Injection:**  Many critical Struts vulnerabilities have stemmed from flaws in the OGNL expression language used by Struts. Attackers can inject malicious OGNL expressions into request parameters, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).  *Examples: CVE-2017-5638 (Equifax breach), CVE-2018-11776*.
*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  Struts, in certain configurations, might be vulnerable to deserialization attacks. If untrusted data is deserialized, it can lead to RCE. *Example: CVE-2017-9805 (REST plugin vulnerability)*.
*   **File Upload Vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of file uploads can allow attackers to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) that can be executed on the server, leading to system compromise.
*   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:**  Flaws in handling file paths can allow attackers to access files outside of the intended web application directory, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing for further exploitation.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While less severe than RCE, XSS vulnerabilities can still be exploited to inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**It's crucial to understand that CVEs related to OGNL injection and deserialization have historically been the most critical and impactful in Struts, often leading to full system compromise.**

#### 4.2. Impact: Potential Consequences of Successful Exploitation

The impact of successfully exploiting a known Struts CVE can be severe and far-reaching, often categorized as **CRITICAL** due to the potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

##### 4.2.1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)

This is the most critical and frequent impact of exploiting Struts CVEs, particularly those related to OGNL injection and deserialization. RCE allows an attacker to:

*   **Execute Arbitrary Commands:**  Gain the ability to run commands directly on the server hosting the Struts application. This effectively gives the attacker control over the server.
*   **Install Backdoors:**  Establish persistent access to the compromised system by installing backdoors, allowing them to return at any time.
*   **Deploy Malware:**  Install malware, such as ransomware, cryptominers, or botnet agents, on the compromised server.
*   **Pivot to Internal Networks:**  Use the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the internal network (lateral movement).

RCE is considered a catastrophic impact as it grants attackers complete control over the server and potentially the entire infrastructure.

##### 4.2.2. Data Breach and Confidentiality Loss

Successful exploitation can lead to data breaches and loss of confidential information. Attackers can:

*   **Access Sensitive Data:**  Read databases, configuration files, application code, and other sensitive data stored on the compromised server.
*   **Exfiltrate Data:**  Steal sensitive data and transfer it to attacker-controlled systems. This can include customer data, financial information, intellectual property, and trade secrets.
*   **Modify Data:**  Alter or delete data, potentially causing data integrity issues and business disruption.

Data breaches can result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and regulatory penalties.

##### 4.2.3. System Compromise and Availability Issues

Beyond data breaches, exploitation can lead to broader system compromise and availability issues:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers might intentionally or unintentionally cause the Struts application or the entire server to become unavailable, disrupting business operations.
*   **System Instability:**  Malicious code execution can lead to system instability, crashes, and performance degradation.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Malware like cryptominers can consume server resources, impacting the performance of legitimate applications and services.

##### 4.2.4. Lateral Movement

A compromised Struts application server can serve as an entry point into the internal network. Attackers can use this foothold to:

*   **Scan Internal Networks:**  Discover other systems and services within the organization's network.
*   **Exploit Other Vulnerabilities:**  Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in other internal systems.
*   **Gain Access to Critical Infrastructure:**  Potentially reach and compromise critical infrastructure components, such as domain controllers, databases, or internal applications.

Lateral movement significantly expands the scope of the attack and can lead to widespread compromise within the organization.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies: Defending Against CVE Exploitation

Mitigating the risk of exploiting known Struts CVEs requires a multi-layered approach encompassing proactive prevention, detection, and response measures.

##### 4.3.1. Patching and Version Management

*   **Timely Patching:**  **This is the MOST CRITICAL mitigation.**  Immediately apply security patches released by the Apache Struts project for identified CVEs. Subscribe to the Apache Struts security mailing list and regularly check for security bulletins.
*   **Version Control and Inventory:** Maintain a clear inventory of all Struts applications and their versions within the organization. This allows for quick identification of vulnerable instances when new CVEs are announced.
*   **Automated Patch Management:**  Implement automated patch management systems to streamline the patching process and ensure timely updates, especially in larger environments.
*   **Upgrade to Supported Versions:**  If possible, upgrade to the latest supported Struts version.  Older, unsupported versions are more likely to have unpatched vulnerabilities and will not receive security updates.

##### 4.3.2. Web Application Firewall (WAF)

*   **Virtual Patching:**  WAFs can provide "virtual patches" by filtering out malicious requests that target known Struts vulnerabilities. This can offer immediate protection while actual patching is being planned and implemented.
*   **Signature-Based Detection:**  WAFs can be configured with signatures to detect common exploit patterns and payloads associated with known Struts CVEs.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:**  More advanced WAFs can use behavioral analysis to detect anomalous traffic patterns that might indicate exploit attempts, even for unknown or slightly modified exploits.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  WAFs can enforce strict input validation and sanitization rules to prevent injection attacks, including OGNL injection, which is a common root cause of Struts vulnerabilities.

##### 4.3.3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

*   **Network-Based IDS/IPS:**  Monitor network traffic for malicious patterns and signatures associated with Struts exploit attempts. IPS can automatically block or mitigate detected attacks.
*   **Host-Based IDS (HIDS):**  Monitor system logs, file integrity, and process activity on servers hosting Struts applications to detect suspicious behavior that might indicate successful exploitation.
*   **Signature Updates:**  Ensure IDS/IPS signatures are regularly updated to include detection rules for newly disclosed Struts CVEs and exploits.

##### 4.3.4. Security Monitoring and Logging

*   **Centralized Logging:**  Implement centralized logging for Struts applications and related infrastructure components (web servers, databases).
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Utilize a SIEM system to aggregate logs, correlate events, and detect suspicious activity related to Struts exploit attempts.
*   **Alerting and Incident Response:**  Configure alerts for suspicious events and establish incident response procedures to handle potential security breaches effectively.
*   **Regular Log Review:**  Periodically review logs for anomalies and potential security incidents, even if automated alerts are not triggered.

##### 4.3.5. Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing

*   **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:**  Conduct regular vulnerability scans using automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Struts applications and underlying infrastructure.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform periodic penetration testing by security professionals to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities, including Struts CVEs. Penetration testing can uncover vulnerabilities that automated scanners might miss and validate the effectiveness of existing security controls.

##### 4.3.6. Secure Development Practices

*   **Secure Coding Training:**  Train developers on secure coding practices to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities in Struts applications during development.
*   **Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):**  Integrate SAST and DAST tools into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Use dependency management tools to track and manage Struts dependencies and ensure that vulnerable versions are not used.
*   **Security Reviews:**  Conduct regular security reviews of Struts application code and configurations.

#### 4.4. Risk Assessment and Conclusion

Exploiting known CVEs in Apache Struts represents a **CRITICAL** and **HIGH-RISK PATH** in the attack tree. The widespread use of Struts, coupled with the availability of public exploits and the potential for severe impact (especially RCE), makes this attack vector a significant threat.

**Key Takeaways and Recommendations for the Development Team:**

*   **Prioritize Patching:**  Patching vulnerable Struts versions is the **most crucial and immediate action** to mitigate this risk. Establish a rapid patching process and prioritize security updates.
*   **Implement a Multi-Layered Security Approach:**  Don't rely solely on patching. Implement a combination of WAF, IDS/IPS, security monitoring, and vulnerability scanning to create a robust defense-in-depth strategy.
*   **Continuous Monitoring and Vigilance:**  Security is an ongoing process. Continuously monitor for new CVEs, update security tools and signatures, and regularly assess the security posture of Struts applications.
