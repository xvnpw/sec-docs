# Threat Model Analysis for apache/kafka

## Threat: [Unauthorized Topic Access (Read/Write)](./threats/unauthorized_topic_access__readwrite_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Topic Access (Read/Write)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Kafka topic they are not authorized to read from or write to.  They might use stolen credentials, exploit a misconfigured ACL, or leverage a vulnerability in a *Kafka client* library. The attacker could inject malicious messages (if writing) or steal sensitive data (if reading).
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality violation), data corruption (integrity violation), potential for downstream system compromise if malicious data is processed.
    *   **Affected Kafka Component:** Broker (authorization logic within `kafka.server.KafkaApis`), potentially Zookeeper/KRaft (if ACLs are stored there).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is involved) or High (for non-sensitive data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication (SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM, Kerberos, OAuth).
        *   Use TLS/SSL encryption for client-broker communication.
        *   Configure and enforce Kafka ACLs (Access Control Lists) to restrict topic access.
        *   Regularly review and audit ACL configurations.
        *   Use principle of least privilege: grant only necessary permissions to clients.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service_via_message_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Message Flooding

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a massive number of messages to a Kafka topic, overwhelming the *Kafka brokers* and preventing legitimate producers and consumers from functioning correctly.  This could be a targeted attack or a result of a compromised *Kafka producer*.
    *   **Impact:** Service outage, data loss (if retention policies are exceeded), performance degradation for all clients using the cluster.
    *   **Affected Kafka Component:** Broker (message handling, storage, replication within `kafka.log.Log` and related components), potentially Zookeeper/KRaft (if under heavy load due to metadata updates).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement producer quotas (using `producer.quota.bytes.per.second.default` and related Kafka configurations).
        *   Monitor broker resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network).
        *   Set up alerts for high message rates and resource exhaustion.
        *   Use Kafka's dynamic configuration capabilities to adjust quotas in real-time.

## Threat: [Rogue Broker Injection](./threats/rogue_broker_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Rogue Broker Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious *Kafka broker* into the cluster. This rogue broker could intercept, modify, or redirect data, or disrupt the cluster's operation.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, denial of service, complete cluster compromise.
    *   **Affected Kafka Component:** Entire Kafka cluster, Zookeeper/KRaft (broker registration). The `kafka.server.KafkaServer` class is directly affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use TLS/SSL with mutual authentication (mTLS) for inter-broker communication.
        *   Configure `listeners` and `advertised.listeners` correctly within the Kafka broker configuration.
        *   Regularly audit the cluster configuration and broker membership.
        *   Use a secure configuration management system for Kafka deployments.
        *   Monitor for unexpected broker additions.

## Threat: [Zookeeper/KRaft Compromise](./threats/zookeeperkraft_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** Zookeeper/KRaft Compromise

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control of the Zookeeper/KRaft ensemble, which stores critical *Kafka metadata* (topic configurations, consumer group information, ACLs).  This allows the attacker to manipulate the cluster, disrupt service, or steal data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data loss, denial of service, data breach.
    *   **Affected Kafka Component:** Zookeeper/KRaft ensemble, entire Kafka cluster.  This is a direct attack on a core Kafka dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Zookeeper/KRaft with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Use network security controls to restrict access to Zookeeper/KRaft *from outside the Kafka cluster*.
        *   Regularly patch and update Zookeeper/KRaft.
        *   Monitor Zookeeper/KRaft for suspicious activity.
        *   Implement a robust backup and recovery plan for Zookeeper/KRaft data.

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Transit (Without TLS)](./threats/message_tampering_in_transit__without_tls_.md)

*   **Threat:** Message Tampering in Transit (Without TLS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies messages as they are transmitted between producers, brokers, and consumers *if TLS/SSL is not used*. This could involve a man-in-the-middle attack.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, integrity violation, potential for downstream system compromise.
    *   **Affected Kafka Component:** Network communication between *Kafka producers*, *Kafka brokers*, and *Kafka consumers*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use TLS/SSL encryption for *all* communication (client-broker, inter-broker). This is the primary mitigation.
        *   Enable client authentication (SASL) in conjunction with TLS.

## Threat: [Data Modification at Rest (Broker Storage)](./threats/data_modification_at_rest__broker_storage_.md)

* **Threat:** Data Modification at Rest (Broker Storage)

    *   **Description:** An attacker with physical or privileged access to the *Kafka broker's* storage directly modifies the Kafka data files, bypassing Kafka's internal mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, integrity violation.
    *   **Affected Kafka Component:** Broker's storage (log segments, specifically `kafka.log.LogSegment` files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use disk encryption (e.g., LUKS) to protect data at rest on the *Kafka broker* machines.
        *   Implement strict file system permissions to limit access to Kafka data directories.
        *   Run Kafka brokers with a non-root user.
        *   Regularly monitor file integrity.

## Threat: [Unpatched Kafka Vulnerability Exploitation (Broker/Client)](./threats/unpatched_kafka_vulnerability_exploitation__brokerclient_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unpatched Kafka Vulnerability Exploitation (Broker/Client)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability in the *Kafka broker software* or *Kafka client libraries*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from denial of service to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Kafka Component:** Any vulnerable component (broker, client library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep *Kafka brokers* and *all Kafka client libraries* up to date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and advisories for Kafka.
        *   Implement a robust patch management process.
