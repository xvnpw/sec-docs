# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/kafka

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Network Exposure of Kafka Broker Ports (High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_network_exposure_of_kafka_broker_ports__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Kafka broker ports (e.g., 9092) are exposed to the network without proper access controls, allowing unauthorized connections.
*   **Kafka Contribution:** Kafka requires network ports to be open for producers, consumers, and inter-broker communication, inherently creating network exposure.
*   **Example:** Kafka broker port 9092 is directly accessible from the public internet without firewall rules or network segmentation.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Kafka cluster, potential data breaches, denial of service attacks, cluster disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement firewall rules to restrict access to Kafka ports to only trusted networks and clients.
    *   Utilize network segmentation to isolate Kafka brokers within a secure network zone.
    *   Consider using a VPN or private network for Kafka client connections.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication and Authorization (Critical Risk)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authentication_and_authorization__critical_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Kafka's default configuration lacks authentication and authorization, allowing any client to connect and perform actions.
*   **Kafka Contribution:** Kafka, by default, does not enforce authentication or authorization, requiring explicit configuration for security.
*   **Example:** An attacker connects to the Kafka broker without any credentials and is able to produce messages to sensitive topics or consume data without permission.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data injection, data corruption, compliance violations, potential for malicious activities within the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable authentication mechanisms such as SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM, or Kerberos.
    *   Implement Kafka ACLs (Access Control Lists) to define granular authorization rules for topics, consumer groups, and cluster operations.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring ACLs.

## Attack Surface: [Plaintext Data Transmission (Without TLS/SSL) (High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/plaintext_data_transmission__without_tlsssl___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between Kafka clients and brokers, or between brokers, is sent in plaintext without encryption.
*   **Kafka Contribution:** Kafka communication, by default, is not encrypted and requires explicit configuration of TLS/SSL for secure communication.
*   **Example:** Sensitive data is transmitted in plaintext between a producer application and a Kafka broker, and a network attacker eavesdrops on the traffic to capture the data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches due to eavesdropping, exposure of sensitive information in transit, non-compliance with data protection regulations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all Kafka listeners, including client-broker and inter-broker communication.
    *   Ensure proper certificate management and validation for TLS/SSL configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Kafka Components and Dependencies (High to Critical Risk)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_kafka_components_and_dependencies__high_to_critical_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Software vulnerabilities present in Kafka brokers, ZooKeeper/Kraft, Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, or their dependencies (e.g., JRE, libraries).
*   **Kafka Contribution:** Kafka, like any software, is susceptible to vulnerabilities, and its reliance on dependencies introduces further potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of Kafka broker or the underlying Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is exploited by an attacker to gain remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, denial of service, data corruption, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Kafka and all its components updated to the latest stable versions.
    *   Regularly apply security patches and updates released by the Apache Kafka project and its dependency providers.
    *   Implement vulnerability scanning and management processes.

## Attack Surface: [Critical Misconfiguration of Security Features (High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/critical_misconfiguration_of_security_features__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configuring critical security features like TLS/SSL, SASL, or ACLs, rendering them ineffective or creating new vulnerabilities that lead to high impact.
*   **Kafka Contribution:** Kafka's security features are powerful but require careful and correct configuration to be effective, and critical misconfigurations can negate their benefits leading to high risk.
*   **Example:** TLS/SSL is enabled, but certificate validation is disabled, making the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks despite using encryption. ACLs are set up but are overly permissive granting wide access.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing intended security controls, data breaches, unauthorized access, potential for exploitation due to weakened security posture.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test and validate security configurations after implementation and changes.
    *   Follow official documentation and best practices when configuring security features.
    *   Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify misconfigurations and weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [High Severity Vulnerabilities in Connectors (Kafka Connect) (High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/high_severity_vulnerabilities_in_connectors__kafka_connect___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** High severity vulnerabilities in third-party Kafka Connect connectors used to integrate Kafka with external systems, that can directly impact Kafka or connected systems.
*   **Kafka Contribution:** Kafka Connect's extensibility through connectors introduces a dependency on external code, which may contain high severity vulnerabilities exploitable through Kafka Connect.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable Kafka Connect connector has a remote code execution vulnerability that can be triggered by a malicious message processed by the connector, leading to compromise of the Kafka Connect worker and potentially Kafka cluster.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches in connected systems, compromise of Kafka Connect workers, potential for lateral movement to other parts of the application infrastructure, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and select Kafka Connect connectors from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Keep connectors updated to the latest versions and apply security patches, especially for high severity vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly audit and monitor connectors for known vulnerabilities and security updates.
