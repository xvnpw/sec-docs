# Threat Model Analysis for apache/kafka

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Kafka Brokers](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_kafka_brokers.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to bypass authentication or exploit misconfigurations to gain access to Kafka brokers. They might use brute-force attacks, exploit default credentials, or leverage network vulnerabilities to connect to broker ports. Once inside, they can produce/consume messages, modify configurations, or disrupt the cluster.

**Impact:**
*   Confidentiality breach: Reading sensitive messages.
*   Integrity breach: Modifying messages or cluster configurations.
*   Availability impact: Disrupting Kafka cluster operations, leading to service downtime.

**Affected Kafka Component:** Kafka Brokers, Broker Authentication/Authorization Modules

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms (SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM, TLS Mutual Authentication).
*   Enforce authorization using Kafka ACLs.
*   Restrict network access to Kafka broker ports using firewalls and network segmentation.
*   Regularly audit and review authentication and authorization configurations.

## Threat: [Client Impersonation](./threats/client_impersonation.md)

**Description:** An attacker steals or compromises credentials of a legitimate Kafka client (producer or consumer). They then use these credentials to impersonate the client and perform actions as if they were authorized. This could involve producing malicious messages or consuming sensitive data they shouldn't access.

**Impact:**
*   Integrity breach: Injecting malicious or incorrect messages into topics.
*   Confidentiality breach: Accessing and consuming sensitive messages from topics.
*   Availability impact: Disrupting message flow or application logic by injecting faulty data.
