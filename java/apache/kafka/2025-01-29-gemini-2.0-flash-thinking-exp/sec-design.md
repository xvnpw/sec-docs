# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache Kafka project aims to provide a distributed streaming platform. It is designed to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka enables users to publish and subscribe to streams of records, storing them durably and reliably.

Business priorities for a project like Apache Kafka are:
- Reliability: Ensuring the platform is highly available and fault-tolerant to prevent data loss and system downtime.
- Scalability: Allowing the platform to handle increasing data volumes and user loads without performance degradation.
- Performance: Maintaining low latency and high throughput for real-time data processing.
- Flexibility: Supporting diverse use cases and integration with various systems and technologies.
- Community Support: Leveraging a strong open-source community for continuous improvement and support.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Data Loss: Risk of losing critical data due to system failures or misconfigurations.
- System Downtime: Risk of service interruption impacting business operations that rely on real-time data streams.
- Data Breaches: Risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data stored or processed by Kafka.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Risk of the system failing to meet performance requirements under heavy load.
- Operational Complexity: Risk of increased operational overhead and errors due to the distributed nature of Kafka.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Access Control Lists (ACLs) for topic authorization. Implemented within Kafka brokers.
- security control: TLS encryption for data in transit between clients and brokers, and between brokers. Configured in Kafka broker and client configurations.
- security control: SASL authentication mechanisms (e.g., Kerberos, SCRAM, PLAIN) for client and inter-broker authentication. Configured in Kafka broker and client configurations.
- accepted risk: Complexity of configuring and managing Kafka security features, potentially leading to misconfigurations.
- accepted risk: Performance overhead associated with enabling encryption and authentication.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to simplify authorization management and improve granularity.
- recommended security control: Auditing of security-related events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization failures, configuration changes) for monitoring and incident response.
- recommended security control: Vulnerability scanning and static/dynamic code analysis integrated into the software development lifecycle and build process.
- recommended security control: Data at rest encryption for sensitive data stored in Kafka topics.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate clients (producers, consumers, administrators) connecting to Kafka brokers.
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate inter-broker communication within the Kafka cluster.
  - Requirement: Support for multiple authentication mechanisms to accommodate different environments and security policies.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization to control access to Kafka resources (topics, groups, cluster operations).
  - Requirement: Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users only the necessary permissions.
  - Requirement: Centralized and manageable authorization policies.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Validate input from producers to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
  - Requirement: Validate configurations provided by administrators and clients to prevent misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities.
  - Requirement: Sanitize and validate data consumed from Kafka topics before further processing in applications.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Encrypt data in transit to protect confidentiality and integrity during communication.
  - Requirement: Consider data at rest encryption for sensitive data stored in Kafka topics to protect confidentiality.
  - Requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
  - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.

Build Process Description:

The build process for Apache Kafka starts with developers committing code changes to the GitHub repository.

- Developer: Developers write code, perform local builds and tests, and commit changes to the source code repository.
- Source Code Repository (GitHub): GitHub hosts the source code for Apache Kafka, managing version control and collaboration.
- CI System (GitHub Actions): GitHub Actions is used as the Continuous Integration (CI) system to automate the build, test, and release process.
- Build Environment: A dedicated environment within the CI system where the Kafka project is built. This environment includes necessary build tools (e.g., Maven, JDK), dependencies, and security scanning tools.
- Security Checks: During the build process, several security checks are performed:
  - SAST Scanner: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools scan the source code for potential security vulnerabilities.
  - Dependency Check: Dependency checking tools analyze project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - Linter: Linters enforce code quality and style guidelines, which can indirectly improve security by reducing code complexity and potential errors.
- Build Artifacts: The build process produces various artifacts, including JAR files, Docker images, and distribution packages.
- Artifact Repository (Maven Central, Docker Hub): Build artifacts are published to artifact repositories like Maven Central for Java libraries and Docker Hub for container images, making them available for users.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Secure Source Code Repository: Access control and audit logging on the GitHub repository to protect source code integrity.
- security control: CI/CD Pipeline Security: Secure configuration of GitHub Actions workflows, access control to CI/CD secrets and credentials, audit logging of CI/CD activities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Real-time data ingestion and delivery: Ensuring continuous and reliable flow of data from producers to consumers.
- Data storage and durability: Protecting the integrity and availability of stored data in Kafka topics.
- Cluster management and operations: Maintaining the operational stability and security of the Kafka cluster.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Messages in Kafka topics: Sensitivity depends on the application. Could include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data, application logs, and other business-critical information. Assume medium to high sensitivity in general.
- Kafka cluster metadata: Configuration data, topic definitions, ACLs, and other metadata that is critical for cluster operation and security. High sensitivity.
- Administrative credentials and secrets: Credentials used for accessing and managing the Kafka cluster and related systems. Very high sensitivity.
- Monitoring and logging data: Operational and security logs that can contain sensitive information about system behavior and potential security incidents. Medium sensitivity.
