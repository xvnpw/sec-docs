# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/kafka

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Kafka Listeners:](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_kafka_listeners.md)

*   **Description:** Kafka brokers expose listeners for client and inter-broker communication. If these listeners are not properly secured with authentication and encryption, they become vulnerable.
*   **Kafka's Contribution:** Kafka's architecture requires open network ports for communication, making unsecured listeners a direct point of entry.
*   **Example:** An attacker connects to an unsecured broker listener and intercepts sensitive data being transmitted or sends malicious commands to the broker.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to Kafka cluster, potential for cluster disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS encryption for all Kafka listeners (client and inter-broker).
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms like SASL (e.g., PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-512) for client and inter-broker connections.
    *   Use network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to Kafka listeners to authorized networks and clients only.

## Attack Surface: [ZooKeeper Exploitation:](./attack_surfaces/zookeeper_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Kafka relies on ZooKeeper for coordination and metadata management. Compromising ZooKeeper can have severe consequences for the Kafka cluster.
*   **Kafka's Contribution:** Kafka's dependency on ZooKeeper introduces a secondary attack surface directly impacting Kafka's functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in ZooKeeper or gains unauthorized access to ZooKeeper nodes, leading to cluster instability, data loss, or the ability to manipulate Kafka's metadata (e.g., topic configurations).
*   **Impact:** Complete Kafka cluster disruption, data loss, ability to control Kafka behavior maliciously.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure ZooKeeper with authentication (e.g., using Kerberos or SASL).
    *   Harden the operating system and network where ZooKeeper is running.
    *   Regularly patch and update ZooKeeper to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strong access controls for ZooKeeper nodes.
    *   Consider using KRaft mode (if available and suitable) to eliminate the ZooKeeper dependency.

## Attack Surface: [Message Injection/Tampering (Without Security):](./attack_surfaces/message_injectiontampering__without_security_.md)

*   **Description:** Without proper authentication and authorization on the producer side, malicious actors can inject arbitrary messages into Kafka topics. Without message integrity checks, messages can be altered in transit.
*   **Kafka's Contribution:** Kafka, by default, allows producers to send messages to topics without requiring authentication or integrity checks, making it a direct point of exploitation.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends fake orders to a financial application's Kafka topic, or modifies the content of legitimate messages while in transit through the Kafka broker.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption within Kafka topics, business logic disruption for consuming applications, potential financial losses, reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement producer authentication using mechanisms like SASL.
    *   Implement authorization rules to control which producers can write to specific topics.
    *   Use message signing or encryption at the application level (producers) to ensure message integrity and authenticity within Kafka.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can overwhelm Kafka brokers with a high volume of requests, leading to resource exhaustion and service disruption.
*   **Kafka's Contribution:** Kafka's core function of handling message traffic makes it a target for resource exhaustion attacks at the broker level.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods the Kafka cluster with a massive number of produce requests, overwhelming the brokers' resources and making them unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability of the Kafka cluster, inability to process messages, potential data loss due to buffer overflows or timeouts within Kafka.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement resource quotas and throttling for producers.
    *   Configure appropriate broker resources (CPU, memory, disk).
    *   Use network rate limiting and firewalls to mitigate network-level DoS attacks targeting Kafka brokers.
    *   Monitor Kafka cluster performance and set up alerts for unusual activity.

## Attack Surface: [Kafka Connect Configuration Vulnerabilities:](./attack_surfaces/kafka_connect_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfigured Kafka Connect connectors can expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to external systems through the Kafka Connect framework.
*   **Kafka's Contribution:** Kafka Connect, as a core component for data integration, directly introduces risks if its configurations are insecure.
*   **Example:** A Kafka Connect connector is configured to pull data from a database using hardcoded credentials stored in plain text in the connector configuration, accessible through the Kafka Connect API or configuration files.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data managed by Kafka Connect, unauthorized access to external systems integrated with Kafka, potential for data breaches in connected systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in connector configurations. Use secure credential management mechanisms (e.g., secrets management tools integrated with Kafka Connect).
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege for connector configurations and roles within Kafka Connect.
    *   Regularly review and audit Kafka Connect configurations.
    *   Secure communication between Kafka Connect and external systems (e.g., using TLS), configured within the Connect framework.
