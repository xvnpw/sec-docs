# Threat Model Analysis for apache/kafka

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Production](./threats/unauthorized_message_production.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to producer credentials or exploits a vulnerability in the producer application to send malicious or unauthorized messages to Kafka topics. This could involve crafting messages to exploit consumer logic or simply flooding topics with irrelevant data.

**Impact:** Data corruption within Kafka topics, injection of malicious commands that could be executed by consumers, spamming legitimate consumers, resource exhaustion on Kafka brokers due to excessive message volume.

**Affected Component:** Producer API, Kafka Broker (topic partitions)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for producers (e.g., SASL/SCRAM, Kerberos).
*   Securely manage and store producer credentials, avoiding hardcoding or insecure storage.
*   Use Kafka ACLs (Access Control Lists) to restrict which producers can write to specific topics.
*   Monitor producer activity for unusual patterns or high message rates.

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Transit](./threats/message_tampering_in_transit.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between a producer or consumer and the Kafka broker and modifies the message content before it reaches its destination. This can be achieved through man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, leading to incorrect processing by consumers, potentially causing financial loss, system errors, or other adverse effects depending on the application logic.

**Affected Component:** Network communication layer between Producers/Consumers and Brokers

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Enable TLS encryption for all communication between producers, brokers, and consumers to ensure data confidentiality and integrity in transit.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Consumption](./threats/unauthorized_message_consumption.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to consume messages from Kafka topics they are not permitted to access. This could be due to weak authentication, misconfigured authorization, or compromised consumer credentials.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data contained within the messages, potentially leading to privacy breaches, compliance violations, and misuse of information.

**Affected Component:** Consumer API, Kafka Broker (topic partitions), Consumer Group Coordinator

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for consumers (e.g., SASL/SCRAM, Kerberos).
*   Use Kafka ACLs to restrict which consumers can read from specific topics and consumer groups.
*   Securely manage and store consumer credentials.

## Threat: [Zookeeper Compromise](./threats/zookeeper_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Zookeeper ensemble that manages the Kafka cluster metadata. This could be through exploiting vulnerabilities in Zookeeper or compromising the underlying infrastructure.

**Impact:** Complete control over the Kafka cluster, including the ability to disrupt service, delete topics, modify configurations, and potentially gain access to data.

**Affected Component:** Zookeeper

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Secure the Zookeeper infrastructure with strong access controls and network segmentation.
*   Regularly patch and update Zookeeper to address known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement authentication and authorization for Zookeeper clients.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) against Brokers](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__against_brokers.md)

**Description:** An attacker overwhelms the Kafka brokers with a large number of requests or malicious traffic, making them unavailable to legitimate producers and consumers. This could involve sending excessive messages, connection requests, or exploiting resource-intensive operations.

**Impact:** Inability to produce or consume messages, leading to application downtime and potential data loss if producers cannot buffer messages.

**Affected Component:** Kafka Broker

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement rate limiting on producers to prevent them from overwhelming the brokers.
*   Configure resource limits on brokers to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   Use network firewalls and intrusion detection systems to filter malicious traffic.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Messages](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_messages.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information is included in the message payload without proper encryption, making it vulnerable if unauthorized parties gain access to the Kafka cluster or message logs.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, leading to exposure of personal data, financial information, or other sensitive details, potentially resulting in legal and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Message payload

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Encrypt sensitive data within the message payload before publishing it to Kafka.
*   Implement access controls on Kafka topics to restrict who can read messages.

## Threat: [Metadata Manipulation in Zookeeper](./threats/metadata_manipulation_in_zookeeper.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to Zookeeper modifies critical metadata about the Kafka cluster, such as topic configurations, partition assignments, or broker information.

**Impact:** Corruption of the Kafka cluster state, leading to unpredictable behavior, data loss, or service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Zookeeper data store

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Strictly control access to the Zookeeper ensemble.
*   Implement authentication and authorization for Zookeeper clients.
*   Regularly back up Zookeeper data to facilitate recovery in case of corruption.
