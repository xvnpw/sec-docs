## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Producer Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Messages](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_producer_vulnerabilities_-_inject_malicious_messages.md)

* **Exploit Producer Vulnerabilities -> Inject Malicious Messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts and sends messages to Kafka topics that contain malicious payloads or exploit vulnerabilities in the application's message processing logic on the consumer side.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (depends heavily on the robustness of input validation and sanitization in the consuming application).
    * **Impact:** Can range from data corruption and triggering unintended application behavior to achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the consumer.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Broker](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_broker_vulnerabilities_-_gain_unauthorized_access_to_broker.md)

* **Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities -> Gain Unauthorized Access to Broker [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits security misconfigurations (e.g., default credentials), known vulnerabilities in the Kafka broker software, or uses compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to a Kafka broker.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the organization's security practices, patching cadence, and configuration management).
    * **Impact:** Grants the attacker full control over the Kafka cluster, allowing them to read, write, modify, or delete any data, disrupt service, and potentially pivot to other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities -> Corrupt or Delete Kafka Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_broker_vulnerabilities_-_corrupt_or_delete_kafka_data.md)

* **Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities -> Corrupt or Delete Kafka Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Following unauthorized access to a broker, an attacker directly manipulates the data stored in Kafka topics and partitions, leading to data corruption or deletion.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (requires successful prior unauthorized access).
    * **Impact:** Can cause critical data loss, data integrity issues, and application malfunction, potentially leading to significant business disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Consumer Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Consumer Group Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_consumer_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_consumer_group_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Exploit Consumer Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Consumer Group Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates consumer group offsets or membership, potentially by exploiting weaknesses in consumer group management or through unauthorized access, to intercept or replay messages intended for other consumers.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (if consumer group management is not properly secured with authorization and access controls).
    * **Impact:** Can lead to data leakage (accessing sensitive information intended for other consumers), inconsistent application state, and denial of service for legitimate consumers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ZooKeeper Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Affecting Kafka) -> Gain Unauthorized Access to ZooKeeper](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_zookeeper_vulnerabilities__indirectly_affecting_kafka__-_gain_unauthorized_access_to_zookeep_e8cdb41d.md)

* **Exploit ZooKeeper Vulnerabilities (Indirectly Affecting Kafka) -> Gain Unauthorized Access to ZooKeeper [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits security misconfigurations, default credentials, or vulnerabilities in the ZooKeeper software to gain unauthorized access to the ZooKeeper ensemble that manages the Kafka cluster.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on the security practices applied to the ZooKeeper deployment).
    * **Impact:** Compromising ZooKeeper can disrupt the entire Kafka cluster operation, potentially leading to data loss, metadata corruption, and application unavailability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Kafka Communication -> Intercept and Modify Kafka Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_kafka_communication_-_intercept_and_modify_kafka_traffic.md)

* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Kafka Communication -> Intercept and Modify Kafka Traffic [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts network communication between Kafka producers, brokers, and consumers to eavesdrop on or alter messages in transit. This is typically achieved by compromising the network or exploiting weaknesses in network security.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (if TLS encryption is properly implemented and enforced for all Kafka communication).
    * **Impact:** Can lead to data leakage (exposing sensitive information in transit), data corruption (modifying messages), and unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses -> Brute-force or Guess Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses_-_brute-force_or_guess_credentials.md)

* **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** This encompasses various weaknesses in how Kafka components are authenticated and authorized.
        * **Brute-force or Guess Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers attempt to guess or brute-force usernames and passwords for Kafka brokers or ZooKeeper.
    * **Likelihood:**
        * Brute-force: Low to Medium (depends on password policies).
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Kafka components, allowing attackers to perform various malicious actions depending on the level of access gained.

    * **Attack Vector:** This encompasses various weaknesses in how Kafka components are authenticated and authorized.
        * **Exploit Weak or Missing Authorization Checks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers perform actions without proper authorization due to misconfigured or missing Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    * **Likelihood:**
        * Weak Authorization: Medium (common misconfiguration).
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Kafka components, allowing attackers to perform various malicious actions depending on the level of access gained.
