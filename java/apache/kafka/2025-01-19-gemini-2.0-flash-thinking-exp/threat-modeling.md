# Threat Model Analysis for apache/kafka

## Threat: [Unauthorized Broker Access](./threats/unauthorized_broker_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Kafka broker. This could be achieved by exploiting weak or default Kafka broker configurations, leveraging network vulnerabilities directly targeting Kafka broker ports, or through social engineering targeting Kafka administrators. Once inside, the attacker might read sensitive messages stored within Kafka, modify broker configurations managed by Kafka, or disrupt core broker operations.

**Impact:** Data breaches by accessing messages, data corruption by modifying broker state, denial of service by disrupting broker functionality, cluster instability due to configuration changes, potential for further lateral movement within the Kafka cluster.

**Affected Component:** Kafka Broker (specifically the authentication and authorization modules, network listeners).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms provided by Kafka (e.g., SASL/PLAIN, SASL/SCRAM, Kerberos).
* Enable TLS encryption for client-broker and inter-broker communication as configured within Kafka.
* Utilize network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to Kafka broker ports.
* Regularly audit access logs generated by Kafka and monitor for suspicious activity.
* Enforce strong password policies for Kafka-managed credentials and consider multi-factor authentication where applicable.

## Threat: [Data Tampering on Brokers](./threats/data_tampering_on_brokers.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the Kafka broker's storage or internal communication channels modifies messages stored in topics managed by the Kafka broker. This could involve altering message content, changing offsets within Kafka's storage, or deleting messages directly from Kafka's logs.

**Impact:** Data integrity issues within Kafka topics, incorrect application behavior based on tampered data consumed from Kafka, potential for financial loss or compliance violations due to data manipulation within the Kafka system.

**Affected Component:** Kafka Broker (specifically the storage layer, replication mechanisms managed by Kafka).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable TLS encryption for inter-broker communication as configured within Kafka to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on Kafka's internal traffic.
* Implement strict access controls to limit who can directly access the broker's underlying storage (operating system level security around Kafka's data directories).
* Consider using message signing or checksums at the application level (producer/consumer) for data integrity verification independent of Kafka's internal mechanisms.
* Regularly back up Kafka data to facilitate recovery from tampering incidents within the Kafka system.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attack on Brokers](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attack_on_brokers.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods Kafka brokers with a large volume of requests (e.g., produce or consume requests) directly targeting Kafka's APIs or exploits resource-intensive operations within Kafka's processing logic, overwhelming the broker's resources (CPU, memory, network) managed by Kafka.

**Impact:** Broker performance degradation within the Kafka cluster, inability to process messages within Kafka, potential for broker crashes and service unavailability of the Kafka service, impacting applications dependent on Kafka.

**Affected Component:** Kafka Broker (specifically the request handling and resource management modules within the Kafka broker).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement resource quotas and rate limiting for producers and consumers as configured within Kafka.
* Utilize network-level DoS protection mechanisms (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems) to filter malicious traffic before it reaches the Kafka brokers.
* Monitor broker resource utilization within Kafka and implement alerting for anomalies.
* Properly configure Kafka settings related to request sizes and timeouts.

## Threat: [Broker Impersonation](./threats/broker_impersonation.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor sets up a rogue Kafka broker that pretends to be a legitimate member of the Kafka cluster. This rogue broker could intercept messages intended for the real brokers, provide incorrect metadata about the Kafka cluster, or disrupt core Kafka cluster operations.

**Impact:** Data breaches by intercepting Kafka messages, data corruption due to the rogue broker's actions, cluster instability within Kafka, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks targeting Kafka's internal communication.

**Affected Component:** Kafka Broker (specifically the cluster membership and communication protocols within Kafka).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable TLS encryption for inter-broker communication within Kafka and enforce certificate verification for brokers joining the cluster.
* Implement strong authentication for brokers joining the cluster (e.g., using certificates managed by Kafka).
* Monitor Kafka cluster membership for unexpected brokers.

## Threat: [Malicious Payload Injection by Producers](./threats/malicious_payload_injection_by_producers.md)

**Description:** A compromised or malicious producer sends messages containing malicious payloads through Kafka's producer API, designed to exploit vulnerabilities in consumer applications that process messages from Kafka.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on consumer systems that process data from Kafka, data breaches on consumer systems triggered by malicious Kafka messages, denial of service on consumers due to processing malicious Kafka messages.

**Affected Component:** Producer API, Kafka Broker (topic partitions managed by Kafka), Consumer API.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the consumer side when processing messages received from Kafka.
* Utilize schema validation within Kafka or at the consumer level to enforce message structure and prevent unexpected data from being processed.
* Consider using security scanning tools on messages consumed from Kafka before further processing.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Topic Consumption](./threats/unauthorized_topic_consumption.md)

**Description:** An unauthorized consumer gains access to and reads messages from Kafka topics they are not permitted to access through Kafka's consumer API.

**Impact:** Data breaches by exfiltrating sensitive information stored in Kafka topics, violation of data privacy regulations due to unauthorized access to Kafka data.

**Affected Component:** Consumer API, Kafka Broker (authorization module within Kafka).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for consumers connecting to Kafka.
* Utilize Access Control Lists (ACLs) provided by Kafka to restrict topic access based on user or group.
* Encrypt sensitive data within messages stored in Kafka topics.

## Threat: [Compromised Kafka Connect Connector](./threats/compromised_kafka_connect_connector.md)

**Description:** Using a vulnerable or malicious Kafka Connect connector can introduce security risks directly into the Kafka ecosystem. A compromised connector could exfiltrate data from Kafka, inject malicious data into Kafka topics, or perform other unauthorized actions within the Kafka Connect framework.

**Impact:** Data breaches from Kafka sources, data corruption within Kafka topics, potential for remote code execution on the Kafka Connect worker nodes.

**Affected Component:** Kafka Connect framework, specific connector implementation interacting with Kafka.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only use trusted and verified Kafka Connect connectors.
* Regularly update connectors to patch known vulnerabilities within the Kafka Connect ecosystem.
* Implement security scanning for connector code used within Kafka Connect.
* Run Kafka Connect workers in a secure environment with appropriate access controls.
