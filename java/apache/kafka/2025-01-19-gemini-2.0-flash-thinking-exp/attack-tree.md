## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Application Data via Kafka](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_application_data_via_kafka.md)

**Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Messages [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Compromise Producer Application [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Exploit Application Vulnerability (e.g., Injection Flaw): Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the producer application's code (like SQL injection or command injection) to send crafted messages to Kafka.
    *   Gain Access to Producer Credentials/Keys: Attackers obtain valid credentials or API keys used by the producer application, allowing them to send arbitrary messages.
*   **Exploit Kafka Topic Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Modify ACLs to Allow Unauthorized Writes: Attackers with administrative privileges (or through exploiting vulnerabilities) alter Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Kafka topics to grant themselves write access.
    *   Disable Authentication/Authorization: In severely misconfigured environments, attackers might be able to disable authentication and authorization entirely, allowing anyone to write to topics.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Functionality via Kafka](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_functionality_via_kafka.md)

**Attack Vector: Denial of Service (DoS) on Kafka Brokers [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   Send Large Volume of Messages: Attackers, potentially using compromised producers or botnets, flood Kafka brokers with a massive number of messages, overwhelming their resources.
*   Exploit Lack of Rate Limiting/Quotas: If Kafka is not configured with proper rate limits or quotas, attackers can easily overwhelm the brokers with messages.
*   Exploit Kafka Broker Vulnerability: Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Kafka broker software to cause resource exhaustion or crashes.
*   Flood Broker with Connection Requests: Attackers send a large number of connection requests to the brokers, exhausting their connection handling capacity.
*   Exploit Kafka Protocol Vulnerabilities: Attackers craft malicious requests that exploit weaknesses in the Kafka protocol implementation, leading to broker instability.
*   **Attack Vector: Denial of Service (DoS) on Zookeeper [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   Send Malformed Requests to Zookeeper: Attackers send specially crafted, invalid requests to Zookeeper, causing it to become unstable or crash.
    *   Exploit Zookeeper Vulnerability: Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Zookeeper software to cause resource exhaustion or crashes.
    *   Flood Zookeeper with Connection Requests: Attackers send a large number of connection requests to Zookeeper, overwhelming its ability to manage connections and maintain quorum.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Kafka Data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_kafka_data.md)

**Attack Vector: Read Sensitive Data from Topics [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   Connect to Kafka Cluster Without Credentials: If authentication is not enabled or enforced, attackers can directly connect to the Kafka cluster and read messages from topics.
    *   Default or Weak Credentials: Attackers use default or easily guessable credentials to authenticate and access Kafka data.
*   Exploit Misconfigured ACLs: Attackers exploit overly permissive or incorrectly configured Access Control Lists (ACLs) to gain read access to sensitive topics.
*   **Attack Vector: Access Kafka Configuration Data**
    *   **Compromise Zookeeper [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Exploit Zookeeper Vulnerability: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Zookeeper to gain unauthorized access to its data, which includes Kafka cluster metadata and configurations.
        *   Default or Weak Zookeeper Credentials: Attackers use default or weak credentials to access the Zookeeper ensemble, gaining access to Kafka configuration.
