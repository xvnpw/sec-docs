# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/kafka

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Client Connections (Producers/Consumers to Brokers)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_client_connections__producersconsumers_to_brokers_.md)

* **Description:** Communication between client applications (producers and consumers) and Kafka brokers is not encrypted or authenticated.
    * **How Kafka Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Kafka brokers expose ports for client connections, and if TLS encryption and authentication are not enabled, this communication channel is vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts data being sent by a producer or received by a consumer, potentially revealing sensitive information like customer data or financial transactions.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, potential for data manipulation if the attacker can inject messages.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable TLS encryption: Configure Kafka brokers and clients to use TLS for encrypting all communication.
        * Implement strong authentication: Use mechanisms like SASL/SCRAM or mutual TLS to authenticate clients connecting to the brokers.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Inter-Broker Communication](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_inter-broker_communication.md)

* **Description:** Communication between Kafka brokers within the cluster is not encrypted or authenticated.
    * **How Kafka Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Kafka brokers need to communicate for data replication and cluster management. If this communication is not secured, it becomes a target.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the internal network eavesdrops on data being replicated between brokers or manipulates cluster metadata, potentially leading to data corruption or cluster instability.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, cluster instability, potential for denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable TLS encryption for inter-broker communication: Configure Kafka brokers to use TLS for all internal communication.
        * Implement inter-broker authentication: Use mechanisms to authenticate brokers to each other, preventing unauthorized brokers from joining the cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication and Authorization on Brokers](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authentication_and_authorization_on_brokers.md)

* **Description:** Kafka brokers do not require authentication for client connections or do not enforce granular authorization controls.
    * **How Kafka Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Kafka's design allows for configurable authentication and authorization. If these features are not enabled or properly configured, it creates a significant vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An unauthorized application or user connects to the Kafka cluster and produces malicious messages, consumes sensitive data from topics they shouldn't have access to, or performs administrative actions they are not permitted to.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, operational disruptions.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable authentication: Configure Kafka brokers to require authentication for all client connections (e.g., using SASL/SCRAM).
        * Implement granular authorization (ACLs): Define Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control which users or applications can perform specific actions (produce, consume, create topics, etc.) on specific topics.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Kafka Connect Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_kafka_connect_plugins.md)

* **Description:**  Kafka Connect relies on plugins (connectors) to integrate with external systems. These plugins might contain security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Kafka Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Kafka Connect's architecture allows for the use of external plugins, and the security of the overall system depends on the security of these plugins.
    * **Example:** A malicious or vulnerable connector is deployed, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Kafka Connect worker, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or other connected systems.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, compromise of connected systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully vet and select connectors: Only use connectors from trusted sources and review their code if possible.
        * Keep connectors up-to-date: Regularly update connectors to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Implement security scanning for connectors: Use tools to scan connectors for potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
        * Run Kafka Connect workers in isolated environments: Limit the impact of a compromised connector by isolating the worker processes.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Kafka REST Proxy (if used)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_kafka_rest_proxy__if_used_.md)

* **Description:** The Kafka REST Proxy, if used, exposes a RESTful interface to Kafka without proper authentication and authorization.
    * **How Kafka Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The REST Proxy is an optional component that adds a new entry point to interact with Kafka. If not secured, this entry point is vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses the unsecured REST API to produce malicious messages to Kafka topics or consume sensitive data without proper authorization.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to Kafka resources.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement authentication and authorization on the REST Proxy: Configure the REST Proxy to require authentication (e.g., using OAuth 2.0) and enforce authorization policies.
        * Use HTTPS: Ensure all communication with the REST Proxy is over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
        * Secure the underlying Kafka cluster: The security of the REST Proxy relies on the security of the underlying Kafka cluster.
