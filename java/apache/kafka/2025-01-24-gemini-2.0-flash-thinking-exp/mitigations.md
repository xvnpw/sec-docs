# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/kafka

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Kafka ACLs (Access Control Lists)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_kafka_acls__access_control_lists_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Kafka ACLs (Access Control Lists)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authorizer:** Configure Kafka brokers to use an ACL authorizer by setting `authorizer.class.name` in `server.properties` (e.g., `kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer`).
    2.  **Define ACL Rules:** Use `kafka-acls.sh` or Kafka AdminClient API to create ACLs. Each ACL specifies:
        *   **Principal:** User or service account (e.g., `User:app-producer`).
        *   **Permission Type:** `Allow` or `Deny`.
        *   **Operation:** Action being controlled (e.g., `Write`, `Read`, `Create`).
        *   **Resource Type:** Kafka resource (e.g., `Topic`, `Group`).
        *   **Resource Name:** Specific resource or wildcard (e.g., `topic-name`, `*`).
    3.  **Apply Granular Permissions:** Define ACLs at topic and group levels to enforce least privilege. Producers should only have `Write` on specific topics, consumers only `Read`, etc.
    4.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Audit and update ACLs to reflect changes in application roles and access needs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized reading of topic data.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized writing or altering of topic data.
    *   **Unauthorized Topic/Group Management (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized creation, deletion, or configuration changes of topics and consumer groups.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces unauthorized access and modification risks by enforcing fine-grained access control within Kafka.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if ACLs are currently implemented and where. For example: "ACLs are enabled in production Kafka cluster." or "Not currently implemented."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where ACLs are missing. For example: "ACLs are not configured for development and staging environments." or "ACLs are only implemented for topics, not consumer groups."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Client Authentication (SASL/TLS)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_client_authentication__sasltls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Client Authentication (SASL/TLS)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose SASL Mechanism:** Select a SASL mechanism (e.g., `SASL/SCRAM`, `SASL/PLAIN`, `SASL/GSSAPI`) or TLS Client Authentication.
    2.  **Broker Configuration:** Configure brokers in `server.properties` to enable the chosen mechanism. Example for `SASL/SCRAM`:
        *   `security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_SSL`
        *   `listeners=SASL_SSL://:9093`
        *   `sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=SCRAM-SHA-256`
        *   `sasl.enabled.mechanisms=SCRAM-SHA-256`
        *   `ssl.client.auth=required` (if using TLS for encryption)
        *   Configure JAAS for credential management.
    3.  **Client Configuration:** Configure producers and consumers to use the same mechanism in their properties (e.g., `producer.properties`, `consumer.properties`). Example for `SASL/SCRAM`:
        *   `security.protocol=SASL_SSL`
        *   `sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256`
        *   `sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required username="<user>" password="<password>";`
        *   `ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/truststore.jks` (if using TLS)
    4.  **Secure Credential Management:** Securely manage client credentials, avoiding hardcoding. Use secrets management solutions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Kafka Cluster (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from connecting to brokers.
    *   **Spoofing/Impersonation (High Severity):** Reduces risk of malicious actors impersonating legitimate clients.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces unauthorized access by verifying client identity before allowing connections.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if client authentication is implemented and which mechanism is used. For example: "SASL/SCRAM is used for production clients." or "Not currently implemented."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where client authentication is missing. For example: "Client authentication is not enforced in development." or "Consumers are not yet configured for authentication."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS Encryption for Data in Transit](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tls_encryption_for_data_in_transit.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** TLS Encryption for Data in Transit
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate Keystores/Truststores:** Create JKS keystores for brokers and truststores for brokers and clients, containing certificates and keys.
    2.  **Broker Configuration:** Configure brokers in `server.properties` to enable TLS listeners and specify keystore/truststore paths and passwords. Example:
        *   `listeners=SSL://:9093`
        *   `security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL`
        *   `ssl.keystore.location=/path/to/broker.keystore.jks`
        *   `ssl.keystore.password=<password>`
        *   `ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/broker.truststore.jks`
        *   `ssl.truststore.password=<password>`
    3.  **Client Configuration:** Configure clients to use TLS and specify truststore paths and passwords in client properties. Example:
        *   `security.protocol=SSL`
        *   `ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/client.truststore.jks`
        *   `ssl.truststore.password=<password>`
    4.  **Strong Cipher Suites:** Configure strong TLS cipher suites in broker and client configurations.
    5.  **Certificate Management:** Implement a process for managing certificates (issuance, renewal, revocation).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Interception (Confidentiality Breach - High Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping on data in transit.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Integrity and Confidentiality Breach - High Severity):** Protects against interception and manipulation of communication.
    *   **Data Tampering in Transit (Integrity Breach - Medium Severity):** TLS ensures data integrity during transmission.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces data breach risks by ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if TLS is implemented and where. For example: "TLS is enabled for all production Kafka communication." or "TLS is used for client-broker, but not inter-broker."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where TLS is missing. For example: "TLS is not enabled in staging." or "Inter-broker communication is not yet TLS encrypted."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Message Checksums (Kafka's Built-in)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_message_checksums__kafka's_built-in_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Message Checksums
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Checksums (Default):** Kafka, by default, enables message checksums. Ensure this default configuration is maintained and not disabled.
    2.  **Monitor for Checksum Errors:** Monitor Kafka broker logs and metrics for checksum errors, which could indicate data corruption during storage or transmission.
    3.  **Investigate Checksum Failures:** If checksum errors are detected, investigate potential causes such as hardware issues, network problems, or software bugs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Integrity Breach - Medium Severity):** Detects accidental data corruption during storage or transmission within Kafka.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces the risk of undetected data corruption by providing a mechanism to verify message integrity.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if checksums are enabled and monitored. For example: "Message checksums are enabled by default and monitored in production." or "Checksum monitoring is not yet implemented."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify if checksum monitoring is missing. For example: "Alerting on checksum errors is not yet configured." or "No specific monitoring for checksum errors is in place."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Kafka Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/implement_kafka_quotas.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Kafka Quotas
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Default Quotas:** Set default quotas in `server.properties` for producer/consumer bandwidth and request rates (e.g., `producer.quota.byte.rate.default`, `consumer.quota.byte.rate.default`).
    2.  **Override Quotas (Granular Control):** Use `kafka-configs.sh` or AdminClient API to override default quotas for specific users or client IDs for finer control.
    3.  **Monitor Quota Usage:** Monitor Kafka metrics related to quota violations and resource utilization to ensure quotas are effective and adjust as needed.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) by Resource Exhaustion (High Severity):** Prevents a single client from monopolizing Kafka resources and impacting cluster stability.
    *   **"Noisy Neighbor" Problem (Performance Degradation - Medium Severity):** Prevents one application's excessive usage from affecting others.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces DoS and performance degradation risks by limiting resource consumption per client within Kafka.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if quotas are implemented and what types. For example: "Producer and consumer bandwidth quotas are implemented in production." or "Only default quotas are used."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where quotas are missing or need improvement. For example: "Quotas are not enforced in development." or "Granular quotas per application are not yet implemented."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Kafka](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_kafka.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Kafka Updates
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to Kafka security mailing lists and monitor CVE databases for Kafka vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Test Patches in Non-Production:** Test security patches and upgrades in staging/development environments before production.
    3.  **Apply Patches Promptly:** Apply tested patches and upgrades to production Kafka clusters in a timely manner during maintenance windows.
    4.  **Automate Patching (Optional):** Consider automating patching using configuration management tools.
    5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities and repeat the patching process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Reduces risk of attackers exploiting publicly known Kafka vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces exploitation risk by keeping Kafka software up-to-date with security patches.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if a regular update process is in place. For example: "Monthly Kafka patch review and application process is in place." or "Kafka is updated only on major releases."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify areas for improvement in updates. For example: "Automated patching is not yet implemented." or "Patching frequency could be improved."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kafka Broker Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kafka_broker_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Kafka Broker Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to Kafka security best practices during broker configuration.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any Kafka broker features or components that are not required for your application to reduce the attack surface.
    3.  **Harden Broker OS:** Harden the operating systems hosting Kafka brokers by applying OS-level security configurations and patches.
    4.  **Restrict Network Access:** Use firewalls to restrict network access to Kafka brokers to only authorized clients and services.

    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces risks arising from insecure default configurations or misconfigurations of Kafka brokers.
    *   **Unnecessary Service Exposure (Medium Severity):** Minimizes the attack surface by disabling unused features and services.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces risks associated with misconfigurations and unnecessary exposure by hardening Kafka broker settings.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if secure broker configuration practices are followed. For example: "Kafka brokers are configured according to security best practices in production." or "Default configurations are mostly used."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify areas for improvement in broker configuration. For example: "Regular security configuration reviews are not yet performed." or "Unnecessary features might still be enabled."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Kafka Kraft Mode (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/consider_kafka_kraft_mode__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Kafka Kraft Mode
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Evaluate Kraft Mode:** For new Kafka deployments or upgrades, evaluate migrating to Kafka Kraft mode, which removes the dependency on Zookeeper for metadata management.
    2.  **Deploy Kraft Mode Cluster:** If suitable, deploy new Kafka clusters in Kraft mode. Follow Kafka documentation for Kraft mode setup and configuration.
    3.  **Migrate to Kraft Mode (If Applicable):** For existing Zookeeper-based clusters, plan and execute a migration to Kraft mode if feasible and beneficial for your environment.
    4.  **Secure Kraft Controllers:** In Kraft mode, secure the Kafka controllers, as they now handle metadata management previously done by Zookeeper.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Zookeeper Related Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** Eliminates vulnerabilities and security risks associated with running and managing a separate Zookeeper cluster.
    *   **Complexity of Zookeeper Security (Medium Severity):** Reduces the complexity of securing the overall Kafka infrastructure by removing Zookeeper dependency.
*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces risks associated with Zookeeper dependency by eliminating Zookeeper as a separate component.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if Kraft mode is currently used. For example: "New Kafka clusters are deployed in Kraft mode." or "Still using Zookeeper-based Kafka."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify if Kraft mode is being considered or not. For example: "Migration to Kraft mode is being evaluated for future upgrades." or "No plans to migrate to Kraft mode currently."]
