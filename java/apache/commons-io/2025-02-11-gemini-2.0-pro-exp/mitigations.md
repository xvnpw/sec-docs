# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/commons-io

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Filename Validation and Sanitization with `FilenameUtils` and `File`](./mitigation_strategies/strict_filename_validation_and_sanitization_with__filenameutils__and__file_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Whitelist:** Create a list of allowed characters for filenames (e.g., `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]`).
    2.  **Input Validation:** Validate user-supplied filenames against the whitelist. Reject invalid input.
    3.  **Normalization (Commons IO):** Use `FilenameUtils.normalize(filename)` to handle path separator variations and relative path components.  This is a *helper* function, *not* the primary defense.
    4.  **Canonical Path Check (Commons IO + `File`):** Create a `File` object: `new File(baseDirectory, normalizedFilename)`.  Use `file.getCanonicalPath()` to get the absolute, resolved path.  This is *crucial* for security.
    5.  **Base Directory Comparison:** Compare the canonical path to the canonical path of the base directory. Ensure the file's canonical path *starts with* the base directory's canonical path.
    6.  **Reject Invalid Paths:** Reject the request if any checks fail.
    7. **Encoding:** Ensure that the filename is properly encoded.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal / Directory Traversal:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Attackers can access files outside the intended scope.  `FilenameUtils.normalize()` and `File.getCanonicalPath()` are key to mitigating this.
    *   **Injection Attacks (Indirectly):** (Severity: **High**) - By ensuring a clean filename, we reduce the risk of injection in other parts of the system that might use the filename.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** Risk reduced from **Critical** to **Low** (if implemented correctly, including the canonical path check).
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low** (indirectly).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation in `UploadService.java` and `FileDownloadService.java`, but incomplete and insecure (missing whitelist and canonical path check).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`UploadService.java`:** Needs whitelist, canonical path check, base directory comparison.
    *   **`FileDownloadService.java`:** Needs whitelist, canonical path check.
    *   **`ReportGenerator.java`:**  Completely missing.
    *   **All file system interactions:** Audit and implement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe File Overwrite Handling with `FileUtils.fileExists()`](./mitigation_strategies/safe_file_overwrite_handling_with__fileutils_fileexists___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Existence Check (Commons IO):** Before using `FileUtils.writeStringToFile` (or similar write methods), *always* use `FileUtils.fileExists(file)` to check if the file already exists.
    2.  **Define Overwrite Policy:**
        *   **Never Overwrite:** Throw an exception or return an error if the file exists.
        *   **Generate Unique Filenames:** Generate a unique filename (e.g., with a timestamp or UUID) to avoid collisions.
        *   **User Confirmation (if applicable):** Prompt the user for confirmation.
    3. **Atomic operations:** If possible, use file system features or libraries that provide atomic file operations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintended File Overwrites:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Accidental or malicious overwriting of existing files.  `FileUtils.fileExists()` is the direct mitigation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintended File Overwrites:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`ReportGenerator.java`:** Critical.
    *   **`LogArchiver.java`:** Critical.
    *   **All components writing files:** Implement in all relevant locations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Symbolic Link Attack Prevention with `File.getCanonicalPath()`](./mitigation_strategies/symbolic_link_attack_prevention_with__file_getcanonicalpath___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Symbolic Links (Preferred):** If possible, avoid handling symbolic links.
    2.  **Resolve and Validate (If Necessary - Commons IO + `File`):** If symbolic links *must* be handled:
        *   Use `File.getCanonicalPath()` to resolve the symbolic link to its *actual* target.  This is the *key* step involving Commons IO's interaction with the `File` object.
        *   Perform the canonical path check and base directory comparison (as in the "Strict Filename Validation" strategy).
    3. **Disable following of symbolic links:** If the application does not need to follow symbolic links, use methods that do not follow them, or configure the file system interactions to avoid following them.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Symbolic Link Attacks:** (Severity: **High**) - Attackers can bypass access controls using symbolic links.  `File.getCanonicalPath()` is crucial for safe resolution.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Symbolic Link Attacks:** Risk reduced from **High** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **System-Wide:** Determine if symbolic links are needed. Implement resolution and validation if necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Commons IO Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_commons_io_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use a Dependency Manager:** Use Maven or Gradle.
    2.  **Regular Updates:** Check for and apply updates to Commons IO.
    3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use an SCA tool.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Commons IO:** (Severity: **Variable**) - Exploits targeting known vulnerabilities in the library itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from **Variable** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Maven is used.
    *   No vulnerability scanning.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate an SCA tool.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Establish a process for updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid deprecated methods of Commons IO](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_deprecated_methods_of_commons_io.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly review the API documentation:** When using Commons IO, always refer to the latest API documentation to identify deprecated methods.
    2.  **Replace deprecated methods:** If you find any deprecated methods in your code, replace them with the recommended alternatives. The documentation usually indicates the replacement methods.
    3.  **Use IDE warnings:** Configure your IDE to highlight deprecated method usage. This will help you identify and address them during development.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Deprecated Methods:** (Severity: **Variable**, depends on the specific vulnerability) - Using deprecated methods that might have security issues.
    *   **Compatibility Issues:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Deprecated methods might be removed in future versions, leading to application breakage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced from **Variable** to **Low** (by using up-to-date methods).
    *   **Compatibility Issues:** Risk reduced from **Medium** to **Low**.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No specific checks for deprecated methods are currently in place.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Code Review:** Include a check for deprecated method usage in code reviews.
    *   **IDE Configuration:** Configure the IDE to highlight deprecated methods.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use a static analysis tool that can detect the use of deprecated methods.
