# Threat Model Analysis for apache/commons-io

## Threat: [Threat: Arbitrary File Overwrite via Zip Slip](./threats/threat_arbitrary_file_overwrite_via_zip_slip.md)

*   **Threat:**  Arbitrary File Overwrite via Zip Slip
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious ZIP archive containing files with names that include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../foo.txt`).  The application uses Commons IO's `FilenameUtils.normalize()` to process the filenames *but does not validate the resulting absolute path before writing the extracted files*. The attacker aims to overwrite critical system files or configuration files outside the intended extraction directory.
    *   **Impact:**  System compromise, data corruption, denial of service, potential code execution (if overwritten files are executable or configuration files that control application behavior).
    *   **Affected Component:** `FilenameUtils.normalize()` (when used *incorrectly* in conjunction with ZIP file extraction).  The core issue is *not* `normalize()` itself, but its misuse in the context of file extraction without proper validation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** *Always* validate the *absolute, final* file path *after* any normalization and *before* creating any files during extraction.  Ensure the resulting path is within the intended, sandboxed extraction directory.  Do *not* rely solely on `FilenameUtils.normalize()`.
        *   **Strongly Recommended:** Use a dedicated ZIP library (e.g., Apache Commons Compress) that provides built-in protection against Zip Slip, rather than manually handling file paths with Commons IO.
        *   Avoid extracting ZIP archives from untrusted sources.
        *   Implement a strict whitelist of allowed characters in filenames.
        *   Run the application with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service via Large File Upload/Copy](./threats/threat_denial_of_service_via_large_file_uploadcopy.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via Large File Upload/Copy
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads or provides a path to an extremely large file to an application endpoint that uses Commons IO to read or copy the file (e.g., `FileUtils.copyFile()`, `FileUtils.readFileToString()`, `IOUtils.copy()`). The attacker's goal is to exhaust server resources (memory, disk space, CPU) and make the application unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service, application crash, potential system instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** `FileUtils.copyFile()`, `FileUtils.readFileToString()`, `FileUtils.readLines()`, `IOUtils.copy()`, `IOUtils.toByteArray()`, and any other methods that read or write entire files or large chunks of data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation on file sizes.  Reject files exceeding a predefined maximum size limit.
        *   Use streaming operations (e.g., `IOUtils.copy(InputStream, OutputStream)`) with a reasonable buffer size (e.g., 4KB, 8KB) instead of loading entire files into memory.
        *   Set resource limits (memory, disk space) on the application process.
        *   Implement timeouts for file operations to prevent them from running indefinitely.
        *   Monitor resource usage and alert on unusual activity.

## Threat: [Threat: Denial of Service via File Handle Exhaustion](./threats/threat_denial_of_service_via_file_handle_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:**  Denial of Service via File Handle Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker triggers a code path within the application that repeatedly opens files using Commons IO utilities (e.g., within a loop) but fails to close them properly.  The attacker aims to exhaust the operating system's limit on open file handles, preventing the application (and potentially other processes) from opening new files.
    *   **Impact:**  Denial of service, application instability, potential system-wide impact.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Commons IO method that opens a file stream (e.g., `FileUtils.openInputStream()`, `FileUtils.openOutputStream()`, methods that use these internally like `FileUtils.readFileToString()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucial:** Always close file streams (InputStreams, OutputStreams, Readers, Writers) in a `finally` block or using Java's try-with-resources statement to guarantee closure, even if exceptions occur.
        *   Prefer Commons IO methods that automatically handle closing, such as `FileUtils.readFileToString()` (but be mindful of memory usage for large files).
        *   Conduct code reviews to identify and fix potential resource leaks.
        *   Use static analysis tools to detect unclosed resources.

## Threat: [Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure via Temporary File Mishandling](./threats/threat_sensitive_data_exposure_via_temporary_file_mishandling.md)

*   **Threat:**  Sensitive Data Exposure via Temporary File Mishandling
    *   **Description:** The application uses Commons IO to create temporary files (e.g., `FileUtils.getTempDirectory()`, `File.createTempFile()`) to store sensitive data.  The attacker gains access to the temporary file directory (e.g., through a separate vulnerability or misconfiguration) and reads the contents of the temporary files before they are deleted (or if they are not deleted properly).
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII), potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** `FileUtils.getTempDirectory()`, `File.createTempFile()` (and any methods that use them internally).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucial:** Always delete temporary files explicitly using `FileUtils.deleteQuietly()` or `File.delete()` (with error handling) in a `finally` block or using try-with-resources.
        *   Set restrictive file permissions on temporary files when creating them, limiting access to the application's user.
        *   If possible, use in-memory operations (e.g., `ByteArrayOutputStream`) instead of temporary files to avoid filesystem persistence.
        *   Regularly audit and clean up temporary file directories.
        *   Consider using a dedicated temporary file management library that provides stronger security guarantees.
