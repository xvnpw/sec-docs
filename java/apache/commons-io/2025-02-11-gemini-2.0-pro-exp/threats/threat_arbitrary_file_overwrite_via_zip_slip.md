## 2. Vulnerability Explanation: Zip Slip

Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal attack that exploits the way applications handle ZIP file extraction.  A malicious actor creates a ZIP archive containing files with specially crafted filenames. These filenames include directory traversal sequences like `../` (or `..\` on Windows).  The goal is to trick the application into writing files *outside* the intended extraction directory.

**Example:**

Imagine an application extracts files to `/home/user/uploads/extracted/`.  A malicious ZIP file might contain a file named `../../../../etc/passwd`.  If the application doesn't properly validate the file path after processing the filename, it might attempt to write the extracted file to `/etc/passwd`, potentially overwriting the system's password file.

## 3. Code Example (Vulnerable)

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.zip.ZipEntry;
import java.util.zip.ZipInputStream;

public class VulnerableZipExtractor {

    public static void extractZip(InputStream zipStream, String destinationDir) throws IOException {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        try (ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(zipStream)) {
            ZipEntry zipEntry = zis.getNextEntry();
            while (zipEntry != null) {
                String fileName = zipEntry.getName();
                String normalizedFileName = FilenameUtils.normalize(fileName); // Normalize, but don't validate!
                File newFile = new File(destinationDir, normalizedFileName);

                // VULNERABILITY: No check to ensure newFile is within destinationDir
                if (zipEntry.isDirectory()) {
                    newFile.mkdirs();
                } else {
                    new File(newFile.getParent()).mkdirs(); // Ensure parent directories exist
                    try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(newFile)) {
                        int len;
                        while ((len = zis.read(buffer)) > 0) {
                            fos.write(buffer, 0, len);
                        }
                    }
                }
                zis.closeEntry();
                zipEntry = zis.getNextEntry();
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Example usage (assuming a malicious ZIP file is provided)
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("malicious.zip");
        extractZip(fis, "extracted");
        fis.close();
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

The `extractZip` method uses `FilenameUtils.normalize()` to process the filename from the ZIP entry.  However, it *fails* to check if the resulting `newFile`'s absolute path is still within the intended `destinationDir`.  This is the critical flaw.  An attacker can craft `malicious.zip` to contain a file like `../../../../tmp/evil.txt`, and this code would write it to `/tmp/evil.txt`, bypassing the intended `extracted/` directory.

## 4. Code Example (Mitigated)

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
import java.io.*;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.zip.ZipEntry;
import java.util.zip.ZipInputStream;

public class MitigatedZipExtractor {

    public static void extractZip(InputStream zipStream, String destinationDir) throws IOException {
        Path destinationPath = Paths.get(destinationDir).toAbsolutePath().normalize(); // Get absolute path

        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        try (ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(zipStream)) {
            ZipEntry zipEntry = zis.getNextEntry();
            while (zipEntry != null) {
                String fileName = zipEntry.getName();
                String normalizedFileName = FilenameUtils.normalize(fileName); // Normalize
                Path resolvedPath = destinationPath.resolve(normalizedFileName).normalize(); // Resolve against destination

                // CRITICAL: Check if the resolved path starts with the destination path
                if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(destinationPath)) {
                    throw new IOException("Invalid entry: " + fileName + " - outside destination directory.");
                }

                File newFile = resolvedPath.toFile(); // Convert to File for file operations

                if (zipEntry.isDirectory()) {
                    newFile.mkdirs();
                } else {
                    new File(newFile.getParent()).mkdirs(); // Ensure parent directories exist
                    try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(newFile)) {
                        int len;
                        while ((len = zis.read(buffer)) > 0) {
                            fos.write(buffer, 0, len);
                        }
                    }
                }
                zis.closeEntry();
                zipEntry = zis.getNextEntry();
            }
        }
    }
     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Example usage (assuming a malicious ZIP file is provided)
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("malicious.zip");
        extractZip(fis, "extracted");
        fis.close();
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Mitigation:**

1.  **Absolute Destination Path:**  We obtain the absolute, normalized path of the `destinationDir` using `Paths.get(destinationDir).toAbsolutePath().normalize()`.
2.  **Resolve and Normalize:**  We use `destinationPath.resolve(normalizedFileName).normalize()` to combine the destination path with the (normalized) filename from the ZIP entry.  This creates the *intended* absolute path.
3.  **`startsWith()` Check:**  The crucial step is `!resolvedPath.startsWith(destinationPath)`.  This verifies that the resolved path is *within* the intended destination directory.  If it's not, we throw an exception, preventing the file from being written outside the allowed area.
4. Use of `java.nio.file.Path` is strongly recommended for handling file paths.

## 5. `FilenameUtils.normalize()` Deep Dive

`FilenameUtils.normalize()` is *not* a security function.  Its purpose is to:

*   **Simplify Filenames:**  It removes redundant separators (`/` or `\`) and handles `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory) components *within* a path.
*   **Platform Consistency:**  It attempts to provide a consistent representation of a filename across different operating systems.

**Crucially, `normalize()` does *not* guarantee that the resulting path is safe or within a specific directory.**  It only performs textual manipulation.  It *can* remove `../` sequences, but it doesn't prevent an attacker from crafting a path that *starts* with enough `../` sequences to escape the intended directory.

**Example:**

*   `FilenameUtils.normalize("foo/bar/../baz.txt")`  ->  `foo/baz.txt` (Correctly handles `..`)
*   `FilenameUtils.normalize("../../../etc/passwd")` -> `../../../etc/passwd` (Does *not* prevent escaping)
*   `FilenameUtils.normalize("C:\\foo\\bar\\..\\baz.txt")` -> `C:\foo\baz.txt` (Windows)
*    `FilenameUtils.normalize("C:\\..\\..\\Windows\\System32\\evil.dll")` -> `C:\Windows\System32\evil.dll` (Windows - still dangerous!)

The key takeaway is that `normalize()` is a *helper function*, not a security validation function.  You *must* perform additional checks after using it.

## 6. Impact Analysis

A successful Zip Slip exploit can have severe consequences:

*   **System Compromise:**  Overwriting critical system files (like `/etc/passwd` on Linux or files in `C:\Windows\System32` on Windows) can lead to complete system takeover.
*   **Data Corruption:**  Overwriting application data files can lead to data loss or corruption.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overwriting configuration files or essential application components can render the application unusable.
*   **Code Execution:**  If the attacker can overwrite executable files or configuration files that control code execution (e.g., `.jar` files, `.dll` files, or configuration files that specify which code to load), they can potentially gain arbitrary code execution on the system.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful exploit can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization responsible for it.

## 7. Mitigation Strategy Breakdown

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the mitigation strategies:

*   **Primary: Absolute Path Validation (as shown in the mitigated code example):**
    *   This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   Always determine the *absolute, final* path of the file *after* any normalization.
    *   Use `java.nio.file.Path` for robust path handling.
    *   Use `startsWith()` to ensure the final path is within the intended extraction directory.
    *   Throw an exception or take other appropriate action if the path is invalid.

*   **Strongly Recommended: Use a Dedicated ZIP Library:**
    *   Libraries like Apache Commons Compress have built-in protection against Zip Slip.  They handle the path validation internally, reducing the risk of developer error.
    *   Example (using Commons Compress):

    ```java
     import org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipArchiveEntry;
     import org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.zip.ZipArchiveInputStream;
     import java.io.*;
     import java.nio.file.Files;
     import java.nio.file.Path;
     import java.nio.file.Paths;

     public class CommonsCompressZipExtractor {

         public static void extractZip(InputStream zipStream, String destinationDir) throws IOException {
             Path destinationPath = Paths.get(destinationDir).toAbsolutePath();

             try (ZipArchiveInputStream zis = new ZipArchiveInputStream(zipStream)) {
                 ZipArchiveEntry zipEntry;
                 while ((zipEntry = zis.getNextZipEntry()) != null) {
                     //Commons compress will check for zip slip, so we don't need to.
                     Path resolvedPath = destinationPath.resolve(zipEntry.getName()).normalize();

                     if (!Files.exists(resolvedPath.getParent())) {
                         Files.createDirectories(resolvedPath.getParent());
                     }

                     if (!zipEntry.isDirectory()) {
                         Files.copy(zis, resolvedPath);
                     }
                 }
             }
         }
         public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
             // Example usage (assuming a malicious ZIP file is provided)
             FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("malicious.zip");
             extractZip(fis, "extracted");
             fis.close();
         }
     }

    ```
    *   Commons Compress performs the necessary checks to prevent directory traversal, making it significantly safer than manual file handling.

*   **Avoid Untrusted Sources:**  If possible, avoid extracting ZIP archives from sources you don't fully trust.

*   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed characters in filenames.  This can help prevent the injection of directory traversal sequences.  However, this is a *defense-in-depth* measure and should *not* be relied upon as the sole protection.

*   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause if they successfully exploit the vulnerability.  For example, don't run the application as root or Administrator.

## 8. Testing Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs, SpotBugs, SonarQube) to identify potential Zip Slip vulnerabilities.  These tools can often detect missing path validation checks.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:** Use dynamic analysis tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) to test the application with malicious ZIP files.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests that specifically attempt to exploit the Zip Slip vulnerability.  Create ZIP files with directory traversal sequences and verify that the application correctly rejects them.  These tests should cover various edge cases, including:
    *   Filenames starting with `../`
    *   Filenames containing multiple `../` sequences
    *   Filenames with mixed forward and backward slashes (on Windows)
    *   Filenames with encoded characters (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f`)
*   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing techniques to generate a large number of malformed ZIP files and test the application's resilience.
* **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing, which includes attempting to exploit vulnerabilities like Zip Slip.

## 9. Alternative Library Recommendation (Apache Commons Compress)

As mentioned earlier, Apache Commons Compress is strongly recommended for handling ZIP files securely.  It provides a higher-level API that abstracts away the low-level details of ZIP file processing and includes built-in protection against Zip Slip.  Using Commons Compress significantly reduces the risk of developer error and makes the code more robust. The example code is provided above.

## Conclusion

The Zip Slip vulnerability is a serious threat that can lead to significant security breaches.  While Apache Commons IO's `FilenameUtils.normalize()` can be helpful for filename manipulation, it is *not* a security function and must be used with extreme caution.  The most effective mitigation is to *always* validate the absolute, final file path before writing any files during ZIP extraction.  Using a dedicated ZIP library like Apache Commons Compress, which provides built-in protection, is highly recommended.  Thorough testing, including unit tests and penetration testing, is essential to ensure the application is secure against this vulnerability.
