*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Operations
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input (e.g., filenames, paths) used in Commons IO file operations (like `FileUtils.copyFile`, `FileUtils.moveFile`, `FileUtils.writeStringToFile`) to access or modify files outside the intended directory. They might use sequences like `../` to navigate up the directory structure.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification of critical application files, potential for remote code execution if attacker can overwrite executable files.
    *   **Affected Commons IO Component:** `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils` (specifically functions like `copyFile`, `moveFile`, `writeStringToFile`, `readFileToString`, etc.)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths.
        *   Use canonicalization techniques (e.g., `File.getCanonicalPath()`) to resolve symbolic links and ensure the path stays within the expected boundaries.
        *   Avoid directly using user input in file path construction.
        *   Implement whitelisting of allowed paths or directories.
        *   Consider using a secure file storage mechanism that abstracts away the underlying file system.

*   **Threat:** Unintended File Deletion
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate input used in Commons IO file deletion operations (like `FileUtils.delete()` or `FileUtils.cleanDirectory()`) to delete unintended files or directories. This could happen if the application relies on user input to specify the target for deletion without proper validation.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, application malfunction, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Commons IO Component:** `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils` (specifically functions like `delete`, `cleanDirectory`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user input directly in file deletion operations.
        *   Implement robust access controls and authorization checks before performing deletion actions.
        *   Log file deletion events for auditing.
        *   Implement a "soft delete" mechanism where files are marked as deleted rather than immediately removed.
