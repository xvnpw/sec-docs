## Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using Apache Commons IO - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify application state, or disrupt application availability by leveraging vulnerabilities or misuse of the Apache Commons IO library within the target application.

**High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes Sub-Tree:**

*   Attack: Compromise Application via Commons-IO **[CRITICAL]**
    *   OR ─ Exploit File System Manipulation **[CRITICAL]**
        *   AND ─ Read Arbitrary Files **[CRITICAL]**
            *   *** Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability [CRITICAL] ***
                *   Application uses user-controlled path with commons-io file reading functions (e.g., FileUtils.readFileToString, FileUtils.lineIterator)
        *   AND ─ Write to Arbitrary Files **[CRITICAL]**
            *   *** Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability [CRITICAL] ***
                *   Application uses user-controlled path with commons-io file writing functions (e.g., FileUtils.writeStringToFile, FileUtils.copyFile)
            *   *** Overwrite Critical Application Files [CRITICAL] ***
                *   Attacker crafts malicious content and uses path traversal to overwrite configuration or executable files
            *   *** Inject Malicious Code [CRITICAL] ***
                *   Attacker writes a malicious script or executable to a location where the application might execute it
        *   AND ─ Move/Copy Files to Unauthorized Locations
            *   *** Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [CRITICAL] ***
                *   Attacker moves or copies sensitive application data to a publicly accessible location

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   **Attack: Compromise Application via Commons-IO [CRITICAL]**
    *   This is the overarching goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of vulnerabilities related to the use of Apache Commons IO.

*   **Exploit File System Manipulation [CRITICAL]**
    *   This category encompasses attacks that directly interact with the application's file system through the `commons-io` library. It represents a significant avenue for compromising the application.

*   **Read Arbitrary Files [CRITICAL]**
    *   This attack vector allows an attacker to access files on the server that they are not authorized to view. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, configuration details, or even source code.
        *   **Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**
            *   This vulnerability occurs when the application uses user-controlled input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate this input (e.g., using "..") to navigate outside the intended directories and access arbitrary files on the system using `commons-io` file reading functions.

*   **Write to Arbitrary Files [CRITICAL]**
    *   This attack vector allows an attacker to create or modify files on the server in locations they should not have access to. This can lead to various forms of compromise, including overwriting critical files or injecting malicious code.
        *   **Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerability [CRITICAL]**
            *   Similar to the read vulnerability, this occurs when user-controlled input is used to construct file paths for writing operations without proper validation. Attackers can use path traversal techniques to write to arbitrary locations using `commons-io` file writing functions.
        *   **Overwrite Critical Application Files [CRITICAL]**
            *   By exploiting a path traversal vulnerability, an attacker can write malicious content to overwrite critical application files such as configuration files, libraries, or executable files. This can lead to application malfunction, denial of service, or complete compromise.
        *   **Inject Malicious Code [CRITICAL]**
            *   Attackers can leverage the ability to write to arbitrary files to inject malicious code (e.g., scripts, executables) into locations where the application or the operating system might execute them. This can grant the attacker persistent access or the ability to execute arbitrary commands.

*   **Move/Copy Files to Unauthorized Locations**
    *   This category of attacks involves using `commons-io` functions to move or copy files to locations where the attacker can access them or where they can cause harm.
        *   **Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [CRITICAL]**
            *   If the application uses `commons-io` to move or copy files and an attacker can control either the source or destination path (often through a path traversal vulnerability), they can move or copy sensitive application data to a publicly accessible location or a location they control, leading to data exfiltration.
