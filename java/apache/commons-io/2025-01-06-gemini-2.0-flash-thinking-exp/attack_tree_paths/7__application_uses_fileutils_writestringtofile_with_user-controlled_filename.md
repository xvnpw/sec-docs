## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: "7. Application uses FileUtils.writeStringToFile with user-controlled filename"

As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, let's delve into a comprehensive analysis of the attack tree path: "7. Application uses `FileUtils.writeStringToFile` with user-controlled filename." This path highlights a critical vulnerability arising from the unsafe use of a common file manipulation utility.

**1. Deconstructing the Attack Tree Path:**

* **Node:** 7. Application uses `FileUtils.writeStringToFile` with user-controlled filename.
* **Core Function:** The vulnerability lies in the direct use of user-provided input to determine the destination filename within the `FileUtils.writeStringToFile()` method.
* **Underlying Issue:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization on the user-controlled filename.

**2. Detailed Explanation of the Attack Vector:**

The attack vector leverages the inherent functionality of file systems to interpret relative paths. When an application directly uses user input as a filename without validation, attackers can inject special characters and sequences to manipulate the intended file path. The most common technique is **path traversal**, using sequences like `../` to navigate up the directory structure.

**How it works:**

* **Vulnerable Code Snippet (Illustrative):**

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

public class FileWriteHandler {
    public void writeFile(HttpServletRequest request, String content) {
        String filename = request.getParameter("filename"); // User-controlled input
        File file = new File(filename);
        try {
            FileUtils.writeStringToFile(file, content, "UTF-8");
            System.out.println("File written successfully to: " + file.getAbsolutePath());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error writing file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

* **Attacker's Input:**  An attacker could provide a malicious payload for the `filename` parameter, such as:
    * `../../../var/www/html/backdoor.php`
    * `../../../../etc/passwd`
    * `../../../../home/user/important_data.txt`
    * `/absolute/path/to/sensitive/file`

* **Exploitation:** When the vulnerable code executes with the attacker's input, the `FileUtils.writeStringToFile()` method will attempt to write the provided `content` to the file path constructed using the malicious input.

**3. In-Depth Impact Analysis:**

The ability to write arbitrary files with attacker-controlled content has a wide range of severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**
    * **Web Shell Deployment:**  Writing a PHP, JSP, or other server-side scripting language file to the web server's document root allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The example of `backdoor.php` demonstrates this directly.
    * **Configuration File Modification:** Overwriting configuration files of the application or the operating system can lead to privilege escalation or complete system compromise. For instance, modifying SSH configurations or user account settings.
* **Data Manipulation and Corruption:**
    * **Overwriting Critical Data:** Attackers can overwrite important application data, database connection details, or user information, leading to data loss or application malfunction.
    * **Log Tampering:**  Modifying or deleting log files can hinder incident response and forensic analysis.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * **Filling Disk Space:** Repeatedly writing large files to arbitrary locations can exhaust disk space, causing the system to become unresponsive.
    * **Corrupting System Files:**  Overwriting essential system files can lead to system instability or failure.
* **Information Disclosure:**
    * **Writing to Publicly Accessible Locations:**  While not directly disclosing existing data, writing files with sensitive information to publicly accessible directories can lead to unintended exposure.
    * **Creating Symbolic Links:** In some cases, attackers might be able to create symbolic links to sensitive files, indirectly exposing their content.
* **Privilege Escalation:**  In certain scenarios, writing to specific system files or configuration files can allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system.

**4. Attacker's Perspective and Steps:**

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would typically follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Vulnerable Endpoint:** Locate the application functionality that takes user input for a filename and uses `FileUtils.writeStringToFile()`. This might involve analyzing the application's code, API endpoints, or web forms.
2. **Craft the Malicious Payload:**  Determine the target file path and the content to be written. This requires understanding the application's directory structure and the desired outcome (e.g., deploying a web shell, modifying a configuration file).
3. **Execute the Attack:** Send a request to the vulnerable endpoint with the crafted malicious filename. This could be through a web browser, a command-line tool like `curl`, or a custom script.
4. **Verify the Exploit:** Check if the file was successfully written to the intended location and if the desired impact has been achieved (e.g., accessing the deployed web shell).

**5. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:**

To prevent this vulnerability, the development team should implement the following security measures:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Characters:** Define a strict set of allowed characters for filenames and reject any input containing characters outside this set.
    * **Block Path Traversal Sequences:** Explicitly reject input containing sequences like `../`, `..\\`, `./`, `.\\`, and absolute paths (starting with `/` or drive letters like `C:`).
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce filename patterns and prevent malicious input.
* **Path Canonicalization:**
    * Use `File.getCanonicalPath()` after constructing the `File` object from user input. This resolves symbolic links and relative paths, ensuring the application operates within the intended directory. Compare the canonical path with the intended base directory to prevent traversal.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * The application should only have write access to the specific directories it needs to function correctly. Avoid running the application with overly permissive file system permissions.
* **Secure File Handling Practices:**
    * **Avoid Direct User Input for Filenames:**  Whenever possible, generate filenames server-side or use a mapping mechanism where user input maps to predefined, safe filenames.
    * **Use Unique Identifiers:** Assign unique identifiers to files and store them in a secure location, referencing them instead of relying on user-provided names.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the written content is intended to be served to the browser, implement a strong CSP to mitigate the risk of executing malicious scripts.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    * Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities like this. Use static analysis tools to automatically detect suspicious code patterns.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious requests containing path traversal sequences.
* **Framework-Specific Security Features:**
    * Utilize security features provided by the application framework (e.g., Spring Security, Django's file handling mechanisms) that offer built-in protection against path traversal.

**6. Developer-Focused Summary and Actionable Steps:**

For the development team, the key takeaways are:

* **Never directly use user-controlled input as a filename without thorough validation.**
* **Implement robust input validation to prevent path traversal attacks.**
* **Utilize path canonicalization to ensure file operations stay within intended boundaries.**
* **Adhere to the principle of least privilege for file system access.**
* **Prioritize secure file handling practices and avoid relying on user-provided filenames directly.**
* **Integrate security testing and code reviews into the development lifecycle.**

**Actionable Steps:**

1. **Review all instances of `FileUtils.writeStringToFile()` in the codebase.**
2. **Identify where user input is used to construct the filename.**
3. **Implement strict input validation and sanitization for those inputs.**
4. **Incorporate path canonicalization using `File.getCanonicalPath()` before performing file operations.**
5. **Conduct thorough testing to ensure the implemented mitigations are effective.**

**Conclusion:**

The attack path involving `FileUtils.writeStringToFile` with user-controlled filenames is a significant security risk. By understanding the attack vector, potential impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the application's attack surface and protect it from malicious actors. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability and equips the team with the knowledge necessary to address it effectively.
