## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: "Application uses FileUtils.copyFile with user-controlled destination path"

This analysis delves into the security implications of the attack tree path "Application uses `FileUtils.copyFile` with user-controlled destination path," focusing on the risks, potential impact, and mitigation strategies.

**1. Deconstructing the Attack Tree Path:**

* **Node:** Application uses `FileUtils.copyFile`
    * This indicates the application leverages the `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.copyFile(File srcFile, File destFile)` method. This method copies the content of the source file to the destination file.
* **Refinement:** with user-controlled destination path
    * This is the critical vulnerability. It signifies that the `destFile` parameter of the `copyFile` method is directly or indirectly influenced by user input without proper sanitization or validation.

**2. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

* **Mechanism:** The attacker manipulates the input that is eventually used to construct the `destFile` object passed to `FileUtils.copyFile`. This manipulation typically involves path traversal techniques.
* **Path Traversal:** Attackers use special character sequences like `..` (dot-dot-slash) to navigate outside the intended directory structure. By prepending or embedding these sequences in the user-controlled input, they can specify arbitrary file paths on the server's file system.
* **Example Scenario (Expanded):**
    * An application allows users to upload files, and upon successful upload, it copies the file to a designated location.
    * Vulnerable Code Snippet (Illustrative):
      ```java
      import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
      import java.io.File;
      import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

      public class FileUploadHandler {
          public void handleFileUpload(HttpServletRequest request, File uploadedFile) {
              String destinationPath = request.getParameter("destination"); // User-controlled input
              File destination = new File(destinationPath);
              try {
                  FileUtils.copyFile(uploadedFile, destination);
                  // ... success handling ...
              } catch (IOException e) {
                  // ... error handling ...
              }
          }
      }
      ```
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a request where the `destination` parameter contains a malicious path like `../../../etc/crontabs/www-data`. When the `copyFile` method is executed, the uploaded file will be copied to the `/etc/crontabs/www-data` file, potentially overwriting it or injecting malicious cron jobs.

**3. Impact Assessment:**

The ability to copy arbitrary files to unintended locations can have severe consequences, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and the underlying system.

* **Confidentiality Breach:**
    * **Copying Sensitive Data:** Attackers can copy sensitive configuration files (e.g., database credentials, API keys), application source code, or user data to publicly accessible locations or locations they control.
    * **Information Disclosure:** By copying files to web-accessible directories, attackers can expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.
* **Integrity Compromise:**
    * **Overwriting Critical Files:** Attackers can overwrite important system files, application binaries, or configuration files, leading to application malfunction, denial of service, or even system compromise.
    * **Introducing Malicious Code:**  As illustrated in the example, attackers can inject malicious scripts or executables into locations where they will be automatically executed (e.g., cron jobs, startup scripts, web server directories).
* **Availability Disruption:**
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can fill up disk space by repeatedly copying large files to arbitrary locations, leading to system instability or crashes.
    * **Application Failure:** Overwriting critical application files can render the application unusable.
* **Potential for Further Exploitation:**
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  If the application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to copy files to locations requiring those privileges, potentially gaining further control over the system.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  In a multi-system environment, successful exploitation on one system could be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems.

**4. Root Cause Analysis:**

The core issue lies in the **lack of proper input validation and sanitization** of the user-controlled destination path before using it in the `FileUtils.copyFile` method. The application trusts user input implicitly, allowing malicious path traversal sequences to be interpreted by the operating system.

**5. Detection and Identification:**

* **Static Code Analysis (SAST):** Tools can identify instances where `FileUtils.copyFile` is used with parameters derived from user input without proper validation. Look for patterns where `request.getParameter()`, `request.getHeader()`, or similar methods are used to construct the destination path.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Security scanners can simulate attacks by sending requests with malicious path traversal sequences in the destination parameter and observe the application's behavior.
* **Code Reviews:** Manual inspection of the codebase can reveal instances of this vulnerability. Developers should be trained to recognize this pattern.
* **Penetration Testing:** Security professionals can manually attempt to exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious requests.

**6. Prevention and Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation (Whitelisting):** The most effective approach is to **strictly validate** the user-provided destination path.
    * **Define Allowed Destinations:**  Maintain a whitelist of allowed destination directories or file names. Only allow copying to these predefined locations.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:** Use regular expressions to enforce a specific format for the destination path, preventing path traversal characters.
* **Canonicalization:**  Use methods to resolve the canonical (absolute and normalized) path of the user-provided input and compare it against the allowed destinations. This can help neutralize path traversal attempts.
    * Example using `File.getCanonicalPath()`:
      ```java
      String userInput = request.getParameter("destination");
      File destinationFile = new File(userInput);
      String canonicalPath = destinationFile.getCanonicalPath();

      // Check if canonicalPath starts with the allowed base directory
      if (canonicalPath.startsWith("/allowed/destination/path/")) {
          FileUtils.copyFile(uploadedFile, new File(canonicalPath));
      } else {
          // Handle invalid destination
          // ...
      }
      ```
* **Restrict Permissions:** Run the application with the least privileges necessary. This limits the impact of a successful attack, as the attacker will only be able to write to locations the application user has access to.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If possible, explore alternative approaches that don't involve directly using user input to define the destination path. For example, assign unique identifiers to uploaded files and store them in predefined, controlled directories.
* **Secure File Handling Libraries:** While `commons-io` provides basic file utilities, consider using more specialized libraries that offer built-in security features or abstractions to handle file operations securely.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly conduct security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be configured with rules to detect and block requests containing path traversal sequences in relevant parameters. This provides a layer of defense but should not be relied upon as the primary security measure.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly related to file copying, CSP can help mitigate the impact of injected malicious scripts if the attacker manages to place them in web-accessible locations.

**7. Specific Considerations for `commons-io`:**

* `FileUtils.copyFile` itself doesn't provide any built-in mechanisms for input validation or sanitization. It's the responsibility of the developer using the library to ensure the parameters passed to the method are safe.
* Be aware of other file manipulation methods in `commons-io` that might be vulnerable to similar issues if used with user-controlled input (e.g., `FileUtils.moveFile`, `FileUtils.writeStringToFile`).

**8. Conclusion:**

The attack tree path "Application uses `FileUtils.copyFile` with user-controlled destination path" highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from insufficient input validation. Failing to sanitize user input when constructing file paths can lead to severe security consequences, including data breaches, integrity compromises, and denial of service. Development teams must prioritize implementing robust input validation and sanitization techniques, along with other preventative measures, to mitigate this risk effectively. Regular security assessments and code reviews are crucial to identify and address such vulnerabilities proactively. Relying solely on external tools like WAFs is insufficient; security must be built into the application's design and implementation.
