## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Application uses FileUtils.readFileToString with user-controlled filename

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack path "Application uses `FileUtils.readFileToString` with user-controlled filename," focusing on the potential risks, exploitation methods, impact, and mitigation strategies. This analysis is crucial for the development team to understand the severity of this vulnerability and implement effective countermeasures.

**1. Deconstructing the Attack Path:**

* **Core Functionality:** The application utilizes the `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.readFileToString(File file, String encoding)` method. This method reads the entire content of a file into a String.
* **Vulnerable Element:** The `File file` parameter, representing the file to be read, is constructed using user-controlled input.
* **Lack of Sanitization:** The critical flaw lies in the absence of proper sanitization or validation of the user-provided input before it's used to construct the `File` object.

**2. Detailed Explanation of the Attack Vector:**

The attack vector hinges on the ability of an attacker to manipulate the filename passed to `FileUtils.readFileToString`. Without proper input validation, attackers can inject special characters and sequences that alter the intended file path. The most common technique is **Path Traversal (also known as Directory Traversal or "dot-dot-slash" attack)**.

* **Path Traversal:** By including sequences like `../` (go up one directory), an attacker can navigate outside the intended directory and access files elsewhere on the system.
    * **Example:** If the application intends to read files from a specific directory like `/app/data/`, and the user input is `../../../../etc/passwd`, the application will attempt to read the system's password file.

* **Other Potential Exploitation Scenarios (Less Common but Possible):**
    * **Absolute Paths:** If the application doesn't enforce a specific base directory, an attacker could provide an absolute path like `/etc/hosts` directly.
    * **Symbolic Links (Symlinks):** While less direct, if the application operates in an environment where symbolic links are present and accessible, an attacker might be able to point the filename to a sensitive file through a symlink. This depends heavily on the file system permissions and how the application handles symlinks.
    * **Filename Injection (Less Likely with `readFileToString`):** In scenarios where the filename is used in conjunction with other commands or operations, an attacker might try to inject malicious commands. However, with `readFileToString`, the primary focus is on file access.

**3. Example Scenarios and Code Snippets:**

Let's illustrate with a simplified Java example:

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class FileReadingServlet {

    public void readFileContent(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        String userInput = request.getParameter("filename"); // User provides filename

        // Vulnerable code: Directly using user input
        File fileToRead = new File(userInput);

        try {
            String fileContent = FileUtils.readFileToString(fileToRead, "UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().write(fileContent);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            response.getWriter().write("Error reading file.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Attack Execution:**

1. **Attacker identifies the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker discovers the `readFileContent` servlet and the `filename` parameter.
2. **Crafting the malicious payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious filename, such as `../../../etc/passwd`.
3. **Sending the malicious request:** The attacker sends a request to the server:
   `https://vulnerable-app.com/readFileContent?filename=../../../etc/passwd`
4. **Exploitation:** The `File` object is created with the malicious path, and `FileUtils.readFileToString` attempts to read the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
5. **Impact:** The content of the `/etc/passwd` file is returned to the attacker, potentially revealing user accounts and other sensitive information.

**4. Impact Assessment:**

The impact of this vulnerability can be severe, leading to:

* **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** This is the primary impact. Attackers can access configuration files, database credentials, API keys, source code, user data, and other confidential information stored on the system.
* **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** By accessing files like `/etc/shadow` (if permissions allow), attackers might obtain password hashes that could be cracked to gain higher privileges.
* **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive user data can lead to regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.
* **System Compromise (Indirect):**  Information gained through arbitrary file reading can be used to further compromise the system by revealing other vulnerabilities or access credentials.
* **Denial of Service (Indirect):** While less likely with `readFileToString`, if the attacker can read very large files, it could potentially impact the application's performance or resource consumption.

**5. Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**
    * **Whitelisting:**  The most secure approach is to define a strict set of allowed filenames or patterns. Only filenames that match the whitelist should be processed.
    * **Blacklisting (Less Secure, Use with Caution):**  Block known malicious sequences like `../`, `./`, absolute paths, and special characters. However, blacklists can be bypassed with creative encoding or variations.
    * **Canonicalization:** Convert the user-provided path to its canonical form (e.g., resolving symbolic links and redundant separators) to identify and prevent traversal attempts. Be aware that canonicalization itself can have vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.
    * **Path Normalization:**  Remove redundant separators (`//`), and resolve relative references (`.`, `..`).

* **Restrict File Access:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** The application should only have the necessary permissions to access the files it needs. Avoid running the application with overly permissive user accounts.
    * **Chroot Jails or Sandboxing:**  Confine the application's file system access to a specific directory, preventing it from accessing files outside that boundary.

* **Secure File Handling Practices:**
    * **Use Relative Paths:**  Construct file paths relative to a predefined base directory. This prevents attackers from navigating outside the intended location.
    * **Avoid Directly Using User Input for File Operations:**  Instead of directly using user input, use it as an index or identifier to look up the actual filename from a predefined and controlled list or database.

* **Code Review and Security Testing:**
    * **Manual Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code where `FileUtils.readFileToString` is used, paying close attention to how the filename is constructed.
    * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use SAST tools to automatically identify potential path traversal vulnerabilities in the code.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Use DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities during runtime.
    * **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security experts to perform penetration testing and identify real-world vulnerabilities.

* **Framework-Specific Protections:**
    * If using a web framework, leverage its built-in security features for input validation and sanitization.

* **Error Handling and Logging:**
    * Implement robust error handling to prevent the application from revealing sensitive information in error messages.
    * Log all file access attempts, including the filenames used. This can help in detecting and investigating malicious activity.

**6. Specific Considerations for `FileUtils.readFileToString`:**

* **Encoding:** While not directly related to the path traversal issue, ensure the correct encoding is specified to prevent character encoding vulnerabilities.
* **File Size:** Be mindful of the size of the files being read, as reading very large files into memory can lead to performance issues or denial-of-service. Consider using alternative methods for handling large files if necessary.

**7. Communication with the Development Team:**

When communicating this analysis to the development team, emphasize the following:

* **Severity:** Clearly explain the potential impact of this vulnerability, highlighting the risk of sensitive data disclosure.
* **Ease of Exploitation:**  Path traversal attacks are relatively easy to execute, making this a high-priority issue.
* **Importance of Secure Coding Practices:** Reinforce the need for secure coding practices, especially when handling user input.
* **Actionable Mitigation Strategies:** Provide clear and actionable steps for mitigating the vulnerability.
* **Testing and Verification:** Emphasize the importance of thorough testing to ensure the implemented mitigations are effective.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path involving `FileUtils.readFileToString` with user-controlled filenames presents a significant security risk due to the potential for arbitrary file disclosure. By understanding the attack vector, impact, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the application's vulnerability to path traversal attacks and protect sensitive information. Continuous vigilance, code reviews, and security testing are crucial to maintaining a secure application.
