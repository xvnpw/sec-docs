# Threat Model Analysis for apache/commons-io

## Threat: [Path Traversal](./threats/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input (e.g., filenames, paths) that is used in `commons-io` file operations (like `FileUtils.copyFile()`, `FileUtils.readFileToString()`, `FileUtils.openInputStream()`) to access or modify files outside of the intended directory. They might use sequences like `../` to navigate up the directory structure.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, modification of critical system files, or even remote code execution if an attacker can overwrite executable files.
*   **Affected Component:** `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils` (specifically methods dealing with file paths), `org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils` (when used with file streams based on potentially malicious paths).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input that is used to construct file paths.
    *   Use canonicalization methods (e.g., `File.getCanonicalPath()`) to resolve symbolic links and relative paths before performing file operations.
    *   Implement access control checks to ensure the application only accesses files it is authorized to.
    *   Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths; instead, use predefined, safe paths and allow users to select from a limited set of options.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large File Uploads/Processing](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_file_uploadsprocessing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could upload extremely large files or provide paths to very large files that the application processes using `commons-io` methods like `IOUtils.copy()`, `FileUtils.readFileToByteArray()`, or `FileUtils.copyInputStreamToFile()`. This could consume excessive server resources (memory, disk space, CPU), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:**  Application unavailability, performance degradation, potential server crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** `org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils` (methods for copying streams), `org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils` (methods for reading or copying entire files).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict file size limits for uploads.
    *   Use streaming techniques instead of loading entire files into memory when possible.
    *   Implement resource management and monitoring to detect and mitigate resource exhaustion.
    *   Configure timeouts for file processing operations.
    *   Consider using asynchronous processing for file operations to avoid blocking the main application thread.
