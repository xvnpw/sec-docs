# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/commons-io

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via File Path Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_file_path_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate file paths provided as input to access or modify files outside the intended directories.

**How commons-io Contributes:** `commons-io` provides utilities like `FilenameUtils` and `FileUtils` for manipulating file paths. If applications use these utilities to construct paths based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization, they become vulnerable. For instance, using methods like `FilenameUtils.normalize()` without sufficient validation can still be bypassed.

**Example:** An application allows users to download files by specifying a filename. If the application uses `FileUtils.readFileToString(new File(baseDir, userInput))` and `userInput` is "../../etc/passwd", an attacker could potentially read the system's password file.

**Impact:** Reading sensitive files, data breaches, arbitrary file modification or deletion, potential for remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user-provided file paths. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns.
*   **Canonicalization:** Resolve paths to their canonical form and compare them against allowed paths. Be aware that even canonicalization might have edge cases.
*   **Avoid Direct Path Construction:**  Instead of directly constructing paths from user input, use predefined identifiers or indices that map to safe file locations on the server.

## Attack Surface: [Symbolic Link Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/symbolic_link_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can leverage symbolic links to trick the application into accessing or modifying files or directories outside the intended scope.

**How commons-io Contributes:** `FileUtils` provides methods for copying, moving, and deleting files and directories. If an application operates on user-supplied paths and encounters a symbolic link pointing to a sensitive location, these operations might inadvertently affect the target of the link.

**Example:** An application uses `FileUtils.copyDirectory(userInputDir, destinationDir)`. If `userInputDir` contains a symbolic link pointing to a critical system directory, the contents of that system directory might be copied to `destinationDir`.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive files, unintended file modification or deletion, potential for privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Operations on User-Supplied Paths:** If possible, avoid performing file system operations directly on paths provided by users.
*   **Resolve Symbolic Links:** Before performing critical operations, resolve symbolic links to their actual targets and validate the target path. Be aware that resolving symbolic links can have performance implications.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Stream Consumption](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_stream_consumption.md)

**Description:** Attackers can provide excessively large or never-ending streams as input, causing the application to consume excessive memory or CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).

**How commons-io Contributes:** `IOUtils` provides utility methods for reading data from streams (e.g., `toByteArray()`, `toString()`). If an application uses these methods on streams without proper size limits or timeouts, it becomes vulnerable to resource exhaustion.

**Example:** An application uses `IOUtils.toByteArray(inputStream)` to process data from a user-uploaded file. If a malicious user uploads an extremely large file, this could lead to an `OutOfMemoryError` and crash the application.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application crashes, performance degradation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Set Size Limits:** Impose strict limits on the size of data read from input streams.
*   **Use Bounded Reads:** Read data in chunks instead of attempting to load the entire stream into memory at once.
*   **Implement Timeouts:** Set timeouts for stream read operations to prevent indefinite blocking.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities via Unsanitized Stream Content](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_via_unsanitized_stream_content.md)

**Description:** If an application reads data from a stream using `commons-io` and then processes this data without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious content that could be interpreted as commands or code.

**How commons-io Contributes:** `IOUtils` facilitates reading data from various input streams. If the application trusts the content of these streams without validation, it can be vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Example:** An application reads XML data from a stream using `IOUtils.toString()` and then parses it. If the XML contains malicious code within CDATA sections or other constructs, it could lead to an XML injection vulnerability.

**Impact:** Code execution, data manipulation, cross-site scripting (if the data is used in a web context).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize and validate all data read from streams before processing it.
*   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Encode output data appropriately based on the context where it will be used (e.g., HTML escaping for web output).
*   **Use Secure Parsing Libraries:** Employ secure parsing libraries that are resistant to injection attacks.
