## Attack Tree Path: [1. Read Sensitive Files [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__read_sensitive_files__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker's goal is to access confidential information stored within the application's file system. This could include configuration files, database credentials, API keys, or user data.
**Impact:**  Successful access to sensitive files can lead to complete compromise of the application and its associated data. Attackers can use this information for further attacks, data breaches, or extortion.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Path Traversal during File Reading [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_path_traversal_during_file_reading__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This technique involves manipulating file paths provided by the user to access files or directories outside of the intended scope. By including sequences like "../" in the filename, an attacker can navigate up the directory structure.
**Impact:** Allows attackers to bypass intended access controls and read any file the application process has permissions to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Application uses FileUtils.readFileToString with user-controlled filename](./attack_tree_paths/3__application_uses_fileutils_readfiletostring_with_user-controlled_filename.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses the `FileUtils.readFileToString()` method to read the contents of a file whose name is directly or indirectly controlled by user input. If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject path traversal sequences.
**Example:** If the application uses `FileUtils.readFileToString(userInput)`, and the `userInput` is "../../../etc/passwd", the attacker can read the contents of the system's password file.
**Impact:** Disclosure of the entire content of arbitrary files on the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Application uses FileUtils.lineIterator with user-controlled filename](./attack_tree_paths/4__application_uses_fileutils_lineiterator_with_user-controlled_filename.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Similar to `readFileToString`, the application uses `FileUtils.lineIterator()` to read a file line by line, with the filename being influenced by user input. This is vulnerable to path traversal if the input is not sanitized.
**Example:** If the application uses `FileUtils.lineIterator(new File(userInput))`, and the `userInput` is "../../../var/log/application.log", the attacker can read the application's log files.
**Impact:** Disclosure of the content of arbitrary files, line by line, which can still reveal sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Write Malicious Files [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5__write_malicious_files__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker's goal is to write or copy malicious files to locations where they can be executed or cause harm. This could involve overwriting existing files, creating new backdoors, or placing malicious scripts within the web server's document root.
**Impact:**  Successful writing of malicious files can lead to complete application takeover, remote code execution, and further compromise of the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Path Traversal during File Writing/Copying [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_path_traversal_during_file_writingcopying__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to the reading vulnerability, this involves manipulating destination file paths during write or copy operations to place files in unintended locations.
**Impact:** Allows attackers to write arbitrary files to any location the application process has write permissions to.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Application uses FileUtils.writeStringToFile with user-controlled filename](./attack_tree_paths/7__application_uses_fileutils_writestringtofile_with_user-controlled_filename.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses `FileUtils.writeStringToFile()` to write data to a file whose name is influenced by user input. Without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject path traversal sequences to write to arbitrary locations.
**Example:** If the application uses `FileUtils.writeStringToFile(userInput, maliciousContent)`, and the `userInput` is "../../../var/www/html/backdoor.php", the attacker can create a PHP backdoor in the web server's directory.
**Impact:**  Ability to create or overwrite arbitrary files with attacker-controlled content.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Application uses FileUtils.copyFile with user-controlled destination path](./attack_tree_paths/8__application_uses_fileutils_copyfile_with_user-controlled_destination_path.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses `FileUtils.copyFile()` to copy a file to a destination path influenced by user input. If this destination path is not validated, an attacker can use path traversal to copy files to unintended locations.
**Example:** If the application uses `FileUtils.copyFile(uploadedFile, new File(userInput))`, and the `userInput` is "../../../etc/cron.d/malicious_job", the attacker can copy a malicious script to the cron directory for scheduled execution.
**Impact:** Ability to copy arbitrary files to unintended locations, potentially overwriting existing files or placing malicious files in sensitive areas.
