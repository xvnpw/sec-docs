# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Apache Commons IO, aims to provide a comprehensive collection of utility classes to assist with general Input/Output operations in Java. It is designed to simplify common IO tasks and handle edge cases, making Java development more efficient and robust when dealing with file systems, streams, and other IO resources.

Business priorities and goals:
- Provide stable and reliable IO utility library for Java developers.
- Offer a wide range of functionalities to cover common IO operations.
- Ensure high performance and efficiency in IO operations.
- Maintain backward compatibility to minimize disruption for existing users.
- Foster a strong community around the library for continuous improvement and support.
- Distribute the library through standard channels like Maven Central for easy accessibility.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors in applications using Commons IO, leading to data breaches or system compromise.
- Performance bottlenecks introduced by the library could negatively impact applications relying on it.
- Backward incompatible changes could break existing applications and require significant rework for users.
- Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to stagnation and unaddressed security issues.
- Supply chain attacks targeting the build and distribution process could compromise the integrity of the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open source project with public code repository on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Reliance on the Apache Software Foundation infrastructure, which has its own security policies and procedures. Implemented in: Apache infrastructure.
- security control: Use of standard build tools like Maven, which includes dependency management and verification features. Implemented in: Maven build system.
- security control: Version control system (Git) to track changes and potentially revert to previous versions if issues are found. Implemented in: Git repository.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source library, vulnerabilities might be discovered and publicly disclosed before a patch is available.
- accepted risk: Developers using the library might misuse its functionalities, leading to security vulnerabilities in their applications.
- accepted risk: Dependencies of the library might introduce security vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Integrate dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Commons IO.
- security control: Conduct regular vulnerability scanning of the released artifacts and infrastructure.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Implement code signing for released artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity.
- security control: Follow secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle, including input validation, output encoding, and secure error handling.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using the library.
- Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using the library.
- Input validation: The library should perform robust input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities when handling user-provided or external data, especially file paths and names.
- Cryptography: If the library implements any cryptographic operations, it should use well-established and secure cryptographic algorithms and libraries. (Assumption: Commons IO itself is unlikely to implement cryptography directly, but it might handle streams that could contain sensitive data).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process:
- Providing reusable and reliable IO utilities for Java developers globally. The library's stability and security are crucial for the smooth operation of countless Java applications that depend on it.

Data to protect and sensitivity:
- The Apache Commons IO library itself does not directly handle or store sensitive user data. However, it operates on data streams and files within applications that use it. The sensitivity of the data being processed depends entirely on the applications using the library. If an application uses Commons IO to handle files containing personal or confidential information, then that data is indirectly within the scope of the library's operation. The library should be designed and maintained to avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data processed by applications using it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the specific context in which this design document will be used for threat modeling? Is it for a specific application that uses Commons IO, or for the library itself?
- What are the primary concerns regarding security for the user requesting this document? Are they focused on specific types of threats or vulnerabilities?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization using this document? Is it a startup with a higher risk tolerance or a large enterprise with strict security requirements?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a stable, reliable, and widely used IO utility library for the Java ecosystem. Security is a significant concern but is balanced with usability and functionality.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows standard open-source security practices. There is an understanding of the need for ongoing security vigilance and proactive measures.
- DESIGN: The library is designed as a set of utility classes intended to be integrated into other Java applications. It does not operate as a standalone service or application. The deployment model is primarily as a dependency within Java applications. The build process is assumed to be automated and include basic security checks.
