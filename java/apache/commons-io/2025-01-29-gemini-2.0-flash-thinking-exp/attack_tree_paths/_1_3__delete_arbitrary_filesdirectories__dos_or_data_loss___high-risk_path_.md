### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Unsanitized User Input in Commons IO Delete Operations

The core attack vector for this path is the **exploitation of unsanitized user input**.  Applications often use user input to determine file paths for various operations. If this input is directly passed to Commons IO file deletion methods without proper validation and sanitization, attackers can manipulate the input to target files and directories outside the intended scope.

This vulnerability arises because methods like `FileUtils.delete`, `FileUtils.deleteDirectory`, and `FileUtils.cleanDirectory` in Commons IO operate directly on the provided file paths. They do not inherently prevent path traversal attacks or validate if the target path is within an expected or safe location.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a web application that allows users to upload files and later delete them. The application might use user-provided filenames or IDs to construct the path for deletion using `FileUtils.delete`. If the application doesn't properly sanitize the user input, an attacker could provide input like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` (or similar path traversal sequences) to attempt to delete sensitive system files instead of their intended uploaded file.

#### 4.2. Critical Node: [1.3.1] Leverage FileUtils.delete/deleteDirectory with Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL NODE]

**4.2.1. Attack Description:**

This critical node focuses on the misuse of `FileUtils.delete(File file)` and `FileUtils.deleteDirectory(File directory)` methods. These methods are designed to delete a single file or an entire directory (including its contents), respectively.  The vulnerability occurs when the `File` object passed to these methods is constructed using unsanitized user input.

**4.2.2. Technical Details:**

*   **FileUtils.delete(File file):**  Deletes the specified file. If the file is a directory, it will throw an `IOException`.
*   **FileUtils.deleteDirectory(File directory):** Deletes the specified directory and all its contents recursively. If the directory does not exist, it will not throw an exception (returns silently).

**Vulnerability:**  If the `File` object passed to these methods is constructed directly from user-provided input without sanitization, an attacker can control the target file or directory to be deleted. Path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) within the user input are the primary mechanism for exploiting this.

**4.2.3. Attack Example:**

Consider the following simplified Java code snippet:

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class DeleteFileExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String userInputPath = args[0]; // User-provided path from command line arguments (e.g., web request parameter)

        File fileToDelete = new File(userInputPath);

        try {
            FileUtils.delete(fileToDelete);
            System.out.println("Successfully deleted: " + fileToDelete.getAbsolutePath());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error deleting file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

If an attacker runs this application with the argument `../../../../tmp/important_file.txt`, and the application has sufficient permissions, it will attempt to delete the file `important_file.txt` located in the `/tmp` directory (assuming a Linux-like system).

**4.2.4. Potential Impact:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Deleting critical application files, configuration files, or database files can render the application unusable.
*   **Data Loss:** Deleting user data, backups, or important operational files can lead to significant data loss and business disruption.
*   **System Instability:** In extreme cases, if the application runs with elevated privileges, deleting system directories could lead to system instability or even operating system failure.

**4.2.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a set of allowed characters and patterns for file paths. Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Blacklisting (Less Recommended):**  Blacklist known path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`). However, blacklisting can be bypassed with encoding or variations.
    *   **Canonicalization:** Use `File.getCanonicalPath()` to resolve symbolic links and relative paths to absolute paths. Compare the canonical path against an allowed base directory to ensure the target is within the permitted scope.
*   **Path Validation:**
    *   **Base Directory Restriction:**  Ensure that the target file or directory is within a predefined, safe base directory.  Before performing the delete operation, programmatically check if the canonical path of the target file/directory starts with the allowed base directory.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid running applications with root or administrator privileges unless absolutely required. This limits the potential damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control who can perform delete operations and on which files/directories.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement proper error handling to catch exceptions during file deletion and log relevant information (including user input and attempted paths) for auditing and incident response.

#### 4.3. Critical Node: [1.3.2] Leverage FileUtils.cleanDirectory with Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL NODE]

**4.3.1. Attack Description:**

This critical node focuses on the misuse of `FileUtils.cleanDirectory(File directory)`. This method is designed to delete all files and subdirectories within a specified directory, but *not* the directory itself. The vulnerability arises when the `File` object passed to `cleanDirectory` is constructed using unsanitized user input, leading to the cleaning of an unintended directory.

**4.3.2. Technical Details:**

*   **FileUtils.cleanDirectory(File directory):** Deletes all files and subdirectories within the specified directory. The directory itself is not deleted. If the directory does not exist, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. If the directory is not a directory, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.

**Vulnerability:** Similar to `deleteDirectory`, if the `File` object passed to `cleanDirectory` is based on unsanitized user input, an attacker can manipulate the input to target a different directory than intended for cleaning. Path traversal is again the primary exploitation technique.

**4.3.3. Attack Example:**

Consider a scenario where an application allows users to "clean" their temporary upload directory. The application might intend to clean a directory like `/app/tmp/user_uploads/<user_id>`. However, if the user ID or a part of the path is derived from unsanitized user input, an attacker could manipulate it.

```java
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CleanDirectoryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String userInputDirectory = args[0]; // User-provided directory path

        File directoryToClean = new File(userInputDirectory);

        try {
            FileUtils.cleanDirectory(directoryToClean);
            System.out.println("Successfully cleaned directory: " + directoryToClean.getAbsolutePath());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error cleaning directory: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

If an attacker provides the input `../../../../var/log`, and the application has permissions to write to `/var/log`, it will attempt to clean the `/var/log` directory, potentially deleting important log files.

**4.3.4. Potential Impact:**

*   **Data Loss:** Deleting important application data stored within the cleaned directory. This could include temporary files, cached data, or even user-specific data if the wrong directory is targeted.
*   **Application Malfunction:** Cleaning a directory that the application relies on for temporary storage or runtime data can lead to application errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior.
*   **Operational Disruption:** Deleting log files or other operational data can hinder monitoring, debugging, and incident response efforts.

**4.3.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

The mitigation strategies for `cleanDirectory` are largely the same as for `delete` and `deleteDirectory`, focusing on:

*   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Employ whitelisting, blacklisting (with caution), and canonicalization to sanitize user-provided path components.
*   **Path Validation:**  Strictly validate that the target directory for cleaning is within an expected and safe base directory.  Use canonical paths and prefix checks to enforce this restriction.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Limit the permissions of the application process to minimize the impact of unintended directory cleaning.
*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** Control access to directory cleaning operations based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging to detect and track potential misuse of `cleanDirectory`.
