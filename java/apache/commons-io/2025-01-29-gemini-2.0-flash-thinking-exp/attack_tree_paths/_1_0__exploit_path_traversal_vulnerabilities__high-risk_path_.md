### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities

#### [1.0] Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Description:** This high-risk attack path targets applications that utilize Apache Commons IO and improperly handle user-controlled input when constructing file paths for file system operations. Attackers aim to bypass intended directory restrictions and access, read, or manipulate files and directories outside of their authorized scope. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability, also known as directory traversal or the "dot-dot-slash" vulnerability.

**Attack Vector:**  The primary attack vector is the manipulation of user-provided input that is subsequently used to construct file paths within the application's code, particularly when interacting with Apache Commons IO methods. Attackers inject malicious path components, such as `../` (dot-dot-slash), URL encoded variations (`%2e%2e%2f`), or other encoding tricks, to navigate outside the intended base directory and access sensitive files or directories.

---

#### [1.1.1] Leverage FileUtils.readFileToString with Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This critical node focuses on exploiting the `FileUtils.readFileToString()` method when it's used with user-provided input that is not properly sanitized or validated.  Attackers can supply a malicious file path as input, causing the application to read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially including sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Example (Java):**

    ```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class FileServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String filePath = request.getParameter("file"); // User-controlled input
            File file = new File(filePath);
            String content = FileUtils.readFileToString(file, "UTF-8"); // Vulnerable usage
            response.getWriter().write(content);
        }
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `filePath` is directly taken from the request parameter "file" without any validation. An attacker can send a request like: `http://example.com/fileServlet?file=../../../../etc/passwd`.  `FileUtils.readFileToString()` will then attempt to read the file located at `../../../../etc/passwd` relative to the application's working directory, which, in most server environments, will resolve to the system's `/etc/passwd` file.

*   **How it Works:** `FileUtils.readFileToString()` takes a `File` object as input. The `File` object is constructed directly from the user-provided string.  If the string contains path traversal sequences like `../`, the `File` object will resolve to a path outside the intended directory.  `FileUtils.readFileToString()` then reads the content of the file at this resolved path.

**Impact:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exposure of sensitive data contained in files accessible through path traversal, such as:
    *   System configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, database credentials)
    *   Application configuration files
    *   Source code
    *   User data
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers can gain valuable information about the server's file system structure, installed software, and application configuration, which can be used to plan further attacks.

**Mitigation:**

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Strongly Recommended):**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Characters:**  Restrict input to a predefined set of safe characters (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores) and reject any input containing path separators (`/`, `\`), dot-dot-slash (`../`), or other potentially malicious characters.
    *   **Validate Against Allowed Paths:** If the application is intended to access files within a specific directory, validate that the user-provided input, after normalization, resolves to a path *within* that allowed directory.

2.  **Use Secure Path Handling Methods:**
    *   **Resolve Against a Base Directory:**  Always resolve user-provided input relative to a predefined, secure base directory.  Use `File`'s `getCanonicalPath()` or `getAbsolutePath()` after constructing the `File` object with the user input and the base directory to ensure the path stays within the intended scope.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions. This limits the damage an attacker can cause even if a path traversal vulnerability is exploited.

**Secure Code Example (Java - Mitigation):**

```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class SecureFileServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = "/var/application/files/"; // Secure base directory

        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String requestedFile = request.getParameter("file"); // User-controlled input

            // 1. Input Validation (Whitelist - Example)
            if (!isValidFilename(requestedFile)) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST, "Invalid filename");
                return;
            }

            File baseDir = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY);
            File requestedFileObj = new File(baseDir, requestedFile); // Combine base dir and user input

            // 2. Path Normalization and Validation against base directory
            String canonicalPath = requestedFileObj.getCanonicalPath();
            if (!canonicalPath.startsWith(baseDir.getCanonicalPath())) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN, "Access Denied - Path outside allowed directory");
                return;
            }

            if (!requestedFileObj.exists() || !requestedFileObj.isFile()) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND, "File not found");
                return;
            }

            String content = FileUtils.readFileToString(requestedFileObj, "UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().write(content);
        }

        private boolean isValidFilename(String filename) {
            // Example: Allow alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen, dot.  Reject path separators.
            return filename != null && filename.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]+$");
        }
    }
```

**Real-World Relevance:** Path traversal vulnerabilities in `readFileToString` and similar file reading functions are very common and have been exploited in numerous real-world applications and frameworks.  They are a frequent target for security audits and penetration testing.

#### [1.1.2] Leverage FileUtils.copyFile/copyDirectory with Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This node focuses on exploiting `FileUtils.copyFile()` and `FileUtils.copyDirectory()` methods when used with unsanitized user-controlled source paths. Attackers can manipulate the source path to read and potentially copy sensitive files or directories to a location they can access, effectively exfiltrating data or creating backups of sensitive information in accessible locations.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Example (Java):**

    ```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class CopyServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        private static final String TARGET_DIRECTORY = "/tmp/uploaded_files/"; // Insecure target directory for example

        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String sourcePath = request.getParameter("source"); // User-controlled source path
            String targetFilename = request.getParameter("targetName"); // User-controlled target filename

            File sourceFile = new File(sourcePath); // Vulnerable source path
            File targetDir = new File(TARGET_DIRECTORY);
            File targetFile = new File(targetDir, targetFilename);

            FileUtils.copyFile(sourceFile, targetFile); // Vulnerable copy operation

            response.getWriter().write("File copied to: " + targetFile.getAbsolutePath());
        }
    }
    ```

    An attacker could send a request like: `http://example.com/copyServlet?source=../../../../etc/shadow&targetName=shadow_backup`. This would attempt to copy the `/etc/shadow` file (if the application has permissions) to `/tmp/uploaded_files/shadow_backup`.  If `/tmp/uploaded_files/` is accessible to the attacker (e.g., through a web interface or other means), they can then retrieve the copied sensitive file.

*   **How it Works:** Similar to `readFileToString`, `copyFile` and `copyDirectory` operate on `File` objects constructed from user-provided paths.  Unsanitized source paths allow attackers to specify arbitrary files or directories as the source for the copy operation.

**Impact:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive files can be copied to attacker-accessible locations.
*   **Data Backup in Insecure Location:**  Sensitive data can be inadvertently backed up in a publicly accessible directory, leading to exposure.
*   **Potential Denial of Service (DoS):** Copying large files or directories repeatedly could consume server resources and lead to DoS. (Less likely primary impact for path traversal, but possible).

**Mitigation:**

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial for Source Path):**  Apply the same input validation and sanitization techniques as described for `readFileToString` to the *source path* parameter.  Whitelist allowed characters, validate against allowed paths, and reject malicious input.

2.  **Secure Target Directory Configuration:**
    *   Ensure the target directory for copied files is properly secured and *not* publicly accessible.  Ideally, the target directory should be outside the web root and accessible only to the application and authorized users.
    *   Implement access controls on the target directory to restrict who can read or write files within it.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Permissions):**  Limit the file system permissions of the application process.  If the application doesn't need to read sensitive system files, ensure it doesn't have permissions to do so.

4.  **Path Normalization and Validation (Source Path):**  Similar to `readFileToString`, normalize and validate the source path against a secure base directory to ensure it remains within the intended scope.

**Secure Code Example (Java - Mitigation):**

```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class SecureCopyServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        private static final String ALLOWED_SOURCE_DIRECTORY = "/var/application/allowed_sources/"; // Secure source directory
        private static final String TARGET_DIRECTORY = "/var/application/secure_uploads/"; // Secure target directory

        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String sourceFileParam = request.getParameter("source"); // User-controlled source filename
            String targetFilename = request.getParameter("targetName");

            if (!isValidFilename(sourceFileParam) || !isValidFilename(targetFilename)) { // Validate filenames
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST, "Invalid filename");
                return;
            }

            File allowedSourceDir = new File(ALLOWED_SOURCE_DIRECTORY);
            File sourceFile = new File(allowedSourceDir, sourceFileParam); // Combine allowed source dir and user input

            File targetDir = new File(TARGET_DIRECTORY);
            File targetFile = new File(targetDir, targetFilename);

            // Path Normalization and Validation for Source Path
            String canonicalSourcePath = sourceFile.getCanonicalPath();
            if (!canonicalSourcePath.startsWith(allowedSourceDir.getCanonicalPath())) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN, "Access Denied - Source path outside allowed directory");
                return;
            }

            if (!sourceFile.exists() || !sourceFile.isFile()) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST, "Source file not found or invalid");
                return;
            }

            // Ensure target directory exists and is writable (best practice - should be checked on application startup)
            if (!targetDir.exists() || !targetDir.isDirectory() || !targetDir.canWrite()) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "Target directory misconfigured");
                return;
            }

            FileUtils.copyFile(sourceFile, targetFile);
            response.getWriter().write("File copied to: " + targetFile.getAbsolutePath());
        }

        private boolean isValidFilename(String filename) {
            return filename != null && filename.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]+$");
        }
    }
```

**Real-World Relevance:** Similar to `readFileToString`, vulnerabilities in `copyFile` and `copyDirectory` are also frequently found and exploited.  They can lead to significant data breaches and are a common finding in security assessments.

#### [1.1.3] Leverage FilenameUtils.normalize/getFullPath with Improper Handling [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This node highlights a more subtle vulnerability.  Developers might mistakenly believe that using `FilenameUtils.normalize()` or `FilenameUtils.getFullPath()` alone is sufficient to prevent path traversal attacks. However, these methods, while helpful, are *not* foolproof and can be bypassed if not used in conjunction with proper validation and secure path handling.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Example (Java - Misusing `normalize`):**

    ```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class NormalizeServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = "/var/application/files/";

        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String filePath = request.getParameter("file"); // User-controlled input
            String normalizedPath = FilenameUtils.normalize(filePath); // Attempt to normalize

            File baseDir = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY);
            File file = new File(baseDir, normalizedPath); // Still vulnerable if normalization is bypassed

            // Misconception: Assuming normalize is enough
            String content = FileUtils.readFileToString(file, "UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().write(content);
        }
    }
    ```

    While `FilenameUtils.normalize()` will resolve `../` sequences to some extent, it might not handle all encoding tricks or edge cases perfectly.  For example, certain operating systems or file systems might have different path normalization rules.  Furthermore, `normalize` primarily focuses on *syntactic* normalization, not *semantic* validation against a base directory.

*   **Bypass Examples:**
    *   **Encoding Tricks:**  Attackers might use URL encoding (`%2e%2e%2f`), double encoding, or other encoding techniques that `normalize` might not fully decode and sanitize.
    *   **Long Paths/Path Length Limits:** In some systems, very long paths or paths exceeding certain limits might bypass normalization or validation checks.
    *   **Symbolic Links (Symlinks):**  `normalize` might resolve symbolic links, potentially leading to traversal if the symlink points outside the intended directory.  However, this is more related to file system behavior than `normalize` itself.

*   **`getFullPath` Misuse:** `FilenameUtils.getFullPath()` extracts the directory part of a path.  It's not intended for security sanitization and should not be relied upon for preventing path traversal.  Misusing it for validation is highly likely to be ineffective.

**Impact:**

*   If developers rely solely on `FilenameUtils.normalize` or `getFullPath` for security, they can create applications that are still vulnerable to path traversal attacks, leading to the same impacts as described in [1.1.1] and [1.1.2] (confidentiality breach, data exfiltration, etc.).

**Mitigation:**

1.  **Do Not Rely Solely on `normalize` or `getFullPath` for Security:**  These methods are utilities for path manipulation, *not* security sanitization tools.  They can be *part* of a secure path handling strategy, but they are not sufficient on their own.

2.  **Combine `normalize` with Strict Validation Against a Base Directory:**
    *   Use `FilenameUtils.normalize()` to clean up path syntax (e.g., resolve `../`, `.` etc.).
    *   *Crucially*, after normalization, *always* validate that the resulting path, when resolved against a secure base directory, remains within the allowed scope.  Use `File.getCanonicalPath()` and `String.startsWith()` as demonstrated in the secure code examples for [1.1.1] and [1.1.2].

3.  **Robust Input Validation:**  Implement strong input validation as described in [1.1.1] and [1.1.2] to reject potentially malicious input *before* any path manipulation, including normalization.

**Secure Code Example (Java - Correctly using `normalize` with validation):**

```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class SecureNormalizeServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = "/var/application/files/";

        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String filePath = request.getParameter("file"); // User-controlled input

            // 1. Input Validation (Whitelist - Example) - Still important!
            if (!isValidFilename(filePath)) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST, "Invalid filename");
                return;
            }

            String normalizedPath = FilenameUtils.normalize(filePath); // Normalize path syntax

            File baseDir = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY);
            File file = new File(baseDir, normalizedPath);

            // 2. Path Normalization and Validation against base directory (Crucial!)
            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();
            if (!canonicalPath.startsWith(baseDir.getCanonicalPath())) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN, "Access Denied - Path outside allowed directory");
                return;
            }

            if (!file.exists() || !file.isFile()) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND, "File not found");
                return;
            }

            String content = FileUtils.readFileToString(file, "UTF-8");
            response.getWriter().write(content);
        }

        private boolean isValidFilename(String filename) {
            return filename != null && filename.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]+$");
        }
    }
```

**Real-World Relevance:**  Misunderstandings about the security capabilities of `normalize` and similar path manipulation functions are common.  Developers often overestimate their effectiveness and fail to implement proper validation, leading to exploitable path traversal vulnerabilities.

---

#### [1.1.4] Leverage File System Operations with User-Controlled Paths [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This node is a generalization of the previous nodes. It highlights that *any* file system operation in Apache Commons IO (or standard Java IO) that uses user-controlled paths can be a potential path traversal vulnerability if input is not properly handled. This includes methods like `FileUtils.listFiles()`, `FileUtils.directoryContains()`, `FileUtils.delete()`, `FileUtils.moveFile()`, and many others.  Even seemingly less critical operations like listing directory contents can aid attackers in reconnaissance.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Example (Java - `listFiles`):**

    ```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Collection;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class ListFilesServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String dirPath = request.getParameter("dir"); // User-controlled directory path
            File directory = new File(dirPath); // Vulnerable directory path

            Collection<File> files = FileUtils.listFiles(directory, null, false); // List files in directory

            StringBuilder fileList = new StringBuilder("Files in directory:\n");
            for (File file : files) {
                fileList.append(file.getName()).append("\n");
            }
            response.getWriter().write(fileList.toString());
        }
    }
    ```

    An attacker could send a request like: `http://example.com/listFilesServlet?dir=../../../../etc/`. This would attempt to list the files in the `/etc/` directory. While this might not directly expose file *contents*, it reveals the directory structure and file names, which can be valuable information for planning further attacks (e.g., targeting specific configuration files identified in the listing).

*   **How it Works:**  Methods like `listFiles`, `directoryContains`, etc., take `File` objects as input, which, as before, can be manipulated by path traversal sequences in user-provided input.

**Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure (Directory Structure):**  Revealing directory structure and file names can aid attackers in reconnaissance and targeted attacks.
*   **File Existence Checks:**  Attackers can use methods like `FileUtils.directoryContains()` or `File.exists()` (indirectly through other `FileUtils` methods) to probe for the existence of specific files or directories, confirming potential targets.
*   **File Deletion/Manipulation (Less Common Path Traversal Impact, but possible with other methods):** In scenarios using methods like `FileUtils.delete()` or `FileUtils.moveFile()` with unsanitized paths, attackers could potentially delete or move files outside the intended scope, leading to data loss or application malfunction. (This is less typical for path traversal, but worth noting for completeness).

**Mitigation:**

1.  **Apply Consistent Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The same robust input validation, sanitization, and path normalization/validation techniques described for [1.1.1], [1.1.2], and [1.1.3] must be applied to *all* user-controlled paths used in *any* file system operation within the application, regardless of the specific Apache Commons IO method being used.

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Permissions):**  Minimize the file system permissions granted to the application process.  This limits the scope of what an attacker can access or manipulate, even if path traversal vulnerabilities exist.

3.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and remediate path traversal vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in the application.

**Secure Code Example (Java - `listFiles` with mitigation):**

```java
    import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Collection;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

    public class SecureListFilesServlet extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet {
        private static final String ALLOWED_DIRECTORY = "/var/application/allowed_directories/"; // Secure allowed directory

        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws javax.servlet.ServletException, IOException {
            String dirParam = request.getParameter("dir"); // User-controlled directory name

            if (!isValidFilename(dirParam)) { // Validate directory name
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST, "Invalid directory name");
                return;
            }

            File allowedBaseDir = new File(ALLOWED_DIRECTORY);
            File directory = new File(allowedBaseDir, dirParam); // Combine allowed base dir and user input

            // Path Normalization and Validation for Directory Path
            String canonicalDirPath = directory.getCanonicalPath();
            if (!canonicalDirPath.startsWith(allowedBaseDir.getCanonicalPath())) {
                response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN, "Access Denied - Directory path outside allowed directory");
                return;

**Real-World Relevance:**  Path traversal vulnerabilities are not limited to file reading or copying.  Improper handling of user-controlled paths in *any* file system operation can lead to security risks.  Developers must be vigilant about sanitizing and validating user input for all file-related operations.
