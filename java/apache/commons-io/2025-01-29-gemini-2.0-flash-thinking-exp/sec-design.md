# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is the Apache Commons IO library, a widely used open-source Java library.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, efficient, and reliable set of Java utility classes to assist with common input/output tasks.
  - Simplify and standardize IO operations for Java developers, reducing boilerplate code and potential errors.
  - Maintain backward compatibility and stability to ensure existing applications relying on the library continue to function correctly.
  - Foster a community-driven development model, encouraging contributions and improvements from the wider Java ecosystem.
  - Ensure the library is freely available and usable under the Apache License, promoting broad adoption.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Introduction of bugs or vulnerabilities in new releases that could negatively impact applications using the library.
  - Lack of maintenance or timely security updates, leading to security risks for users.
  - Performance regressions in new versions that could degrade the performance of applications using the library.
  - Incompatibility issues with newer Java versions or other libraries, causing integration problems for users.
  - Dependency on vulnerable third-party libraries, creating supply chain security risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, providing transparency and version control. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Development process managed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), which has established open-source development practices. (Implemented: ASF Governance)
  - security control: Public issue tracker (JIRA) for reporting bugs and security vulnerabilities. (Implemented: ASF JIRA)
  - security control: Use of Apache Maven for build management and dependency management. (Implemented: pom.xml)
  - security control: Code reviews are likely part of the ASF development process, although not explicitly documented in the repository. (Assumed: ASF Best Practices)
  - security control: Releases are signed using GPG keys by ASF release managers. (Implemented: ASF Release Process)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be discovered in the library code, given the complexity of IO operations and the wide range of use cases.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce unforeseen security issues if not properly vetted.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on third-party libraries, which may have their own vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Users may misuse the library in insecure ways in their applications.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) as part of the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Integrate dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Commons IO.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits or penetration testing of the library to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
  - security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for users on how to use Commons IO securely in their applications, especially regarding file path handling and input validation.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for handling security vulnerability reports, including response times and communication channels.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications using the library.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a library. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using the library.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library should handle invalid or malicious input gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: File path inputs should be carefully validated to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Input streams and readers should be handled to prevent denial-of-service attacks or resource exhaustion.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If the library provides any cryptographic functionality (which is not apparent in a basic IO library, but needs to be confirmed), it should use well-established and secure cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    - Requirement: Sensitive data (if any is handled by the library, which is unlikely) should be protected appropriately, avoiding storage in plaintext or insecure transmission.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing reliable and secure IO utility functions to Java developers.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Commons IO library.
  - Ensuring the library does not introduce vulnerabilities into applications that use it.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the Commons IO library: High sensitivity. Confidentiality and integrity are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure.
  - Build artifacts (JAR files): High sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to ensure users download and use untampered and safe libraries.
  - Security vulnerability information: High sensitivity. Confidentiality is important until a fix is released to prevent exploitation. Public disclosure should be coordinated.
  - Developer credentials and signing keys: Critical sensitivity. Confidentiality is paramount to prevent unauthorized access and releases.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

  - The build process is automated and uses a CI/CD pipeline.
  - Released artifacts are signed to ensure integrity and authenticity.
  - Developers using Commons IO are responsible for implementing security controls in their own applications.
