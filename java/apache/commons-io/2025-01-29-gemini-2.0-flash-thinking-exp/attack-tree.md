## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1] Resource Exhaustion via Large File Operations [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1__resource_exhaustion_via_large_file_operations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers trigger operations involving excessively large files or directories using Commons IO functions, leading to resource exhaustion (memory, CPU, disk I/O) and Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Critical Nodes within this path:**
    *   **[2.1.1] Read Extremely Large Files using FileUtils.readFileToString/readByteArrayToFile [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Requesting to read extremely large files using `FileUtils.readFileToString` or `FileUtils.readByteArrayToFile`, causing memory exhaustion and application crash.
        *   **Example:**  Requesting to download or process a multi-gigabyte log file, overwhelming the application's memory.
    *   **[2.1.2] Copy Extremely Large Files/Directories using FileUtils.copyFile/copyDirectory [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Requesting to copy extremely large files or directories using `FileUtils.copyFile` or `FileUtils.copyDirectory`, causing disk I/O saturation and application slowdown or crash.
        *   **Example:**  Initiating a copy operation of a massive backup directory, consuming excessive disk resources.
    *   **[2.1.3] Recursive Directory Operations on Deeply Nested Structures [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Triggering recursive operations like `copyDirectory` or `deleteDirectory` on deeply nested directory structures or symbolic link loops, leading to stack overflow, excessive processing time, or application hangs.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.3] Zip Slip Vulnerability (Indirectly related via Archive Libraries using Commons IO) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/_2_3__zip_slip_vulnerability__indirectly_related_via_archive_libraries_using_commons_io___high-risk__605b0ffa.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting Zip Slip vulnerability in archive libraries (like Apache Commons Compress) that might use Commons IO internally. This allows writing files outside the intended extraction directory when handling user-uploaded archives.
*   **Critical Node within this path:**
    *   **[2.3.1] Application uses Archive Libraries (e.g., Apache Commons Compress) that internally use Commons IO and are vulnerable to Zip Slip when handling user-uploaded archives. [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Uploading a malicious ZIP archive containing entries with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../evil.jsp`) that, when extracted by a vulnerable library, write files outside the intended extraction directory.
        *   **Example:**  Uploading a ZIP file designed to write a web shell to a web-accessible directory during extraction.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.1] Exposing File Paths in Error Messages [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_3_1__exposing_file_paths_in_error_messages__critical_node_.md)

*   **Critical Node within this path:**
    *   **[3.1.1] Verbose Error Handling with FileUtils Methods [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Application's error handling for `FileUtils` operations (e.g., `FileNotFoundException`, `IOException`) directly exposes file paths in user-facing error messages.
        *   **Example:**  An error message displaying "FileNotFoundException: /sensitive/path/config.xml (No such file or directory)" revealing the existence and path of a sensitive configuration file.

## Attack Tree Path: [[4.1] Incorrect File Name Handling with FilenameUtils [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_4_1__incorrect_file_name_handling_with_filenameutils__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misunderstanding or incorrect usage of `FilenameUtils` functions leads to vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior, often related to path traversal bypasses or incorrect file processing logic.
*   **Critical Node within this path:**
    *   **[4.1.1] Misunderstanding FilenameUtils.normalize/getFullPath behavior [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack:** Developers incorrectly assume `FilenameUtils.normalize` or `FilenameUtils.getFullPath` fully sanitize paths and prevent traversal, leading to bypasses when these functions are not used as part of a comprehensive validation strategy.
        *   **Example:** Relying solely on `FilenameUtils.normalize` and failing to implement further checks, allowing attackers to craft paths that bypass the normalization and still achieve traversal.
