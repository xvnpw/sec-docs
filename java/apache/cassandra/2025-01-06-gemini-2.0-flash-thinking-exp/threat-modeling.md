# Threat Model Analysis for apache/cassandra

## Threat: [Weak or Default Cassandra Authentication](./threats/weak_or_default_cassandra_authentication.md)

**Description:**  The default Cassandra authentication is disabled or uses weak default credentials. An attacker who gains network access to the Cassandra ports can connect and perform unauthorized actions without proper authentication.

**Impact:**  Full access to the Cassandra database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete any data, create new users, and potentially disrupt the entire cluster.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Service

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable Cassandra authentication and authorization.
*   Change all default usernames and passwords to strong, unique credentials.
*   Enforce strong password policies.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass or Privilege Escalation](./threats/authorization_bypass_or_privilege_escalation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in Cassandra's role-based access control (RBAC) implementation or configuration to gain access to data or perform actions they are not authorized for. This could involve exploiting misconfigured permissions or vulnerabilities in the authorization logic.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to perform administrative actions, potential data manipulation or deletion, and the possibility of escalating privileges to gain full control over the cluster.

**Affected Component:** Authorization Service, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully configure and review Cassandra roles and permissions.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
*   Regularly audit user permissions and access patterns.
*   Stay updated with Cassandra security advisories and apply necessary patches.

## Threat: [Gossip Protocol Spoofing/Tampering](./threats/gossip_protocol_spoofingtampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker on the network intercepts or injects malicious gossip messages exchanged between Cassandra nodes. This could be used to falsify node status, manipulate cluster topology information, or disrupt cluster operations.

**Impact:** Cluster instability, incorrect routing of requests, data inconsistencies, potential denial of service, and the possibility of isolating nodes or introducing rogue nodes into the cluster.

**Affected Component:** Gossip Protocol

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable inter-node authentication and encryption using TLS/SSL for gossip communication.
*   Implement strong network segmentation to limit the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access to the Cassandra network.
*   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [CQL Injection](./threats/cql_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's code by injecting malicious CQL (Cassandra Query Language) commands through user input or other data sources. This can allow them to read, modify, or delete data they are not authorized to access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, data deletion, and potentially the ability to execute arbitrary CQL commands leading to further system compromise.

**Affected Component:** CQL Parser, Application's data access layer

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data.
*   Adopt an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) or similar abstraction layer that handles query construction securely.
*   Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular security code reviews.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in User-Defined Functions (UDFs)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_user-defined_functions__udfs_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes User-Defined Functions (UDFs), vulnerabilities within these custom functions could be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Cassandra nodes.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on Cassandra servers, leading to complete compromise of the node and potential cluster-wide impact.

**Affected Component:** User-Defined Function (UDF) execution environment

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review and test all custom UDFs for security vulnerabilities.
*   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within UDFs.
*   Restrict the permissions of the Cassandra user executing UDFs.
*   Consider code signing for UDFs to ensure their integrity.
