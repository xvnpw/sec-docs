## Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious CQL Queries via Application Input (HIGH-RISK PATH)

This analysis delves into the attack path "1.3.1 Inject Malicious CQL Queries via Application Input," focusing on its mechanics, potential impact, and mitigation strategies within the context of an application using Apache Cassandra.

**Attack Path:** 1.3.1 Inject Malicious CQL Queries via Application Input (HIGH-RISK PATH)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the application's input handling to inject malicious CQL (Cassandra Query Language) code. This occurs when user-supplied data is directly incorporated into CQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Attack Vector:**  The primary attack vector is through application input fields, such as:

* **Web forms:**  Input fields in web applications interacting with the Cassandra database.
* **API endpoints:**  Data passed through API requests (e.g., REST, GraphQL) that are used to construct CQL queries.
* **Command-line interfaces (CLIs):**  Arguments or options passed to CLI tools that interact with Cassandra.
* **Indirect inputs:** Data sourced from external systems or files that the application processes and uses to build CQL queries.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood: Medium:** The likelihood is considered medium if the application has weak input validation practices. Many developers might not be fully aware of the nuances of CQL injection or might rely on inadequate sanitization techniques. Legacy code or rapidly developed features are often more susceptible.
* **Impact: Medium-High:** The impact is significant because successful injection can lead to:
    * **Data Breach (Retrieval):** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the Cassandra database by injecting `SELECT` queries.
    * **Data Manipulation (Modification):**  Attackers can modify existing data using `UPDATE` or `INSERT` queries, potentially corrupting the database integrity.
    * **Data Destruction (Deletion):** Attackers can delete data using `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` queries, leading to significant data loss and operational disruption.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not as direct as some DoS attacks, malicious queries can consume excessive resources, impacting application performance and potentially leading to instability.
    * **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** In some scenarios, if the application's database user has elevated privileges, attackers might be able to perform administrative tasks within Cassandra.

**Deep Dive into the Attack Mechanics:**

1. **Vulnerable Code:** The core vulnerability lies in the way the application constructs CQL queries. Instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements, the application directly concatenates user-supplied input into the query string.

   **Example of Vulnerable Code (Conceptual):**

   ```python
   username = request.form['username']
   query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}';"
   session.execute(query)
   ```

2. **Crafting Malicious Payloads:** Attackers analyze the application's input fields and the expected data types. They then craft malicious CQL fragments that, when concatenated, alter the intended query's logic.

   **Common Injection Techniques:**

   * **String Concatenation Exploitation:**  Closing the existing string and injecting new CQL commands.
     * **Example:** If the application expects a username, an attacker might input: `'; SELECT * FROM sensitive_data; --`
     * **Resulting Query:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; SELECT * FROM sensitive_data; --';`  The `--` comments out the rest of the original query.

   * **Boolean Logic Manipulation:**  Injecting conditions that always evaluate to true, bypassing intended filters.
     * **Example:** If the application expects an ID, an attacker might input: `1 OR 1=1`
     * **Resulting Query:** `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = 1 OR 1=1;` This would return all orders.

   * **Stored Procedure/User-Defined Function Exploitation (Less Common in Standard Cassandra):** If custom functions or procedures are enabled and not properly secured, attackers might try to invoke them with malicious parameters.

   * **Time-Based Blind Injection:** If direct output is not available, attackers can inject queries that cause delays based on conditions, allowing them to infer information bit by bit.

3. **Execution by Cassandra:** When the application executes the constructed query, Cassandra processes the injected malicious CQL commands alongside the intended ones.

**Impact Scenarios in Detail:**

* **Data Breach:** An attacker could inject queries like:
    ```cql
    SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE email = 'victim@example.com' UNION ALL SELECT key, value FROM system_properties;
    ```
    This could retrieve user credentials and internal system information.

* **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could inject queries like:
    ```cql
    UPDATE products SET price = 0 WHERE product_id = 'vulnerable_product';
    ```
    This could manipulate product pricing or other critical data.

* **Data Destruction:** An attacker could inject queries like:
    ```cql
    DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'PENDING';
    ```
    This could lead to the deletion of legitimate orders.

**Mitigation Strategies (Crucial for Development Team):**

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the **most effective** defense. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code. The database driver handles escaping and ensures the input is safely incorporated into the query.

   **Example (Python with Cassandra Driver):**

   ```python
   username = request.form['username']
   query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s;"
   session.execute(query, (username,))
   ```

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Whitelisting:** Define allowed characters, formats, and lengths for each input field. Reject any input that doesn't conform.
    * **Blacklisting (Less Reliable):** Identify and block known malicious patterns. This is less effective as attackers can often find ways to bypass blacklists.
    * **Encoding and Escaping:**  Encode or escape special characters that have meaning in CQL (e.g., single quotes, semicolons) before using them in queries. However, this should be a secondary measure to parameterized queries.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations. Avoid using highly privileged accounts for routine tasks.

* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the codebase for potential CQL injection vulnerabilities. Use static analysis tools to identify potential issues.

* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can help detect and block malicious requests, including those containing potential CQL injection attempts. However, WAFs should not be the sole defense.

* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers about the risks of CQL injection and best practices for secure coding.

* **Regular Security Testing (Penetration Testing):** Conduct regular penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

* **Output Encoding:** While primarily for preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), encoding output can sometimes indirectly help mitigate injection risks by preventing the execution of injected scripts if they somehow bypass other defenses.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Log Analysis:** Monitor application and Cassandra logs for suspicious query patterns, error messages related to query parsing, or unusual database activity.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** These systems can be configured to detect and potentially block malicious CQL injection attempts.
* **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** DAM tools can provide real-time visibility into database activity, helping to identify and alert on suspicious queries.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Establish baselines for normal database activity and alert on deviations that might indicate an attack.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious CQL Queries via Application Input" attack path represents a significant risk to applications using Apache Cassandra. While the likelihood depends on the application's security posture, the potential impact of data breaches, manipulation, and destruction is substantial. **The most effective defense is the consistent use of parameterized queries.**  Coupled with robust input validation, security testing, and a security-aware development culture, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to this type of attack.
