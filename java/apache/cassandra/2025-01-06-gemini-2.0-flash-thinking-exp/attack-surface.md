# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/cassandra

## Attack Surface: [CQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/cql_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface: CQL Injection**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious CQL (Cassandra Query Language) statements into application queries to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cassandra executes CQL queries provided by the application. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize user inputs before embedding them in CQL queries, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a user's search term and directly inserts it into a CQL `WHERE` clause: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + user_input + `'`. A malicious user could input `' OR 1=1 --` to bypass the intended filtering.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, potential denial-of-service by executing resource-intensive queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective way to prevent CQL injection by treating user input as data, not executable code.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and remove potentially malicious characters.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the Cassandra user the application connects with has only the necessary permissions to perform its intended operations.

## Attack Surface: [Native Transport Protocol Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/native_transport_protocol_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Native Transport Protocol Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the binary protocol used by clients to communicate with Cassandra can be exploited.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cassandra uses this protocol for all client interactions. Flaws in its implementation can directly impact the security of the Cassandra instance.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the protocol's handling of specific data types could be exploited to cause a denial-of-service or potentially even remote code execution on the Cassandra node.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service, data corruption, potential remote code execution on Cassandra nodes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Cassandra Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Cassandra to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities in the native transport protocol.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Cassandra cluster within a secure network segment, limiting access from untrusted networks.
        *   **Use Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure only authorized clients can connect to the Cassandra cluster.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Authentication and Authorization Bypass**
    *   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to the Cassandra cluster or perform actions they are not permitted to.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cassandra provides built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms. Weak configurations or vulnerabilities in these mechanisms can lead to bypasses.
    *   **Example:** Using default credentials for Cassandra users, misconfiguring role-based access control (RBAC) allowing users excessive permissions, or vulnerabilities in the authentication plugin itself.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, cluster disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable and Enforce Strong Authentication:** Use secure authentication mechanisms and avoid default credentials.
        *   **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Regularly review and update permissions.
        *   **Secure Authentication Plugins:** If using custom authentication plugins, ensure they are securely developed and regularly audited.

## Attack Surface: [JMX Interface Exposure](./attack_surfaces/jmx_interface_exposure.md)

*   **Attack Surface: JMX Interface Exposure**
    *   **Description:** The Java Management Extensions (JMX) interface, used for monitoring and managing Cassandra, is exposed without proper security.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cassandra exposes JMX for operational purposes. If not secured, it provides a direct management interface to the Cassandra instance.
    *   **Example:** The JMX port (default 7199) is accessible without authentication or with default credentials. Attackers can connect and perform administrative actions, including potentially executing arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Cluster configuration changes, data access, potential remote code execution on Cassandra nodes, denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Remote JMX Access:** If remote access is not required, disable it entirely.
        *   **Enable JMX Authentication and Authorization:** Configure JMX to require authentication and authorize access based on roles.
        *   **Use Secure JMX Transports:** Configure JMX to use secure transports like TLS/SSL.
        *   **Firewall JMX Port:** Restrict access to the JMX port to only authorized management systems.

## Attack Surface: [User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and User-Defined Aggregates (UDAs)](./attack_surfaces/user-defined_functions__udfs__and_user-defined_aggregates__udas_.md)

*   **Attack Surface: User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and User-Defined Aggregates (UDAs)**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in custom code deployed as UDFs or UDAs within Cassandra.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cassandra allows users to extend its functionality with custom code. If this code is not secure, it introduces vulnerabilities directly into the Cassandra process.
    *   **Example:** A UDF that executes arbitrary system commands based on user input without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Cassandra nodes, data breaches, denial-of-service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Code Reviews:** Carefully review all UDF and UDA code for security vulnerabilities before deployment.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation within UDFs and UDAs to prevent malicious input from being processed.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for UDF Execution:** If possible, restrict the permissions of the Cassandra user executing UDFs.
        *   **Consider Sandboxing:** Explore mechanisms for sandboxing UDF execution to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/misconfigurations.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Misconfigurations**
    *   **Description:** Insecure or incorrect configuration settings in Cassandra.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cassandra has numerous configuration options, and incorrect settings can expose vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Leaving default ports open without proper firewalling, disabling authentication, using insecure encryption settings for inter-node communication or client connections.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely depending on the misconfiguration, but can include unauthorized access, data breaches, denial-of-service, and cluster compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the misconfiguration)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to official Cassandra security guidelines and best practices during configuration.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of Cassandra configurations to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration:** Restrict who can modify Cassandra configurations.
        *   **Secure Default Settings:** Change default passwords and disable unnecessary features or ports.
