# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a highly available and scalable database solution.
*   Offer a decentralized, fault-tolerant architecture for mission-critical data.
*   Support high-volume, high-velocity data ingestion and retrieval.
*   Provide a flexible data model (schema-optional) that can adapt to evolving application needs.
*   Maintain a strong open-source community and ecosystem.
*   Offer tunable consistency levels to meet different application requirements.
*   Minimize operational overhead and administrative burden.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data loss or corruption due to hardware failures, software bugs, or operational errors.
*   Service unavailability leading to application downtime and business disruption.
*   Unauthorized data access or modification due to security vulnerabilities.
*   Performance degradation or bottlenecks impacting application responsiveness.
*   Inability to scale to meet growing data volume and user demand.
*   Complexity of management and configuration leading to operational errors.
*   Lack of skilled personnel to manage and maintain the Cassandra cluster.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Cassandra supports multiple authentication mechanisms, including internal authentication (using passwords), LDAP, and Kerberos. This is described in the Cassandra documentation and configuration files.
*   security control: Authorization: Cassandra provides role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions on database objects (keyspaces, tables, etc.). This is managed through Cassandra's `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands and roles management.
*   security control: Client-to-node encryption: Cassandra supports TLS/SSL encryption for communication between clients and Cassandra nodes. Configuration details are in `cassandra.yaml`.
*   security control: Node-to-node encryption: Cassandra supports TLS/SSL encryption for inter-node communication. Configuration details are in `cassandra.yaml`.
*   security control: JMX access control: Cassandra uses JMX for management and monitoring. Access to JMX can be secured using password authentication and SSL.
*   security control: Auditing: Cassandra can be configured to log various events, including authentication successes and failures, schema changes, and permission changes. This is configured in `cassandra.yaml` and related audit logging configuration files.
*   security control: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE): DSE (DataStax Enterprise, a commercial distribution) offers TDE, but the open-source Apache Cassandra project does not natively support encryption at rest. Users often rely on OS-level or disk-level encryption.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Lack of native encryption at rest in Apache Cassandra. This means data stored on disk is not encrypted by default in the open-source version. Mitigation often relies on external tools or operating system features.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration of security features. Cassandra's security features require careful configuration. Mistakes can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of managing a distributed database. Cassandra's distributed nature introduces complexities in security management, requiring expertise to configure and maintain securely.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement OS-level or disk-level encryption to provide encryption at rest. This mitigates the accepted risk of no native encryption at rest.
*   security control: Regularly review and update Cassandra configurations, especially security-related settings, to address potential misconfigurations.
*   security control: Implement a robust monitoring and alerting system to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Use a dedicated, secured network segment for inter-node communication.
*   security control: Implement strong password policies and regularly rotate credentials.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All client connections must be authenticated.
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., Kerberos, LDAP).
    *   Enforce password complexity and rotation policies.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement granular access control using RBAC.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   Regularly review and audit user permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   While Cassandra itself doesn't directly handle "input" in the same way as a web application, data types are enforced at the schema level. Ensure appropriate data types are used to prevent injection-like attacks at the application level.
    *   Applications interacting with Cassandra should perform input validation to prevent malicious data from being stored.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use TLS/SSL for all client-to-node and node-to-node communication.
    *   Use strong cipher suites and regularly update TLS/SSL configurations.
    *   If using OS-level or disk-level encryption, use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).

## BUILD

Cassandra's build process is managed through Apache Maven. The source code is hosted on GitHub, and continuous integration is likely performed using Jenkins (based on historical information; the Apache project uses a variety of tools, and specifics can change).

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] --> GitHub["GitHub (Source Code)"]
    GitHub --> Jenkins["Jenkins (CI Server)"]
    Jenkins --> Maven["Maven (Build Tool)"]
    Maven --> UnitTests["Unit Tests"]
    Maven --> IntegrationTests["Integration Tests"]
    Maven --> SAST["SAST (Static Analysis)"]
    Maven --> ArtifactRepo["Artifact Repository (e.g., Apache Nexus)"]
    ArtifactRepo --> CassandraRelease["Cassandra Release (tarball, deb, rpm)"]

```

Build Process Security Controls:

*   security control: Source Code Management: GitHub provides access control, code review mechanisms, and branch protection rules.
*   security control: Build Automation: Jenkins automates the build process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Maven manages dependencies, but it's crucial to use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Static Analysis (SAST): SAST tools (e.g., FindBugs, SpotBugs, SonarQube) can be integrated into the Maven build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Unit and Integration Tests: Comprehensive tests help ensure the correctness and security of the code.
*   security control: Artifact Repository: A secure artifact repository (e.g., Apache Nexus) is used to store and manage build artifacts. Access control and integrity checks are important.
*   security control: Supply Chain Security: While not explicitly shown in the diagram, efforts are ongoing in the open-source community to improve supply chain security, including signing releases and providing SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Data storage and retrieval for applications relying on Cassandra.
*   Real-time data processing and analytics (if applicable).
*   Maintaining high availability and fault tolerance for mission-critical applications.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The sensitivity of the data stored in Cassandra depends entirely on the applications using it. Cassandra itself doesn't inherently know the sensitivity of the data.
*   Data sensitivity can range from non-sensitive (e.g., public data) to highly sensitive (e.g., PII, financial data, healthcare data).
*   Applications using Cassandra are responsible for classifying and protecting data appropriately, using techniques like encryption and access control.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) apply to the applications using Cassandra? This will influence the necessary security controls.
*   What are the specific performance and scalability requirements for the Cassandra cluster?
*   What is the expected data volume and growth rate?
*   What are the existing security policies and procedures within the organization?
*   What level of expertise is available for managing and maintaining Cassandra?
*   Are there any specific external systems (besides LDAP/Kerberos) that Cassandra needs to integrate with?
*   What is the specific CI/CD pipeline used for building and deploying Cassandra (confirming Jenkins usage and details)?
*   What specific SAST/DAST tools are used, if any?
*   What is the process for vulnerability management and patching?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization prioritizes data availability and scalability, but also recognizes the importance of data security.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The organization has a basic understanding of security best practices and is willing to invest in necessary security controls.
*   DESIGN: The deployment will use Kubernetes, and the build process will leverage Maven and a CI/CD system (assumed to be Jenkins). The organization will implement OS-level or disk-level encryption to compensate for the lack of native encryption at rest in open-source Cassandra.
