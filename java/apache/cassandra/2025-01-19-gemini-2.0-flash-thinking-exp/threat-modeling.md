# Threat Model Analysis for apache/cassandra

## Threat: [Unencrypted Inter-Node Communication](./threats/unencrypted_inter-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could eavesdrop on network traffic between Cassandra nodes to intercept sensitive data being exchanged during replication, repair, or gossip operations. They might use network sniffing tools to capture packets and analyze the unencrypted data.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data stored in Cassandra could be exposed, including user credentials, application data, and internal cluster metadata. This could lead to data breaches, identity theft, or further attacks on the cluster.
*   **Affected Component:** Network Communication Module, Gossip Protocol
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for inter-node communication.
    *   Configure Cassandra to require encrypted connections between nodes.
    *   Ensure proper certificate management and rotation.
    *   Restrict network access to Cassandra ports to trusted nodes only.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Client-to-Node Communication](./threats/unencrypted_client-to-node_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between the application and Cassandra nodes to steal credentials or sensitive data being transmitted in queries and responses. They might use man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and potentially modify the data.
*   **Impact:** Application credentials used to connect to Cassandra could be compromised, allowing the attacker to access or manipulate data. Sensitive application data exchanged with the database could be exposed.
*   **Affected Component:** Native Protocol Handler, Client Connection Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for client-to-node communication.
    *   Configure the Cassandra driver in the application to enforce encrypted connections.
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms for client connections.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Cassandra User Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_cassandra_user_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to brute-force or guess default or weak passwords for Cassandra users. If successful, they gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Impact:** Full access to the Cassandra database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data. They could also potentially gain administrative control over the cluster.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, User Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for Cassandra users.
    *   Disable or change default credentials immediately after installation.
    *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Consider using external authentication providers (e.g., LDAP, Kerberos).

## Threat: [Data at Rest Encryption Not Enabled](./threats/data_at_rest_encryption_not_enabled.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains physical access to the storage media where Cassandra data is stored (e.g., hard drives) could directly access and read the unencrypted data files.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of all data stored in Cassandra, including sensitive user information and application data.
*   **Affected Component:** Storage Engine, SSTable Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable data at rest encryption using Cassandra's built-in features or external encryption solutions.
    *   Implement strong physical security measures for the servers hosting Cassandra.
    *   Properly dispose of storage media containing Cassandra data.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in User-Defined Functions (UDFs) or User-Defined Aggregates (UDAs)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_user-defined_functions__udfs__or_user-defined_aggregates__udas_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom UDFs or UDAs, such as code injection flaws, to execute arbitrary code on the Cassandra nodes.
*   **Impact:** Potential for complete compromise of the Cassandra node where the UDF/UDA is executed, leading to data manipulation, denial of service, or further attacks on the cluster.
*   **Affected Component:** User-Defined Function Execution Engine, User-Defined Aggregate Execution Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all custom UDFs and UDAs for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization within UDFs/UDAs.
    *   Restrict the permissions of the Cassandra user executing UDFs/UDAs.
