# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/cassandra

## Attack Surface: [CQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/cql_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious CQL code into queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra's reliance on CQL for data interaction makes it vulnerable if input is not properly sanitized before being used in queries.

**Example:** An application takes user input for a product name and directly embeds it in a CQL query like `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '` + userInput + `'`. A malicious user could input `' OR 1=1; --`, potentially bypassing the intended query logic.

**Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive information, potential denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements): This is the most effective way to prevent CQL injection. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code.
*   Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using it in CQL queries. However, this is less robust than parameterized queries.
*   Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the Cassandra user accounts used by the application have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to Cassandra data or administrative functions.

**How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms need to be properly configured and enforced. Weak configurations or default credentials can be exploited.

**Example:** Using default credentials for Cassandra users or failing to enable authentication altogether allows anyone with network access to interact with the database.

**Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, cluster disruption, potential for remote code execution if administrative privileges are gained.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable and Enforce Authentication: Always enable Cassandra's authentication features.
*   Strong Passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for all Cassandra user accounts.
*   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement granular RBAC to restrict user access to only the necessary data and operations.
*   Regular Password Rotation: Enforce regular password changes for Cassandra users.
*   Disable Default Accounts: Remove or disable any default administrative accounts with known credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inter-Node Communication (Man-in-the-Middle)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inter-node_communication__man-in-the-middle_.md)

**Description:** Attackers intercept and potentially modify communication between Cassandra nodes, compromising data integrity and cluster stability.

**How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra nodes communicate with each other using a gossip protocol and for data streaming. If this communication is not encrypted, it's vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.

**Example:** Without SSL/TLS encryption enabled for inter-node communication, an attacker on the network could intercept data being replicated between nodes or gossip messages about cluster topology.

**Impact:** Data corruption, data inconsistencies across the cluster, potential for cluster disruption or takeover.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable SSL/TLS Encryption for Inter-Node Communication: Configure Cassandra to use SSL/TLS for all communication between nodes.
*   Mutual Authentication (mTLS): Implement mTLS to ensure that each node authenticates the identity of the other nodes it communicates with.
*   Secure Network Infrastructure: Ensure the network infrastructure where Cassandra is deployed is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed JMX Interface](./attack_surfaces/exposed_jmx_interface.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit the Java Management Extensions (JMX) interface, which is used for monitoring and managing Cassandra, to gain unauthorized access and potentially execute arbitrary code.

**How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra exposes JMX for management purposes. If not properly secured, it becomes a significant attack vector.

**Example:** If the JMX port (typically 7199) is exposed without authentication and authorization, an attacker could connect remotely and use JMX to execute commands on the Cassandra JVM.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, complete control over the Cassandra node, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable Remote JMX Access: If remote JMX access is not required, disable it entirely.
*   Enable JMX Authentication and Authorization: Configure JMX to require authentication and authorization for remote connections.
*   Use Strong JMX Credentials: Set strong, unique passwords for JMX users.
*   Restrict Access via Firewall: Use firewalls to restrict access to the JMX port to only authorized management systems.
*   Consider Alternatives to JMX: Explore alternative monitoring and management tools that might offer better security controls.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and Aggregates (UDAs)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_user-defined_functions__udfs__and_aggregates__udas_.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in custom UDFs or UDAs to execute arbitrary code or cause resource exhaustion on the Cassandra nodes.

**How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra allows users to extend its functionality with custom UDFs and UDAs. If these are not developed securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A poorly written UDF might have a buffer overflow vulnerability that an attacker could exploit to execute arbitrary code on the Cassandra JVM.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure UDF/UDA Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices when developing UDFs and UDAs, including input validation, bounds checking, and avoiding known vulnerabilities.
*   Code Reviews: Conduct thorough code reviews of all custom UDFs and UDAs before deployment.
*   Resource Limits: Implement resource limits for UDF execution to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   Principle of Least Privilege for UDF Execution: Run UDFs with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   Consider Sandboxing: Explore options for sandboxing UDF execution to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities.
