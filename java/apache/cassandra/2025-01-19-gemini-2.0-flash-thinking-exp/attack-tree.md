## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Cassandra](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_cassandra.md)

- This path represents the attacker's primary goal of gaining entry into the Cassandra database. Success here allows for further malicious activities.
- Critical Node: Exploit Authentication Weaknesses
  - Exploiting weak or default credentials provides immediate and direct access.
  - Brute-forcing, while requiring more effort, can succeed against weak passwords.
  - Authentication bypass vulnerabilities, though less common, offer a direct route in.
- Critical Node: Exploit Network Vulnerabilities
  - An unsecured JMX port grants extensive control over the Cassandra instance.
  - Intercepting unencrypted traffic can reveal credentials.
  - Firewall misconfigurations can expose Cassandra to unauthorized access.
- Critical Node: Compromise Client Credentials
  - Stealing application credentials allows attackers to authenticate as the application.
  - Exploiting driver vulnerabilities can lead to access or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data within Cassandra](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_within_cassandra.md)

- This path focuses on compromising the integrity of the data stored in Cassandra.
- Unauthorized Data Modification:
  - Insufficient RBAC allows users or compromised accounts to modify data they shouldn't.
  - Bugs in authorization logic can lead to unintended access and modification.
- Data Corruption:
  - Injecting malicious data via application vulnerabilities uses the application as an attack vector against Cassandra.
  - Exploiting bugs in Cassandra's write paths can directly corrupt data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Cassandra Availability/Performance](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_cassandra_availabilityperformance.md)

- This path aims to make Cassandra unavailable or significantly degrade its performance, impacting the application.
- Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:
  - Overwhelming Cassandra with requests can exhaust its resources.
  - Exploiting bugs leading to resource exhaustion can crash the system.
- Critical Node: Configuration Tampering (after gaining access)
  - Disabling critical services directly leads to unavailability.
  - Introducing malicious configuration changes can destabilize or compromise Cassandra.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cassandra Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cassandra_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

- This path targets known and unknown weaknesses within the Cassandra software itself.
- Critical Node: Exploit Known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
  - Publicly known vulnerabilities can be exploited if Cassandra is not patched.
- Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
  - While less likely, exploiting undiscovered vulnerabilities can have a critical impact.
