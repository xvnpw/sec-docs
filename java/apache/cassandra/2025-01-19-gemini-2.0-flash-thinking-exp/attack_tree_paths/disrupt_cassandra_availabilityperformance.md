#### 4.3 Critical Node: Configuration Tampering (after gaining access)

**Description:** This attack path assumes the attacker has already gained some level of access to the Cassandra system, either through compromised credentials, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or insider threats. The attacker then manipulates Cassandra's configuration to disrupt its availability or performance.

**Assumptions:** The attacker has sufficient privileges to modify Cassandra configuration files or use administrative tools.

Understanding the specific techniques involved in each stage is crucial for implementing effective mitigation strategies.

By focusing on strong access controls, regular patching, robust monitoring, and secure configuration management, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks succeeding. A layered security approach, combining preventative and detective measures, is essential for protecting the availability and performance of Cassandra clusters and the applications they support.
