## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via Cassandra](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_cassandra.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes can lead to achieving this objective.
*   **Why Critical:** Represents the ultimate security failure, leading to potential data breach, service disruption, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Cassandra Network Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_cassandra_network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Cassandra is exposed on the network. This includes unsecured communication channels and publicly accessible ports.
*   **Why Critical:** Network exposure is a fundamental security weakness that can be easily exploited and opens up multiple attack vectors.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Unsecured Inter-Node Communication -> Sniff Sensitive Data in Transit**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Cassandra nodes communicate internally without encryption (TLS/SSL disabled). An attacker on the same network can passively intercept this traffic.
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposed:** Authentication tokens, schema information, replicated application data.
        *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential for lateral movement within the Cassandra cluster and application infrastructure.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (TLS misconfiguration is a common oversight).
        *   **Effort:** Low (Network sniffing tools are readily available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires network traffic analysis).

    *   **High-Risk Path: Unsecured Client-to-Node Communication -> Sniff Sensitive Data in Transit**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Communication between the application and Cassandra nodes (CQL protocol) is not encrypted (TLS/SSL disabled). An attacker on the same network can passively intercept this traffic.
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposed:** Application queries, data being transmitted to and from Cassandra, potentially authentication credentials if embedded in connection strings.
        *   **Impact:** Exposure of application data, potential for data manipulation based on intercepted queries.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (TLS misconfiguration is a common oversight).
        *   **Effort:** Low (Network sniffing tools are readily available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires network traffic analysis).

    *   **Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Publicly Exposed Cassandra Ports -> Direct Access to Cassandra Services (CQL, JMX, nodetool) -> Unauthorized Data Access/Modification -> Exfiltrate sensitive application data**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Cassandra ports (e.g., 9042, 7199, 7000/7001) are directly accessible from untrusted networks or the public internet. Attackers can directly connect to Cassandra services.
        *   **Services Exploited:** CQL Native Protocol (port 9042), JMX (port 7199), nodetool (via JMX or SSH if enabled).
        *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Execute CQL queries to read, modify, or delete data. Use JMX/nodetool for administrative actions if authentication is weak or bypassed.
        *   **Impact:** Data breach through exfiltration of sensitive application data, data integrity compromise through modification, potential for complete system compromise via JMX/nodetool.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Misconfiguration of network security, especially in cloud environments).
        *   **Effort:** Low (CQL clients, nodetool are readily available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Unusual CQL activity, access from unknown IPs, JMX/nodetool access logs).

    *   **Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Publicly Exposed Cassandra Ports -> Direct Access to Cassandra Services (CQL, JMX, nodetool) -> Unauthorized Data Access/Modification -> Modify application data to disrupt functionality or inject malicious content**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Same as above - publicly exposed Cassandra ports.
        *   **Malicious Actions:** Modify application data to disrupt application logic, inject malicious content that the application processes, or cause data inconsistencies.
        *   **Impact:** Application malfunction, data integrity compromise, potential for further exploitation through application logic flaws triggered by malicious data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Misconfiguration of network security).
        *   **Effort:** Low (CQL clients are readily available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Unusual CQL activity, data modification patterns, application errors).

    *   **Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Publicly Exposed Cassandra Ports -> Direct Access to Cassandra Services (CQL, JMX, nodetool) -> Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion -> Overwhelm Cassandra with requests, impacting application availability**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Publicly exposed Cassandra ports allow attackers to send a flood of requests to Cassandra services.
        *   **DoS Methods:** Send a large volume of CQL queries, JMX requests, or nodetool commands to overwhelm Cassandra resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
        *   **Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption, denial of service to legitimate users.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Easy to launch basic DoS attacks if ports are exposed).
        *   **Effort:** Low (DoS tools are readily available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (High resource usage, connection spikes, slow response times).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Cassandra Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_cassandra_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

*   **Description:** Focuses on vulnerabilities related to how Cassandra authenticates and authorizes users. Weaknesses here can bypass access controls.
*   **Why Critical:** Authentication and authorization are fundamental security controls. Bypassing them grants unauthorized access to data and functionality.

    *   **High-Risk Path: Default Credentials -> Access Cassandra with default username/password -> Unauthorized Data Access/Modification & Configuration Tampering**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Cassandra is deployed with default username and password (e.g., `cassandra/cassandra`). Attackers attempt to log in using these credentials.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Cassandra, leading to data breach, data manipulation, configuration tampering, and potential for further system compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Organizations are generally aware of default credentials, but still happens, especially in quick setups or forgotten deployments).
        *   **Effort:** Very Low (Default credentials are publicly known).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Authentication logs will show login attempts with default credentials).

    *   **High-Risk Path: Weak Authentication Mechanisms -> Credential Stuffing -> Use compromised credentials from other breaches**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use lists of compromised usernames and passwords (obtained from breaches of other services) to attempt login to Cassandra. Users often reuse passwords across multiple services.
        *   **Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to Cassandra, leading to data breach, data manipulation, and potential for further system compromise.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Password reuse is common, credential stuffing attacks are prevalent).
        *   **Effort:** Low (Compromised credential lists are readily available).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Difficult to distinguish from legitimate logins without advanced anomaly detection).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Exploit Cassandra Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities -> Resource Exhaustion Attacks -> Query-based DoS -> Craft expensive queries to overload Cassandra resources (CPU, memory, I/O)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_&_high-risk_path_exploit_cassandra_denial_of_service__dos__vulnerabilities_-_resource__08142e4b.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft intentionally inefficient or resource-intensive CQL queries and send them to Cassandra.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** These queries consume excessive CPU, memory, and I/O resources on Cassandra nodes.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown, service disruption, potential Cassandra node instability or crashes, denial of service to legitimate users.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Relatively easy to craft inefficient queries, especially if application queries are not optimized).
*   **Effort:** Low (Requires basic CQL knowledge and query crafting).
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (High resource usage, slow query logs, performance monitoring).

    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Cassandra Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities -> Resource Exhaustion Attacks -> Write-heavy DoS -> Flood Cassandra with write requests to overwhelm storage and processing**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers flood Cassandra with a large volume of write requests.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Excessive write operations overwhelm Cassandra's storage subsystem, commit log, and indexing processes.
        *   **Impact:** Application slowdown, service disruption, potential storage exhaustion, denial of service to legitimate users.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Easy to generate high volume of write requests).
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple scripting can generate write floods).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (High write latency, storage utilization spikes, performance monitoring).

    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Cassandra Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities -> Resource Exhaustion Attacks -> Connection Exhaustion -> Open numerous connections to exhaust Cassandra's connection limits**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers open a large number of connections to Cassandra nodes, exceeding connection limits.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Exhaustion of connection resources prevents legitimate clients from connecting to Cassandra.
        *   **Impact:** Application service disruption, inability for legitimate clients to connect, denial of service.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Easy to open many connections from an attacker machine).
        *   **Effort:** Low (Simple scripting can open many connections).
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Connection limit errors, connection spikes, monitoring connection counts).
