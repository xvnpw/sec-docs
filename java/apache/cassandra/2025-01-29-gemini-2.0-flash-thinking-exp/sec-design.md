# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Apache Cassandra, aims to provide a highly scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant NoSQL database management system. It is designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

Business priorities and goals:
- Provide a highly available and fault-tolerant database solution.
- Offer linear scalability to handle growing data volumes and user traffic.
- Ensure operational simplicity for managing large-scale deployments.
- Support flexible data modeling and fast read/write operations.
- Maintain an open-source and community-driven project.

Most important business risks:
- Data loss or corruption due to system failures or misconfigurations.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- Performance degradation or service unavailability due to security vulnerabilities or attacks.
- Compliance violations related to data privacy and security regulations.
- Loss of user trust and adoption due to security incidents.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control Authentication mechanisms (e.g., PasswordAuthenticator, KerberosAuthenticator, AllowAllAuthenticator). Implemented within Cassandra codebase and configuration.
- security control Authorization framework (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC). Implemented within Cassandra codebase and configuration.
- security control Data encryption in transit using TLS/SSL. Configurable within Cassandra.
- security control Data encryption at rest (transparent data encryption). Configurable within Cassandra.
- security control Audit logging of security-related events. Configurable within Cassandra.
- security control Input validation on client requests to prevent injection attacks. Implemented within Cassandra codebase.
- security control Secure inter-node communication using authentication and encryption. Configurable within Cassandra.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk Complexity of security configuration can lead to misconfigurations if not properly managed.
- accepted risk Reliance on users to properly configure and manage security features.
- accepted risk Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- accepted risk Performance overhead of encryption and security features.

Recommended security controls:
- security control Implement automated security vulnerability scanning of the codebase and dependencies during development.
- security control Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits of Cassandra deployments.

        - security control Notification system for developers.

- Element:
    - Name: Build Artifacts (JARs, Docker Image)
    - Type: Artifact
    - Description: The output of the build process, including JAR files, Docker images, and other distributable components.
    - Responsibilities:
        - Packaging the compiled code and dependencies.
        - Creating distributable artifacts.
    - Security controls:
        - security control Signing of build artifacts to ensure integrity.
        - security control Secure storage of build artifacts.

- Element:
    - Name: Artifact Repository (e.g., GitHub Packages, Docker Hub)
    - Type: System
    - Description: A repository for storing and managing build artifacts, such as JAR files and Docker images.
    - Responsibilities:
        - Storing build artifacts securely.
        - Providing access to build artifacts for deployment.
        - Versioning and managing artifacts.
    - Security controls:
        - security control Access control to the artifact repository.
        - security control Audit logging of artifact access.
        - security control Vulnerability scanning of stored artifacts.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Data storage and retrieval: Ensuring the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of data stored in Cassandra.
- Database operations: Maintaining the operational stability and performance of the Cassandra database to support applications.
- Cluster management: Securing the management and administration of the Cassandra cluster to prevent unauthorized modifications or disruptions.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Customer data: Depending on the application, Cassandra might store sensitive customer information (PII, financial data, etc.). Sensitivity is high, requiring strong confidentiality and integrity controls.
- Application data: Data generated and used by applications. Sensitivity depends on the application and data type.
- Operational data: Logs, metrics, and configuration data related to Cassandra operations. Sensitivity is medium, as exposure could reveal system vulnerabilities or operational details.
- Authentication credentials and secrets: Keys, passwords, and other secrets used for authentication and encryption. Sensitivity is critical, requiring strong protection to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific compliance requirements for organizations using Apache Cassandra (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)?
- What are the typical deployment environments for Cassandra (on-premise, cloud, hybrid)?
- What are the common attack vectors targeting Cassandra deployments?
- What are the performance implications of enabling different security features in Cassandra?
- What are the best practices for security monitoring and incident response for Cassandra clusters?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a highly available, scalable, and secure database solution. Security is a critical non-functional requirement.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Cassandra implements basic security controls like authentication, authorization, and encryption, but further hardening and proactive security measures are needed.
- DESIGN: The design assumes a typical distributed Cassandra architecture with multiple nodes, client coordinators, storage engines, and supporting components. Deployment is assumed to be cloud-based on Kubernetes for scalability and manageability. Build process includes automated security checks in CI/CD pipeline.
