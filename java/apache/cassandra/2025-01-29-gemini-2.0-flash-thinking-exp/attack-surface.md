# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/cassandra

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated CQL Native Protocol Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_cql_native_protocol_access.md)

*   **Description:** Cassandra's CQL native protocol (port 9042) allows clients to interact with the database. If authentication is disabled, anyone can connect without credentials.
*   **Cassandra Contribution:** Cassandra's default configuration might have authentication disabled, especially in development environments, which can be mistakenly carried over to production.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans open ports, finds port 9042 open, connects without credentials, and dumps all data from Cassandra.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, complete compromise of data integrity and confidentiality.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Always enable Cassandra authentication and authorization. Configure a robust mechanism (e.g., internal password authentication, LDAP, Kerberos).
    *   **Strong Credentials:** Set strong, unique passwords for all Cassandra users, especially the administrator account.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to port 9042 to only authorized clients and networks using firewalls.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated JMX Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_jmx_access.md)

*   **Description:** JMX (Java Management Extensions) provides a management interface for Cassandra. If JMX authentication is disabled or uses default credentials, attackers can gain administrative control.
*   **Cassandra Contribution:** Cassandra exposes JMX for monitoring and management. Default configurations might have JMX authentication disabled or use weak default credentials.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the JMX port (7199) without authentication and uses JMX tools to execute arbitrary code on the Cassandra server, taking complete control.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service, cluster instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable JMX Authentication and Authorization:** Always enable JMX authentication and authorization. Configure strong credentials for JMX users.
    *   **Restrict JMX Access:** Limit network access to the JMX port (7199) to only authorized management systems and administrators using firewalls.
    *   **Change Default JMX Credentials:** If default JMX credentials are used, change them immediately to strong, unique passwords.
    *   **Disable Remote JMX (If Possible):** If remote JMX access is not required, disable it entirely.

## Attack Surface: [Gossip Protocol Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/gossip_protocol_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Cassandra's gossip protocol (port 7000/7001) is used for inter-node communication. Exploitation can involve spoofing gossip messages or eavesdropping on unencrypted traffic.
*   **Cassandra Contribution:** Cassandra relies on gossip for cluster management. By default, gossip communication is unencrypted and might be vulnerable on compromised networks.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network segment injects malicious gossip messages, causing nodes to become isolated or corrupting cluster metadata, leading to denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data corruption, denial of service, information disclosure (cluster metadata).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable Gossip Encryption:** Configure Cassandra to encrypt gossip communication using SSL/TLS to protect inter-node traffic.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Isolation:** Isolate the Cassandra cluster network segment to limit attacker access to gossip ports.
    *   **Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Implement network-based IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious gossip traffic.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default credentials for Cassandra administrative users (e.g., `cassandra/cassandra`) allows immediate unauthorized access.
*   **Cassandra Contribution:** Cassandra, like many systems, has default administrative credentials set during initial installation, which must be changed.
*   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to Cassandra using default credentials and gains administrative access, allowing them to manipulate data or shut down the cluster.
*   **Impact:** Complete administrative access, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, full system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Change Default Credentials Immediately:** Change all default Cassandra credentials (administrator and any other default users) during initial setup.
    *   **Password Management Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for all Cassandra users, including complexity requirements.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Backups](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_backups.md)

*   **Description:** If Cassandra backups are not properly secured, they can become a target for attackers, leading to data breaches.
*   **Cassandra Contribution:** Cassandra's backup mechanisms create copies of data that, if not protected, expose the data outside of active database security controls.
*   **Example:** Backups are stored in an unencrypted cloud storage bucket with weak access controls. An attacker gains access and downloads sensitive Cassandra data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, compliance violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Encrypt Backups:** Encrypt Cassandra backups at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
    *   **Secure Backup Storage:** Store backups in secure locations with strong access controls, limiting access to authorized personnel and systems.
    *   **Regular Backup Security Audits:** Periodically review backup storage security configurations and access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Management Interfaces (JMX)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_management_interfaces__jmx_.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing management interfaces like JMX to untrusted networks without proper authentication and authorization allows attackers to manage and potentially compromise Cassandra.
*   **Cassandra Contribution:** Cassandra provides JMX for administrative tasks. If JMX is accessible remotely without security, it becomes an attack vector.
*   **Example:** JMX is accessible remotely without authentication. An attacker uses JMX to execute arbitrary code on the Cassandra server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, data corruption, cluster instability, remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Access to Management Interfaces:** Limit network access to the JMX port to only authorized administrators and management systems from trusted networks. Use firewalls and network segmentation.
    *   **Enable Authentication and Authorization for JMX:** Enable and enforce strong authentication and authorization for JMX.
    *   **Consider Dedicated Management Network:** For highly sensitive environments, consider using a dedicated, isolated management network for accessing Cassandra management interfaces.
