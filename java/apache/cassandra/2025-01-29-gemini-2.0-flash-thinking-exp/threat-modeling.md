# Threat Model Analysis for apache/cassandra

## Threat: [Unauthorized SSTable Access](./threats/unauthorized_sstable_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the server's file system and directly reads Cassandra SSTable files. This could be achieved through compromised server credentials, physical access, or exploiting file system vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data stored in Cassandra, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
*   **Affected Cassandra Component:** Data Storage (SSTables on Disk)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong file system permissions to restrict access to SSTable directories.
    *   Enable disk encryption for data at rest to protect data even if physical access is gained.
    *   Regularly audit file system permissions and access logs.

## Threat: [Backup Data Exposure](./threats/backup_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to unsecured Cassandra backups (SSTables, snapshots). This could happen if backups are stored in publicly accessible locations, without proper access controls, or if backup storage is compromised.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data contained in backups, similar to unauthorized SSTable access.
*   **Affected Cassandra Component:** Backup/Snapshot Mechanism
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store backups in secure, access-controlled locations.
    *   Encrypt backups at rest and in transit.
