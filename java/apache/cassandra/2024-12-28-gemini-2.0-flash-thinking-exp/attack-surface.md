*   **Attack Surface: Unprotected Native Transport Protocol**
    *   **Description:** The Cassandra native protocol (port 9042 by default) is used by clients to interact with the database. If left unauthenticated and unencrypted, it becomes a significant entry point for attackers.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra exposes this protocol for client communication. The default configuration often does not enforce authentication or encryption.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network (or through an exposed port) connects to the Cassandra instance without providing credentials and executes CQL queries to read sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable client authentication using Cassandra's built-in authentication mechanisms (e.g., PasswordAuthenticator).
        *   Enforce authorization to control what authenticated users can access and modify.
        *   Enable TLS encryption for client-to-node communication to protect data in transit.
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to the native port from trusted networks only.

*   **Attack Surface: Unprotected JMX Interface**
    *   **Description:** Java Management Extensions (JMX) provides a way to monitor and manage Cassandra. If the JMX port (7199 by default) is exposed without proper authentication, it allows attackers to gain control over the Cassandra instance.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra exposes JMX for management purposes. The default configuration often does not require authentication for JMX access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker connects to the unprotected JMX port and uses JMX beans to execute arbitrary code on the Cassandra server, potentially taking complete control of the system.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable JMX authentication and authorization using password-based security.
        *   Restrict access to the JMX port to trusted management hosts only using firewall rules.
        *   Consider using TLS encryption for JMX communication.
        *   If not strictly necessary, disable remote JMX access altogether.

*   **Attack Surface: Lack of Inter-Node Communication Encryption**
    *   **Description:** Communication between Cassandra nodes (e.g., for gossip, data replication, repair) can be intercepted if not encrypted.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra nodes communicate with each other over the network. Without explicit configuration, this communication might not be encrypted.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the network eavesdrops on the communication between Cassandra nodes and intercepts sensitive data being replicated or exchanged.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of cluster topology and internal state, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management for secure communication.
        *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the Cassandra cluster network.

*   **Attack Surface: Weak or Default Credentials**
    *   **Description:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for Cassandra users provides a simple entry point for attackers.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra allows for user authentication. If default credentials are not changed or weak passwords are used, it weakens the security posture.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials (e.g., `cassandra`/`cassandra`) to log in and gain full access to the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all Cassandra users.
        *   Immediately change default credentials upon installation.
        *   Regularly review and rotate passwords.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms if available and suitable for the environment.

*   **Attack Surface: CQL Injection Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** Improperly constructed CQL queries, especially when concatenating user input, can lead to CQL injection attacks, similar to SQL injection.
    *   **How Cassandra Contributes:** Cassandra uses CQL as its query language. The responsibility of safe query construction lies with the application developers using Cassandra.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input and directly embeds it into a CQL query without proper sanitization or using prepared statements, allowing an attacker to inject malicious CQL code.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use prepared statements with parameterized queries** to prevent the injection of malicious CQL.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the application side.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when interacting with the Cassandra database.
