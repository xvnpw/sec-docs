### High and Critical Cassandra Threats

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Weak Authentication
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cassandra cluster by exploiting default credentials or weak passwords. They might use brute-force attacks or leverage publicly known default credentials.
        *   **How:** The attacker attempts to connect to the Cassandra cluster using common usernames and passwords or exploits default credentials that haven't been changed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  Confidential data stored in Cassandra can be exposed, modified, or deleted. This can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** `Authenticator` module, specifically the default `AllowAllAuthenticator` or poorly configured custom authenticators.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and configure a strong `IAuthenticator` implementation (e.g., `PasswordAuthenticator`).
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all Cassandra users.
        *   Regularly rotate passwords.
        *   Disable or remove default accounts.

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation through Insufficient Authorization
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker with limited access to the Cassandra cluster exploits overly permissive role-based access control (RBAC) configurations to gain higher privileges.
        *   **How:** The attacker leverages existing permissions to perform actions they shouldn't be authorized for, potentially granting themselves additional roles or accessing sensitive data they were not intended to see.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  An attacker can gain full control over the Cassandra cluster, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:** `Authorizer` module, specifically the configuration of roles and permissions within the `system_auth` keyspace.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained RBAC, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly audit and review role assignments and permissions.
        *   Utilize keyspace and table-level grants to restrict access to specific data.
        *   Avoid granting the `ALL PERMISSIONS` role unnecessarily.

*   **Threat:** Data Breach via Unencrypted Data at Rest
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains physical access to the storage media where Cassandra data is stored (e.g., hard drives) or compromises the underlying storage infrastructure.
        *   **How:** Without encryption, the attacker can directly access and read the data files stored on disk.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  Sensitive data stored in Cassandra is exposed, leading to confidentiality breaches and potential regulatory violations.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:**  Storage Engine, specifically the mechanisms for writing SSTables to disk.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Cassandra's data at rest encryption feature.
        *   Securely manage encryption keys using a key management system.
        *   Implement physical security measures to protect storage media.

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Client-Node Communication
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker intercepts communication between the application client and the Cassandra nodes.
        *   **How:** If TLS/SSL is not enabled, the attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially capturing sensitive data like credentials or query results. They might also manipulate the communication.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  Confidential data transmitted between the application and Cassandra can be compromised. Attackers might also be able to inject malicious queries.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:**  Client-to-node communication layer, specifically the CQL protocol handler.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for client-to-node communication.
        *   Properly configure and manage TLS certificates.
        *   Enforce the use of secure connections on the client side.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker sends a large volume of requests to the Cassandra cluster, overwhelming its resources.
        *   **How:** The attacker might send a flood of read or write requests, or craft complex queries that consume significant resources, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  The Cassandra cluster becomes unavailable, impacting the application's functionality and potentially leading to financial losses or service outages.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:**  Request Coordinator, Read/Write Path, Memory Management, Network I/O.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on client requests.
        *   Configure appropriate resource limits for Cassandra (e.g., connection limits, memory allocation).
        *   Implement connection timeouts and request timeouts.
        *   Use load balancing to distribute traffic across nodes.
        *   Monitor Cassandra resource utilization and performance.

*   **Threat:** JMX Exposure and Exploitation
    *   **Description:**
        *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Cassandra JMX interface.
        *   **How:** If JMX authentication is not enabled or uses weak credentials, the attacker can connect to the JMX interface and perform administrative actions, potentially reconfiguring the cluster, accessing sensitive information, or causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Cassandra cluster is possible, allowing for data manipulation, service disruption, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Component:**  JMX interface and its configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and configure JMX authentication and authorization.
        *   Use strong passwords for JMX users.
        *   Restrict network access to the JMX port using firewalls.
        *   Consider disabling remote JMX access if not required.
