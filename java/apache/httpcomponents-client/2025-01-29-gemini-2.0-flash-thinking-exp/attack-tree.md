## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1.1] Application constructs URL using unsanitized user input (SSRF)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_1__application_constructs_url_using_unsanitized_user_input__ssrf_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious URLs into user input fields that are used by the application to construct URLs for `httpcomponents-client` requests.
    * **Mechanism:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user input before incorporating it into URLs, an attacker can control the destination server and path of the HTTP request.
    * **Exploitation:** The attacker can make the application send requests to internal servers, cloud metadata endpoints, or other sensitive resources that are normally inaccessible from the outside.
    * **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) can lead to:
        * Access to internal resources and services.
        * Data breaches by accessing sensitive internal data.
        * Remote Code Execution (RCE) if internal services are vulnerable.
        * Circumvention of firewalls and network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2.1.1] Application constructs headers using unsanitized user input (HTTP Header Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_1_1__application_constructs_headers_using_unsanitized_user_input__http_header_injection_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious content into user input fields that are used by the application to construct HTTP headers for `httpcomponents-client` requests.
    * **Mechanism:** If the application doesn't sanitize user input before including it in headers, attackers can inject arbitrary headers.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can inject headers like:
        * `Cache-Control` or `Expires` to manipulate caching behavior (Cache Poisoning).
        * `Set-Cookie` to attempt session hijacking or cookie manipulation.
        * Headers that might be interpreted by backend servers in a vulnerable way.
    * **Impact:** HTTP Header Injection can lead to:
        * Cache Poisoning: Serving malicious content to other users.
        * Session Hijacking: Stealing or manipulating user sessions.
        * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via response headers (less common but possible).
        * Exploiting backend vulnerabilities through header manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.1.1] Application forwards unsanitized user input to request body (Malicious Request Body Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_1_1__application_forwards_unsanitized_user_input_to_request_body__malicious_request_body_inject_cbdfcae1.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious data into user input fields that are directly placed into the request body of HTTP requests made by `httpcomponents-client`.
    * **Mechanism:** If the application forwards user input to the request body without proper validation or sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary data.
    * **Exploitation:** This is particularly relevant for APIs and applications that process data sent in request bodies (e.g., POST requests with JSON or XML payloads). Attackers can inject:
        * Malicious payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in backend API endpoints.
        * Data to manipulate backend application logic.
        * Payloads for injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if the backend processes the request body in database queries).
    * **Impact:** Malicious Request Body Injection can lead to:
        * Data manipulation or corruption on the backend.
        * Exploiting vulnerabilities in backend APIs or data processing logic.
        * Potential for injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, etc.) if backend processes the body insecurely.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.2.1.1] Application blindly follows redirects from untrusted sources (Open Redirect Vulnerability)](./attack_tree_paths/_2_2_1_1__application_blindly_follows_redirects_from_untrusted_sources__open_redirect_vulnerability_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a malicious URL that the application uses as a redirect target in an HTTP response handled by `httpcomponents-client`.
    * **Mechanism:** If the application automatically follows redirects without validating the redirect URL against a whitelist or safe domains, it can be tricked into redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites.
    * **Exploitation:** An attacker can craft a response (or control a server that the application interacts with) to include a redirect to a phishing site, malware download site, or other malicious destination.
    * **Impact:** Open Redirect Vulnerability can lead to:
        * Phishing attacks: Redirecting users to fake login pages to steal credentials.
        * Malware distribution: Redirecting users to sites hosting malware.
        * SEO manipulation: Damaging the application's search engine ranking.
        * Reputation damage and loss of user trust.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.1.1.1] Application code disables certificate validation for testing or due to misunderstanding (Insecure TLS Configuration - Disabled Certificate Validation)](./attack_tree_paths/_3_1_1_1__application_code_disables_certificate_validation_for_testing_or_due_to_misunderstanding__i_72eb84b5.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly disable SSL/TLS certificate validation in `httpcomponents-client` configuration, often for testing purposes or due to a lack of understanding of the security implications.
    * **Mechanism:** Disabling certificate validation means the application will accept any certificate from the server, regardless of whether it's valid, trusted, or belongs to the intended domain.
    * **Exploitation:** This makes the application highly vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker positioned in the network can intercept traffic, present their own certificate (which will be accepted), and decrypt or modify communications.
    * **Impact:** Disabled Certificate Validation leads to:
        * Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks becoming trivial.
        * Data interception and eavesdropping on sensitive communications.
        * Credential theft if authentication data is transmitted.
        * Data manipulation and integrity compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.3.1.1] Attacker sends many requests to exhaust the connection pool, causing denial of service (Connection Pool Exhaustion DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/_3_3_1_1__attacker_sends_many_requests_to_exhaust_the_connection_pool__causing_denial_of_service__co_3aa878c9.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large number of HTTP requests to the application, specifically targeting the connection pool managed by `httpcomponents-client`.
    * **Mechanism:** If the connection pool is not properly configured with appropriate limits, an attacker can exhaust all available connections in the pool.
    * **Exploitation:** Once the connection pool is exhausted, the application will be unable to establish new connections to backend servers, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
    * **Impact:** Connection Pool Exhaustion DoS results in:
        * Denial of Service (DoS): Application becomes unavailable or unresponsive.
        * Service disruption and impact on business operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.4.1.1] Using outdated versions of httpcomponents-client or its dependencies with known vulnerabilities (Dependency Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/_3_4_1_1__using_outdated_versions_of_httpcomponents-client_or_its_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabil_fafda468.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses outdated versions of the `httpcomponents-client` library or its dependencies that contain publicly known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Mechanism:** Software libraries often have vulnerabilities discovered over time. If an application uses outdated versions, it remains vulnerable to these known issues.
    * **Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities, for which exploit code is often publicly available. Vulnerabilities can range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution.
    * **Impact:** Dependency Vulnerabilities can lead to:
        * Remote Code Execution (RCE): Allowing attackers to run arbitrary code on the server.
        * Data breaches: Accessing or modifying sensitive data.
        * Denial of Service (DoS): Crashing the application or making it unavailable.
        * Full system compromise, depending on the vulnerability.
