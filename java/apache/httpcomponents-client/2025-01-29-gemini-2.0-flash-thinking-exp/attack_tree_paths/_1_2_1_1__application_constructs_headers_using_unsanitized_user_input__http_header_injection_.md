### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1] Application constructs headers using unsanitized user input (HTTP Header Injection)

#### 4.1. Vulnerability Description: HTTP Header Injection

HTTP Header Injection is a type of web security vulnerability that occurs when an application incorporates user-controlled input directly into HTTP headers without proper sanitization or encoding. HTTP headers are separated by Carriage Return (CR - `\r` or ASCII 13) and Line Feed (LF - `\n` or ASCII 10) characters, collectively known as CRLF.

The vulnerability arises because attackers can inject CRLF sequences into user input. When this unsanitized input is used to construct HTTP headers, the injected CRLF sequences can be interpreted by the web server or intermediary systems as the end of the current header and the beginning of a new header. This allows attackers to:

*   **Inject arbitrary HTTP headers:**  Control the headers sent in the HTTP request or response, potentially overriding intended headers or adding new malicious ones.
*   **Manipulate HTTP responses:** In some scenarios, header injection vulnerabilities can be exploited to manipulate the HTTP response, although this is less common in the context of `httpcomponents-client` which is primarily used for making requests. However, if the application processes responses and reflects headers back to the user, response header injection could become relevant.

#### 4.2. `httpcomponents-client` Context

`httpcomponents-client` is a Java library used for creating robust HTTP clients. It provides APIs to construct and execute HTTP requests, including setting headers.  Developers using `httpcomponents-client` typically build requests programmatically, often incorporating data from various sources, including user input, into the request headers.

**How Vulnerability Arises with `httpcomponents-client`:**

If an application using `httpcomponents-client` takes user input (e.g., from a web form, API request, or configuration file) and directly uses this input to set HTTP headers without proper validation or sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to HTTP Header Injection.

**Example Scenario (Conceptual):**

Imagine an application that allows users to customize a report name, and this name is intended to be included in a custom HTTP header for tracking purposes when requesting data from a backend service using `httpcomponents-client`.

```java
// Vulnerable Code Example (Conceptual - Java-like)
String reportName = request.getParameter("reportName"); // User input

// Constructing request headers using httpcomponents-client
HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost("https://backend-service.example.com/data");
httpPost.setHeader("X-Report-Name", reportName); // Directly using user input

// Execute request using HttpClient
CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault();
CloseableHttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpPost);
```

In this vulnerable example, if a user provides input like:

```
MyReport\r\nCache-Control: no-cache
```

The `X-Report-Name` header will become:

```
X-Report-Name: MyReport
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

The injected `\r\nCache-Control: no-cache` will be interpreted as a new header, `Cache-Control`, with the value `no-cache`. This is HTTP Header Injection.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector Deep Dive

**4.3.1. Injection Mechanism: CRLF Characters**

The core of HTTP Header Injection is the injection of CRLF (`\r\n`) characters. These characters are fundamental delimiters in the HTTP protocol, separating headers and the header section from the body. By injecting CRLF, an attacker can break out of the intended header value and introduce new headers.

**4.3.2. Examples of Malicious Header Injections:**

*   **Cache Poisoning (via `Cache-Control`, `Expires`):**
    *   **Injection:** `UserInput\r\nCache-Control: no-cache`
    *   **Impact:**  Forces the backend service or intermediary caches to not cache the response. In more complex scenarios, attackers might try to inject headers that cause caching of malicious content, leading to cache poisoning.
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker might inject `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` to force caching of sensitive data or inject `Cache-Control: no-store` to prevent caching when it's intended.

*   **Session Hijacking/Cookie Manipulation (via `Set-Cookie`):**
    *   **Injection:** `UserInput\r\nSet-Cookie: SESSIONID=malicious_session_id; Path=/; HttpOnly`
    *   **Impact:**  Attempts to set a cookie in the *request* headers. While `Set-Cookie` is primarily a response header, some backend systems or intermediary proxies might misinterpret or process headers in unexpected ways.  In certain less common scenarios, this could potentially be leveraged for session manipulation or cookie injection, especially if backend systems are not strictly validating header origins.
    *   **Note:**  Directly injecting `Set-Cookie` in request headers to hijack sessions is less common and less reliable than other header injection attacks. However, it's still a potential avenue to explore depending on the backend infrastructure and how headers are processed.

*   **Backend Exploitation (via Custom Headers):**
    *   **Injection:** `UserInput\r\nX-Custom-Backend-Header: vulnerable_value`
    *   **Impact:**  Injects custom headers that might be processed by the backend service in a vulnerable way. If the backend application relies on custom headers for functionality and doesn't properly validate them, attackers can exploit this to trigger backend vulnerabilities.
    *   **Scenario:** Imagine a backend system that uses `X-Debug-Mode` header to enable debug features. An attacker could inject `X-Debug-Mode: true` to enable debugging and potentially gain access to sensitive information or bypass security checks.

**4.3.3. Exploitation Steps:**

1.  **Identify Input Vector:**  Locate user input fields that are used to construct HTTP headers in the application's code.
2.  **Craft Malicious Input:**  Create input strings containing CRLF sequences (`\r\n`) followed by the malicious header(s) to be injected.
3.  **Inject Input:**  Submit the crafted input through the identified input vector (e.g., form field, API parameter).
4.  **Observe Behavior:**  Monitor the HTTP requests sent by the application (using proxy tools like Burp Suite or Wireshark) to confirm that the malicious headers are being injected.
5.  **Exploit Impact:**  Based on the injected headers and the application's behavior, attempt to exploit the intended impact (cache poisoning, session manipulation, backend exploitation, etc.).

#### 4.4. Impact Assessment

Successful HTTP Header Injection can lead to a range of security impacts:

*   **Cache Poisoning:** By injecting cache-control headers, attackers can manipulate caching behavior. This can lead to:
    *   **Serving stale or incorrect content:**  Users might receive outdated or manipulated content from caches.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Repeated cache invalidation or cache misses can overload backend servers.
    *   **Distribution of malicious content:**  Attackers can poison caches to serve malicious content to unsuspecting users, potentially leading to XSS or other attacks.

*   **Session Hijacking/Cookie Manipulation:** While less direct, injecting `Set-Cookie` or other cookie-related headers in requests (or manipulating response headers if the application reflects them) could potentially be used to:
    *   **Steal or manipulate user sessions:**  In specific backend configurations or through intermediary proxies, session cookies might be altered or new sessions injected.
    *   **Perform actions on behalf of users:** If session cookies are compromised, attackers can impersonate legitimate users.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Response Headers (Less Common but Possible):**
    *   If the application processes and reflects HTTP response headers back to the user (e.g., in error messages or logs), and response header injection is possible, attackers could inject headers like `Content-Type: text/html` and then inject HTML/JavaScript code. This is a less common scenario in the context of `httpcomponents-client` usage, but relevant if the application handles responses in a vulnerable way.

*   **Exploiting Backend Vulnerabilities through Header Manipulation:**
    *   Injecting custom headers can expose vulnerabilities in backend systems that rely on or process these headers. This can lead to:
        *   **Bypassing security controls:**  Disabling security features or authentication mechanisms.
        *   **Gaining unauthorized access:**  Accessing restricted resources or functionalities.
        *   **Data breaches:**  Exfiltrating sensitive information from backend systems.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In extreme cases, if backend systems are severely vulnerable to header manipulation, RCE might be possible.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To prevent HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities in applications using `httpcomponents-client`, developers should implement the following mitigation strategies:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate all user inputs:**  Define allowed characters, formats, and lengths for input fields that will be used in headers.
    *   **Sanitize or encode user input:**  Remove or encode CRLF characters (`\r`, `\n`, `%0D`, `%0A`) from user input before using it in headers.  Consider using URL encoding or other appropriate encoding methods.
    *   **Use allowlists instead of blocklists:** Define what characters are allowed rather than trying to block specific malicious characters, as blocklists can be easily bypassed.

2.  **Secure Header Construction Methods:**
    *   **Use parameterized or safe header setting APIs:**  If `httpcomponents-client` or the underlying HTTP library provides APIs that handle header construction in a safe manner (e.g., by automatically encoding or escaping special characters), utilize them.  However, `httpcomponents-client` primarily relies on string-based header values, so careful sanitization is crucial.
    *   **Avoid direct string concatenation:**  Minimize or eliminate direct string concatenation when building header values with user input. This reduces the risk of accidentally introducing vulnerabilities.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege and Secure Coding Guidelines:**
    *   **Minimize header usage:**  Only include necessary headers in HTTP requests. Avoid using custom headers unnecessarily, especially with user-controlled data.
    *   **Follow secure coding practices:**  Educate developers about HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities and secure coding principles. Conduct regular security training.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) and other Security Headers:**
    *   While CSP primarily mitigates XSS, properly configured security headers can provide defense-in-depth and limit the impact of certain header injection attacks.
    *   Ensure appropriate `Cache-Control`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), and other security headers are set correctly in the *responses* from your application to protect users.  This doesn't directly prevent request header injection, but strengthens overall security posture.

#### 4.6. Detection and Prevention

*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Use SAST tools to analyze source code and identify potential instances where user input is used to construct HTTP headers without proper sanitization. SAST tools can help detect vulnerable code patterns early in the development lifecycle.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Employ DAST tools to perform black-box testing of the application. DAST tools can automatically inject various payloads, including CRLF sequences, into input fields and observe the application's behavior to detect HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  Deploy a WAF in front of the application to monitor and filter HTTP traffic. WAFs can be configured with rules to detect and block requests containing CRLF sequences or other malicious header injection patterns.
*   **Code Review and Security Audits:**  Conduct regular code reviews and security audits by experienced security professionals to manually examine the codebase and identify potential vulnerabilities, including HTTP Header Injection.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and assess the application's security posture, including its resilience to HTTP Header Injection.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

HTTP Header Injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant security implications for applications using `httpcomponents-client` if user input is not properly handled when constructing HTTP headers.  By injecting CRLF characters, attackers can manipulate caching behavior, potentially hijack sessions, and even exploit backend vulnerabilities.

**Recommendations for Development Teams:**

*   **Prioritize Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user inputs that are used in HTTP headers. Treat all user input as potentially malicious.
*   **Educate Developers:**  Train developers on HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices. Emphasize the importance of secure header handling.
*   **Utilize Security Tools:** Integrate SAST and DAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect and prevent HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Deploy WAFs:**  Use WAFs to provide runtime protection against HTTP Header Injection attacks.
*   **Regular Security Assessments:** Conduct regular code reviews, security audits, and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.

By diligently implementing these recommendations, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of HTTP Header Injection vulnerabilities and build more secure applications using `httpcomponents-client`.
