# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Apache HttpComponents Client, aims to provide a robust, efficient, and feature-rich HTTP client library for Java. It is designed to simplify the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses within Java applications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a reliable and stable HTTP client library for Java developers.
- Offer high performance and efficiency in HTTP communication.
- Support a wide range of HTTP standards and features.
- Maintain compatibility and ease of integration with existing Java ecosystems.
- Ensure the library is secure and protects applications from HTTP-related vulnerabilities.
- Foster a strong community and provide ongoing maintenance and updates.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by attackers, compromising applications that depend on it.
- Performance bottlenecks in the library could negatively impact the performance of applications using it.
- Lack of compatibility with new HTTP standards or Java versions could limit the library's usability and adoption.
- Bugs or instability in the library could lead to application failures and disruptions.
- Insufficient maintenance and support could result in unpatched vulnerabilities and a decline in the library's quality over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Development - The project is developed openly, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the code. This can help identify potential security issues. Implemented through GitHub repository and public contribution process.
- security control: Version Control - Source code is managed using Git, providing traceability of changes and facilitating security audits. Implemented through GitHub.
- security control: Build Automation -  Likely uses automated build processes (e.g., Maven) which can be configured to include basic security checks. Implemented through project build scripts and potentially CI/CD pipelines.
- security control: Dependency Management - Uses dependency management tools (e.g., Maven) to manage external libraries, which allows for tracking and updating dependencies for security vulnerabilities. Implemented through pom.xml files.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions -  Security depends partly on the vigilance of the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies could affect the library.
- accepted risk: User Misconfiguration - Users might misconfigure the library in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities in their applications.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to handle security reports responsibly and efficiently.
- security control: Security Code Reviews - Implement mandatory security focused code reviews for all code changes, especially those related to parsing, networking, and cryptography.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The library should securely handle authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens, usernames/passwords) when making requests.
    - Requirement: The library should support various authentication schemes (e.g., Basic, Bearer, OAuth) and allow users to implement custom schemes securely.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: The library should correctly handle server-side authorization responses (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden) and provide mechanisms for applications to react appropriately.
    - Requirement: The library itself does not enforce authorization policies, but it should not introduce vulnerabilities that could bypass authorization mechanisms implemented by applications or servers.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The library must perform robust input validation on all data received from HTTP responses (headers, body) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., header injection, response splitting).
    - Requirement: The library should provide mechanisms for users to validate input data before making HTTP requests to prevent sending malformed or malicious requests.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: The library must support secure communication over HTTPS/TLS, using strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    - Requirement: The library should handle TLS certificate validation correctly to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - Requirement: If the library provides any cryptographic functionalities beyond TLS (which is less likely for an HTTP client), these must be implemented securely using well-vetted cryptographic libraries and best practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Secure and reliable HTTP communication for Java applications.
- Maintaining the reputation and trust associated with the Apache HttpComponents project.
- Ensuring the continued usability and adoption of the library by the Java developer community.

Data to Protect:
- Potentially sensitive data transmitted over HTTP connections established by the library (depending on the application using the library). This could include:
    - Authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens, usernames/passwords).
    - Application-specific data exchanged with web services.
    - Configuration data for the library and applications.

Data Sensitivity:
- Sensitivity of data transmitted over HTTP is highly dependent on the application using the library. It can range from public information to highly confidential data (e.g., financial transactions, personal data).
- The library itself does not store persistent sensitive data, but it handles sensitive data in transit.
- The source code of the library itself is publicly available, but unauthorized modifications or compromises to the build and release process could introduce vulnerabilities.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are currently used in the CI/CD pipeline (if any)?
- Is there a documented vulnerability disclosure policy for the project?
- Are there regular security audits or penetration testing performed on the library?
- What is the process for handling and patching reported vulnerabilities?
- What are the performance testing and monitoring practices for the library?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and high-performance HTTP client library for the Java ecosystem. The project prioritizes stability and compatibility.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows general secure development practices for open-source projects. Security is considered important, but there might be areas for improvement in automated security testing and formal security audits. The project relies on community contributions for security vulnerability identification.
- DESIGN: The library is designed as a modular Java library with clear separation of concerns. It supports standard HTTP protocols and security features like TLS/SSL. The build process is automated using standard Java build tools and likely includes some basic security checks.
