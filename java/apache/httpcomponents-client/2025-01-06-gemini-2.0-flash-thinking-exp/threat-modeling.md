# Threat Model Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-client

## Threat: [HTTP Header Injection](./threats/http_header_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is used to construct HTTP headers in requests made by the application *via the `httpcomponents-client`*. This can involve injecting newline characters and arbitrary header fields and values.

**Impact:** The attacker can manipulate the server's behavior, potentially leading to cache poisoning, session fixation, cross-site scripting (if the injected header is reflected), or bypassing security controls.

**Affected Component:**
*   `org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpRequestBase` (when setting headers directly using methods like `setHeader` with unsanitized input).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly sanitize and validate all input used to construct HTTP headers before passing them to `httpcomponents-client` methods.
*   Use the `httpcomponents-client`'s built-in methods for setting headers with properly encoded values.
*   Avoid string concatenation for building headers from user-provided data when using the library.

## Threat: [Malicious Redirects Leading to SSRF or Phishing](./threats/malicious_redirects_leading_to_ssrf_or_phishing.md)

**Description:** If the application configures the `httpcomponents-client` to automatically follow redirects, a malicious server can redirect the client to an internal resource (SSRF) or a phishing site. The attacker exploits the application's trust in the initial server.

**Impact:**
*   **SSRF:** The attacker can make requests to internal systems that are otherwise inaccessible from the outside.
*   **Phishing:** Users might be tricked into providing credentials or sensitive information to a malicious site.

**Affected Component:**
*   `org.apache.http.client.HttpClient` (when configured to follow redirects automatically).
*   `org.apache.http.client.config.RequestConfig` (specifically the `isRedirectsEnabled` setting).

**Risk Severity:** High (for SSRF)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully consider if automatic redirect following via `httpcomponents-client` is necessary.
*   If redirects are required, implement strict validation of redirect URLs against a whitelist of allowed domains *before* allowing `httpcomponents-client` to follow them.
*   Limit the number of redirects allowed in the `RequestConfig` to prevent infinite redirect loops.
*   Consider disabling automatic redirects and handling them manually with more control over the destination.

## Threat: [Insecure Protocol Usage (HTTP instead of HTTPS)](./threats/insecure_protocol_usage__http_instead_of_https_.md)

**Description:** The application configures the `httpcomponents-client` to communicate with servers using the insecure HTTP protocol instead of HTTPS. This exposes the communication to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Sensitive data transmitted over the connection can be intercepted and compromised.

**Affected Component:**
*   `org.apache.http.client.HttpClientBuilder` (when building the `HttpClient` instance without enforcing HTTPS).
*   The scheme specified in the request URI used with the `httpcomponents-client` (e.g., "http://").

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use HTTPS for sensitive communication when using `httpcomponents-client`.
*   Enforce TLS and disable fallback to insecure protocols when configuring the `HttpClientBuilder`.
*   Ensure all request URIs used with the client start with "https://".

## Threat: [Disabled or Insufficient TLS/SSL Verification](./threats/disabled_or_insufficient_tlsssl_verification.md)

**Description:** The application configures the `httpcomponents-client` to disable certificate validation or uses weak TLS/SSL configurations, allowing attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks by presenting fraudulent certificates.

**Impact:** Attackers can intercept and modify communication, potentially stealing credentials or sensitive data.

**Affected Component:**
*   `org.apache.http.ssl.SSLContextBuilder` (when configuring custom SSL contexts for the `httpcomponents-client`).
*   `org.apache.http.client.config.RequestConfig` (related to setting a custom SSL socket factory).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure proper TLS/SSL certificate validation is enabled when configuring the `httpcomponents-client`.
*   Use strong cipher suites and up-to-date TLS versions when building the `SSLContext`.
*   Avoid disabling certificate validation in production environments when using the library. If necessary for testing, ensure it's not deployed to production code.

## Threat: [Improper Cookie Handling Leading to Session Hijacking](./threats/improper_cookie_handling_leading_to_session_hijacking.md)

**Description:** The application might not handle cookies securely *when using the `httpcomponents-client`*, potentially leading to session hijacking. This could involve not respecting `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags or allowing access to cookies that should be protected.

**Impact:** Attackers can steal session cookies and impersonate legitimate users.

**Affected Component:**
*   `org.apache.http.client.CookieStore` and its implementations used with the `httpcomponents-client`.
*   `org.apache.http.client.config.CookieSpecs` (related to setting a custom cookie policy for the client).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use the `httpcomponents-client`'s cookie management features correctly.
*   Ensure the `httpcomponents-client` respects the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags of cookies received from the server.
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in cookies managed by the client if possible.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `httpcomponents-client` library itself or its direct dependencies might contain known vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

**Impact:** The application could inherit these vulnerabilities, potentially allowing for various attacks depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Component:**
*   The `org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient` artifact and its transitive dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update the `httpcomponents-client` library and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the library and its dependencies.
*   Monitor security advisories for updates and patches related to `httpcomponents-client`.
