## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Identify and Leverage Publicly Disclosed CVE
    * Description: Attackers research publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting specific versions of the HttpComponents Client library.
    * Steps:
        * Identify the version of HttpComponents Client used by the target application.
        * Search CVE databases (e.g., NVD) for known vulnerabilities affecting that version.
        * Analyze the vulnerability details and look for proof-of-concept exploits.
        * Adapt or use the exploit to target the application's specific usage of the library.
    * Potential Impact: Complete application compromise, remote code execution, data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Leverage Vulnerability in a Dependency to Affect HttpComponents Client Functionality
    * Description: Attackers target vulnerabilities in libraries that HttpComponents Client depends on. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can indirectly compromise the application through the client library.
    * Steps:
        * Identify the dependencies of the HttpComponents Client library used by the application.
        * Scan these dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools or manual analysis.
        * Understand how the vulnerable dependency is used by HttpComponents Client.
        * Craft an exploit that leverages the dependency vulnerability to impact the client's functionality and ultimately the application.
    * Potential Impact: Similar to exploiting direct vulnerabilities in HttpComponents Client, including application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated Input](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_unvalidated_input.md)

* Attack Vector: Control Destination URL
    * Description: Attackers manipulate user-controlled input that is used to construct URLs for HTTP requests made by the HttpComponents Client.
    * Steps:
        * Identify application functionalities where user input influences the destination URL in HTTP requests.
        * Inject malicious URLs targeting internal network resources, other external services, or cloud metadata endpoints.
        * The HttpComponents Client, acting on behalf of the application, makes requests to these attacker-controlled destinations.
    * Potential Impact: Access to internal resources, exfiltration of sensitive data, ability to perform actions on internal systems, potential for further attacks on other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_tree_paths/http_header_injection.md)

* Attack Vector: Control HTTP Headers
    * Description: Attackers inject malicious HTTP headers into requests made by the HttpComponents Client by exploiting insufficient sanitization of user-provided input.
    * Steps:
        * Identify application functionalities where user input is used to set HTTP headers.
        * Inject malicious headers such as `Location` (for redirection), `Set-Cookie` (for cookie manipulation), or other headers that can influence server-side behavior.
        * The HttpComponents Client sends these crafted headers to the target server.
    * Potential Impact: Redirection to malicious websites, session hijacking, cross-site scripting (if the target server is vulnerable).

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration - Disable Certificate Validation](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_ssltls_configuration_-_disable_certificate_validation.md)

* Attack Vector: Disable Certificate Validation
    * Description: The application is configured to bypass or ignore SSL/TLS certificate validation when making HTTPS requests using HttpComponents Client.
    * Steps:
        * Identify that the application's configuration or code explicitly disables certificate validation.
        * Perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by intercepting the HTTPS connection.
        * Present a fraudulent certificate to the client application.
        * Since certificate validation is disabled, the client will trust the malicious server.
    * Potential Impact: Complete compromise of the communication channel, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on and modify sensitive data exchanged between the application and the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration - Disable Hostname Verification](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_ssltls_configuration_-_disable_hostname_verification.md)

* Attack Vector: Disable Hostname Verification
    * Description: The application is configured to skip verifying that the hostname in the server's certificate matches the hostname in the URL being accessed.
    * Steps:
        * Identify that the application's configuration or code disables hostname verification.
        * Perform a MITM attack and present a valid certificate for a different domain.
        * The client, ignoring the hostname mismatch, establishes a connection with the attacker's server.
    * Potential Impact: Allows attackers to impersonate legitimate servers, leading to phishing attacks or the interception of sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration - Improper Handling of Certificate Errors](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_ssltls_configuration_-_improper_handling_of_certificate_errors.md)

* Attack Vector: Improper Handling of Certificate Errors
    * Description: The application's error handling logic for SSL/TLS certificate validation failures is flawed, causing it to proceed with the connection despite errors.
    * Steps:
        * Identify that the application's code contains logic that ignores or bypasses certificate validation errors.
        * Present an invalid or expired certificate to the client application.
        * Due to the improper error handling, the client continues the connection with the potentially malicious server.
    * Potential Impact: Similar to disabling certificate validation, making the application vulnerable to MITM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Handling of Redirects](./attack_tree_paths/improper_handling_of_redirects.md)

* Attack Vector: Automatic Follow of Redirects to Untrusted Locations
    * Description: The application, using the default behavior of HttpComponents Client, automatically follows HTTP redirects without sufficient validation of the destination URL.
    * Steps:
        * Identify application functionalities that make requests to external URLs.
        * The attacker controls an initial server that responds with a redirect to a malicious URL.
        * The HttpComponents Client automatically follows the redirect to the attacker-controlled destination.
    * Potential Impact: Open redirect vulnerability, potentially used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or to bypass security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization of Response Data](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_of_response_data.md)

* Attack Vector: Insecure Deserialization of Response Data
    * Description: The application deserializes data received in HTTP responses from external servers without proper validation.
    * Steps:
        * Identify application functionalities that deserialize response bodies received via HttpComponents Client.
        * The attacker controls the external server and crafts a malicious serialized object in the response.
        * When the application deserializes this object, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the application server.
    * Potential Impact: Remote code execution, complete server compromise.
