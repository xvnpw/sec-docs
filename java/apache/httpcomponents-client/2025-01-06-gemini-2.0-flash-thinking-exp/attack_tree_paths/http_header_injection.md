## Deep Analysis: HTTP Header Injection via HttpComponents Client

This analysis delves into the "HTTP Header Injection" attack path identified in your attack tree, specifically focusing on applications utilizing the `org.apache.httpcomponents` library (specifically `httpclient`).

**Attack Tree Path:** HTTP Header Injection

**Attack Vector:** Control HTTP Headers

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious HTTP headers into requests made by the HttpComponents Client by exploiting insufficient sanitization of user-provided input.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify application functionalities where user input is used to set HTTP headers.**
2. **Inject malicious headers such as `Location` (for redirection), `Set-Cookie` (for cookie manipulation), or other headers that can influence server-side behavior.**
3. **The HttpComponents Client sends these crafted headers to the target server.**

**Potential Impact:** Redirection to malicious websites, session hijacking, cross-site scripting (if the target server is vulnerable).

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

This attack leverages the fundamental way HTTP requests are constructed. The `httpcomponents-client` library provides developers with methods to programmatically build and send HTTP requests. Crucially, these methods allow setting arbitrary HTTP headers. The vulnerability arises when the application takes user-controlled data and directly uses it to populate these header values *without proper sanitization or validation*.

**Technical Breakdown:**

* **How `httpcomponents-client` Handles Headers:** The library provides methods like `setHeader(String name, String value)` and `addHeader(String name, String value)` within classes like `RequestBuilder`, `HttpUriRequest`, and `ClassicHttpRequest` to manipulate headers. These methods directly incorporate the provided strings into the raw HTTP request being sent.

* **The Injection Point:** The vulnerability lies in the application code where user input (e.g., from a form field, URL parameter, or API call) is used as the `value` argument in these header-setting methods. If this input isn't properly sanitized, an attacker can inject their own headers.

* **Crafting Malicious Headers:** Attackers can exploit the structure of HTTP headers (name: value\r\n) to inject arbitrary headers. Key techniques include:
    * **Introducing Newline Characters:**  The `\r\n` sequence signifies the end of a header. By injecting this sequence within user input, an attacker can terminate the intended header and start a new one.
    * **Injecting Specific Header Names and Values:** Attackers can inject headers like:
        * `Location: http://malicious.example.com`: Forces a redirect on the server-side if the application processes this header.
        * `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=evilvalue; HttpOnly`: Attempts to manipulate the user's session cookie.
        * `X-Forwarded-For: <script>alert('XSS')</script>`: While less direct, if the target server logs or processes this header unsafely, it could lead to XSS.
        * Custom headers that might influence server-side logic or bypass security checks.

* **The Role of `httpcomponents-client`:** The library itself is not inherently vulnerable. It provides the tools to construct HTTP requests, and the responsibility for using these tools securely lies with the application developer. The library faithfully transmits the headers it is instructed to send.

**Real-World Examples and Scenarios:**

1. **Personalized Greeting Feature:** An application allows users to set a custom greeting that is displayed on their profile page. The application uses user input to set a custom header like `X-Greeting: [user_input]`. An attacker could inject:
   ```
   Nice to see you\r\nLocation: http://malicious.example.com
   ```
   This would result in the following headers being sent:
   ```
   X-Greeting: Nice to see you
   Location: http://malicious.example.com
   ```
   If the server processes the `Location` header, the user might be redirected.

2. **API Integration with Custom Headers:** An application integrates with a third-party API and allows users to specify custom headers for the API request. An attacker could inject:
   ```
   User-Agent: MyCustomAgent\r\nSet-Cookie: tracking_id=evil
   ```
   This could potentially set a malicious cookie on the user's browser if the target API server mishandles the `Set-Cookie` header in its response (though less likely in a direct API interaction).

3. **Internal Service Communication:** An application uses `httpcomponents-client` to communicate with internal microservices and allows administrators to configure custom headers for these requests. An attacker gaining control of this configuration could inject headers to bypass authentication or authorization checks within the internal network.

**Potential Impact Deep Dive:**

Beyond the initially listed impacts, consider these more nuanced consequences:

* **Cache Poisoning:** By injecting headers that influence caching behavior (e.g., `Cache-Control`), attackers could potentially poison caches, leading to widespread redirection or serving of malicious content to other users.
* **Authentication Bypass:** In some scenarios, specific headers might be used for authentication or authorization within internal systems. Injecting or manipulating these headers could lead to unauthorized access.
* **Information Disclosure:** Injecting headers related to content negotiation (e.g., `Accept`) could potentially trick the server into returning different content types than expected, potentially revealing sensitive information.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** While less direct, if the injected headers influence the target server to make subsequent requests, this could be a stepping stone for SSRF attacks.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Injecting a large number of headers or headers with excessively long values could potentially overwhelm the target server, leading to a denial of service.

**Mitigation Strategies for Development Teams:**

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** This is the most crucial step. Never directly use user-provided input to set HTTP header values without thorough validation and sanitization.
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define an allowed set of characters and only permit those.
    * **Blacklist Approach (Less Recommended):**  Filter out dangerous characters like `\r` and `\n`. However, this is less robust as attackers might find ways to bypass the blacklist.
    * **Context-Aware Validation:** Understand the expected format and content of each header and validate accordingly.
* **Use Libraries or Frameworks with Built-in Security Features:** Some higher-level HTTP client libraries might offer some degree of protection against header injection, but always verify their effectiveness and don't rely solely on them.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only allow users to control headers that are absolutely necessary for the application's functionality.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review code where user input interacts with HTTP header settings to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential header injection flaws.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Employ DAST tools to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in a running application.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF that can detect and block malicious HTTP requests, including those with injected headers.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate developers about the risks of HTTP header injection and secure coding practices.

**Specific Considerations for Applications Using `httpcomponents-client`:**

* **Developer Responsibility:** Emphasize that the security of header handling is the responsibility of the application developer using the `httpcomponents-client` library. The library itself does not enforce any specific sanitization.
* **Careful Use of Header Manipulation Methods:** Developers need to be extra cautious when using methods like `setHeader()` and `addHeader()` with user-provided data.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If possible, explore alternative ways to achieve the desired functionality that don't involve directly setting user-controlled headers. For example, using predefined options or structured data that the application can then translate into safe headers.

**Conclusion:**

HTTP Header Injection is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences. While the `httpcomponents-client` library provides the functionality to set headers, it's the application's responsibility to ensure that user input used for this purpose is properly sanitized. By implementing robust input validation, adhering to secure coding practices, and leveraging security testing tools, development teams can effectively mitigate the risk of this attack. Understanding the mechanics of header injection and its potential impact is crucial for building secure applications that utilize the `httpcomponents-client` library.
