*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Dependency Management for HttpComponents Client:** Employ a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage the `httpcomponents-client` dependency.
    2.  **Monitor HttpComponents Client Security Advisories:** Subscribe to the Apache HttpComponents project mailing lists or security feeds to receive notifications about vulnerabilities specifically affecting `httpcomponents-client`.
    3.  **Regularly Update HttpComponents Client Version:**  When security advisories are released or new stable versions are available, promptly update the `httpcomponents-client` dependency in your project to incorporate security patches and improvements.
    4.  **Automated Vulnerability Scanning for HttpComponents Client:** Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline to specifically check for known vulnerabilities in the `httpcomponents-client` library and its transitive dependencies.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known HttpComponents Client Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated versions of `httpcomponents-client` may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit through HTTP requests processed by the client.
*   **Impact:** High risk reduction for known `httpcomponents-client` vulnerabilities. Regularly updating minimizes exposure to these vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, using Maven for dependency management in `pom.xml`. GitHub Dependabot is enabled for automated vulnerability scanning and pull request creation for dependency updates, including `httpcomponents-client`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated merging and deployment of `httpcomponents-client` updates are not fully implemented. Updates are currently reviewed and merged manually.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS and Strong TLS Configuration in HttpComponents Client](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_and_strong_tls_configuration_in_httpcomponents_client.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `HttpClientBuilder` for HTTPS Scheme:** Ensure that when building `HttpClient` instances using `HttpClientBuilder`, you configure it to primarily or exclusively use the HTTPS scheme for requests.
    2.  **Customize `SSLContext` for Strong TLS:** Create and configure a custom `SSLContext` to enforce strong TLS protocol versions (TLS 1.2 or higher) and disable weaker versions. Specify strong and secure cipher suites within the `SSLContext`.
    3.  **Apply `SSLContext` to `HttpClientBuilder`:**  Provide the custom `SSLContext` to the `HttpClientBuilder` using `setSSLContext()` to ensure that all connections made by the client use the configured TLS settings.
    4.  **Enable Certificate Validation in `SSLContext`:** Ensure that default or custom certificate validation is enabled within the `SSLContext` to verify server certificates. Do not disable certificate validation unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Using HTTP instead of HTTPS or weak TLS configurations in `httpcomponents-client` allows attackers to intercept and potentially modify communication.
    *   **Eavesdropping and Data Theft (High Severity):**  Without strong encryption enforced by `httpcomponents-client`'s TLS configuration, data transmitted via HTTP requests is vulnerable to eavesdropping.
    *   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks targeting HttpComponents Client connections (Medium Severity):** Weak TLS settings in `httpcomponents-client` can make connections susceptible to downgrade attacks.
*   **Impact:** High risk reduction for MitM attacks and data theft related to `httpcomponents-client` usage. Enforcing HTTPS and strong TLS within the client provides robust protection.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, HTTPS is enforced for all external API calls made using `httpcomponents-client`. TLS 1.2 is the minimum allowed protocol version configured via a custom `SSLContext` used by `HttpClientBuilder`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicit cipher suite configuration within the custom `SSLContext` is currently using defaults.  Automated checks to ensure HTTPS is consistently used by `httpcomponents-client` are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Timeouts in HttpComponents Client Requests](./mitigation_strategies/implement_timeouts_in_httpcomponents_client_requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `RequestConfig` with Timeouts:** Create a `RequestConfig` object using `RequestConfig.Builder` and set appropriate values for:
        *   `setConnectTimeout()`:  Maximum time to establish a connection.
        *   `setSocketTimeout()`: Maximum time to wait for data after connection.
        *   `setConnectionRequestTimeout()`: Maximum time to wait for a connection from the connection pool.
    2.  **Apply `RequestConfig` to Requests:**  Apply the configured `RequestConfig` to each HTTP request using `RequestBuilder.setConfig()` before executing the request with `HttpClient`.
    3.  **Set Default `RequestConfig` for `HttpClientBuilder` (Optional):**  Consider setting a default `RequestConfig` using `HttpClientBuilder.setDefaultRequestConfig()` to apply timeouts to all requests made by the `HttpClient` instance by default.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Exhaustion via HttpComponents Client (Medium to High Severity):**  Without timeouts configured in `httpcomponents-client`, slow or unresponsive servers can cause the application to hang, exhausting resources used by the client.
    *   **Slowloris Attacks targeting HttpComponents Client connections (Medium Severity):** Timeouts in `httpcomponents-client` can help mitigate slowloris-style attacks by preventing indefinite waiting for slow requests.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High risk reduction for DoS attacks related to `httpcomponents-client`. Timeouts improve the client's resilience and prevent resource exhaustion.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, connection timeout and socket timeout are configured globally for `HttpClient` instances created by `HttpClientBuilder` using `setDefaultRequestConfig`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Connection request timeout is not explicitly configured in the default `RequestConfig`. Per-request timeout configuration for specific scenarios using `RequestBuilder.setConfig()` is not consistently implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Redirects in HttpComponents Client](./mitigation_strategies/control_redirects_in_httpcomponents_client.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Limit Maximum Redirects in `HttpClientBuilder`:** Configure the maximum number of redirects `httpcomponents-client` will follow using `HttpClientBuilder.setMaxRedirects()`.
    2.  **Disable Automatic Redirects in `HttpClientBuilder` (Optional):** Disable automatic redirect handling entirely using `HttpClientBuilder.disableRedirectHandling()`.
    3.  **Manual Redirect Handling with `HttpResponse` Inspection (If Disabled):** If automatic redirects are disabled, when you receive a redirect response (3xx status code) from `HttpClient.execute()`, inspect the `Location` header from the `HttpResponse`. Implement custom logic to validate and handle the redirect URL before making a new request using `httpcomponents-client`.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect Vulnerabilities Exploited via HttpComponents Client (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled redirects followed by `httpcomponents-client` can be abused to redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Redirect Loops handled by HttpComponents Client (Medium Severity):**  Excessive or circular redirects followed by `httpcomponents-client` can lead to performance issues and potential DoS.
*   **Impact:** Medium risk reduction for open redirect and DoS via redirect loops related to `httpcomponents-client`'s redirect handling. Limiting or controlling redirects prevents abuse.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, the maximum number of redirects is limited to 5 globally via `HttpClientBuilder.setMaxRedirects()`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Manual redirect handling with validation for sensitive requests when using `httpcomponents-client` is not implemented. Logging of redirect events by `httpcomponents-client` is not currently in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Parameter Encoding when Using HttpComponents Client](./mitigation_strategies/proper_parameter_encoding_when_using_httpcomponents_client.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize HttpComponents Client URI Building Utilities:** When constructing request URIs with parameters, use the URI building utilities provided by `httpcomponents-client` (e.g., `URIBuilder`) to ensure proper URL encoding of parameters.
    2.  **Avoid Manual String Concatenation for Parameters:**  Do not manually concatenate parameters into URLs as strings. This can easily lead to encoding errors and vulnerabilities. Always use the provided utilities.
    3.  **Encode Parameter Values:** When adding parameters using `URIBuilder` or similar methods, ensure that parameter values are properly encoded to handle special characters and prevent injection vulnerabilities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **HTTP Parameter Injection (Medium Severity):** Improper parameter encoding when using `httpcomponents-client` can lead to injection vulnerabilities if the server-side application is not expecting or handling encoded characters correctly.
    *   **Request Smuggling related to Parameter Handling in HttpComponents Client (Medium Severity):** In certain scenarios, incorrect parameter encoding could contribute to request smuggling vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Medium risk reduction for parameter injection vulnerabilities related to how parameters are handled by `httpcomponents-client`. Proper encoding is crucial for preventing these issues.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic parameter encoding is generally used when constructing URLs with `httpcomponents-client`, often implicitly through URI building utilities.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Explicit and consistent use of `URIBuilder` or similar utilities for all parameter handling with `httpcomponents-client` is not enforced across the codebase.  Code reviews should specifically check for manual string concatenation of parameters.
