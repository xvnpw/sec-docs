# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-client

## Attack Surface: [URL Injection / Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/url_injection__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the application into making requests to unintended internal or external resources by controlling the URL used with `httpcomponents-client`.
*   **How httpcomponents-client Contributes:** The library is the mechanism used by the application to make HTTP requests. If the URL passed to the client's methods (e.g., `HttpGet`, `HttpPost`) is derived from untrusted input without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An application takes a website URL from user input to fetch its content. An attacker provides an internal IP address or a URL for a sensitive internal service. The application, using `httpcomponents-client`, makes a request to this internal resource.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure from internal systems, access to internal services, potential for further exploitation of internal vulnerabilities, denial of service against internal resources.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that influences the target URL. Use allow-lists of permitted domains or protocols.
    *   **URL Whitelisting:**  Maintain a strict list of allowed destination URLs and only permit requests to those.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious HTTP headers into requests made by the application using `httpcomponents-client`.
*   **How httpcomponents-client Contributes:** The library allows setting custom headers through methods like `setHeader()`. If the values for these headers are derived from untrusted input without proper encoding or validation, attackers can inject arbitrary headers.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom user-agent. An attacker injects headers like `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` or `Connection: close` to potentially cause HTTP response splitting/smuggling.
*   **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting/Smuggling leading to cache poisoning, session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS) in some scenarios, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Header Value Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all user-provided input that influences HTTP header values.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Header Construction:**  Minimize the use of user input directly in header values. If necessary, use predefined safe header values.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Connection Handling (MITM)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_connection_handling__mitm_.md)

*   **Description:** The application using `httpcomponents-client` communicates over an insecure channel (HTTP) or doesn't properly validate server certificates when using HTTPS, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **How httpcomponents-client Contributes:** The library is responsible for establishing and managing the network connection. If not configured correctly to enforce HTTPS and validate certificates, it will establish insecure connections.
*   **Example:** An application connects to an external API using `httpcomponents-client` over HTTP. An attacker intercepts the communication and steals sensitive data or modifies the request/response. Or, the application doesn't verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate, allowing an attacker with a forged certificate to intercept the connection.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (data theft), integrity breach (data manipulation), potential for account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS for sensitive communication. Configure `httpcomponents-client` to use HTTPS schemes.
    *   **Strict Certificate Validation:**  Ensure proper SSL/TLS certificate validation is enabled in `httpcomponents-client`. Do not disable certificate validation in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the `httpcomponents-client` library itself or its dependencies.
*   **How httpcomponents-client Contributes:** The application directly uses `httpcomponents-client`, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in the library or its transitive dependencies.
*   **Example:** A known security flaw is discovered in a specific version of `httpcomponents-client` that allows for remote code execution. Applications using this vulnerable version are at risk.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update `httpcomponents-client` and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
