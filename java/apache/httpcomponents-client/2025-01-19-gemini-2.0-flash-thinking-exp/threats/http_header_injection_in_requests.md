### Deep Analysis of HTTP Header Injection in Requests

**Threat:** HTTP Header Injection in requests

**Description (Revisited):**

The core of this threat lies in the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-provided data before incorporating it into HTTP request headers when using the `httpcomponents-client` library. `httpcomponents-client` provides flexibility in constructing HTTP requests, including the ability to set headers programmatically. If an application directly uses unsanitized user input to build header values, an attacker can inject arbitrary headers or manipulate existing ones. This is possible because HTTP headers are separated by newline characters (`\r\n`). By injecting these characters within user-controlled data, an attacker can effectively terminate the current header and introduce new ones.

**Technical Details of Exploitation with `httpcomponents-client`:**

The `httpcomponents-client` library offers several ways to set headers on an `HttpRequest` object, primarily through the `RequestBuilder` class and the `addHeader()` method, or by directly creating `Header` objects (like `BasicHeader`) and adding them to the request.

Consider the following vulnerable code snippet:

```java
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost;
import org.apache.http.client.methods.RequestBuilder;
import org.apache.http.message.BasicHeader;

public class VulnerableRequest {
    public HttpPost createRequest(String userId) {
        String customHeaderValue = "User-" + userId; // Potentially from user input

        RequestBuilder builder = RequestBuilder.post("https://example.com/api/data");
        builder.addHeader("X-Custom-ID", customHeaderValue);
        return (HttpPost) builder.build();
    }
}
```

If the `userId` variable comes directly from user input without sanitization, an attacker could provide a value like:

```
123\r\nX-Injected: malicious-value
```

This would result in the following headers being sent:

```
POST /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-Custom-ID: User-123
X-Injected: malicious-value
```

The attacker has successfully injected a new header, `X-Injected`, with a value of their choosing.

**Attack Vectors and Potential Impact:**

The impact of HTTP header injection can vary significantly depending on the injected header and the server's behavior. Here are some key attack vectors and their potential consequences:

*   **`Host` Header Manipulation:** Injecting a `Host` header can lead to routing the request to a different server controlled by the attacker. This can be used for phishing attacks or to bypass certain security controls that rely on the `Host` header.
*   **`Cookie` Header Injection:** An attacker could inject or modify `Cookie` headers to perform session hijacking. By setting a valid session ID, they could impersonate another user.
*   **`Authorization` Header Injection:** In some cases, attackers might attempt to inject or manipulate `Authorization` headers to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** Injecting headers like `Cache-Control` or `Pragma` can manipulate the caching behavior of intermediary proxies or the server itself, potentially leading to denial of service or the serving of stale or malicious content to other users.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Reflected Headers:** If the server reflects certain headers in its response (e.g., in error messages), injecting malicious JavaScript code within a header value can lead to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Bypassing Security Controls:** Some security mechanisms rely on specific headers. Attackers might inject or modify headers to bypass these controls. For example, injecting `X-Forwarded-For` might be used to bypass IP-based access restrictions.
*   **Introducing Newline Characters for Request Smuggling/Splitting (Less likely with modern HTTP clients but worth noting):** While `httpcomponents-client` generally handles request construction in a way that mitigates classic request smuggling, improper handling of user input could theoretically contribute to related vulnerabilities if the underlying connection management is not robust.

**Affected Components (Revisited):**

*   **`RequestBuilder.addHeader(String name, String value)`:** This method is a primary point of vulnerability if the `value` parameter is derived from unsanitized user input.
*   **`RequestBuilder.setHeader(String name, String value)`:** Similar to `addHeader`, this method is vulnerable if the `value` is not properly sanitized.
*   **`BasicHeader(String name, String value)`:** When creating `BasicHeader` objects directly with user-controlled data, the `value` parameter needs careful handling.
*   Any custom code that directly manipulates the `Header` objects within an `HttpRequest` or `RequestBuilder` using user-provided data.

**Risk Severity (Revisited):**

The risk severity remains **Medium to High**, and the specific level depends on several factors:

*   **Sensitivity of the Application and Data:** Applications handling sensitive user data or financial transactions are at higher risk.
*   **Server-Side Handling of Headers:** The server's behavior when encountering unexpected or malicious headers is crucial. Servers that blindly process all headers are more vulnerable.
*   **Context of the Application:** Internal applications might have a lower risk compared to public-facing applications.
*   **Presence of Other Security Controls:** The effectiveness of other security measures in place can influence the overall risk.

**Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and `httpcomponents-client` Specific):**

*   **Avoid Directly Using User-Provided Data to Construct HTTP Headers:** This is the most fundamental principle. Whenever possible, avoid directly incorporating user input into header values. If it's absolutely necessary, follow the subsequent strategies.
*   **Use the `httpcomponents-client` API to Set Headers with Safe Values:**  Prefer setting headers with predefined, safe values or values derived from trusted sources.
*   **Implement Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Identify the Expected Format:** Determine the valid format for the header value.
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Allow only characters or patterns that are explicitly permitted. This is generally more secure than blacklisting.
    *   **Sanitize Special Characters:**  Remove or encode characters that have special meaning in HTTP headers, specifically newline characters (`\r`, `\n`). Consider using libraries specifically designed for input sanitization.
*   **Consider Using Parameterized Requests (Where Applicable):** While not directly related to header injection, using parameterized requests for the request body can prevent similar injection issues in the body. However, `httpcomponents-client` doesn't offer direct parameterization for headers.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct mitigation for header injection in requests, a properly configured CSP on the server can help mitigate the impact of XSS if it occurs due to reflected headers.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Regularly assess the application for vulnerabilities, including HTTP header injection, through code reviews and penetration testing.

**Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Vulnerable Code (as shown before):**

```java
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost;
import org.apache.http.client.methods.RequestBuilder;

public class VulnerableRequest {
    public HttpPost createRequest(String userId) {
        String customHeaderValue = "User-" + userId; // Potentially from user input

        RequestBuilder builder = RequestBuilder.post("https://example.com/api/data");
        builder.addHeader("X-Custom-ID", customHeaderValue);
        return (HttpPost) builder.build();
    }
}
```

**Secure Code (using sanitization):**

```java
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost;
import org.apache.http.client.methods.RequestBuilder;
import org.apache.commons.text.StringEscapeUtils; // Example sanitization library

public class SecureRequest {
    public HttpPost createRequest(String userId) {
        // Sanitize the user ID to remove or encode newline characters
        String sanitizedUserId = StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(userId); // Example: Escape Java control characters
        String customHeaderValue = "User-" + sanitizedUserId;

        RequestBuilder builder = RequestBuilder.post("https://example.com/api/data");
        builder.addHeader("X-Custom-ID", customHeaderValue);
        return (HttpPost) builder.build();
    }
}
```

**Even More Secure Approach (avoiding direct user input in headers if possible):**

```java
import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost;
import org.apache.http.client.methods.RequestBuilder;

public class SecureRequestAlternative {
    public HttpPost createRequest(String userId) {
        // Instead of putting the user ID in a header, consider passing it in the request body
        RequestBuilder builder = RequestBuilder.post("https://example.com/api/data")
                .addParameter("userId", userId); // Add as a form parameter

        // Or, if a header is absolutely necessary, use a predefined mapping
        String internalUserId = lookupInternalUserId(userId); // Map user-provided ID to a safe internal ID
        builder.addHeader("X-Internal-User-ID", internalUserId);

        return (HttpPost) builder.build();
    }

    private String lookupInternalUserId(String userId) {
        // Implement logic to map the user-provided ID to a safe, internal representation
        // This avoids directly using potentially malicious user input in the header
        return "INTERNAL_" + userId.hashCode(); // Example: Using a hash
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:**

HTTP Header Injection is a significant threat that can arise when using `httpcomponents-client` if developers directly incorporate unsanitized user input into HTTP headers. Understanding the mechanisms of this vulnerability and implementing robust mitigation strategies is crucial for building secure applications. The development team should prioritize input validation, sanitization, and, where possible, avoid directly using user-provided data in header values. Regular security assessments and adherence to secure coding practices are essential to prevent this type of vulnerability and protect the application and its users.
