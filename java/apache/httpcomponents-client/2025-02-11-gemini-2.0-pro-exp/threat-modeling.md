# Threat Model Analysis for apache/httpcomponents-client

## Threat: [Bypassing HTTPS Certificate Validation](./threats/bypassing_https_certificate_validation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, intercepting the HTTPS connection and presenting a forged certificate. The attacker exploits a misconfigured client that doesn't properly validate the server's certificate (e.g., hostname verification is disabled, or a custom trust manager accepts all certificates).
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can decrypt, view, and modify all data exchanged, including credentials, session tokens, and sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLConnectionSocketFactory`, `org.apache.http.conn.ssl.X509HostnameVerifier` (or custom implementations), `org.apache.http.ssl.SSLContexts`, custom `TrustManager` implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** disable certificate validation. Use the default `SSLConnectionSocketFactory` and `BROWSER_COMPATIBLE_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER`.
        *   If using a custom `SSLContext`, ensure it's configured with a `TrustManager` that properly validates certificates against a trusted certificate authority (CA).
        *   Avoid using `ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER`. If a custom `HostnameVerifier` is *absolutely* necessary, ensure it performs rigorous checks.
        *   Consider certificate pinning (with careful operational planning) for high-security scenarios.
        *   Regularly update HttpComponents Client to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Credential Leakage via Logging (with Wire Logging)](./threats/credential_leakage_via_logging__with_wire_logging_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to application logs. The application, using HttpComponents Client, has wire logging enabled (`org.apache.http.wire`), which logs *all* raw data sent and received, including headers (like Basic Auth) and request/response bodies containing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker obtains valid credentials or session tokens, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and access protected resources.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient` (if wire logging is enabled), application logging configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable wire logging (`org.apache.http.wire`) in production.** This is the most critical mitigation.
        *   Configure logging levels appropriately (avoid `DEBUG` or `TRACE` in production).
        *   Implement log redaction to filter out sensitive data.
        *   Regularly review and audit logging configurations.
        *   Securely store and manage log files.

## Threat: [Unintentional redirection to malicious host](./threats/unintentional_redirection_to_malicious_host.md)

* **Description:** The attacker manipulates the server response to include a redirect (3xx status code) to a malicious host. The client is configured to automatically follow redirects without proper validation, sending subsequent requests (potentially including sensitive data) to the attacker-controlled server.
    * **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information (credentials, cookies, request data) to the attacker. The attacker could also serve malicious content.
    * **Affected Component:** `org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultRedirectStrategy`, `org.apache.http.client.config.RequestConfig` (specifically `isRedirectsEnabled` and custom `RedirectStrategy`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review the use of automatic redirects. If possible, disable automatic redirects (`isRedirectsEnabled = false`) and handle redirects manually.
        *   If automatic redirects are necessary, implement a custom `RedirectStrategy` that validates the target host before following it. This validation should include:
            *   Checking against a whitelist of allowed hosts.
            *   Ensuring the redirect stays within the same domain or a set of trusted domains.
            *   Verifying that the redirected URL uses HTTPS.
        *   Limit the number of redirects followed automatically.

## Threat: [Cookie Hijacking (Due to Server Misconfiguration, but Client-Side Handling Matters)](./threats/cookie_hijacking__due_to_server_misconfiguration__but_client-side_handling_matters_.md)

*   **Description:**  While *primarily* a server-side issue (missing `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on cookies), the client's handling of cookies can exacerbate the problem. An attacker intercepts network traffic or performs XSS.  If the client doesn't enforce a strict cookie policy, it might accept and send cookies that should have been rejected.
    *   **Impact:**  The attacker can impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.apache.http.client.CookieStore`, `org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicCookieStore`, `org.apache.http.client.config.RequestConfig` (cookie policy).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the client's cookie policy appropriately. Use `CookieSpecs.STANDARD` or a custom policy that enforces security best practices.  This helps prevent the client from *sending* cookies that should have been rejected due to missing security flags.
        *   Avoid accepting cookies from untrusted sources.
        *   Validate the domain and path attributes of cookies.
        *   **Crucially, ensure the *server* sets the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags on all sensitive cookies.** The client can help mitigate, but the server is ultimately responsible for setting these flags.
