## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Serialization Practices within Flink](./mitigation_strategies/secure_serialization_practices_within_flink.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Flink to Utilize Secure Serialization Frameworks (Kryo or Avro)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Java Serialization in Flink:** Review your Flink application and dependencies to pinpoint areas where default Java serialization might be used *within Flink's context*. This includes checking custom serializers registered with Flink's `StreamExecutionEnvironment` and data types used in Flink operators.
        2.  **Configure Flink for Kryo or Avro:** Modify Flink's configuration (`flink-conf.yaml` or programmatically in `StreamExecutionEnvironment`) to explicitly set Kryo or Avro as the default serialization framework *for Flink's internal operations*.  For Kryo, register custom serializers with Flink's Kryo registration mechanism if needed. For Avro, ensure schema compatibility within Flink's data pipelines.
        3.  **Enforce Framework Usage in Flink Code:**  When developing Flink applications, ensure that data types and operators are compatible with the chosen serialization framework (Kryo or Avro) *as understood by Flink*. Avoid relying on implicit Java serialization within Flink's dataflow.
        4.  **Test Flink Application:** Thoroughly test your Flink application *within the Flink runtime environment* to confirm data is correctly serialized and deserialized using the configured framework and that Flink's performance is maintained.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data within Flink (High Severity):**  Exploiting Java serialization vulnerabilities *through data processed by Flink* could lead to remote code execution within the Flink cluster.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Flink's Serialization (Medium Severity):**  If Flink inadvertently uses Java serialization for sensitive data, it could increase the risk of information leakage *within the Flink processing pipeline*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data within Flink:** Risk significantly reduced *specifically within the Flink application*. Kryo and Avro, when configured for Flink, mitigate Java serialization vulnerabilities in Flink's data handling.
        *   **Information Disclosure via Flink's Serialization:** Risk reduced *in the context of Flink's internal data handling*. These frameworks offer more control over serialization within Flink.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Kryo is configured as the default serializer in `flink-conf.yaml` for general data types *within Flink's default settings*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Not fully enforced for all custom data types and UDFs *specifically within the Flink application's logic*. Need to review and potentially refactor UDFs and custom data types to ensure explicit compatibility and usage of Kryo or Avro serializers *as understood by Flink*, avoiding fallback to Java serialization within Flink's processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Flink State Backend Security Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/flink_state_backend_security_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Flink State Backend Access Control

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Flink State Backend:** Determine the type of state backend configured for your Flink application in `flink-conf.yaml` or programmatically (e.g., RocksDB, memory, remote like S3/HDFS).
        2.  **Leverage Flink's State Backend Security Features (if available):** Check if the chosen Flink state backend offers built-in security features. For example, some remote state backends might integrate with cloud provider IAM.
        3.  **Configure Underlying Storage Access Control:**  Regardless of Flink's features, configure access control at the *underlying storage level* used by the state backend. For RocksDB on a file system, use OS permissions. For S3, use AWS IAM policies to restrict access to the S3 bucket used by Flink's state backend *specifically for Flink's access*.
        4.  **Regularly Audit Flink State Backend Configuration:** Periodically review the state backend configuration in `flink-conf.yaml` and the underlying storage access controls to ensure they are correctly configured and aligned with security best practices *for Flink's state management*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Flink Application State (High Severity):** If the Flink state backend is not secured, unauthorized entities could access sensitive data stored *by Flink* in its state.
        *   **Data Tampering in Flink State (High Severity):** Unauthorized access could lead to malicious modification or deletion of state data *managed by Flink*, compromising the integrity of Flink applications.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Flink Application State:** Risk significantly reduced *specifically for Flink's state data*. Access control prevents unauthorized entities from accessing Flink's state backend storage.
        *   **Data Tampering in Flink State:** Risk significantly reduced *for Flink's state data*. Access control limits who can modify Flink's state data.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. For local development, basic file system permissions might be in place for RocksDB *implicitly*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to explicitly configure and enforce robust access control using IAM roles for cloud-based deployments (AWS S3 state backend) *specifically for Flink's state backend access*. Formalize a process for regular reviews of Flink state backend configurations and underlying storage permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Flink Network Security - TLS/SSL Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/flink_network_security_-_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable TLS/SSL for Flink Internal Communication

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Generate Flink TLS Certificates:** Create Java keystore and truststore files containing certificates *specifically for Flink's TLS configuration*. Obtain certificates from a trusted CA or generate self-signed certificates for testing (not production).
        2.  **Configure `flink-conf.yaml` for TLS:**  Modify the `flink-conf.yaml` configuration file to *explicitly enable TLS/SSL for Flink's internal communication channels*. This involves setting Flink-specific properties related to keystore/truststore paths, passwords, and enabling TLS for RPC, Blob Server, and Web UI *within Flink's configuration*. Refer to Flink documentation for TLS configuration properties.
        3.  **Distribute Flink TLS Keystore/Truststore:** Ensure the keystore and truststore files are accessible to all Flink components (JobManager, TaskManagers, clients) *as required by Flink's TLS configuration*.
        4.  **Restart Flink Cluster with TLS Configuration:** Restart the Flink cluster for the TLS/SSL configuration changes *within Flink* to take effect.
        5.  **Verify Flink TLS/SSL:** Verify TLS/SSL is enabled for Flink's internal communication by monitoring network traffic *related to Flink components* or checking Flink logs for TLS-related messages *generated by Flink*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping on Flink Communication (High Severity):** Without TLS, network traffic *between Flink components* can be intercepted, potentially exposing sensitive data being processed or managed by Flink.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Flink Communication (High Severity):** Attackers could intercept and manipulate communication *between Flink components* if not encrypted, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions within the Flink cluster.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping on Flink Communication:** Risk significantly reduced *for Flink's internal network traffic*. TLS/SSL encrypts communication between Flink components.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Flink Communication:** Risk significantly reduced *for Flink's internal network traffic*. TLS/SSL provides authentication and integrity for Flink's communication channels.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. TLS/SSL is not currently enabled for *Flink's internal communication*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to generate certificates *for Flink TLS*, configure `flink-conf.yaml` to enable TLS/SSL for all relevant Flink communication channels, and distribute keystores/truststores across the Flink cluster *as per Flink's TLS configuration requirements*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Flink Job Submission Authentication (Kerberos)](./mitigation_strategies/flink_job_submission_authentication__kerberos_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Flink Job Submission Authentication using Kerberos

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Integrate Flink with Kerberos:** Ensure the Flink cluster is configured to integrate with an existing Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) *for authentication purposes*.
        2.  **Create Flink Kerberos Principals:** Create Kerberos principals *specifically for Flink components and users/services submitting Flink jobs*.
        3.  **Generate Flink Kerberos Keytab Files:** Generate keytab files for the created Kerberos principals *for use by Flink and job submission clients*.
        4.  **Configure Flink for Kerberos Authentication:** Modify `flink-conf.yaml` to *enable Kerberos authentication for Flink job submission*. This involves setting Flink-specific properties related to Kerberos realm, KDC address, and specifying the JobManager's principal and keytab file *within Flink's security configuration*.
        5.  **Configure Flink Clients for Kerberos:** Configure Flink clients (e.g., `flink run` command) to use Kerberos authentication *when interacting with the Flink cluster*. This typically involves providing the user's principal and keytab file or using ticket-granting tickets *as required by Flink's authentication mechanism*.
        6.  **Test Flink Job Submission Authentication:** Test job submission from clients to ensure Kerberos authentication is working correctly *with the Flink cluster*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Flink Job Submission (High Severity):** Without authentication *enforced by Flink*, anyone with network access to the Flink cluster could submit and execute arbitrary jobs, potentially leading to malicious code execution, data breaches, or resource abuse *within the Flink environment*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Flink Job Submission:** Risk significantly reduced *specifically for job submissions to the Flink cluster*. Kerberos authentication ensures only authenticated users/services can submit jobs to Flink.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Flink job submission is currently unauthenticated *within the Flink setup*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to set up Kerberos infrastructure integration with Flink, configure Flink for Kerberos authentication in `flink-conf.yaml`, and configure Flink clients to use Kerberos for job submission *as per Flink's authentication requirements*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Flink Web UI Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/flink_web_ui_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Authentication for Flink Web UI (Simple Authentication or more robust methods)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Choose Flink Web UI Authentication Method:** Decide on an authentication method for the Flink Web UI. Simple authentication (username/password in `flink-conf.yaml`) is a basic option. For production, consider more robust methods like LDAP or integration with an identity provider *supported by Flink's Web UI authentication*.
        2.  **Configure Flink Web UI Authentication in `flink-conf.yaml`:** Modify `flink-conf.yaml` to *enable and configure authentication for the Flink Web UI*. This involves setting Flink-specific properties to enable authentication and configure users/passwords (for simple auth) or configure integration with LDAP/IdP *as per Flink's Web UI authentication options*.
        3.  **Restart Flink Cluster for Web UI Authentication:** Restart the Flink cluster for the Web UI authentication changes *within Flink* to take effect.
        4.  **Test Flink Web UI Access with Authentication:** Access the Flink Web UI through a web browser. You should be prompted for credentials *as configured in Flink*.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Flink Web UI (Medium Severity):** Without authentication *on the Flink Web UI*, anyone with network access can view cluster status, job details, and potentially perform actions through the UI, leading to information disclosure or unauthorized management *of the Flink cluster*.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Flink Web UI:** Risk significantly reduced *for access to the Flink Web UI*. Authentication prevents unauthorized users from accessing the Flink Web UI.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Flink Web UI is currently accessible without authentication *within the Flink setup*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to configure authentication in `flink-conf.yaml` for the Flink Web UI, choosing an appropriate method (at least simple authentication), and restart the Flink cluster *to enable Web UI authentication in Flink*. Consider stronger authentication methods for production environments *if supported by Flink's Web UI authentication features*.
