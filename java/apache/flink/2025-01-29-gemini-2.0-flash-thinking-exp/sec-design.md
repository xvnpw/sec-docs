# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache Flink project aims to provide a versatile stream processing framework capable of handling both batch and stream data processing with high performance and scalability. It targets businesses that require real-time data analysis, event-driven applications, data pipelines, and analytics.

Business priorities and goals:
- Provide a robust and scalable platform for stream and batch data processing.
- Offer high-performance data processing capabilities with low latency.
- Support a wide range of data sources and sinks.
- Enable complex event processing and stateful computations.
- Foster a vibrant open-source community and ecosystem.

Most important business risks:
- Service disruption due to system failures or security vulnerabilities impacting critical data processing pipelines.
- Data integrity issues leading to incorrect analytical results and business decisions.
- Performance bottlenecks hindering real-time processing capabilities and impacting service level agreements.
- Data breaches exposing sensitive data processed by Flink applications, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines.
- Vendor lock-in if relying heavily on specific cloud provider features for Flink deployment and management.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code reviews are conducted by the open-source community as part of the contribution process. (Location: GitHub Pull Request reviews)
- security control: Public vulnerability reporting and disclosure process through Apache Security Mailing lists. (Location: Apache Security website and project documentation)
- security control: Standard GitHub repository security features like branch protection and access controls. (Location: GitHub repository settings)
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities, which might lead to slower response times compared to dedicated security teams.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Flink, requiring ongoing monitoring and updates.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
- security control: Enhance dependency management practices, including vulnerability scanning of dependencies and automated updates to secure versions.
- security control: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing Flink management interfaces and APIs.
- security control: Provide clear guidelines and best practices for secure development and deployment of Flink applications to users.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms should be in place to control access to Flink cluster management interfaces (Web UI, CLI, REST API).
  - Requirement: Consider supporting various authentication methods like Kerberos, LDAP, OAuth 2.0 for integration with existing enterprise identity providers.
- Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage access to Flink resources and operations based on user roles and permissions.
  - Requirement: Ensure that authorization policies are consistently enforced across all access points to the Flink cluster.
- Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All external inputs to Flink applications and management interfaces must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
  - Requirement: Implement input sanitization and encoding to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web interfaces.
- Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest (e.g., configuration files, checkpoints) should be encrypted to protect confidentiality.
  - Requirement: Data in transit between Flink components and external systems should be encrypted using TLS/SSL to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
  - Requirement: Provide secure key management practices for cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Real-time data processing pipelines that provide timely insights for business operations.
- Continuous data ingestion and processing for event-driven applications.
- Reliable and accurate data analytics for decision-making.
- Uninterrupted operation of Flink-based services that are critical for business continuity.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Streaming data: Sensitivity depends on the application. Could include personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or confidential business data. Sensitivity level can range from low to high.
- Application state: Contains intermediate processing results and stateful information. Sensitivity depends on the data being processed. Could be medium to high sensitivity if it reflects sensitive data.
- Configuration data: Includes cluster configuration, job definitions, and credentials. High sensitivity as it can be used to compromise the system.
- Logs: Can contain operational information, debugging data, and potentially sensitive data depending on logging configuration. Sensitivity level can range from low to medium.
- Metrics: Performance and health metrics of the Flink cluster and applications. Low sensitivity in general, but can reveal operational patterns.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the specific use case for Apache Flink in your organization? Understanding the use case will help tailor security requirements and design considerations.
- What type of data will be processed by Flink, and what is its sensitivity level? This will determine the necessary data protection measures.
- What are the compliance requirements for data processing in your organization (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? Compliance requirements will influence security controls and architecture design.
- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the Flink deployment? Scale and performance needs will impact infrastructure and security design.

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to leverage real-time data processing for improved business insights and operational efficiency. High availability and data integrity are critical business requirements.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is a significant concern, and the organization aims to implement reasonable security controls to protect data and infrastructure. A risk-based approach to security is preferred, balancing security needs with operational feasibility. Secure software development lifecycle practices are considered important.
- DESIGN: The Flink deployment will be containerized and orchestrated using Kubernetes in a cloud environment. Standard open-source security best practices will be followed. The focus is on securing the Flink platform and applications against common threats.
