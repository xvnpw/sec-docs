## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Flink Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_flink_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal and inherently critical. Success means the attacker has achieved unauthorized access, data manipulation, denial of service, or code execution within the application or Flink environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flink Web UI Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flink_web_ui_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

The Flink Web UI is often exposed for monitoring and management. Vulnerabilities here can provide an entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unauthenticated Access to Web UI [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/unauthenticated_access_to_web_ui__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the Flink Web UI is exposed without proper authentication, an attacker can directly access it. This is often due to default configurations or misconfigurations during deployment.
*   **Impact:**  Information disclosure about the Flink cluster, running jobs, and configurations.  Attackers might be able to manipulate configurations or even submit malicious jobs through the UI if authorization is also weak.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Web UI [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_web_ui__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Web UI components (e.g., libraries, frameworks, or Flink Web UI code itself) to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Web UI. This could be through exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies or finding new vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server hosting the Web UI, potentially leading to cluster-wide compromise and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flink JobManager Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flink_jobmanager_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

The JobManager is the central coordinator of the Flink cluster. Compromising it can have severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [JobManager RCE via Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/jobmanager_rce_via_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting Java deserialization vulnerabilities in the JobManager. Attackers send malicious serialized data to the JobManager (e.g., during job submission or internal communication). When the JobManager deserializes this data, it triggers the execution of attacker-controlled code.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the JobManager, allowing the attacker to control the entire Flink cluster, steal data, disrupt operations, or launch further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [JobManager RCE via Configuration Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/jobmanager_rce_via_configuration_exploitation__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Manipulating Flink configuration files or APIs (if improperly secured) to inject malicious commands or scripts that are executed by the JobManager during startup or operation.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the JobManager, similar to deserialization RCE, leading to cluster control and potential data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flink TaskManager Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flink_taskmanager_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

TaskManagers execute the actual Flink jobs and process data. Compromising them can lead to data breaches and disruption of data processing.

## Attack Tree Path: [TaskManager RCE via Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/taskmanager_rce_via_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to JobManager deserialization RCE, but targeting TaskManagers. Malicious serialized data is sent to TaskManagers, leading to code execution upon deserialization.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of TaskManagers, allowing attackers to access and manipulate data being processed, potentially exfiltrate data, or disrupt job execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [TaskManager RCE via User Code Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/taskmanager_rce_via_user_code_exploitation__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code within user-defined functions (UDFs) or operators in Flink jobs. When these jobs are executed by TaskManagers, the malicious code is executed within the TaskManager's context.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of TaskManagers, similar to deserialization RCE, allowing data access, manipulation, and potential lateral movement.

## Attack Tree Path: [TaskManager Data Exfiltration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/taskmanager_data_exfiltration__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Inserting malicious code within UDFs or operators specifically designed to exfiltrate sensitive data processed by the TaskManager. This code would send data to an attacker-controlled external location.
*   **Impact:** Data breach and loss of sensitive information being processed by Flink.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flink Connector Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flink_connector_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Flink connectors interact with external systems (databases, message queues, etc.). Vulnerabilities here can extend the attack beyond Flink itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Connector Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/connector_injection_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting injection vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, command injection) through vulnerable connector configurations or by injecting malicious data that is processed by the connector. This often occurs when input data is not properly validated and sanitized before being used in connector operations.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches from connected external systems, potential RCE on connected systems depending on the type of injection vulnerability and the capabilities of the connected system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flink Configuration Mismanagement [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flink_configuration_mismanagement__critical_node_.md)

Misconfigurations are a common source of vulnerabilities and can weaken the entire security posture of the Flink application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Relying on default Flink configurations that are not secure. This includes weak or missing authentication, exposed ports, and insecure default settings for various components.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Configuration Files [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_configuration_files__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flink configuration files containing sensitive information (credentials, connection strings, etc.) are made accessible to unauthorized users or processes due to improper file system permissions or insecure storage.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive credentials and configuration details, which can be used to further compromise the Flink cluster and connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Security Features [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_security_features__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Improperly configuring or disabling Flink security features like authentication, authorization, and encryption. This can be due to lack of understanding, oversight, or misconfiguration during setup.
*   **Impact:** Weakened security posture, making it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities and bypass security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flink Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flink_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Flink relies on numerous dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly impact Flink's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Flink Core Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_flink_core_dependencies__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flink using vulnerable versions of its core dependencies (e.g., Log4j, Jackson, etc.). Known vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited to compromise Flink.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from RCE and DoS to information disclosure, potentially leading to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable User-Added Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_user-added_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** User-defined jobs or connectors introducing vulnerable dependencies that are not part of Flink's core dependencies. Developers might unknowingly include vulnerable libraries in their Flink applications.
*   **Impact:** Similar to core dependency vulnerabilities, impact depends on the specific vulnerability and can range from RCE to DoS and information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Vulnerabilities Around Flink [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_vulnerabilities_around_flink__critical_node_.md)

Network security is crucial for protecting Flink components and the data they process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unencrypted Communication [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/unencrypted_communication__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flink communication channels (Web UI, JobManager-TaskManager, etc.) are not encrypted using TLS/SSL. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on network traffic and potentially intercept sensitive data or credentials.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, interception of sensitive data in transit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Network Segmentation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_network_segmentation__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flink components are deployed in the same network segment as less trusted systems. This lack of segmentation allows attackers who compromise a less secure system to easily pivot and attack Flink components.
*   **Impact:** Increased lateral movement possibilities for attackers, broader impact of a compromise, as attackers can move more easily within the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Flink Ports [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_flink_ports__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Flink ports (Web UI, JobManager, TaskManager) are exposed to the public internet or untrusted networks. This directly increases the attack surface and allows external attackers to attempt to connect to and exploit Flink services.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, easier access for external attackers to attempt exploitation of Flink vulnerabilities.
