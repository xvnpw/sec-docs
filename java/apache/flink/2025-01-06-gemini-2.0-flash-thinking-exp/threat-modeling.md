# Threat Model Analysis for apache/flink

## Threat: [Malicious Job Submission](./threats/malicious_job_submission.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Flink cluster (e.g., through an exposed JobManager API or compromised credentials) and submits a specially crafted Flink job. This job could contain malicious code designed to exploit vulnerabilities *within Flink's execution environment* or perform unauthorized actions *through Flink's APIs and functionalities*.

**Impact:**
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The malicious job could consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network) *within the Flink cluster*, leading to denial of service for legitimate applications running on the cluster.
*   **Code Execution:** The job could execute arbitrary code within the TaskManagers *by leveraging Flink's mechanisms for user code execution*.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The job could modify or delete data in connected data sources or sinks *through Flink's connector framework*.

**Affected Component:** JobManager (Job Submission endpoint, REST API)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for job submission *using Flink's security features or external authentication mechanisms*.
*   Enforce access control lists (ACLs) to restrict who can submit jobs *within Flink's authorization framework*.
*   Regularly audit submitted jobs and their configurations.
*   Implement resource quotas and limits for submitted jobs *using Flink's resource management capabilities*.
*   Consider using a secure job submission gateway or proxy.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution on JobManager](./threats/remote_code_execution_on_jobmanager.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the JobManager software itself (or its dependencies) to execute arbitrary code on the JobManager host. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting deserialization flaws *within Flink's internal communication or APIs*, vulnerabilities in the web UI *components provided by Flink*, or flaws in network protocols *used by Flink*.

**Impact:**
*   **Complete Cluster Takeover:** The attacker gains full control of the JobManager, allowing them to control the entire Flink cluster, including submitting malicious jobs, accessing sensitive information, and disrupting operations.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored on or accessible by the JobManager *through Flink's internal data structures or configurations*.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can intentionally crash or disable the JobManager, bringing down the entire Flink cluster.

**Affected Component:** JobManager (Core runtime, Web UI, REST API)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Flink version up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Regularly scan the JobManager host for vulnerabilities.
*   Harden the JobManager operating system and restrict unnecessary services.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit access to the JobManager.
*   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect the Flink Web UI.

## Threat: [TaskManager Compromise leading to Data Manipulation](./threats/taskmanager_compromise_leading_to_data_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a TaskManager node (e.g., through a vulnerability in the TaskManager software, its dependencies). Once compromised, the attacker can intercept and modify data being processed by the TaskManager before it reaches its destination *by manipulating Flink's internal data processing mechanisms*.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Corruption:**  Processed data becomes inaccurate or unreliable, leading to incorrect insights or decisions based on the data.
*   **Data Integrity Violation:** The integrity of the data stream is compromised, potentially affecting downstream applications or systems relying on this data.
*   **Business Logic Bypass:**  Manipulated data could bypass intended business logic or security checks within the Flink application.

**Affected Component:** TaskManager (Core runtime, Data processing pipelines)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Flink version up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Regularly scan TaskManager hosts for vulnerabilities.
*   Harden the TaskManager operating system and restrict unnecessary services.
*   Implement network segmentation to isolate TaskManagers.
*   Consider using secure communication channels (e.g., TLS/SSL) for internal Flink communication.
*   Implement data validation and integrity checks within the Flink application.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in User-Defined Functions (UDFs)](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_user-defined_functions__udfs_.md)

**Description:**  A developer writes a UDF that deserializes untrusted data without proper validation. An attacker can craft malicious input data that, when deserialized *by Flink's UDF execution framework*, executes arbitrary code on the TaskManager where the UDF is running.

**Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution on TaskManager:**  The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the TaskManager host.
*   **Data Access:** The attacker can access data processed by the TaskManager or data accessible on the TaskManager host.
*   **Denial of Service:** The malicious deserialization can crash the TaskManager.

**Affected Component:** TaskManager (User code execution environment, UDFs)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing untrusted data in UDFs if possible.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization libraries and techniques.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for data passed to UDFs.
*   Regularly review and audit UDF code for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using sandboxing or containerization for UDF execution.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to State Backends](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_state_backends.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage location of Flink's state backend (e.g., file system, RocksDB, external databases) *due to misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in how Flink manages state*. This could happen due to misconfigured permissions *within Flink's state backend integration*, exposed network shares, or vulnerabilities in the state backend itself *as used by Flink*.

**Impact:**
*   **State Data Breach:** The attacker can access sensitive data stored in the application's state.
*   **State Tampering:** The attacker can modify the application's state, leading to incorrect application behavior, data corruption, or security breaches.
*   **Replay Attacks:** The attacker could potentially replay old states, causing the application to revert to a previous (potentially vulnerable) state.

**Affected Component:** State Backend (Storage mechanism, e.g., file system, RocksDB)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the state backend storage location with appropriate file system permissions or database access controls.
*   Encrypt state data at rest *using Flink's state backend encryption features or underlying storage encryption*.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the state backend.
*   Regularly audit access to the state backend.
*   Consider using a state backend with built-in security features.
