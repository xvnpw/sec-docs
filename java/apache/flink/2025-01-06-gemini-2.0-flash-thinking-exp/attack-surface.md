# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/flink

## Attack Surface: [Flink Web UI Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/flink_web_ui_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into the Flink Web UI, which are then executed by other users viewing the UI.
*   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink provides the Web UI and is responsible for sanitizing user-supplied data before rendering it. Failure to do so directly enables XSS attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a job with a malicious script embedded in its name. When an administrator views the job list in the Web UI, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise of users accessing the Web UI, leading to unauthorized actions on the Flink cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding on the server-side within the Flink Web UI codebase.
    *   Utilize templating engines with built-in XSS protection mechanisms within the Flink Web UI.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) within the Flink Web UI to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Flink REST API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/flink_rest_api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Flink REST API, allowing them to perform actions without proper authentication or by bypassing authorization checks.
*   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink implements the REST API and its authentication and authorization mechanisms. Vulnerabilities in this Flink-provided code lead to the bypass.
*   **Example:**  A bug in the Flink API's authentication logic allows an attacker to make requests without providing valid credentials, enabling them to submit or cancel jobs.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized control over the Flink cluster, including job submission, cancellation, and potentially accessing sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the Flink REST API (e.g., using secure tokens, mutual TLS) within Flink's codebase.
    *   Implement robust authorization checks within the Flink REST API to ensure users can only perform actions they are permitted to.
    *   Regularly review and audit the Flink API's authentication and authorization code for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Flink Job Submission Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/flink_job_submission_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flink's job submission process involves deserializing data. If this data originates from an untrusted source and contains malicious serialized objects, it can lead to remote code execution within Flink components.
*   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's architecture for job submission and management directly involves deserialization of job configurations or user-defined code. This Flink-specific process introduces the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious job submission payload containing a serialized object that, upon deserialization by the JobManager, executes arbitrary code on the JobManager's host.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the JobManager, potentially leading to complete control over the Flink cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources within Flink's job submission process.
    *   Implement object input stream filtering within Flink to restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
    *   Use secure serialization libraries within Flink and keep them updated.
    *   Consider alternative methods for job submission within Flink that don't rely on deserialization of arbitrary objects.

## Attack Surface: [Flink Configuration Exposure (High Risk Scenario)](./attack_surfaces/flink_configuration_exposure__high_risk_scenario_.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive configuration details of the Flink cluster are exposed, potentially revealing credentials or other information that can be used for further attacks. This scenario focuses on direct exposure due to Flink's handling of configuration.
*   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's method of handling and storing configuration files or environment variables can lead to exposure if not properly managed within the Flink deployment.
*   **Example:** Flink configuration files containing database credentials are stored with insufficient access controls on the JobManager or TaskManagers.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to connected systems, potential for privilege escalation within the Flink cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store sensitive Flink configuration data securely using secrets management tools.
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials in Flink configuration files.
    *   Implement proper access controls on Flink configuration files and directories on the servers where Flink is deployed.

## Attack Surface: [Flink User-Defined Function (UDF) Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/flink_user-defined_function__udf__code_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into User-Defined Functions (UDFs) that are then executed within the Flink cluster.
*   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's mechanism for allowing and executing user-defined functions is the direct contributor to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a job with a UDF that contains malicious code designed to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary commands on the TaskManagers.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on TaskManagers, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of UDF code within Flink before deployment.
    *   Enforce code review processes for UDFs.
    *   Run Flink components with the least privileges necessary.
    *   Consider using secure coding practices and sandboxing techniques for UDF execution within Flink.
