## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Flink Cluster --> Exploit JobManager Vulnerabilities --> Exploit Unauthenticated/Weakly Authenticated REST API --> Submit Malicious Job:](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_flink_cluster_--_exploit_jobmanager_vulnerabilities_--_exploit_unauthenticatedweakly__ba7f3fa3.md)

**Attack Vector Breakdown:** This path represents a direct and easily exploitable route to compromising the Flink cluster. It starts with the attacker identifying an unprotected or weakly protected REST API endpoint. They then leverage this lack of security to submit a malicious Flink job. This job, when executed by the cluster, can lead to arbitrary code execution on the TaskManagers, allowing the attacker to control the processing environment and potentially the underlying systems. The likelihood of this path is high due to the relative ease of exploiting unauthenticated APIs, and the impact is critical due to the potential for complete cluster compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Flink Cluster --> Exploit Misconfigurations --> Weak or Default Credentials for Flink UI/API --> Gain Administrative Access:](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_flink_cluster_--_exploit_misconfigurations_--_weak_or_default_credentials_for_flink_u_9184450f.md)

**Attack Vector Breakdown:** This path highlights the significant risk posed by insecure configurations. Attackers often scan for services using default or common credentials. If the Flink UI or API is configured with such credentials, gaining administrative access becomes trivial. This level of access grants the attacker complete control over the Flink cluster, allowing them to perform any administrative task, including submitting malicious jobs, accessing data, and potentially disrupting operations. The likelihood of this path depends on how often default credentials are used and not changed, but the impact is critically high due to the complete control gained.
