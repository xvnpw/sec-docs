# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/flink

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:**  Execution of arbitrary, malicious code within the Flink cluster (JobManager or TaskManagers) through job submission.
    *   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's *core purpose* is to execute user-provided code (JARs). This inherent functionality is the primary attack vector. Flink's distributed execution model amplifies the impact.
    *   **Example:** An attacker submits a JAR containing a reverse shell, providing remote control over a TaskManager.  A JAR uses reflection to bypass security restrictions and access system resources or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data exfiltration, data destruction, lateral movement within the network, potential for complete control of connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Review & Signing (Mandatory):**  Rigorous, mandatory code review for *all* submitted JARs.  Digitally sign JARs and *enforce* signature verification before execution. Maintain a whitelist of approved code/developers.
        *   **Authentication & Authorization (Job Submission - Mandatory):** Implement strong authentication (e.g., Kerberos, multi-factor authentication) and granular authorization to *strictly* control who can submit jobs. Integrate with external identity providers.
        *   **Resource Quotas:** Enforce strict resource limits (CPU, memory, network I/O) per job and per user/tenant to limit the damage a malicious job can inflict.
        *   **Limited Sandboxing:** Utilize Java Security Manager (despite deprecation, it provides *some* protection) and containerization (Docker) to isolate TaskManagers. *Note:* Perfect sandboxing of Java is extremely difficult.
        *   **Input Validation (within UDFs):** If User-Defined Functions (UDFs) accept external input, *rigorously* validate that input *within the UDF code* to prevent injection attacks *inside* the UDF.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious or poorly written job consumes excessive Flink cluster resources, preventing legitimate jobs from running or crashing the cluster.
    *   **How Flink Contributes:** Flink's distributed nature and ability to process large datasets, combined with its resource management, make it susceptible to resource exhaustion if not properly configured and monitored.
    *   **Example:** A job with an infinite loop or a job that allocates massive amounts of memory without releasing it. A job that opens too many network connections, exhausting Flink's connection pool.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate users, cluster instability, potential data loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Resource Quotas (Per Job/User - Mandatory):** Enforce *hard* limits on CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and disk I/O for each job and each user/tenant.
        *   **Job Monitoring & Alerting (Proactive):** Implement real-time monitoring of resource usage *within Flink*. Set up alerts to trigger when jobs exceed predefined thresholds. Automate job termination if necessary.
        *   **Backpressure Handling:** Ensure the application and Flink configuration are correctly handling backpressure to prevent cascading failures due to resource constraints.

## Attack Surface: [JobManager RPC Endpoint Exposure](./attack_surfaces/jobmanager_rpc_endpoint_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unprotected JobManager RPC endpoints allowing unauthorized job submission, cluster control, or data exfiltration.
    *   **How Flink Contributes:** The JobManager's RPC interface is the *primary control plane* for Flink. Exposure of this interface is a direct and critical Flink-related risk.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovering an exposed JobManager port and submitting a malicious job. An attacker using the RPC interface to query cluster status and extract sensitive information, or to terminate running jobs.
    *   **Impact:** Complete cluster compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, full control over Flink's operations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation (Critical):** Isolate the Flink cluster on a private network, preventing *direct* external access to the JobManager's RPC ports.
        *   **Authentication & Authorization (JobManager - Mandatory):** Enable and *strictly enforce* Flink's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms (Kerberos, custom plugins).
        *   **TLS Encryption (JobManager Communication - Mandatory):** Use TLS to encrypt *all* communication with the JobManager's RPC endpoints. Configure strong cipher suites.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow access to the JobManager's ports *only* from authorized clients (e.g., specific IP addresses or networks).

## Attack Surface: [State Backend Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/state_backend_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the state backend (e.g., RocksDB, HDFS) to access or modify application state.
    * **How Flink Contributes:** Flink *relies* on state backends to manage application state. The security of the chosen backend, and how Flink interacts with it, is a direct concern.
    * **Example:** An attacker gaining access to the RocksDB files on disk and extracting sensitive state data. An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in HDFS to modify the state stored there, corrupting application data.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, application manipulation, potential for complete application compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Encryption at Rest (State Backend):** If using a persistent state backend (like RocksDB), enable encryption at rest to protect the state data on disk.
        * **Access Control (Distributed State Backends):** If using a distributed state backend (e.g., HDFS), ensure proper access controls (e.g., HDFS permissions, Kerberos) are in place to prevent unauthorized access.  This is managed *through* Flink's configuration, making it a Flink-related concern.
        * **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the state backend storage (e.g., the HDFS cluster) from unauthorized network access.
        * **Regular Updates (State Backend):** Keep the state backend software (e.g., RocksDB, HDFS) up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Flink's configuration determines *which* backend is used, making this a Flink-specific concern.
