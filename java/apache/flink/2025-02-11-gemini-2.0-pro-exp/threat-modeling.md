# Threat Model Analysis for apache/flink

## Threat: [Malicious Deserialization in Custom Deserializers](./threats/malicious_deserialization_in_custom_deserializers.md)

*   **Threat:**  Malicious Deserialization in Custom Deserializers

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input data that exploits vulnerabilities in *custom* deserializers used by Flink to convert data from external sources (e.g., Kafka, files) into Java objects.  The attacker leverages known deserialization gadgets or finds new vulnerabilities in the custom deserializer code *specific to how Flink uses it*.        
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) within TaskManagers, allowing the attacker to take control of the Flink worker nodes, potentially escalating to the entire cluster. Data exfiltration, denial of service. This is *critical* because Flink's distributed nature amplifies the impact of RCE.    
    *   **Affected Flink Component:**  `org.apache.flink.api.common.serialization.DeserializationSchema` (and custom implementations thereof), TaskManagers (where deserialization occurs).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Custom Deserializers if Possible:** Prefer built-in, well-vetted Flink deserializers (e.g., Avro, JSON, Protobuf) whenever feasible. These are more thoroughly tested and less likely to contain Flink-specific vulnerabilities.
        *   **Rigorous Input Validation *Before* Deserialization:**  Implement strict schema validation and input sanitization *before* the data reaches the deserializer.  This limits the attacker's ability to inject malicious payloads that exploit Flink's handling of deserialized data.
        *   **Security Audits of Custom Deserializers:**  Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of any custom deserializer code, focusing on potential deserialization vulnerabilities *and how they interact with Flink's execution model*.
        *   **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If custom deserialization is unavoidable, use libraries designed to mitigate deserialization attacks (e.g., libraries that implement whitelisting of allowed classes), and ensure they are compatible with Flink's serialization framework.
        *   **Monitor for Deserialization Exceptions:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting for exceptions thrown during deserialization *within Flink's TaskManagers*, as these can indicate attempted exploits.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Job Submission via REST API](./threats/unauthorized_job_submission_via_rest_api.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unauthorized Job Submission via REST API

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Flink JobManager's REST API (typically exposed on port 8081 by default) without proper authentication. The attacker submits a malicious JAR file containing a Flink job designed to exploit vulnerabilities *within Flink itself* or to misuse Flink's capabilities for malicious purposes (e.g., launching distributed attacks, exfiltrating data processed by Flink).
    *   **Impact:**  Complete cluster compromise, RCE, data exfiltration, denial of service.  The attacker can run arbitrary code *within the Flink cluster's context*, leveraging Flink's distributed execution capabilities.
    *   **Affected Flink Component:**  JobManager's REST API (`org.apache.flink.runtime.webmonitor.WebMonitorEndpoint`), JobManager itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Authentication and Authorization:**  Configure Flink's security features to require authentication (e.g., Kerberos, basic auth via a reverse proxy) and authorization for *all* REST API access. This is a core Flink security feature.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the JobManager within a secure network segment, restricting access from untrusted networks.  Use firewalls to limit access to the REST API port, *specifically for Flink's internal communication*.
        *   **Disable the REST API if Not Needed:** If the REST API is not strictly required for your deployment (e.g., you're using a different deployment mode), disable it entirely to reduce the attack surface exposed by Flink.
        *   **Use a Reverse Proxy with Authentication:**  Place a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of the Flink Web UI and REST API to handle authentication and authorization, adding an extra layer of security *before* requests reach Flink.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Windowing (Flink-Specific Misconfiguration)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_windowing__flink-specific_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Windowing (Flink-Specific Misconfiguration)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a stream of data with keys that *exploit a misconfiguration in Flink's windowing logic*, causing windows to never close or to accumulate an excessive amount of state. This leverages Flink's state management mechanisms to cause a denial of service.  This is distinct from a general DoS; it's about misusing Flink's features.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) of the Flink application and potentially the entire cluster.  Application instability and data loss due to Flink's state management being overwhelmed.
    *   **Affected Flink Component:**  Flink's windowing mechanisms (`org.apache.flink.streaming.api.windowing`), State backends (e.g., RocksDB, HeapStateBackend), TaskManagers (where state is stored).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Appropriate Windowing Strategies:** Carefully choose windowing strategies (tumbling, sliding, session) and their parameters (size, slide, trigger) to ensure that windows close within a reasonable timeframe *based on the expected data characteristics and Flink's processing capabilities*.
        *   **Implement State Time-To-Live (TTL):**  Configure state TTL *within Flink* to automatically clear old state that is no longer needed, preventing unbounded state growth that could exhaust Flink's resources.
        *   **Monitor State Size:**  Continuously monitor the size of Flink's state *using Flink's metrics* and set alerts for excessive growth, indicating a potential misconfiguration or attack.
        *   **Use a Bounded State Backend:** Consider using a state backend that has built-in mechanisms for limiting state size (e.g., RocksDB with configured limits), leveraging Flink's options for managing state size.
        * **Use allowed lateness:** Configure allowed lateness for windows to handle late data and prevent it from accumulating indefinitely, a feature specific to Flink's windowing.

## Threat: [Checkpoint Corruption on Shared Storage (Targeting Flink's Recovery)](./threats/checkpoint_corruption_on_shared_storage__targeting_flink's_recovery_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Checkpoint Corruption on Shared Storage (Targeting Flink's Recovery)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the shared storage location used by Flink for checkpoints (e.g., HDFS, S3) and either deletes or corrupts the checkpoint files. This *specifically targets Flink's ability to recover from failures*, leading to data loss.
    *   **Impact:**  Data loss, application downtime.  Flink cannot restore its state after a failure, leading to data reprocessing or permanent data loss. This directly impacts Flink's fault tolerance.
    *   **Affected Flink Component:**  Flink's checkpointing mechanism (`org.apache.flink.runtime.checkpoint`), State backends, JobManager (coordinates checkpointing), shared storage system (HDFS, S3, etc.) *as used by Flink*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Checkpoint Storage:**  Use a secure storage location for checkpoints with restricted access controls (e.g., encrypted object storage, HDFS with Kerberos authentication), ensuring that only Flink has the necessary permissions.
        *   **Regular Backups of Checkpoints:**  Implement a backup strategy for Flink checkpoints to a separate, secure location to protect against accidental deletion or corruption. This is a backup of Flink's internal state.
        *   **Checksum Verification:**  Enable checksum verification *within Flink's checkpointing configuration* to detect corruption during storage or retrieval.
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Use ACLs on the shared storage to restrict write and delete access to *only the Flink JobManager and authorized services*, preventing unauthorized modification of Flink's checkpoints.
