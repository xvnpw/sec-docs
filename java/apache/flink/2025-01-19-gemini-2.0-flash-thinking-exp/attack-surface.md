# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/flink

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured JobManager REST API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_jobmanager_rest_api.md)

**Description:** The JobManager exposes a REST API for monitoring and managing Flink jobs and the cluster. Without proper authentication and authorization, this API can be accessed by unauthorized users.

**How Flink Contributes:** Flink provides this REST API as a core component for interaction and management. If security features are not enabled or configured correctly, it becomes a direct entry point.

**Example:** An attacker could use the API to submit malicious jobs, cancel running jobs, retrieve sensitive job configurations, or even reconfigure the cluster.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable and configure Flink's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms for the REST API.
*   Use HTTPS to encrypt communication with the REST API.
*   Restrict network access to the JobManager's REST API to authorized networks or IP addresses.
*   Regularly review and update API access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Web UI Vulnerabilities (JobManager)](./attack_surfaces/web_ui_vulnerabilities__jobmanager_.md)

**Description:** The Flink Web UI, hosted by the JobManager, provides a visual interface for monitoring and managing Flink applications. Vulnerabilities like XSS or CSRF can be present if the UI is not developed with security in mind.

**How Flink Contributes:** Flink provides this Web UI as a standard feature. Security vulnerabilities in the UI code directly expose the application.

**Example:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the Web UI, which could then steal user credentials or perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Flink version updated to benefit from security patches.
*   Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Web UI code.
*   Implement CSRF protection mechanisms.
*   Restrict access to the Web UI to authorized users and networks.
*   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection through User-Defined Functions (UDFs)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_through_user-defined_functions__udfs_.md)

**Description:** Flink allows users to submit custom code in the form of UDFs. If not properly sandboxed or validated, malicious code could be injected and executed on the TaskManagers.

**How Flink Contributes:** Flink's core functionality relies on the execution of user-provided code. The flexibility of UDFs introduces the risk of malicious code execution.

**Example:** A user could submit a UDF that attempts to access sensitive files on the TaskManager's file system or establish network connections to external systems.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for UDF parameters.
*   Utilize Flink's security features for user code execution, such as sandboxing or process isolation (if available and properly configured).
*   Enforce strict code review processes for user-submitted UDFs.
*   Limit the permissions of the user running the Flink TaskManager processes.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured RPC Communication Channels](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_rpc_communication_channels.md)

**Description:** Flink components (JobManager and TaskManagers) communicate via RPC. If these channels are not encrypted or authenticated, they are susceptible to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

**How Flink Contributes:** Flink's distributed architecture necessitates inter-process communication. The security of these communication channels is crucial.

**Example:** An attacker could intercept communication between the JobManager and a TaskManager to steal sensitive information or inject malicious commands.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable and configure encryption for RPC communication using TLS/SSL.
*   Utilize Flink's built-in authentication mechanisms for RPC endpoints.
*   Ensure proper network segmentation to limit access to RPC ports.

## Attack Surface: [Connector Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/connector_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flink relies on connectors to interact with external systems (e.g., Kafka, databases). Vulnerabilities in these connectors can be exploited to inject malicious data or gain unauthorized access to external systems.

**How Flink Contributes:** Flink's ability to integrate with various data sources and sinks depends on these connectors. Flink's attack surface expands with the vulnerabilities present in its connectors.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a JDBC connector could allow an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks on the connected database.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Flink connectors updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
*   Follow security best practices for configuring and using connectors, including proper authentication and authorization.
*   Sanitize and validate data being passed to and from connectors.
*   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of a compromised connector.

## Attack Surface: [State Backend Security](./attack_surfaces/state_backend_security.md)

**Description:** Flink's state backend stores the state of running applications. If the state backend is not properly secured, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive application data or manipulate the state.

**How Flink Contributes:** Flink's state management is a core feature. The security of the chosen state backend directly impacts the security of the Flink application.

**Example:** An attacker could access the state backend to steal sensitive data or modify the application's state to cause incorrect behavior.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Choose a state backend with robust security features.
*   Configure appropriate access controls for the state backend.
*   Encrypt data at rest in the state backend.
*   Secure the network communication between Flink and the state backend.
