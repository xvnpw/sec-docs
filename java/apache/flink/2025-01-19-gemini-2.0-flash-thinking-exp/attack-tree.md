## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Apache Flink [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_apache_flink__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a complete breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JobManager [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jobmanager__critical_node_.md)

The JobManager is the central coordinator. Compromising it grants significant control over the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Web UI -> Default Credentials Exploitation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_web_ui_-_default_credentials_exploitation__high_risk_.md)

Many Flink deployments might use default credentials if not properly configured. This provides immediate, high-impact access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Web UI Vulnerability -> Authentication/Authorization Bypass [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_web_ui_vulnerability_-_authenticationauthorization_bypass__high_risk_.md)

Circumventing security measures in the web UI to gain unauthorized access to functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JobManager REST API [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jobmanager_rest_api__critical_node_.md)

The JobManager also provides a REST API for programmatic interaction.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to REST API -> Default API Keys/Tokens Exploitation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_rest_api_-_default_api_keystokens_exploitation__high_risk_.md)

If API authentication is enabled but uses default or weak keys, attackers can easily gain access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerability -> Authentication/Authorization Bypass [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerability_-_authenticationauthorization_bypass__high_risk_.md)

Similar to the web UI, bypassing security checks in the REST API.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerability -> API Parameter Injection leading to code execution [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerability_-_api_parameter_injection_leading_to_code_execution__high_risk_.md)

Injecting malicious code or commands through API parameters that are not properly sanitized, leading to direct code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerability -> Deserialization Vulnerability in API requests [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerability_-_deserialization_vulnerability_in_api_requests__high_risk_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the API handles serialized data, potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Submit Malicious Job [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/submit_malicious_job__high_risk___critical_node_.md)

Attackers can submit specially crafted Flink jobs to the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code in User Code [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_in_user_code__high_risk_.md)

Embedding malicious code within the user-defined functions or operators of a Flink job. This code will be executed by the TaskManagers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerability in Job Submission [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerability_in_job_submission__high_risk_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the JobManager deserializes job configurations or other components during job submission, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TaskManager [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_taskmanager__critical_node_.md)

TaskManagers are the worker nodes responsible for executing tasks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TaskManager Vulnerability [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_taskmanager_vulnerability__high_risk_.md)

Directly exploiting vulnerabilities within the TaskManager process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in TaskManager process [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerability_in_taskmanager_process__high_risk_.md)

Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution on the TaskManager host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Container Escape vulnerability (if running in containers) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/container_escape_vulnerability__if_running_in_containers___high_risk_.md)

If Flink is running in containers, exploiting vulnerabilities to escape the container and gain access to the underlying host.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Management [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_management__critical_node_.md)

Flink applications often maintain state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access control issues on state backend storage [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/access_control_issues_on_state_backend_storage__high_risk_.md)

Gaining unauthorized access to the storage location of the state backend and manipulating the data directly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into State [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_state__high_risk_.md)

Compromising a component that writes to the state to inject malicious data, potentially triggering unintended actions or code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channels [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channels__critical_node_.md)

Flink components communicate with each other.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in RPC Framework [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_rpc_framework__high_risk_.md)

Flink uses RPC for inter-component communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization vulnerabilities in RPC messages [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_rpc_messages__high_risk_.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities in how RPC messages are serialized and deserialized, potentially leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication/Authorization bypass in RPC calls [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/authenticationauthorization_bypass_in_rpc_calls__high_risk_.md)

Circumventing security measures to make unauthorized RPC calls to Flink components.
