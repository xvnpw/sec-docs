# Threat Model Analysis for apache/flink

## Threat: [Malicious Job Submission](./threats/malicious_job_submission.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the JobManager's submission interface (e.g., REST API, command-line tools) and submits a crafted job. This job could contain malicious code designed to exploit vulnerabilities in TaskManagers *within the Flink framework*, access sensitive data processed by Flink, or disrupt the Flink cluster's operation. The attacker might leverage stolen credentials or exploit misconfigured access controls *within Flink*.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code on TaskManagers *due to Flink's execution environment*, data exfiltration *handled by Flink*, denial of service on the Flink cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** JobManager (Job Submission endpoint, Job Scheduling), TaskManagers (Task Execution).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for job submission *using Flink's security features*.
        *   Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for job parameters and code *at the Flink API level*.
        *   Utilize Flink's security features like secure user code deployment and resource management.
        *   Regularly audit job submissions and monitor for suspicious activity *within the Flink cluster*.

## Threat: [TaskManager Code Injection/Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/taskmanager_code_injectionremote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities *within Flink TaskManagers* or their dependencies *as used by Flink* to inject and execute arbitrary code. This could be achieved through deserialization vulnerabilities *in Flink's internal communication or state handling*, exploiting flaws in user-defined functions (UDFs) *within Flink's execution environment*, or leveraging vulnerabilities in connector libraries *directly integrated with Flink*. The attacker might aim to gain control of the TaskManager process, steal data processed by Flink, or disrupt Flink's operation.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the TaskManager process, data exfiltration *handled by Flink*, denial of service on the TaskManager.
    *   **Affected Component:** TaskManagers (Task Execution Environment, User Code Execution), Connectors *as part of the Flink framework*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Flink and all dependencies *distributed with Flink*, including connector libraries, up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for data processed by UDFs *within the Flink application*.
        *   Enforce strong security policies for user code deployment and execution *within the Flink cluster*.

## Threat: [State Tampering](./threats/state_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Flink's state backend (e.g., file system, database, RocksDB) and modifies the stored state. This could involve altering intermediate results, checkpoint data, or savepoints *managed by Flink*. The attacker might aim to manipulate application logic *within Flink*, cause incorrect outputs, or disrupt recovery processes *managed by Flink*.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption *within Flink's state*, inconsistent application behavior, incorrect results, failure to recover from failures *within the Flink application*.
    *   **Affected Component:** State Backend (File System State Backend, RocksDB State Backend, Memory State Backend), Checkpointing mechanism, Savepoint mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the state backend with appropriate access controls and authentication *at the storage level*.
        *   Encrypt the state data at rest and in transit *using Flink's state encryption features or underlying storage encryption*.
        *   Implement integrity checks for state data to detect tampering *within the Flink application*.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Flink Web UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_flink_web_ui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Flink Web UI due to weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the Flink Web UI itself*. This allows the attacker to view sensitive information about running jobs, cluster configuration, and potentially perform administrative actions like cancelling jobs or modifying configurations *through the Flink Web UI*.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure *via the Flink Web UI*, ability to disrupt Flink operations, potential for further attacks based on exposed information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flink Web UI (Authentication, Authorization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce authentication for the Flink Web UI (e.g., using Flink's built-in security or integrating with external authentication providers).
        *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles *within the Flink Web UI*.
        *   Ensure the web UI is served over HTTPS to protect credentials in transit.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Flink Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_flink_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network communication between Flink components (JobManager, TaskManagers, clients) to eavesdrop on sensitive data or inject malicious messages. This is possible if *Flink's internal* communication channels are not properly encrypted. The attacker might steal credentials *used by Flink components*, manipulate job execution, or disrupt the cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches *in Flink's internal communication*, manipulation of Flink operations, potential for denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  RPC communication between JobManager and TaskManagers, Client-to-Cluster communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all internal Flink communication channels (RPC).
        *   Use strong authentication mechanisms for inter-component communication *within Flink*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) on JobManager](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__on_jobmanager.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the JobManager with requests or exploits resource-intensive operations *within Flink's job submission or management processes*, making it unavailable for managing jobs. This could be achieved by submitting a large number of small jobs, exploiting vulnerabilities in job submission *within Flink*, or flooding the JobManager's network interface.
    *   **Impact:** Inability to submit or manage Flink jobs, disruption of data processing pipelines, potential for cascading failures.
    *   **Affected Component:** JobManager (Job Submission, Resource Management, Network Interface).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on JobManager endpoints *within Flink*.
        *   Enforce resource quotas and limits for submitted jobs *within Flink's configuration*.
        *   Monitor JobManager resource utilization and set up alerts for anomalies.

## Threat: [Connector Vulnerabilities Leading to External System Compromise *via Flink*](./threats/connector_vulnerabilities_leading_to_external_system_compromise_via_flink.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Flink connectors to interact with external systems in an unauthorized manner *through Flink*. This could involve SQL injection in database connectors *used by Flink*, path traversal in file system connectors *used by Flink*, or exploiting authentication weaknesses in other external system connectors *integrated with Flink*. The attacker might gain access to sensitive data in external systems or compromise those systems *by leveraging Flink's access*.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches in connected external systems, compromise of external systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Flink Connectors (specific connector implementations, e.g., Kafka Connector, JDBC Connector).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the latest versions of Flink connectors with known security vulnerabilities patched.
        *   Implement secure configuration practices for connectors, including secure credential management *within Flink's connector configuration*.
        *   Enforce strict input validation and sanitization when interacting with external systems through connectors *within the Flink application logic*.
