# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/logging-log4j2

## Mitigation Strategy: [Upgrade Log4j 2 Library](./mitigation_strategies/upgrade_log4j_2_library.md)

*   **1. Mitigation Strategy:** Upgrade Log4j 2 Library

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Dependencies:** Use dependency management tools (Maven: `mvn dependency:tree`, Gradle, etc.) to find all direct and transitive uses of Log4j 2.
        2.  **Check Current Version:** Determine the exact version(s) of Log4j 2 currently in use.
        3.  **Identify Latest Secure Version:** Refer to the official Apache Log4j 2 security page ([https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)) for the latest secure version compatible with your Java environment (Java 6, 7, 8+).
        4.  **Update Dependency Declarations:** Modify your project's build files (e.g., `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`) to explicitly require the latest secure version of Log4j 2. Update *all* instances.
        5.  **Resolve Conflicts:** Address any dependency conflicts.  You may need to exclude older, vulnerable versions of Log4j 2 brought in by other libraries and force the use of the newer version.
        6.  **Rebuild and Test:** Rebuild the application and execute comprehensive automated and manual tests.  Focus on logging functionality and overall application stability.
        7.  **Deploy:** Deploy the updated application to all environments.
        8.  **Monitor:** Monitor application logs and performance post-deployment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell):** Remote Code Execution (RCE) - **Critical Severity**.  Patched versions remove the vulnerable JNDI lookup functionality.
        *   **CVE-2021-45046:** Denial of Service (DoS) and limited RCE (non-default configurations) - **High Severity**.  Addressed by further updates.
        *   **CVE-2021-45105:** Denial of Service (DoS) - **High Severity**.  Fixed in later versions.
        *   **Other Vulnerabilities:**  Upgrading addresses any other known and patched security issues.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (eliminated).
        *   **CVE-2021-45046:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.
        *   **CVE-2021-45105:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.
        *   **Other Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `service-a` upgraded to 2.17.1. `reporting-module` remains at 2.14.1.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Upgrade `reporting-module`. Verify all third-party libraries use secure Log4j 2 versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable JNDI Lookups](./mitigation_strategies/disable_jndi_lookups.md)

*   **2. Mitigation Strategy:** Disable JNDI Lookups

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Deployment Method:** Determine how the application is started (standalone JAR, WAR, container, etc.).
        2.  **JVM Argument (Preferred):** Add `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to the Java command line.  This is the most reliable method.  The specific steps depend on the deployment:
            *   **Standalone JAR:** Modify the startup script.
            *   **Application Server (Tomcat, etc.):** Update server configuration files (e.g., `setenv.sh`, `catalina.properties`).
            *   **Docker:** Add to `JAVA_OPTS` in the Dockerfile or docker-compose file.
        3.  **Environment Variable (Alternative):** Set the environment variable `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`. Less reliable than JVM arguments.
        4.  **Programmatic Setting (Least Reliable):**  As a last resort, attempt: `System.setProperty("log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups", "true");` in the application code.  This may be too late to be effective.
        5.  **Verification:** *Crucially*, verify the setting is active. Check logs for messages indicating lookups are disabled, or attempt a JNDI lookup (in a controlled environment) to confirm failure.
        6.  **Apply Consistently:** Ensure this setting is applied to *all* application instances and dependencies.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell):** Remote Code Execution (RCE) - **Critical Severity**.  Disables the core vulnerable functionality.
        *   **CVE-2021-45046:** DoS and limited RCE - **High Severity**.  Also mitigated.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (significantly reduced, but not eliminated if misconfigured or if older Log4j 2 versions don't fully respect the setting).
        *   **CVE-2021-45046:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **CVE-2021-45105:** Not directly mitigated.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Implement as a defense-in-depth measure across all components, especially `reporting-module`. Add the JVM argument to startup scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Remove `JndiLookup` Class](./mitigation_strategies/remove__jndilookup__class.md)

*   **3. Mitigation Strategy:** Remove `JndiLookup` Class

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Locate JAR Files:** Find all JAR files containing the Log4j 2 core library (`log4j-core-*.jar`).
        2.  **Backup:** *Always* create backups of the original JAR files before modification.
        3.  **Remove the Class:** Use the `zip` command (or equivalent on Windows) to delete the `JndiLookup.class` file:
            ```bash
            zip -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
            ```
            Repeat for *every* relevant JAR file.
        4.  **Replace Original JAR:** Replace the original `log4j-core-*.jar` files with the modified versions.
        5.  **Test Thoroughly:**  Extensively test the application to ensure correct functionality.  Focus on any areas that might have (unusually) used JNDI.
        6.  **Document:**  Clearly document this non-standard modification.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell):** Remote Code Execution (RCE) - **Critical Severity**.  Removes the vulnerable code entirely.
        *   **CVE-2021-45046:** DoS and limited RCE - **High Severity**.  Also mitigated.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228:** Risk reduced from Critical to Negligible (eliminated).
        *   **CVE-2021-45046:** Risk reduced from High to Negligible.
        *   **CVE-2021-45105:** Not directly mitigated.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** No. Last resort.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider for `reporting-module` only if upgrading is impossible. Upgrading is strongly preferred.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Logging of User-Controlled Input (Log4j2 configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_logging_of_user-controlled_input__log4j2_configuration_.md)

*   **4. Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Logging of User-Controlled Input (Log4j2 configuration)

    *   **Description:**
        1. **Review Log4j2 Configuration:** Examine your `log4j2.xml` (or other configuration file format) to identify patterns and appenders.
        2. **Modify Patterns:** Adjust the patterns used in your appenders (especially `PatternLayout`) to avoid logging potentially dangerous input directly.  For example, instead of logging the entire message (`%m`), consider logging only specific, sanitized parts of the message.  Use custom message objects or structured logging to control what gets logged.
        3. **Use Filters:** Implement Log4j 2 filters to selectively filter out log events based on their content.  You could create a custom filter that checks for potentially malicious patterns (like `${jndi:`) and prevents those events from being logged.  This is more robust than just modifying the pattern.
        4. **Context Map Filtering:** If you're using the Thread Context Map (MDC), be *very* careful about what you put in the MDC, as it's often included in log messages.  Avoid putting user-supplied data directly into the MDC.
        5. **Test Configuration Changes:** After making any changes to your Log4j 2 configuration, thoroughly test to ensure that logging still works as expected and that the changes effectively mitigate the risk.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell):** Remote Code Execution (RCE) - **Critical Severity**. Reduces the attack surface by controlling what data is processed by Log4j 2's vulnerable components.
        *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Can help mitigate other injection attacks that might leverage logging.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **CVE-2021-44228:** Risk reduced from Critical to High (reduces the likelihood of triggering the vulnerability, but doesn't eliminate it).
        *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Reduces risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Some patterns have been reviewed, but a comprehensive review of the Log4j 2 configuration and the implementation of filters are needed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  A full review of `log4j2.xml` is required.  Custom filters should be implemented to specifically check for and block potentially malicious log messages.  The use of the MDC needs to be carefully reviewed.
