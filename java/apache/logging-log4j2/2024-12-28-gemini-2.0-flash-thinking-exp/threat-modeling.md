### High and Critical Log4j2 Threats

Here's a list of high and critical security threats that directly involve the Apache Log4j2 library:

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution via JNDI Lookups (Log4Shell)
    *   **Description:** An attacker can craft malicious input that, when processed by Log4j2, triggers a lookup to a remote server via JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface). This allows the attacker to control the response from the remote server, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server running the application. The vulnerability lies within Log4j2's message formatting functionality where it attempts to resolve expressions using various lookup mechanisms, including JNDI.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, including data breach, malware installation, denial of service, and lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Recursive Lookups
    *   **Description:** An attacker can craft log messages or configuration patterns that cause Log4j2's lookup mechanism to enter an infinite loop or excessively deep recursion. This consumes significant server resources (CPU, memory), leading to performance degradation or complete service unavailability. The vulnerability resides in how Log4j2 handles nested or circular references within its lookup expressions.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, potentially leading to service disruption and financial losses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
