# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/rocketmq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Topic Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/enable_access_control_lists__acls__for_topic_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable ACL feature:** In RocketMQ broker configuration files (`broker.conf`), set `aclEnable=true`. Restart brokers for changes to take effect.
        2.  **Configure ACL rules:** Define ACL rules in `plain_acl.yml` (or configure a custom ACL provider). Rules specify permissions (READ, WRITE, DENY) for users/groups on specific resources (topics, groups).
        3.  **Apply rules to topics:**  For each sensitive topic, define rules that restrict WRITE access to authorized producers and READ access to authorized consumer groups only. Use wildcard characters for topic patterns if needed.
        4.  **Apply default deny policy:**  Ensure a default deny policy is in place so that any access not explicitly allowed is denied. This is crucial for security.
        5.  **Test ACL configuration:** Thoroughly test ACL rules in a staging environment to ensure they function as expected and do not disrupt legitimate application functionality.
        6.  **Regularly review and update ACLs:**  Periodically review and update ACL rules as application requirements and user roles change.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Topic Access (High): Prevents unauthorized producers from sending messages to topics they shouldn't access.
        *   Data Breach (High): Prevents unauthorized consumers from reading sensitive data from topics they are not permitted to access.
        *   Data Tampering (Medium): Reduces the risk of unauthorized modification of messages by restricting write access.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Topic Access: High - Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   Data Breach: High - Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   Data Tampering: Medium - Reduces the risk, but doesn't prevent authorized users from tampering.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** ACL is enabled on production brokers and configured for key sensitive topics like `user_data` and `payment_events`. ACL rules are defined in `plain_acl.yml` and managed within the infrastructure repository.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** ACL is not fully enforced in development and staging environments.  ACL rules need to be extended to cover consumer groups and administrative operations.  Consider migrating to a more robust ACL provider than `plain_acl.yml` for better management and scalability.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS/SSL Encryption for Broker-Client Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tlsssl_encryption_for_broker-client_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Generate TLS/SSL certificates:** Obtain or generate TLS/SSL certificates for brokers and clients (producers/consumers). Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) for production environments.
        2.  **Configure Broker for TLS/SSL:** In `broker.conf`, configure TLS/SSL related properties: `sslEnable=true`, `sslKeyStorePath`, `sslKeyStorePass`, `sslTrustStorePath`, `sslTrustStorePass`. Specify paths to keystore and truststore files containing certificates and keys.
        3.  **Configure Nameserver for TLS/SSL (if applicable):** If nameserver also needs TLS (e.g., for management UI), configure TLS settings in `namesrv.conf` similarly.
        4.  **Configure Clients for TLS/SSL:** In producer and consumer code, configure TLS/SSL settings to connect to brokers using TLS. This typically involves setting system properties or using client configuration objects to specify truststore paths and enable TLS.
        5.  **Enforce TLS-only connections:** Configure brokers to reject non-TLS connections. This might involve specific broker configuration settings or firewall rules.
        6.  **Test TLS/SSL connectivity:** Thoroughly test TLS/SSL connections between clients and brokers in a staging environment to ensure proper encryption and certificate validation.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data in Transit Interception (High): Prevents eavesdropping and interception of message data and sensitive information (like credentials) during transmission between clients and brokers.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High):  Reduces the risk of MitM attacks where attackers intercept and potentially modify communication.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data in Transit Interception: High - Effectively eliminates the risk of passive eavesdropping.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: High - Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring communication integrity and authenticity (with proper certificate validation).

    *   **Currently Implemented:** TLS/SSL is enabled for production brokers and clients. Certificates are managed by the infrastructure team and automatically deployed. Client libraries are configured to use TLS by default in production profiles.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** TLS/SSL is not consistently enforced in development and staging environments.  Need to ensure all environments utilize TLS for client-broker communication.  Consider implementing mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger client authentication in the future.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Resource Quotas and Limits on Brokers](./mitigation_strategies/configure_resource_quotas_and_limits_on_brokers.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Define resource limits:** Determine appropriate limits for message size, message consumption rates, producer sending rates, queue depths, and topic sizes based on system capacity and expected traffic.
        2.  **Configure broker properties:** In `broker.conf`, configure properties related to resource limits. Examples include `maxMessageSize`, `maxConsumerRate`, `maxProducerRate`, `maxQueueDepth`, `maxTopicSize`. Refer to RocketMQ documentation for specific property names and configuration details.
        3.  **Apply limits to specific topics or groups (if possible):** Some resource limits can be configured per topic or consumer group. Utilize these features to fine-tune limits based on specific needs.
        4.  **Monitor resource usage:** Implement monitoring for broker resource utilization (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O) to observe the impact of configured limits and identify potential bottlenecks.
        5.  **Adjust limits as needed:**  Continuously monitor system performance and adjust resource limits as application traffic patterns and system capacity evolve.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion (High): Prevents malicious or accidental resource exhaustion attacks by limiting message sizes, rates, and queue depths.
        *   Broker Instability (Medium):  Reduces the risk of broker instability and performance degradation due to excessive message traffic or resource consumption.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion: High - Significantly reduces the risk of basic resource exhaustion DoS attacks.
        *   Broker Instability: Medium - Improves broker stability under heavy load and reduces the impact of traffic spikes.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic message size limits (`maxMessageSize`) are configured on production brokers. Monitoring is in place for CPU and memory usage.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  More granular resource limits (consumer/producer rates, queue depths, topic sizes) are not fully configured.  Need to implement comprehensive resource quotas and limits, especially for high-traffic topics and consumer groups.  Explore dynamic rate limiting based on real-time broker load.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure RocketMQ Configuration Files and Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rocketmq_configuration_files_and_access.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Restrict file system permissions:** Set file system permissions on RocketMQ configuration files (`broker.conf`, `namesrv.conf`, `plain_acl.yml`, etc.) to restrict read and write access to only the RocketMQ process user and authorized administrators.
        2.  **Secure configuration management:** Store configuration files in a secure location, such as a version control system with access controls (e.g., Git with restricted branch access).
        3.  **Avoid storing secrets in plain text:** Do not store sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or TLS/SSL private keys directly in configuration files. Use environment variables, secure configuration management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
        4.  **Regularly audit configuration:** Periodically review RocketMQ configuration settings to ensure they are aligned with security best practices and application requirements.
        5.  **Implement configuration change management:** Establish a process for managing and auditing changes to RocketMQ configuration files. Use version control and code review for configuration changes.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Configuration (High): Prevents unauthorized users from modifying critical RocketMQ configurations, potentially leading to security breaches or system instability.
        *   Exposure of Secrets (High): Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive credentials or keys stored in configuration files.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized Access to Configuration: High - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized configuration changes.
        *   Exposure of Secrets: High - Significantly reduces the risk of exposing secrets if proper secret management is implemented.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Configuration files are stored in a private Git repository with access controls. File system permissions are set to restrict access on production servers.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Secrets are still partially managed using environment variables, which can be less secure than dedicated secret management solutions.  Need to migrate to a dedicated secret management system (e.g., Vault) for storing and managing sensitive configuration parameters.  Implement automated configuration auditing and drift detection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update RocketMQ and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_rocketmq_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Track RocketMQ releases:** Subscribe to RocketMQ security mailing lists or monitor release notes for security updates and patches.
        2.  **Establish update process:** Define a process for regularly updating RocketMQ brokers, nameservers, and client libraries. Include testing in a staging environment before deploying updates to production.
        3.  **Dependency scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in RocketMQ dependencies (e.g., Log4j, Netty).
        4.  **Update dependencies:** Regularly update RocketMQ dependencies to address identified vulnerabilities. Follow RocketMQ upgrade guides and compatibility notes.
        5.  **Automate updates (where possible):** Explore automating RocketMQ and dependency updates using infrastructure-as-code tools and CI/CD pipelines, while ensuring proper testing and rollback mechanisms.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High): Prevents attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities in RocketMQ or its dependencies that are addressed by security updates.
        *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium): Reduces the attack surface and improves overall security posture, making it harder to exploit even unknown vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High - Significantly reduces the risk by patching known vulnerabilities.
        *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Medium - Improves overall security posture and reduces the likelihood of successful exploitation.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** RocketMQ version updates are performed manually on a quarterly basis. Dependency scanning is not fully automated.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to automate dependency scanning and integrate it into the CI/CD pipeline.  Implement a more frequent and automated RocketMQ update process, potentially using rolling updates for brokers to minimize downtime.  Establish a clear process for responding to security advisories and patching vulnerabilities promptly.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Monitor Audit Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_monitor_audit_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable audit logging:** Configure RocketMQ brokers and nameservers to enable audit logging. Refer to RocketMQ documentation for specific configuration properties to enable audit logs.
        2.  **Configure log levels:** Set appropriate log levels for audit logs to capture relevant security events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization decisions, administrative actions).
        3.  **Centralize log collection:** Integrate RocketMQ audit logs with a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Graylog).
        4.  **Implement log monitoring and alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerting rules on the centralized logging system to detect suspicious activity or security incidents based on audit log events.
        5.  **Regularly review audit logs:** Periodically review audit logs to identify potential security issues, misconfigurations, or unauthorized activities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Security Incident Detection (High): Improves the ability to detect and respond to security incidents by providing visibility into security-related events.
        *   Unauthorized Activity Detection (Medium): Helps identify unauthorized access attempts, configuration changes, or other suspicious activities.
        *   Post-Incident Forensics (Medium): Provides valuable data for post-incident analysis and forensics investigations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Security Incident Detection: High - Significantly improves incident detection capabilities.
        *   Unauthorized Activity Detection: Medium - Provides a mechanism for detecting suspicious activities.
        *   Post-Incident Forensics: Medium - Enhances forensic capabilities after a security incident.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic audit logging is enabled on production brokers. Logs are collected by a centralized logging system.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Log levels are not finely tuned for security auditing.  Monitoring and alerting rules based on audit logs are not fully implemented.  Need to enhance audit logging configuration, implement robust monitoring and alerting, and establish a process for regular audit log review.
