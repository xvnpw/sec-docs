# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/rocketmq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Enforce Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_enforce_authentication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Nameserver Authentication:** In `namesrv.conf`, set `rocketmq.namesrv.authEnable=true`.
    2.  **Configure Broker Authentication:** In `broker.conf`, set `aclEnable=true` to activate ACL-based authentication.
    3.  **Create Access Keys:** Generate AccessKey and SecretKey pairs for clients (producers, consumers, admin tools).
    4.  **Client-Side Configuration:** Configure clients to use authentication by providing AccessKey and SecretKey during initialization (e.g., using `accessKey` and `secretKey` properties in Java clients).
    5.  **Test Authentication:** Verify that only clients with valid credentials can connect and operate.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized clients from interacting with RocketMQ.
        *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk by limiting access to message data.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Mitigates DoS from unauthorized clients.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** High reduction.
        *   **Data Breaches:** Medium reduction.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium reduction.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented (Development environment uses basic placeholder authentication).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Production Environment: Full authentication enforcement needed.
        *   Stronger Mechanism: Transition to ACL or robust provider integration.
        *   Secure Key Management: Implement secure key storage and rotation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using ACLs](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__using_acls.md)

    3.  **Define Roles:** Identify application roles (producer, consumer, admin).
    4.  **Assign Permissions:** Map roles to ACL rules (e.g., producer role -> PUB on topic X).
    5.  **Apply ACLs to Users:** Assign roles/ACLs to users/applications via AccessKeys.

        *   **Privilege Escalation:** High reduction.
        *   **Data Breaches:** Medium reduction (incremental to authentication).
        *   **Insider Threats:** Medium reduction.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented (Basic ACLs for development topics).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Granular ACLs: Implement for production topics/groups based on roles.
