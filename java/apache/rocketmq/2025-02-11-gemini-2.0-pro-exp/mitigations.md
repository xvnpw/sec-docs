# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/rocketmq

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication and Authorization (ACL)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication_and_authorization__acl_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable ACL:** In the `broker.conf` file, set `aclEnable=true`.
2.  **Define Permissions:** Create a `plain_acl.yml` file (or use your chosen ACL provider). Define roles (e.g., `producerRole`, `consumerRole`, `adminRole`).  For each role, specify permissions:
    *   `topic`: The topic name (or wildcard pattern).
    *   `access`:  `PUB` (publish), `SUB` (subscribe), `DENY` (no access), or combinations (e.g., `PUB|SUB`).
    *   `default`:  `true` or `false` (whether this is the default permission for this topic).
3.  **Create Users:**  In the same `plain_acl.yml` file, define users and assign them to roles.  Set strong, unique passwords for each user.  Example:
    ```yaml
    accounts:
      - accessKey: producerUser
        secretKey: StrongProducerPassword!
        whiteRemoteAddress: 192.168.1.0/24  # Restrict by IP (optional)
        admin: false
        defaultTopicPerm: DENY
        defaultGroupPerm: DENY
        topicPerms:
          - topic: MyTopic
            perm: PUB
      - accessKey: consumerUser
        secretKey: StrongConsumerPassword!
        # ... (similar configuration for consumer)
    ```
4.  **Configure Clients:**  In your producer and consumer code, configure the `accessKey` and `secretKey` to match the credentials defined in the ACL file.  Use the RocketMQ client libraries' authentication mechanisms.
5.  **Regular Review:**  At least quarterly, review the ACL configuration to ensure it still aligns with the principle of least privilege.  Remove unused users and roles.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Brokers/NameServers (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized users from connecting to and interacting with the RocketMQ cluster.
    *   **Unauthorized Message Production (Severity: High):**  Prevents unauthorized clients from publishing messages to topics.
    *   **Unauthorized Message Consumption (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized clients from subscribing to and consuming messages from topics.
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized users from performing administrative operations (e.g., creating/deleting topics, managing brokers).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low* (assuming strong passwords and regular review).
    *   **Unauthorized Production/Consumption:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Unauthorized Administration:** Risk reduced from *Critical* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   ACL is enabled in `broker.conf`.
    *   Basic `plain_acl.yml` file exists with producer and consumer roles.
    *   Producer and consumer clients are configured with credentials.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   IP-based restrictions (`whiteRemoteAddress`) are not yet implemented in the ACL file.
    *   Regular quarterly reviews of the ACL configuration are not yet formalized in a documented process.
    *   Admin role and users are not yet defined, relying on default broker permissions (which should be disabled).

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/SSL Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/tlsssl_encryption.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Obtain Certificates:** Obtain TLS/SSL certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  Avoid self-signed certificates in production.
2.  **Configure Brokers:**
    *   In `broker.conf`, set `sslEnable=true`.
    *   Specify the paths to the certificate file (`ssl.server.certPath`), private key file (`ssl.server.keyPath`), and CA certificate file (`ssl.server.trustCertPath`).
    *   Configure other SSL-related settings as needed (e.g., `ssl.server.needClientAuth` to require client certificates).
3.  **Configure NameServers:**
    *   Similar to brokers, configure SSL settings in `namesrv.conf`.
4.  **Configure Clients:**
    *   In your producer and consumer code, enable SSL and configure the paths to the client certificate (if required), private key, and CA certificate.  Use the RocketMQ client libraries' SSL configuration options.
    *   Ensure clients are configured to verify the server's certificate.
5.  **Certificate Renewal:**  Establish a process for renewing certificates before they expire.  Automate this process if possible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Network Eavesdropping (Severity: High):** Encrypts all communication between clients and brokers, and between brokers and NameServers, preventing attackers from intercepting and reading message data.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Severity: High):**  Certificate verification prevents attackers from impersonating a RocketMQ broker or NameServer.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Network Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   TLS/SSL is enabled in `broker.conf` and `namesrv.conf`.
    *   Certificates are obtained from a trusted CA.
    *   Producer and consumer clients are configured to use SSL.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Client certificate authentication (`ssl.server.needClientAuth`) is not yet enabled.  This would provide an additional layer of security.
    *   An automated certificate renewal process is not yet in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [RocketMQ Built-in Flow Control (Rate Limiting - Client Side)](./mitigation_strategies/rocketmq_built-in_flow_control__rate_limiting_-_client_side_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Java Client Example:**
    *   Use the `DefaultMQProducer.setSendMessageFlowControl(int permits)` method to set the maximum number of permits (messages) that can be sent concurrently.
    *   Adjust this value based on testing and monitoring of broker performance and message throughput.  Start with a conservative value and increase it gradually.
2. **Other Client Libraries:** Consult the documentation for your specific RocketMQ client library to find equivalent flow control settings.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Severity: High):** Helps prevent a single producer from overwhelming the RocketMQ brokers with messages, although it's less effective against distributed DoS attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Attacks:** Risk reduced from *High* to *Medium* (this is a partial mitigation and should be combined with other DoS defenses).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `sendMessageFlowControl` setting (or its equivalent in other client libraries) needs to be configured and tuned.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Up-to-Date (Patching RocketMQ)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_up-to-date__patching_rocketmq_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Subscribe to Notifications:** Subscribe to the Apache RocketMQ security mailing list and monitor the official website for security advisories.
2.  **Establish a Patching Process:**
    *   Define a process for testing and deploying RocketMQ updates, especially security patches.
    *   Include a rollback plan in case of issues.
    *   Prioritize security patches and apply them as soon as possible.
3.  **Automate (If Possible):**  Automate the patching process as much as possible to reduce the time to apply updates. This might involve using configuration management tools or container orchestration platforms.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, potentially Critical):**  Addresses vulnerabilities in RocketMQ itself that could be exploited by attackers. The severity depends on the specific vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly, depending on the promptness of patching.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Team members are subscribed to the RocketMQ security mailing list.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal, documented patching process is not yet in place.
    *   Patching is currently done manually and is not automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logs (RocketMQ Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logs__rocketmq_configuration_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Enable Detailed Logging:** Configure RocketMQ's logging levels to capture sufficient detail for auditing. This typically involves modifying the `logback.xml` (or equivalent) configuration file used by RocketMQ.
    2. **Configure Log Appenders:** Ensure that logs are written to a persistent and secure location. Consider using a dedicated logging service or centralized logging infrastructure.
    3. **Log Rotation and Retention:** Implement log rotation to prevent log files from growing indefinitely. Define a retention policy to keep logs for a sufficient period for auditing and investigation purposes.
    4. **Log Key Events:** Ensure that the following events are logged:
        * Authentication attempts (successes and failures)
        * Authorization decisions (access granted or denied)
        * Topic creation and deletion
        * Broker configuration changes
        * Message production and consumption (optionally, with details like client IP addresses and message IDs â€“ be mindful of privacy and performance implications)
    5. **Regular Review:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing audit logs, either manually or using automated log analysis tools.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Detection of Unauthorized Access (Severity: High):** Provides a record of authentication and authorization events, allowing for the detection of unauthorized access attempts.
    * **Detection of Malicious Activity (Severity: Variable):** Helps identify suspicious patterns of activity, such as unusual message rates or access from unexpected sources.
    * **Forensic Analysis (Severity: High):** Provides crucial information for investigating security incidents and understanding the scope of a compromise.

* **Impact:**
    * **Detection:** Improves the ability to detect and respond to security incidents.
    * **Forensics:** Enables more effective forensic analysis after an incident.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic RocketMQ logging is enabled.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Detailed audit logging, specifically capturing authentication and authorization events, is not fully configured.
    * Log rotation and retention policies are not yet formally defined.
    * Regular log review is not yet part of a documented process.
