# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/rocketmq

## Attack Surface: [NameServer Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/nameserver_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the NameServer with requests, consuming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and making it unavailable.
*   **RocketMQ Contribution:** The NameServer is a central, single point of failure (by design, though clustering mitigates this). Its exposed network port and *RocketMQ-specific* request handling logic are attackable.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends thousands of `registerBroker` requests per second (a RocketMQ-specific operation), overwhelming the NameServer.
*   **Impact:** Complete disruption of the RocketMQ cluster; producers and consumers cannot discover brokers, halting message flow.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting (RocketMQ Configuration):** Implement strict rate limiting on NameServer requests, configurable within RocketMQ's settings, both globally and per client IP.
    *   **Request Validation (RocketMQ Code):** Ensure RocketMQ's internal code thoroughly validates all NameServer requests, rejecting malformed or suspicious requests *specific to RocketMQ protocols*.
    *   **Resource Monitoring (RocketMQ Metrics):** Monitor NameServer resource usage using RocketMQ's built-in metrics and set alerts.
    *   **NameServer Clustering (RocketMQ Deployment):** Deploy multiple NameServer instances, a standard RocketMQ deployment practice.
    *   **Firewall Rules (Targeting RocketMQ Port):** Use firewall rules to restrict access to the NameServer's port (default: 9876) â€“ specifically targeting the RocketMQ service.

## Attack Surface: [Broker Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/broker_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm a Broker with a high volume of messages or connections, exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, disk space, network).
*   **RocketMQ Contribution:** Brokers are the core message storage and delivery components *within RocketMQ*. Their exposed ports and *RocketMQ-specific* message handling logic are attackable.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends millions of large messages to a specific topic, filling the Broker's disk space (managed by RocketMQ's storage engine).
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for clients using the affected Broker; potential message loss.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Message Size Limits (RocketMQ Configuration):** Enforce maximum message size limits within RocketMQ's configuration.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Producer Side, RocketMQ Client):** Implement rate limiting on the producer side using the RocketMQ client library's features.
    *   **Connection Limits (RocketMQ Configuration):** Limit the number of concurrent connections to the Broker, configurable within RocketMQ.
    *   **Resource Monitoring (RocketMQ Metrics):** Monitor Broker resource usage via RocketMQ's built-in metrics.
    *   **Disk Quotas (Managed by RocketMQ):** Utilize RocketMQ's internal mechanisms (if available) to manage disk space allocation for topics/queues.
    *   **Broker Clustering (RocketMQ Deployment):** Deploy multiple Broker instances, a standard RocketMQ deployment practice.
    *   **Flow Control (RocketMQ Feature):** Utilize RocketMQ's built-in flow control mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Message Production/Consumption](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_message_productionconsumption.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send messages to or consume messages from topics without proper authorization.
*   **RocketMQ Contribution:** RocketMQ's *built-in* ACL system, if misconfigured or if a vulnerability exists *within RocketMQ's ACL implementation*, allows unauthorized access.
*   **Example:** An attacker, without proper credentials, successfully publishes messages due to a misconfigured ACL rule *within RocketMQ*.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage, data corruption, injection of malicious data, disruption of application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable and Configure ACLs (RocketMQ Feature):** Enable and meticulously configure RocketMQ's *built-in* ACL feature. Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Strong Authentication (RocketMQ Configuration):** Use strong, unique passwords or access keys for all RocketMQ accounts, managed within RocketMQ's security configuration.
    *   **Regular ACL Audits (RocketMQ Configuration):** Regularly review and audit RocketMQ's ACL configurations.
    *   **Use TLS (RocketMQ Feature):** Enable and correctly configure TLS encryption for communication between clients and brokers, using RocketMQ's TLS support.

## Attack Surface: [Rogue Broker Registration](./attack_surfaces/rogue_broker_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a malicious Broker with the NameServer, potentially intercepting or injecting messages.
*   **RocketMQ Contribution:** The NameServer's *RocketMQ-specific* broker registration mechanism, if not properly secured, can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker registers a rogue Broker that mimics a legitimate Broker, exploiting a weakness in RocketMQ's authentication for broker registration.
*   **Impact:** Message interception, message modification, denial of service, data leakage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication for Broker Registration (RocketMQ Feature):** Require strong authentication for Brokers to register with the NameServer. This is a *critical RocketMQ security setting*.
    *   **NameServer ACLs (RocketMQ Feature):** Use NameServer ACLs (part of RocketMQ's security model) to restrict which hosts can register Brokers.
    *   **Monitoring for New Brokers (RocketMQ Metrics):** Monitor the NameServer for new Broker registrations using RocketMQ's monitoring capabilities.
    *   **Static Broker Configuration (Advanced RocketMQ Deployment):** In highly secure environments, consider a static Broker configuration, bypassing RocketMQ's dynamic registration.
