## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-tree 1: Data Exfiltration](./attack_tree_paths/sub-tree_1_data_exfiltration.md)

*   **Goal:** Data Exfiltration
    *   **OR Node:**
        *   **Unencrypted Communication:** `[HIGH RISK]`
            *   **Leaf Node:** RocketMQ traffic is not encrypted (TLS/SSL not configured). `[CRITICAL]`
                *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
                    *   **Description:** The attacker passively monitors network traffic between RocketMQ clients, brokers, and the NameServer. Because the communication is not encrypted, the attacker can read the contents of messages, potentially including sensitive data.
                    *   **Prerequisites:** Network access to sniff traffic (e.g., compromised network device, ARP spoofing, physical access).
                    *   **Steps:**
                        1.  Gain network access.
                        2.  Use a packet sniffer (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) to capture RocketMQ traffic.
                        3.  Analyze the captured packets to extract message data.
                    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS/SSL for *all* RocketMQ communication. Use strong cipher suites and properly configured certificates.
            *   **Leaf Node:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack intercepts unencrypted traffic.
                * **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
                    * **Description:** The attacker positions themselves between the client/broker or broker/NameServer, intercepting and potentially modifying the unencrypted communication.
                    * **Prerequisites:** Ability to intercept network traffic (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS hijacking, compromised router).
                    * **Steps:**
                        1.  Establish a MitM position.
                        2.  Intercept RocketMQ traffic.
                        3.  Read and/or modify message data.
                        4.  Forward the (potentially modified) traffic to the intended recipient.
                    * **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS/SSL with certificate pinning or strict certificate validation. Network segmentation can also limit the scope of MitM attacks.
        *   **Unauthorized Client Access:** `[HIGH RISK]`
            *   **AND Node:**
                *   **Leaf Node:** Weak or default credentials for RocketMQ clients. `[CRITICAL]`
                    *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
                        *   **Description:** The attacker uses default or easily guessable credentials to connect to the RocketMQ broker as a legitimate client.
                        *   **Prerequisites:** Knowledge of default credentials or the ability to guess/brute-force weak passwords.
                        *   **Steps:**
                            1.  Obtain a list of default RocketMQ credentials (from documentation or online resources).
                            2.  Attempt to connect to the RocketMQ broker using these credentials.
                            3.  If successful, subscribe to topics and consume messages.
                        *   **Mitigation:**  **Never** use default credentials. Enforce strong, unique passwords for all RocketMQ clients. Implement a robust authentication mechanism (e.g., token-based authentication, multi-factor authentication).
                *   **Leaf Node:** Lack of proper authorization controls (ACLs). `[CRITICAL]`
                    *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
                        *   **Description:** Even with strong authentication, if ACLs are not configured or are too permissive, an authenticated client may be able to access topics and groups they shouldn't.
                        *   **Prerequisites:**  Authenticated access to the RocketMQ broker (even with limited privileges).
                        *   **Steps:**
                            1.  Authenticate to the RocketMQ broker.
                            2.  Attempt to subscribe to various topics, even those not explicitly authorized.
                            3.  If successful, consume messages from unauthorized topics.
                        *   **Mitigation:** Implement fine-grained ACLs that restrict client access to specific topics and groups based on the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and audit ACLs.
        *   **Compromised Broker:**
            *   **OR Node:**
                *   **Leaf Node:** Exploit a vulnerability in the RocketMQ broker software (RCE). `[CRITICAL]`

                            3. Develop or obtain an exploit for the vulnerability.
                            4. Send the exploit payload to the broker.
                            5. Gain a shell or other form of control on the broker.
                            6. Exfiltrate data directly from the broker's memory or storage.
                        * **Mitigation:** Keep RocketMQ *strictly* up-to-date. Apply security patches *immediately* upon release. Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing. Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules to detect and block RCE exploit attempts.
                *   **Leaf Node:** Compromise the underlying operating system of the broker. `[CRITICAL]`
                    * **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
                        * **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the operating system running the RocketMQ broker to gain root or administrator access.
                        * **Prerequisites:** Existence of an unpatched vulnerability in the operating system. Knowledge of how to exploit the vulnerability.

                            4. Gain access to the system (e.g., through a compromised service, weak SSH credentials).
                            5. Escalate privileges to root/administrator.
                            6. Access RocketMQ data files or memory.
                        * **Mitigation:** Harden the operating system. Implement strong access controls (e.g., SELinux, AppArmor). Use a host-based intrusion detection/prevention system (HIDS/HIPS). Regularly patch the operating system.

        *   **Message Modification/Replay:** `[HIGH RISK]`
            *   **AND Node:**
                *   **Leaf Node:** Lack of message integrity checks (digital signatures). `[CRITICAL]`
