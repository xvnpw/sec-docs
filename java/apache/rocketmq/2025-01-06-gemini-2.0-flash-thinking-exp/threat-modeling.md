# Threat Model Analysis for apache/rocketmq

## Threat: [Rogue Nameserver Deployment](./threats/rogue_nameserver_deployment.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys a malicious Nameserver instance on the network. Producers and consumers, either through misconfiguration or network compromise, connect to this rogue Nameserver. The attacker can then manipulate routing information, causing messages to be misdirected, dropped, or intercepted.
*   **Impact:** Message loss, data interception, denial of service for legitimate producers and consumers, potential for data manipulation if the attacker controls subsequent brokers.
*   **Affected Component:** Nameserver, Producer (client-side configuration), Consumer (client-side configuration).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict network segmentation to isolate the RocketMQ cluster.
    *   Configure producers and consumers to connect only to known and trusted Nameserver addresses.
    *   Use a static list of Nameservers instead of relying solely on DNS discovery in untrusted environments.
    *   Implement monitoring to detect the presence of unexpected Nameserver instances.

## Threat: [Nameserver Data Poisoning](./threats/nameserver_data_poisoning.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a legitimate Nameserver and modifies its metadata, such as broker addresses, topic configurations, or queue assignments. This can lead to messages being routed to incorrect brokers, preventing delivery or causing data corruption if messages are processed by unintended consumers.
*   **Impact:** Message loss, data corruption, service disruption, potential for information disclosure if messages are routed to malicious entities.
*   **Affected Component:** Nameserver (data storage and management).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing and modifying Nameserver data.
    *   Enforce access control lists (ACLs) to restrict which entities can modify Nameserver configurations.
    *   Audit all modifications to the Nameserver configuration.
    *   Consider using a distributed consensus mechanism for Nameserver data to improve resilience against tampering.

## Threat: [Broker Spoofing/Rogue Broker](./threats/broker_spoofingrogue_broker.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys a malicious Broker instance that masquerades as a legitimate Broker within the RocketMQ cluster. This rogue Broker can then intercept messages destined for legitimate consumers, potentially steal data, or inject malicious messages into the system.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, message manipulation, potential for further attacks by injecting malicious data, denial of service if the rogue broker malfunctions or is intentionally disruptive.
*   **Affected Component:** Broker (registration process), Nameserver (broker registration management), Producer (broker selection).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement mutual authentication between Brokers and the Nameserver.
    *   Ensure producers only connect to Brokers registered with trusted Nameservers.
    *   Implement monitoring to detect the presence of unexpected Broker instances.
    *   Utilize Broker identity verification mechanisms if available.

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Broker Storage](./threats/message_tampering_in_broker_storage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the storage mechanism used by a Broker (e.g., disk files) and modifies messages at rest. This can lead to data corruption, manipulation of business logic, or the introduction of malicious payloads.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, integrity violations, potential for application-level vulnerabilities to be exploited through manipulated messages.
*   **Affected Component:** Broker (message storage module).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls on the Broker's storage directories and files.
    *   Encrypt messages at rest on the Broker's storage.
    *   Implement file system integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Message Eavesdropping on Broker](./threats/message_eavesdropping_on_broker.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Broker and reads messages intended for other consumers. This can expose sensitive information contained within the messages.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential for misuse of leaked information.
*   **Affected Component:** Broker (message retrieval and delivery).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement message encryption in transit (TLS/SSL).
    *   Implement message encryption at rest on the Broker.
    *   Enforce strict access control lists (ACLs) on topics to restrict which consumers can access specific message queues.

## Threat: [Broker Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/broker_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms a Broker with excessive message publishing requests, consumption requests, or other resource-intensive operations, making it unavailable to legitimate clients.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, message backlog, potential data loss if the Broker fails due to overload.
*   **Affected Component:** Broker (message processing and resource management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the Broker.
    *   Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are allocated to the Broker.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for Broker performance and resource utilization.
    *   Utilize RocketMQ's built-in flow control mechanisms.

## Threat: [Malicious Message Injection by Compromised Producer](./threats/malicious_message_injection_by_compromised_producer.md)

*   **Description:** A legitimate producer account or system is compromised, and the attacker uses it to send malicious or malformed messages. These messages could exploit vulnerabilities in consumer applications or disrupt their intended functionality.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, data corruption on the consumer side, potential for remote code execution if consumer applications have vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Broker (message acceptance), Consumer (message processing logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong security practices for producer applications and systems.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization on the consumer side to protect against malicious message content.
    *   Implement schema validation for messages to ensure they conform to expected formats.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Consumption](./threats/unauthorized_message_consumption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access and attempts to consume messages from topics they are not authorized to access. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data.
*   **Affected Component:** Broker (message delivery), Consumer (access control).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust authorization mechanisms for consumers based on topics and consumer groups.
    *   Use access control lists (ACLs) to restrict consumer access to specific queues.
    *   Authenticate consumers before allowing them to subscribe to topics.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Client SDK](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_client_sdk.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the RocketMQ client SDK used by producers or consumers. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the client application, potentially leading to data exfiltration, denial of service, or further attacks on the RocketMQ cluster.
