## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Broker Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_broker_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

* This node is critical because the Broker is the central component of RocketMQ. Compromise here can lead to complete control over message flow, data, and potentially the server itself.
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Broker [CRITICAL] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * Attack Vector: Exploit known CVE in Broker software.
            * Description: Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the RocketMQ Broker software.
            * Likelihood: Medium (depends on patching cadence).
            * Impact: Critical (full control of the Broker server).
            * Mitigation: Regularly update RocketMQ, implement vulnerability management.
    * Data Exfiltration from Broker [CRITICAL]:
        * This node is critical as it directly leads to the exposure of sensitive message data.
            * Access and download stored messages [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
                * Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities to bypass access controls.
                    * Description: Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to directly access and download stored messages.
                    * Likelihood: Low (requires specific vulnerabilities).
                    * Impact: Critical (exposure of sensitive message data).
                    * Mitigation: Implement strong access controls, regular security audits.
                * Attack Vector: Gain unauthorized access to Broker's storage.
                    * Description: Attackers gain direct file system access to the Broker's storage directories.
                    * Likelihood: Very Low (if proper file system permissions are in place).
                    * Impact: Critical (exposure of sensitive message data).
                    * Mitigation: Secure file system permissions, restrict access to storage.
            * Monitor message traffic [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
                * Attack Vector: Intercept communication between producers, consumers, and the Broker.
                    * Description: Attackers eavesdrop on network traffic to capture messages in transit.
                    * Likelihood: Medium (if network is not properly segmented or encrypted).
                    * Impact: High (exposure of in-transit message data).
                    * Mitigation: Enforce TLS/SSL encryption, network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate NameServer [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_nameserver__critical_.md)

* This node is critical because the NameServer controls the routing of messages. Compromise can disrupt the entire messaging infrastructure.
    * Poisoning NameServer routing information [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * Attack Vector: Register malicious Broker address.
            * Description: Attackers register a rogue Broker with the NameServer, tricking producers/consumers into connecting to it.
            * Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on NameServer security).
            * Impact: High (can redirect traffic and intercept messages).
            * Mitigation: Implement authentication for Broker registration, monitor registrations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Message Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_message_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

* This node is critical because it directly targets the application logic through message content.
    * Malicious Message Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * Attack Vector: Inject messages with malicious payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in consumer application's message processing logic (SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection).
            * Description: Attackers craft messages containing malicious code or commands that are executed by the consuming application.
            * Likelihood: Medium (if consumer doesn't sanitize inputs).
            * Impact: High to Critical (data breach, remote code execution on consumer).
            * Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization in consumer applications, use parameterized queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Administrative Features (if exposed) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_administrative_features__if_exposed___critical_.md)

* This node is critical as it grants wide-ranging control over the RocketMQ infrastructure.
    * Exploit unsecured administrative interfaces [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * Attack Vector: Access admin console with default or weak credentials.
            * Description: Attackers gain access to the administrative interface using default or easily guessable credentials.
            * Likelihood: Low to Medium (depends on organizational security).
            * Impact: High (full control over Broker configuration).
            * Mitigation: Enforce strong passwords, disable default accounts, secure admin interfaces.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inter-Component Communication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inter-component_communication.md)

* This node represents attacks targeting the communication channels between RocketMQ components.
    * Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]:
        * Attack Vector: Intercept communication between producers and Broker.
            * Description: Attackers intercept and potentially modify communication between message producers and the Broker.
            * Likelihood: Low to Medium (if communication is not encrypted).
            * Impact: High (message interception, modification).
            * Mitigation: Enforce TLS/SSL encryption, mutual authentication.
        * Attack Vector: Intercept communication between consumers and Broker.
            * Description: Attackers intercept and potentially modify communication between message consumers and the Broker.
            * Likelihood: Low to Medium (if communication is not encrypted).
            * Impact: High (message interception, modification).
            * Mitigation: Enforce TLS/SSL encryption, mutual authentication.
        * Attack Vector: Intercept communication between Brokers and NameServer.
            * Description: Attackers intercept and potentially modify communication between Brokers and the NameServer.
            * Likelihood: Low to Medium (if communication is not encrypted).
            * Impact: High (manipulation of routing information).
            * Mitigation: Enforce TLS/SSL encryption, mutual authentication.
