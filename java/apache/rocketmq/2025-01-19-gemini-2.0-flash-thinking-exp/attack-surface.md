# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/rocketmq

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Network Exposure of RocketMQ Components](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_network_exposure_of_rocketmq_components.md)

*   **Description:** RocketMQ Name Servers and Brokers listen on network ports. If these ports are exposed without proper network segmentation or access controls, unauthorized access is possible directly to RocketMQ components.
*   **How RocketMQ Contributes:** RocketMQ's architecture necessitates network communication between its components. Default configurations might not enforce strict network access controls, directly exposing these services.
*   **Example:** A publicly accessible Name Server port allows an attacker to query it and discover internal broker addresses, which are core RocketMQ components.
*   **Impact:** Discovery of RocketMQ cluster topology, direct unauthorized access to brokers, potential for manipulating RocketMQ's internal state or causing denial of service at the RocketMQ level.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate RocketMQ components within a private network.
    *   Use firewalls to restrict access to RocketMQ ports only from authorized IP addresses or networks.
    *   Configure network interfaces to bind to specific internal IPs rather than all interfaces.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Missing Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_missing_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of strong authentication for producers, consumers, and administrative tools allows unauthorized entities to directly interact with the RocketMQ cluster. Insufficient authorization allows actions beyond intended permissions within RocketMQ.
*   **How RocketMQ Contributes:** RocketMQ provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, but their strength and enforcement are directly controlled by RocketMQ configurations. Weak or missing configuration directly exposes RocketMQ to unauthorized actions.
*   **Example:** A producer connects to a broker without providing valid credentials and is able to send messages to any topic, directly exploiting a lack of RocketMQ's authentication enforcement.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized message production and consumption within RocketMQ, data breaches by accessing unauthorized topics, message tampering within the RocketMQ system, potential for malicious control over the RocketMQ cluster itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce authentication for producers and consumers using RocketMQ's ACLs (Access Control Lists) or custom authentication providers.
    *   Implement robust authorization policies within RocketMQ to restrict access to specific topics and groups based on user roles or identities.
    *   Secure access to RocketMQ administrative tools with strong passwords and multi-factor authentication where possible.
    *   Regularly review and update RocketMQ's authentication and authorization configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Message Injection Exploiting RocketMQ's Lack of Content Inspection](./attack_surfaces/message_injection_exploiting_rocketmq's_lack_of_content_inspection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can send messages containing malicious payloads through RocketMQ. While the ultimate impact depends on the consumer, RocketMQ's role is in facilitating the delivery of this potentially harmful content without inspection.
*   **How RocketMQ Contributes:** RocketMQ, by default, acts as a message transport without deep inspection of message content. This allows the propagation of arbitrary data, including malicious payloads, through the system.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message through RocketMQ containing a serialized object with a known deserialization vulnerability. RocketMQ delivers this message to the consumer, who then attempts to deserialize it, potentially leading to remote code execution on the consumer's system. The vulnerability is in the consumer, but RocketMQ facilitated the attack.
*   **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution on consumer systems (though the vulnerability resides there), data breaches if malicious data is processed, denial of service of consumer applications due to malicious messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the consumer side (primary defense).
    *   Consider implementing content-based filtering or scanning mechanisms *before* messages enter RocketMQ or as a RocketMQ plugin, if feasible, to detect and block potentially malicious messages at the transport level.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations of RocketMQ](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations_of_rocketmq.md)

*   **Description:** RocketMQ might have default configurations that are not secure, such as weak default passwords for administrative users or overly permissive access controls within RocketMQ itself.
*   **How RocketMQ Contributes:** The default state of RocketMQ directly determines the initial security posture. Insecure defaults provide immediate vulnerabilities within the RocketMQ system.
*   **Example:** The default administrative user password for RocketMQ is used, allowing an attacker with knowledge of this default to gain full administrative access to the RocketMQ cluster.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the RocketMQ cluster, potential for complete compromise of the messaging infrastructure, manipulation of messages, and disruption of service at the RocketMQ level.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Change all default passwords for RocketMQ administrative users and internal components immediately after installation.
    *   Review and harden default RocketMQ configurations, ensuring that access controls are appropriately restrictive.
    *   Follow security best practices outlined in the official RocketMQ documentation.
