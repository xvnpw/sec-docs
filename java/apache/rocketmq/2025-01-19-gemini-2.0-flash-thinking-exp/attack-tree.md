## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit RocketMQ Broker Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_rocketmq_broker_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node is critical because successful exploitation grants significant control over the message broker, the core component for message storage and delivery.
*   It's a high-risk path due to the potential for severe impact (data breach, service disruption, complete compromise of the broker).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Broker](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__remote_code_execution__rce__on_broker.md)

*   This is a critical node as it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the broker's host, leading to complete system compromise.
*   It's a high-risk path due to the critical impact and the potential for exploitation through deserialization flaws or other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known Broker Software Vulnerability (CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_known_broker_software_vulnerability__cve_.md)

*   This is a critical node because exploiting known vulnerabilities is a common attack vector.
*   It's a high-risk path if the broker instance is unpatched, making exploitation relatively straightforward with readily available exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit RocketMQ NameServer Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_rocketmq_nameserver_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node is critical because the NameServer is the central registry for brokers. Compromise can disrupt the entire messaging infrastructure.
*   It's a high-risk path due to the potential for widespread impact on the RocketMQ deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE) on NameServer](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__remote_code_execution__rce__on_nameserver.md)

*   This is a critical node as it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the NameServer's host, leading to complete control over the discovery service.
*   It's a high-risk path due to the critical impact and potential exploitation through deserialization flaws or other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known NameServer Software Vulnerability (CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_known_nameserver_software_vulnerability__cve_.md)

*   This is a critical node because exploiting known vulnerabilities is a common attack vector against the NameServer.
*   It's a high-risk path if the NameServer instance is unpatched, making exploitation relatively straightforward.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE] Data Manipulation on NameServer](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__data_manipulation_on_nameserver.md)

*   This node is critical because manipulating the NameServer's data can directly impact message routing and availability.
*   It's a high-risk path due to the potential for significant disruption and the ability to redirect message flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Register Malicious Broker Information](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__register_malicious_broker_information.md)

*   This is a high-risk path because by registering a malicious broker, the attacker can intercept or manipulate messages intended for legitimate brokers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) on NameServer](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__denial_of_service__dos__on_nameserver.md)

*   This is a high-risk path because disrupting the NameServer can effectively bring down the entire RocketMQ messaging system, impacting all dependent applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in RocketMQ Client SDK](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_rocketmq_client_sdk.md)

*   This is a high-risk path because vulnerabilities in the client SDK can be exploited to compromise the applications using the SDK.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Client](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_client.md)

*   This is a high-risk path because successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the host of the application consuming messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Message Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__message_injection.md)

*   This is a high-risk path because injecting malicious messages can trigger unintended or harmful behavior in the consuming application, potentially leading to data corruption or further compromise.
