# Threat Model Analysis for apache/rocketmq

## Threat: [Nameserver Spoofing](./threats/nameserver_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sets up a rogue Nameserver instance. Producers and consumers, due to misconfiguration or a compromised discovery mechanism, connect to this fake Nameserver. The attacker can intercept connection requests, potentially redirecting traffic or gathering information about the application's messaging patterns.
    *   **Impact:** Producers might send messages to the attacker's server, leading to data loss or interception. Consumers might fail to connect to the real brokers, causing service disruption. The attacker could manipulate broker information presented to clients, leading to further misrouting.
    *   **Affected Component:** Nameserver, Client SDK (broker discovery mechanism)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Nameserver registration and updates.
        *   Use a secure and reliable mechanism for clients to discover Nameservers, avoiding reliance on potentially compromised DNS.
        *   Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) between clients and the Nameserver to verify the server's identity.
        *   Regularly monitor the registered brokers in the Nameserver to detect anomalies.

## Threat: [Broker Spoofing](./threats/broker_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sets up a fake Broker instance, attempting to impersonate a legitimate broker. Producers might send messages to this rogue broker, leading to data loss or interception. Consumers might connect to the fake broker and receive fabricated or outdated messages.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss from messages sent to the fake broker. Data corruption or application errors due to consumers receiving incorrect messages. Potential for the attacker to inject malicious messages into the system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Broker, Client SDK (broker connection logic)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for brokers to register with the Nameserver.
        *   Use mutual TLS (mTLS) between clients and brokers to verify the broker's identity.
        *   Ensure clients validate the broker's identity based on trusted certificates.
        *   Monitor broker registrations and connections for unexpected or unauthorized brokers.

## Threat: [Message Tampering in Transit](./threats/message_tampering_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between producers/consumers and brokers and modifies message content before it reaches its destination. This could involve altering data, injecting malicious payloads, or deleting messages.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption leading to application errors or incorrect business logic execution. Injection of malicious content could compromise consuming applications. Loss of critical information if messages are deleted.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network communication between clients and brokers
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all communication between producers, consumers, brokers, and the Nameserver.
        *   Implement message signing or encryption at the application level to ensure message integrity and authenticity.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Consumption](./threats/unauthorized_message_consumption.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a broker and consumes messages from topics they are not authorized to access. This could be due to weak access controls, misconfigurations, or compromised credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data contained within the messages. Potential violation of data privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Broker (access control mechanisms)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for consumers, ensuring they can only access authorized topics and consumer groups.
        *   Utilize RocketMQ's ACL (Access Control List) features to define granular permissions for topic access.
        *   Regularly review and audit access control configurations.
        *   Consider encrypting sensitive data within messages at the application level.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Broker or Nameserver Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_broker_or_nameserver_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the RocketMQ broker or Nameserver software. This could allow them to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the affected component, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or control over the messaging infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Broker, Nameserver (software code)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep RocketMQ software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management program to identify and address potential weaknesses.
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring RocketMQ.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Broker or Nameserver Management Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_broker_or_nameserver_management_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the administrative interface (e.g., web console, command-line tools) of the broker or Nameserver. This could be due to weak credentials, default passwords, or vulnerabilities in the interface itself.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the messaging infrastructure, allowing the attacker to modify configurations, delete topics, view messages, and potentially disrupt the entire system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Broker (management interface), Nameserver (management interface)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
        *   Restrict access to the management interface to authorized users and networks.
        *   Disable or secure any unnecessary management interfaces.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Client SDK Vulnerabilities](./threats/client_sdk_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the RocketMQ client SDK used by producers or consumers. This could allow them to compromise the application using the SDK, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or executing arbitrary code within the application's context.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of producer or consumer applications. Data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities originating from the compromised application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Client SDK (software code)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the latest stable version of the RocketMQ client SDK and keep it updated with security patches.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when using the client SDK.
        *   Regularly scan application dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
