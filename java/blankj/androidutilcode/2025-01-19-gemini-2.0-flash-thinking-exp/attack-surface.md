# Attack Surface Analysis for blankj/androidutilcode

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage via Shared Preferences](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage_via_shared_preferences.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data is stored in shared preferences without proper encryption, making it accessible to other applications or attackers with root access.

**How androidutilcode Contributes:** `SPUtils` in `androidutilcode` provides convenient methods for interacting with shared preferences. If developers use this utility to store sensitive data directly without encryption, it contributes to this attack surface.

**Example:** An application stores user login credentials (username and password) using `SPUtils.put()` without any encryption. A malicious app can then read these credentials from the shared preferences file.

**Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, identity theft, unauthorized access to application features and data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Avoid storing sensitive data in shared preferences. If necessary, encrypt the data before storing it using robust encryption algorithms (e.g., AES with proper key management). Do not rely solely on obfuscation. Consider using Android's `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage via Files](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage_via_files.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data is stored in the application's internal or external storage without proper encryption or access controls, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**How androidutilcode Contributes:** `FileUtils` in `androidutilcode` provides utilities for file I/O. If developers use these utilities to write sensitive data to files without encryption or with world-readable permissions, it contributes to this attack surface.

**Example:** An application uses `FileUtils.writeFileFromString()` to save user's personal information to a file in the external storage directory without encryption. Any application with storage permissions can read this file.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential for data manipulation or deletion by malicious actors.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Encrypt sensitive data before writing it to files. Use Android's internal storage with appropriate file permissions (private mode). Avoid storing sensitive data on external storage unless absolutely necessary and with strong encryption.
