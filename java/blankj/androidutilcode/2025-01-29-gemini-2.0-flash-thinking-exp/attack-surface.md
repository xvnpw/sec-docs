# Attack Surface Analysis for blankj/androidutilcode

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage in SharedPreferences](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage_in_sharedpreferences.md)

*   **Description:** Storing sensitive data in SharedPreferences without encryption exposes it to unauthorized access.
*   **How androidutilcode contributes:** `SPUtils` within `androidutilcode` simplifies SharedPreferences usage. This ease of use can inadvertently encourage developers to store sensitive data in SharedPreferences without implementing necessary encryption, as `SPUtils` itself doesn't enforce or provide default encryption.
*   **Example:** An application uses `SPUtils` to store user authentication tokens in plaintext. An attacker gains root access to the device and can easily read the SharedPreferences file, extracting the tokens and compromising user accounts.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, identity theft, and compromise of sensitive user information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Encryption:** Always encrypt sensitive data before storing it in SharedPreferences. Utilize Android Keystore for secure key management and robust encryption/decryption.
    *   **Minimize Sensitive Data Storage:**  Avoid storing highly sensitive data in SharedPreferences if possible. Explore more secure storage options like encrypted databases or server-side storage for critical information.
    *   **Secure Backups:** Implement secure backup strategies that either exclude sensitive SharedPreferences data or ensure it is encrypted within backups to prevent exposure during backup and restore processes.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities via ShellUtils](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerabilities_via_shellutils.md)

*   **Description:**  Using `ShellUtils` to execute shell commands constructed from untrusted input without proper sanitization creates a critical command injection vulnerability.
*   **How androidutilcode contributes:** `ShellUtils` in `androidutilcode` provides straightforward methods for executing shell commands.  If developers utilize these methods to run commands built using user-supplied input or data from untrusted sources, they directly introduce a pathway for command injection attacks.
*   **Example:** An application uses `ShellUtils.execCmd()` to execute a command that includes a filename provided by the user. An attacker injects malicious shell commands within the filename input, such as `; rm -rf / ;`, leading to arbitrary code execution with the application's privileges, potentially wiping device data.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the device, privilege escalation, complete device compromise, data theft, denial of service, and potential for malware installation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid ShellUtils with Untrusted Input (Strongly Recommended):**  Absolutely avoid using `ShellUtils` to execute commands that incorporate user input or data from any untrusted source. This is the most effective mitigation.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (If ShellUtils is Unavoidable):** If shell command execution with external input is absolutely unavoidable, rigorously validate and sanitize *all* input used in command construction. Employ whitelisting of allowed characters and commands, and escape all special shell characters. This is complex and error-prone, so avoidance is highly preferred.
    *   **Parameterized Commands or Safer Alternatives:**  Explore and utilize parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution provided by the Android SDK or other secure libraries whenever possible. These methods often prevent command injection by design.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Minimize the privileges under which shell commands are executed. If possible, execute commands with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities via FileUtils](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_via_fileutils.md)

*   **Description:**  Constructing file paths using user-controlled input without thorough validation when using file utility functions can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **How androidutilcode contributes:** `FileUtils` in `androidutilcode` offers various file operation utilities. If developers use `FileUtils` methods with file paths that are directly derived from user input or untrusted sources without implementing robust validation, they can inadvertently create path traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An application uses `FileUtils.readFile2String()` with a file path provided directly by the user. An attacker provides a malicious path like `../../../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive system files outside the application's intended file access scope.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive application data, system files, configuration files, or other user data residing on the device's file system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Rigorous validation and sanitization of all file paths used with `FileUtils` is crucial, especially when paths originate from user input or untrusted sources. Implement whitelisting of allowed characters and path components.
    *   **Use Absolute or Canonical Paths:**  Utilize absolute paths or resolve paths to their canonical form to eliminate relative path traversal vulnerabilities. Resolve user-provided path fragments against a known safe base directory.
    *   **Restrict File Access Permissions:**  Implement and enforce strict file access permissions to limit access to files and directories to only authorized application components, minimizing the impact of potential path traversal exploits.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for File Operations:**  Operate on files with the minimum necessary permissions required for the intended functionality to reduce the potential damage from a path traversal vulnerability.
