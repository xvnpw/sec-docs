# Attack Surface Analysis for blankj/androidutilcode

## Attack Surface: [File System Manipulation via Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/file_system_manipulation_via_path_traversal.md)

* **Attack Surface: File System Manipulation via Path Traversal**
    * **Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths provided to the application to access or modify files outside of the intended directories.
    * **How androidutilcode Contributes:** The `FileUtils` class in `androidutilcode` provides convenient methods for file creation, writing, and copying (e.g., `writeFileFromString`, `copyFile`). If the application uses these methods with unsanitized user input for file paths, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal.
    * **Example:** An attacker could provide a path like `../../../../sensitive_data.txt` to a function using `FileUtils.writeFileFromString`, potentially overwriting critical system files.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary file read, write, or deletion leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided file paths before using them with `FileUtils` methods. Use canonicalization techniques to resolve relative paths. Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths. Employ whitelisting of allowed paths or directories.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) via Insecure Network Requests](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__via_insecure_network_requests.md)

* **Attack Surface: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) via Insecure Network Requests**
    * **Description:** An attacker intercepts network communication between the application and a server, potentially eavesdropping or manipulating data.
    * **How androidutilcode Contributes:** The `NetworkUtils` class offers utilities for making network requests. If the application uses these utilities without enforcing HTTPS or properly validating SSL/TLS certificates, it becomes vulnerable to MITM attacks.
    * **Example:** An attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network could intercept communication made using `NetworkUtils.getIpAddressByDomain` over HTTP, potentially revealing sensitive information or manipulating the resolved IP address.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and redirection to malicious servers.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Always use HTTPS for network communication. Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate pinning to prevent attackers from using forged certificates. Ensure `NetworkUtils` configurations prioritize secure connections.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage in Shared Preferences](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage_in_shared_preferences.md)

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Data Storage in Shared Preferences**
    * **Description:** Sensitive data stored in Shared Preferences without encryption can be easily accessed by other applications or through rooting.
    * **How androidutilcode Contributes:** The `SPUtils` class simplifies the process of storing and retrieving data from Shared Preferences. If the application uses this to store sensitive data without encryption, it becomes vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An application might use `SPUtils.put` to store a user's API key in plain text in Shared Preferences.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Never store sensitive data in Shared Preferences without proper encryption. Use the Android Keystore system or other secure storage mechanisms.
