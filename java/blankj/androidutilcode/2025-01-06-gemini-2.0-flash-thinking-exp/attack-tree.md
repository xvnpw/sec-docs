## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Application Data (via Read Arbitrary File)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_application_data__via_read_arbitrary_file_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a Path Traversal Vulnerability in the application's use of `FileUtil` to read arbitrary files within the application's file system. This allows them to access sensitive data like configuration files, database files, or internal storage files containing user information or API keys.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Direct access to sensitive data)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Storing Sensitive Data in Insecure Locations (using FileUtil)](./attack_tree_paths/storing_sensitive_data_in_insecure_locations__using_fileutil_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly use `FileUtil` to store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user credentials) in plain text on the SD card or internal storage without proper encryption. This data can be accessed by other applications or users with file system access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Exposure of sensitive credentials or personal information)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Storing Sensitive Data in Plain Text in Shared Preferences](./attack_tree_paths/storing_sensitive_data_in_plain_text_in_shared_preferences.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers use `SPUtils` (or directly use `SharedPreferences`) to store sensitive data in plain text. This data can be accessed by other applications with the same user ID or through rooting the device.
*   **Likelihood:** High
*   **Impact:** High (Exposure of sensitive credentials or personal information)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Application unknowingly includes compromised code (via Supply Chain Attack)](./attack_tree_paths/application_unknowingly_includes_compromised_code__via_supply_chain_attack_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The `androidutilcode` repository is compromised, and malicious code is injected into the library. Applications that include this compromised version of the library unknowingly incorporate the malicious code, which could perform various malicious actions.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low (for the initial compromise) / Inherited (for inclusion in the app)
*   **Impact:** High (Potentially full control of the application and user data)
*   **Effort:** High (to compromise the repository) / N/A (from the app developer's perspective at the time of inclusion)
*   **Skill Level:** High (to compromise the repository) / N/A (from the app developer's perspective at the time of inclusion)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires careful dependency analysis and potentially runtime monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** A flaw in the application's handling of file paths when using `FileUtil`, allowing attackers to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
*   **Impact:** Enables reading arbitrary files (leading to sensitive data access) and potentially writing arbitrary files (leading to data corruption or code injection).

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Arbitrary File](./attack_tree_paths/read_arbitrary_file.md)

**Description:** Successful exploitation of a path traversal vulnerability to read sensitive files within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** Direct access to sensitive data, bypassing intended security restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Storing Sensitive Data in Plain Text in Shared Preferences](./attack_tree_paths/storing_sensitive_data_in_plain_text_in_shared_preferences.md)

**Description:** The insecure practice of storing sensitive information without encryption in `SharedPreferences`.
*   **Impact:** Direct and easy access to sensitive data by malicious actors or other applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise of the androidutilcode Repository](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_of_the_androidutilcode_repository.md)

**Description:** A successful attack on the `androidutilcode` GitHub repository, allowing the injection of malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Widespread impact on all applications using the compromised version of the library, potentially leading to various forms of compromise.
