        *  Bypassing authentication/authorization {CRITICAL}

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 File Utilities (FileUtils) - Path Traversal](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_file_utilities__fileutils__-_path_traversal.md)

    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious file paths (e.g., using `../../` sequences) to access files outside the intended directory. This is possible if the application uses `FileUtils` methods with user-supplied input without proper sanitization.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Example Attack:**
        1.  Application uses `FileUtils.readFileToString(userInputPath)`.
        2.  Attacker provides `userInputPath = "../../../../data/data/com.example.app/databases/sensitive.db"`.
        3.  Application reads and potentially exposes the contents of `sensitive.db`.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize user-supplied file paths.
        *   Use `getCanonicalPath()` to resolve symbolic links and ensure the path is within the allowed directory.
        *   Avoid relative paths based on user input.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege for file access.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Shell Command Utilities (ShellUtils) - Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_shell_command_utilities__shellutils__-_command_injection.md)

    *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious shell commands into user input that is then used by `ShellUtils` to execute commands. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the device.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Example Attack:**
        1.  Application uses `ShellUtils.execCmd("ls " + userInput, false)`.
        2.  Attacker provides `userInput = "; rm -rf /data/data/com.example.app/*;"`.
        3.  Application executes the injected `rm` command, potentially deleting critical data.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Avoid* using `ShellUtils` with user-supplied input whenever possible.
        *   If unavoidable, use extreme caution and implement robust input sanitization and validation.
        *   Use `ProcessBuilder` with separate arguments instead of concatenating strings.
        *   Prefer built-in Android APIs over shell commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Overly Permissive Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_overly_permissive_permissions.md)

    *   **Description:** The application requests more permissions than it needs (e.g., `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` when it only needs to access a specific file). This expands the attack surface.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Enabler)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy
    *   **Example:** Application requests `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` but only needs to read a single configuration file. An attacker exploiting a separate vulnerability can now write arbitrary files to external storage.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Request only the *minimum* necessary permissions.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and justify each permission request.
        *   Use scoped storage where possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Insecure Storage](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_insecure_storage.md)

    *   **Description:** Sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal information) is stored without encryption using `SPUtils` (SharedPreferences) or other storage mechanisms.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Example:** Application stores the user's password in plain text in SharedPreferences. An attacker with device access or another app with read access to shared preferences can retrieve the password.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Always* encrypt sensitive data before storing it.
        *   Use the Android Keystore system for storing cryptographic keys.
        *   Consider using `EncryptedSharedPreferences`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Weak Cryptography Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_weak_cryptography_implementation.md)

    *   **Description:** The application uses weak cryptographic algorithms, insecure modes of operation, hardcoded keys, or predictable random number generators when using `EncryptUtils` or other crypto-related functions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard
    *   **Example:** Application uses `EncryptUtils` with a hardcoded key and DES encryption. An attacker can easily decrypt the data.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Follow cryptographic best practices.
        *   Use strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256 with GCM).
        *   Use secure key management (Android Keystore).
        *   Avoid hardcoding keys.
        *   Use a secure random number generator.
        *   Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations.
