# Attack Surface Analysis for blankj/androidutilcode

## Attack Surface: [Cryptographic Misuse](./attack_surfaces/cryptographic_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect implementation of cryptographic functions, leading to weak encryption or data exposure.
*   **`androidutilcode` Contribution:** Provides `EncryptUtils` with various encryption and hashing functions (AES, DES, RSA, MD5, SHA).  Easy-to-use APIs can lead to incorrect usage without understanding underlying cryptographic principles.
*   **Example:** A developer uses `EncryptUtils.encryptAES()` with a hardcoded key and a static IV, making the encryption easily breakable.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data (passwords, personal information, API keys), potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, or reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Never use MD5 or SHA-1 for security-sensitive operations.
        *   For password hashing, use strong, adaptive hashing algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt (use a dedicated library, *not* `EncryptUtils`).
        *   For symmetric encryption (AES, DES), use the Android Keystore for key management.  Never hardcode keys.  Use secure modes of operation (GCM, CBC with proper padding) and random IVs.
        *   For asymmetric encryption (RSA), use OAEP padding and sufficiently large key sizes (2048+ bits).
        *   Thoroughly understand cryptographic best practices before using *any* encryption function.  Consider using a higher-level library like Tink.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection (Shell Execution)](./attack_surfaces/command_injection__shell_execution_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious commands into shell commands executed by the application.
*   **`androidutilcode` Contribution:**  Provides `ShellUtils.execCmd()` for executing shell commands.  If user input is directly incorporated into the command string without sanitization, it's vulnerable.
*   **Example:**  An app uses `ShellUtils.execCmd("ping " + userInput)` to ping a host.  An attacker provides input like `"; rm -rf /sdcard/*"`, causing the app to delete files.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, data deletion, device compromise, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   *Avoid* using `ShellUtils` whenever possible.  Explore alternative Android SDK APIs.
        *   If `ShellUtils` *must* be used, *never* directly concatenate user input into the command string.
        *   Use parameterized commands or rigorously sanitize all user input before passing it to `execCmd()`.  Whitelist allowed characters rather than blacklisting dangerous ones.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (File I/O)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__file_io_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate file paths to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **`androidutilcode` Contribution:** Provides `FileUtils` and `FileIOUtils` for file operations.  If these utilities don't properly sanitize file paths, they can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An app uses `FileUtils.writeFile(userInput, "data")` to write data to a file. An attacker provides a path like `"../../../../data/data/com.example.app/databases/"` to overwrite the application's database.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive files, data leakage, potential system compromise (on rooted devices), data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Always validate and sanitize user-provided file paths *before* using them with any `androidutilcode` file function.
        *   Use relative paths within the app's designated storage areas (internal or external with scoped storage).  Avoid absolute paths.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege: the app should only have access to the files it absolutely needs.
        *   Use Android's built-in file storage mechanisms and APIs, which provide some built-in protection against path traversal.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Data Storage (SharedPreferences)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_data_storage__sharedpreferences_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is stored insecurely in SharedPreferences, making it accessible to attackers.
*   **`androidutilcode` Contribution:** Provides `SPUtils` to simplify SharedPreferences access.  This can encourage developers to store data in SharedPreferences that should be stored more securely.
*   **Example:** An app uses `SPUtils.put("auth_token", userToken)` to store a user's authentication token. On a rooted device, an attacker can retrieve this token and impersonate the user.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data (API keys, tokens, potentially user data), leading to unauthorized access to services or data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   *Never* store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens) directly in SharedPreferences, even with `SPUtils`.
        *   Use the Android Keystore system for storing sensitive data securely.
        *   If using SharedPreferences for non-sensitive data, understand that it's accessible on rooted devices.
