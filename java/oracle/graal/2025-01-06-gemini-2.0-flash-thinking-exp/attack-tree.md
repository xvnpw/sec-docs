## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Native Image Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_native_image_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **[CRITICAL] Malicious Input During AOT Compilation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with control over the build process or its inputs can provide specially crafted data (e.g., within configuration files, classpath entries, or resource files) that triggers a vulnerability within the GraalVM compiler during the ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation phase.
    *   **Consequence:** This can lead to the generation of a native image containing exploitable code or unexpected behavior, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution when the application runs.

*   **[CRITICAL] Code Generation Bugs:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  The GraalVM compiler, like any complex software, might contain bugs. An attacker can exploit these bugs to cause the compiler to generate incorrect or vulnerable native code.
    *   **Consequence:** This can result in classic memory safety issues like buffer overflows, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or incorrect memory management within the compiled native image, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.

*   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Reflection/JNI Interoperability Issues:**
    *   **Unsafe Reflection Usage:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Applications using reflection might inadvertently expose internal or restricted classes and methods in the native image. Attackers can leverage this to bypass intended access controls or manipulate the application's internal state in unintended ways.
        *   **Consequence:** This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **[CRITICAL] JNI Boundary Exploitation:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** When native images interact with native libraries via the Java Native Interface (JNI), vulnerabilities can arise at the boundary between the managed Java code and the unmanaged native code. This can involve issues with data marshalling, memory management, or security vulnerabilities within the native libraries themselves.
        *   **Consequence:** Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, arbitrary code execution within the native context, and potentially compromise the entire application.
    *   **Unintended Code Execution via Reflection:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating reflection configurations or exploiting weaknesses in how reflection is handled in the native image, an attacker might be able to force the application to reflectively access and execute methods or constructors that were not intended to be accessible.
        *   **Consequence:** This can bypass security checks and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse Polyglot Capabilities (If Applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_polyglot_capabilities__if_applicable_.md)

*   **[CRITICAL] Cross-Language Injection:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** In applications leveraging GraalVM's polyglot capabilities, an attacker can inject malicious code written in one supported language that is then executed within the context of another language. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in how data and control flow are managed between different language runtimes.
        *   **Consequence:** Successful injection can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other malicious activities within the application's polyglot environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Substrate VM Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_substrate_vm_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **[CRITICAL] Memory Corruption in Substrate VM:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The Substrate VM, which serves as the runtime environment for native images, is susceptible to memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or use-after-free errors.
    *   **Consequence:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially gaining control of the execution flow and achieving arbitrary code execution at the VM level, compromising the entire application.

*   **[CRITICAL] Sandbox Escape:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The Substrate VM aims to provide a degree of isolation and sandboxing. However, vulnerabilities within the VM's design or implementation might allow an attacker to escape this sandbox.
    *   **Consequence:** A successful sandbox escape can grant the attacker access to underlying system resources, execute arbitrary code outside the intended application boundaries, and potentially compromise the host system.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse GraalVM Configuration and Integration](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_graalvm_configuration_and_integration.md)

*   **Insecure Native Image Build Configuration:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Developers might inadvertently use insecure configurations during the native image build process. This could include enabling debugging features in production builds, including unnecessary or vulnerable dependencies, or using insecure build flags.
        *   **Consequence:** Such misconfigurations can introduce vulnerabilities or provide attackers with valuable information to facilitate further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploiting Dependencies of GraalVM](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploiting_dependencies_of_graalvm.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** GraalVM, like most software, relies on external libraries and components. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, they can be exploited in applications built with GraalVM.
    *   **Consequence:** Exploiting vulnerable dependencies can lead to a wide range of attacks, including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: API Misuse Leading to Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_api_misuse_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Improper or insecure usage of GraalVM-specific APIs or features can introduce vulnerabilities into the application. This could involve insecure context handling, unsafe interoperation with other languages or native code, or incorrect use of security-sensitive APIs.
    *   **Consequence:** Such misuse can create openings for attackers to exploit, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or other security compromises.
