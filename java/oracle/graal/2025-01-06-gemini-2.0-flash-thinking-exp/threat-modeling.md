# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/graal

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection during Native Image Build](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection_during_native_image_build.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise the build process by injecting malicious dependencies that get included in the final native image. This could happen through supply chain attacks on dependency repositories or compromised build environments. The malicious dependency would execute within the application's context.

**Impact:** Code execution within the application's process, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Native Image builder

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure build pipelines with dependency scanning and verification.
* Use dependency management tools with vulnerability checking.
* Employ reproducible builds to ensure build integrity.
* Regularly audit and update dependencies.

## Threat: [Exploiting Predictable Memory Layout in Native Images](./threats/exploiting_predictable_memory_layout_in_native_images.md)

**Description:** The ahead-of-time compilation of native images can lead to more predictable memory layouts compared to dynamically loaded JVM applications. An attacker with knowledge of this layout might be able to craft exploits that target specific memory addresses, potentially bypassing Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) if not properly configured or effective.

**Impact:** Enables more reliable exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Substrate VM (runtime for native images)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure ASLR is enabled and effective at the operating system level.
* Develop with memory-safe programming practices to minimize memory corruption vulnerabilities.
* Utilize compiler flags and Substrate VM configurations that enhance memory layout randomization.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Managers due to Native Image Limitations](./threats/bypassing_security_managers_due_to_native_image_limitations.md)

**Description:** Traditional Java Security Managers, which enforce fine-grained access control, might have limitations or different behavior within native images due to the reduced runtime environment of Substrate VM. An attacker might exploit these limitations to bypass security restrictions that would normally be enforced in a standard JVM.

**Impact:** Allows unauthorized access to system resources, sensitive data, or internal application components.

**Affected Component:** Substrate VM

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Understand the limitations of Security Managers in native images.
* Implement alternative security mechanisms at the application level.
* Rely on operating system-level security features and containerization.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Statically Linked Native Libraries](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_statically_linked_native_libraries.md)

**Description:** Native images often include statically linked native libraries. Vulnerabilities present in these libraries become directly embedded in the application executable. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application. Updating these libraries requires rebuilding and redeploying the entire native image, potentially delaying patching.

**Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service due to vulnerabilities in embedded native code.

**Affected Component:** Native Image builder, linked native libraries

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully select and regularly update native dependencies.
* Perform vulnerability scanning on statically linked libraries.
* Implement mechanisms for easier rebuilding and redeployment of native images when updates are needed.

## Threat: [Language Boundary Exploitation in Polyglot Applications](./threats/language_boundary_exploitation_in_polyglot_applications.md)

**Description:** In applications utilizing GraalVM's polyglot capabilities, attackers might exploit vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between different languages. This could involve type confusion, insecure data passing, or unexpected behavior when crossing language boundaries.

**Impact:** Code execution, data corruption, or privilege escalation by exploiting weaknesses in language interoperability.

**Affected Component:** Polyglot API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization at language boundaries.
* Thoroughly understand the type systems and security implications of interacting languages.
* Use secure coding practices in all languages involved.

## Threat: [Exploiting JNI Vulnerabilities in Native Images](./threats/exploiting_jni_vulnerabilities_in_native_images.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Java Native Interface (JNI) to interact with native code, vulnerabilities in that native code become a direct security risk to the GraalVM application. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption) to compromise the application.

**Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service due to vulnerabilities in native code called via JNI.

**Affected Component:** JNI integration

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Apply secure coding practices in native code.
* Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of native libraries used via JNI.
* Carefully manage data passed between Java and native code.

## Threat: [Substrate VM Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/substrate_vm_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The Substrate VM, which provides the runtime environment for native images, might contain its own vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or the underlying system.

**Impact:** Potentially critical, leading to arbitrary code execution or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Substrate VM

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if a vulnerability is discovered)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep GraalVM updated to the latest stable version, which includes security patches.
* Monitor security advisories related to GraalVM.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization via Polyglot Interoperability](./threats/insecure_deserialization_via_polyglot_interoperability.md)

**Description:** When exchanging data between different languages in a polyglot application, especially if serialization is involved, vulnerabilities related to insecure deserialization can arise. An attacker could provide malicious serialized data that, when processed by the application, leads to code execution or other harmful outcomes.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:** Polyglot API, Serialization mechanisms used

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
* Use secure serialization libraries and mechanisms.
* Implement input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
