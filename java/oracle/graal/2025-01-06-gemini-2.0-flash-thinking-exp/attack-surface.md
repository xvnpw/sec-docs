# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/graal

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Native Image Build Environment](./attack_surfaces/compromised_native_image_build_environment.md)

*   **Description:** The environment where the Native Image is built is compromised, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into the final executable.
    *   **GraalVM Contribution:** Native Image compilation is a build-time process. If this process, which uses GraalVM tools, is compromised, the resulting executable will inherently be malicious.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline used to build the Native Image with GraalVM and modifies the build scripts to include a backdoor, leveraging GraalVM's build tools.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application and potentially the system it runs on.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the build environment with strong access controls and monitoring.
        *   Implement integrity checks for GraalVM build tools and dependencies.
        *   Use hardened build agents and containers.
        *   Regularly scan the build environment for vulnerabilities affecting GraalVM and related tools.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in GraalVM Compiler](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_graalvm_compiler.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the GraalVM compiler itself could be exploited to generate malicious or vulnerable native images.
    *   **GraalVM Contribution:** The GraalVM compiler is the core component responsible for translating application code into the native executable. Vulnerabilities here directly impact the security of the output generated by GraalVM.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the GraalVM compiler's optimization phase allows an attacker to craft specific input code that, when compiled by GraalVM, leads to a buffer overflow in the generated native image.
    *   **Impact:** Generation of vulnerable applications, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep GraalVM updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Monitor GraalVM security advisories and release notes.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the generated native image to detect potential issues introduced by the GraalVM compilation process.

## Attack Surface: [Substrate VM Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/substrate_vm_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities within the Substrate VM, the lightweight runtime environment for Native Images, could be exploited.
    *   **GraalVM Contribution:** Native Images rely on the Substrate VM, a core component of GraalVM Native Image, for execution. Vulnerabilities within this VM directly impact the security of the running application.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Substrate VM's memory management, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the running native image.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application runtime environment, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep GraalVM updated to benefit from Substrate VM security fixes.
        *   Monitor GraalVM security advisories specifically related to the Substrate VM.
        *   Consider security hardening the operating system and environment where the native image, powered by the Substrate VM, runs.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks on GraalVM Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_on_graalvm_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** GraalVM itself relies on various dependencies. If any of these dependencies are compromised, it could introduce vulnerabilities into the GraalVM build process or the generated native images.
    *   **GraalVM Contribution:** As a complex software project, GraalVM relies on external libraries and components during its build process. Compromises in these dependencies can propagate to GraalVM and affect the security of applications built with it.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor compromises a library used by the GraalVM compiler's build process, injecting malicious code that gets included in the generated native images via the compromised GraalVM build.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into applications built with the compromised GraalVM version.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use trusted sources for GraalVM downloads.
        *   Verify the integrity of GraalVM distributions using checksums or signatures.
        *   Be aware of the dependencies used by GraalVM and monitor them for vulnerabilities.
