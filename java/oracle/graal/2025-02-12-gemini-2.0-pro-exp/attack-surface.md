# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/graal

## Attack Surface: [Language Boundary Exploits](./attack_surfaces/language_boundary_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between different languages within the GraalVM polyglot environment.
*   **How GraalVM Contributes:** GraalVM's core feature is enabling interoperability between multiple languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, LLVM bitcode, etc.). This creates complex interaction boundaries *managed by GraalVM itself*.
*   **Example:** A crafted JavaScript input to a GraalJS context, exposed to a Java application, could exploit a vulnerability in the GraalJS-to-Java bridge (a *GraalVM component*) to call arbitrary Java methods with malicious parameters, bypassing intended security checks.
*   **Impact:** Code execution in the host JVM, data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate all data crossing language boundaries.  Treat data from guest languages as untrusted.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Restrict the permissions of guest language contexts.  Limit access to Java APIs and resources. Use the `Value` API for safe data exchange.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Utilize GraalVM's sandboxing features (e.g., `--sandbox` option where available) to isolate guest languages.  This directly leverages GraalVM's isolation mechanisms.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep GraalVM and all language implementations up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities *within GraalVM and its components*.
    *   **Context Separation:** Use separate `Context` instances (a GraalVM concept) for untrusted code and carefully manage their interactions.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the code that handles language interoperability, focusing on the GraalVM-specific interaction points.

## Attack Surface: [Native Image - Reflection/Dynamic Loading Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/native_image_-_reflectiondynamic_loading_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or incomplete configuration of reflection and dynamic class loading in Native Image applications, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **How GraalVM Contributes:** Native Image's ahead-of-time compilation *requires* explicit configuration for reflection and dynamic class loading, unlike the traditional JVM. This configuration is *specific to GraalVM's Native Image*.
*   **Example:** An application uses reflection to load a class based on user input.  If the Native Image configuration (a *GraalVM-specific file*) is missing the necessary entries, the application might fail.  An attacker could provide a class name that *is* present in the configuration but performs malicious actions.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected behavior, potential for code execution if an attacker-controlled class is loaded.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Dynamic Features:** Reduce reliance on reflection and dynamic class loading in Native Image applications.
    *   **Configuration Generation:** Use the `native-image-agent` (a *GraalVM tool*) to automatically generate the necessary configuration files.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test the Native Image application to ensure all required classes and resources are correctly included and loaded. This testing is crucial due to Native Image's unique behavior.
    *   **Explicit Configuration:** Manually review and refine the generated configuration files to ensure accuracy and completeness.  Use `--initialize-at-build-time` and `--initialize-at-run-time` (GraalVM Native Image options) judiciously.
    *   **Input Validation:** If dynamic loading is unavoidable, strictly validate any user-provided input that influences class loading.

## Attack Surface: [Native Image - Static Analysis Bypass](./attack_surfaces/native_image_-_static_analysis_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** The difficulty of performing dynamic analysis and runtime security monitoring on Native Image applications, potentially allowing vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security tools.
*   **How GraalVM Contributes:** Native Image compiles Java code to a standalone executable, removing the JVM bytecode that many security tools rely on for instrumentation. This is a *direct consequence of using GraalVM Native Image*.
*   **Example:** A runtime security tool that detects SQL injection by monitoring JDBC calls might not function correctly with a Native Image, as the JDBC calls are compiled directly into native code.
*   **Impact:** Undetected vulnerabilities, increased difficulty in identifying and responding to security incidents.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Static Analysis Emphasis:** Prioritize static analysis techniques during development.
    *   **Native Image-Specific Tools:** Utilize security tools specifically designed for analyzing Native Images (tools that understand the output of GraalVM's compilation).
    *   **Hybrid Approach:** Consider a hybrid deployment where some components run in a traditional JVM for monitoring, while performance-critical parts are compiled to Native Image.
    *   **Enhanced Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging and auditing to capture security-relevant events.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on potential security vulnerabilities that might be missed by dynamic analysis.

## Attack Surface: [Foreign Function Interface (FFI) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/foreign_function_interface__ffi__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in native code (e.g., C/C++) accessed via GraalVM's FFI mechanisms (Sulong, or custom bindings).
*   **How GraalVM Contributes:** GraalVM provides mechanisms *within GraalVM itself* (like Sulong) to interact with native code, inheriting the security risks associated with native code execution, but also providing potential mitigation strategies.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow in a C library called from a GraalVM-hosted Python script (via GraalPy's FFI, a *GraalVM-provided feature*) could overwrite memory within the GraalVM process, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Code execution in the GraalVM process, data breaches, privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Memory-Safe Languages:** Prefer memory-safe languages (like Rust) for native interactions whenever possible.
    *   **Native Code Auditing:** Thoroughly audit and vet any native code used.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Employ sandboxing techniques (e.g., seccomp, AppArmor) to restrict the capabilities of native code.
    *   **Sulong Sandboxing:** If using Sulong (GraalVM's LLVM bitcode interpreter), leverage its *built-in sandboxing features*, which are part of GraalVM.
    *   **Input Validation:** Carefully validate any data passed to native code.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep native libraries and GraalVM's FFI components up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [GraalVM Updater (gu) Compromise](./attack_surfaces/graalvm_updater__gu__compromise.md)

* **Description:** An attacker compromises the `gu` tool or its update mechanism to install malicious GraalVM components.
    * **How GraalVM Contributes:** `gu` is the *official GraalVM tool* for managing GraalVM components, making it a direct target for attacks against GraalVM installations.
    * **Example:** An attacker intercepts the network traffic between `gu` and the update server, injecting a trojanized version of a language implementation (e.g., a backdoored GraalJS). This directly compromises the GraalVM installation.
    * **Impact:** Installation of malicious code, complete system compromise.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trusted Source:** Obtain `gu` and GraalVM distributions only from official, trusted sources (e.g., the official GraalVM website).
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify the integrity of downloaded components using checksums (SHA-256, etc.) provided by the official source.
        *   **Secure Network:** Use a secure, trusted network connection when updating GraalVM. Avoid public Wi-Fi for updates.
        *   **Code Signing (Future):** Ideally, GraalVM components would be digitally signed, allowing `gu` to verify their authenticity. (This is a desirable future improvement for GraalVM.)
