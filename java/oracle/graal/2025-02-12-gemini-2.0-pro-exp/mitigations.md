## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Reflection Configuration via Tracing Agent](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_reflection_configuration_via_tracing_agent.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Integrate the Tracing Agent:** Add the `-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=<output-directory>` option to your application's JVM startup command during development and testing. `<output-directory>` should be a dedicated directory for the agent's output.
    2.  **Run Comprehensive Tests:** Execute a wide range of tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) while the tracing agent is active. Ensure all code paths that use reflection, JNI, resources, or dynamic proxies are exercised.
    3.  **Collect Configuration Files:** The agent will generate JSON files (`reflect-config.json`, `resource-config.json`, `jni-config.json`, `proxy-config.json`, `serialization-config.json`) in the specified output directory.
    4.  **Refine Configuration:** Review the generated configuration files. Remove unnecessary entries. Be as specific as possible, listing only the classes, methods, fields, and resources that *must* be accessible. Avoid wildcard entries or overly permissive settings (`"allowAll": true`).
    5.  **Integrate into Build:** Add the `-H:ConfigurationFileDirectories=<output-directory>` option to your `native-image` build command, pointing to the directory containing the refined configuration files.
    6.  **Regular Updates:** Repeat steps 1-5 whenever your application's code changes, especially if those changes involve reflection, JNI, resources, or dynamic proxies. Integrate this into your CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Reflection (Severity: High):** Attackers could use reflection to instantiate arbitrary classes and invoke methods, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Unauthorized Resource Access (Severity: Medium):** Attackers could access sensitive resources (configuration files, data) not intended to be exposed.
    *   **JNI Exploitation (Severity: High):** Vulnerabilities in native code accessed via JNI can bypass Java security.
    *   **Dynamic Proxy Manipulation (Severity: Medium):** Attackers could interfere with the behavior of dynamic proxies.
    *   **Serialization/Deserialization Attacks (Severity: High):** Uncontrolled deserialization of untrusted data can lead to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Reflection:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Unauthorized Resource Access:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **JNI Exploitation:** Risk reduced (mitigates *discovery* of JNI entry points, but not vulnerabilities *within* the native code). Severity remains High if native code is vulnerable.
    *   **Dynamic Proxy Manipulation:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Serialization/Deserialization Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Tracing agent is used during development, but configuration files are not regularly updated and are not integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Configuration is not as specific as it could be.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated regeneration of configuration files in CI/CD. Refinement of configuration files to be more specific. Regular review of configuration files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize and Secure Polyglot Interactions](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_and_secure_polyglot_interactions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Context Isolation:** Create separate `Context` instances for different guest languages or modules, even if they need to interact.
    2.  **Restrict Host Access:** When creating a `Context`, use the most restrictive settings possible:
        *   `allowAllAccess(false)`
        *   `allowHostAccess(HostAccess.NONE)` (or a very specific `HostAccess` configuration built with `HostAccess.newBuilder()`)
        *   `allowIO(false)`
        *   `allowCreateThread(false)`
        *   `allowHostClassLookup` with a strict predicate that only allows access to specific, necessary classes.
        *   `allowHostSymbolAccess` only if absolutely necessary and with careful consideration.
    3.  **Data Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* data passed between languages. Treat data from other languages as untrusted. Validate data types, lengths, and contents.
    4.  **Controlled Communication:** If different `Context` instances need to communicate, use explicit and secure mechanisms like shared memory (with appropriate synchronization) or message queues, rather than relying on direct access through the polyglot API.
    5. **Regular Updates:** Keep all guest language implementations up to date.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Language Code Injection (Severity: High):** An attacker could inject malicious code in one language (e.g., JavaScript) that executes in another (e.g., Java), bypassing security.
    *   **Unauthorized Host Access (Severity: High):** A guest language could gain unauthorized access to Java classes, methods, and resources.
    *   **Guest Language Vulnerabilities (Severity: Medium/High):** Vulnerabilities in a guest language implementation could be exploited.
    *   **Data Tampering (Severity: Medium):** Data passed between languages could be modified.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Language Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Unauthorized Host Access:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Guest Language Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (mitigates the *impact* by limiting access). Severity remains dependent on the specific guest language.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. `HostAccess` is restricted, but not to the most restrictive level. Data sanitization is not consistently applied. Separate Contexts are not always used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent use of separate `Context` instances. Stricter `HostAccess` configurations. Comprehensive data sanitization for all inter-language communication. Regular updates of guest language implementations are not automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Serialization Alternatives (with GraalVM Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_serialization_alternatives__with_graalvm_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Java Serialization:** Prefer JSON (Jackson, Gson) or Protocol Buffers.
    2.  **GraalVM Configuration:** If using a library like Jackson, ensure it's properly configured for Native Image. This often involves providing metadata about the classes to be serialized/deserialized. *Use the tracing agent to help identify these classes and generate the necessary configuration files.*
    3.  **Data Validation:** Thoroughly validate all deserialized data, regardless of the mechanism.
    4.  **Last Resort: Custom ObjectInputStream (with Tracing Agent):** If Java serialization *must* be used, implement a custom `ObjectInputStream` that overrides `resolveClass`. In `resolveClass`, check if the class is on an explicit allowlist. Reject any class not on the allowlist. *Use the tracing agent to generate the initial allowlist.*

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Deserialization Attacks (Severity: High):** Uncontrolled deserialization of untrusted data can lead to arbitrary code execution.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Deserialization Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low if alternatives are used; High to Medium if a custom `ObjectInputStream` is used).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. JSON serialization is used in some parts, but Java serialization is still present. No custom `ObjectInputStream`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Complete migration away from Java serialization. Implementation of a custom `ObjectInputStream` as a fallback. Consistent data validation after deserialization.  Proper GraalVM configuration for the chosen serialization library (using the tracing agent).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Native Image Dependency Compatibility Checks (using the Tracing Agent)](./mitigation_strategies/native_image_dependency_compatibility_checks__using_the_tracing_agent_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Dependency Analysis:** Before adding a new dependency, use the `native-image-agent` in a test environment with the new dependency included.
    2. **Configuration Generation:** Run your application with the tracing agent and a representative set of tests. The agent will generate configuration files that reflect the dependency's use of reflection, JNI, resources, etc.
    3. **Compatibility Assessment:** Examine the generated configuration files.  Large or complex configuration files may indicate potential compatibility issues or a larger attack surface.
    4. **Iterative Refinement:** If issues are found, try to find alternative dependencies or work with the library maintainers to improve Native Image compatibility.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
     *   **Native Image Incompatibility (Severity: Medium):** Some dependencies may not work correctly with Native Image, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
     *   **Indirect Reflection/JNI Usage (Severity: Medium/High):** Dependencies might use reflection or JNI internally, which needs to be properly configured for Native Image. This helps uncover those hidden uses.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Native Image Incompatibility:** Risk reduced (proactive checking helps prevent integration of incompatible dependencies).
    *   **Indirect Reflection/JNI Usage:** Risk reduced by identifying and configuring these usages.

* **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.

* **Missing Implementation:**  Implementation of a process to use the tracing agent to check new dependencies for Native Image compatibility *before* they are integrated into the main codebase.
