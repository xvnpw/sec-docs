## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Native Image Vulnerabilities/Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_native_image_vulnerabilitiesmisconfigurations.md)

*   **JNI Abuse [HIGH RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in native code called through the Java Native Interface (JNI). Native Image's security relies on the closed-world assumption, but JNI calls escape this protection.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   **Native Code Call {CRITICAL}:**
            *   **Description:**  The attacker crafts input that triggers a vulnerability in the native code (e.g., buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, use-after-free). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the native process, effectively bypassing all Native Image security.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the presence and vulnerability of native code)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE, potentially bypassing all Native Image protections)
            *   **Effort:** Medium to High (Depends on the complexity of the native code vulnerability)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires knowledge of native code exploitation)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Standard native code vulnerability detection techniques apply)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Polyglot Capabilities & Language Interactions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_polyglot_capabilities_&_language_interactions.md)

*   **Language Injection:**

    *   **JavaScript to Java [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that is then executed within the GraalVM context. This code can then interact with Java code, potentially calling methods with unexpected arguments or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Java API exposed to JavaScript.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the application's input handling and polyglot API design)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (RCE or data exfiltration, depending on the exploited Java methods)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires understanding of both languages and their interaction)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (May require cross-language analysis)

    *   **LLVM Bitcode [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** If the application allows the execution of user-supplied LLVM bitcode, this is an extremely high-risk scenario. LLVM bitcode is essentially native code, and its execution bypasses most security mechanisms.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (Most applications *shouldn't* allow user-provided bitcode)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Essentially native code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low (If the application allows it, the attack is trivial)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires knowledge of LLVM bitcode)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If user-provided bitcode is allowed, it should be flagged as high risk)
* **Sandbox Escapes:**
    * **Bypass Security Manager:**
        *   **Description:** GraalVM provides sandboxing capabilities to restrict guest languages. Attackers might try to find vulnerabilities in the sandbox implementation to escape and gain access to the host environment.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (GraalVM's sandbox is generally robust, but vulnerabilities can exist)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full access to the host environment)
        *   **Effort:** High to Very High (Requires finding a new or unpatched sandbox escape vulnerability)
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard (May appear as legitimate application behavior until the escape is complete)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node.md)

*   **Attacker Achieves RCE or Data Exfiltration on GraalVM-Powered Application {CRITICAL}:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful completion of the attack. All paths in the attack tree lead to this node.
