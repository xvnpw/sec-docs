# Attack Surface Analysis for oracle/graal

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Reflection Configuration](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_reflection_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsafe Reflection Configuration
    *   **Description:**  GraalVM's native image generation requires explicit configuration for reflection. If this configuration is overly permissive or incorrectly defined, it can expose internal application components and methods that should not be accessible at runtime.
    *   **How Graal Contributes:** Unlike traditional JVMs where reflection is largely dynamic, GraalVM needs to know reflection usage at build time. Misconfiguration during this phase directly impacts the attack surface of the compiled native image.
    *   **Example:**  A configuration allows reflection on internal classes responsible for security checks. An attacker could then use reflection to bypass these checks.
    *   **Impact:** High - Allows attackers to bypass intended access controls, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only allow reflection for the absolutely necessary classes, methods, and fields.
        *   **Careful Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review reflection configuration files (`reflect-config.json`) and ensure they are as restrictive as possible.
        *   **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize tools that can analyze reflection configurations for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Runtime Checks (where feasible):** Implement additional runtime checks to validate the legitimacy of reflection calls.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Deserialization Configuration
    *   **Description:** Similar to reflection, serialization also requires explicit configuration in GraalVM native images. Incorrect or overly broad configuration can enable the deserialization of arbitrary classes, leading to insecure deserialization vulnerabilities if the application later deserializes untrusted data.
    *   **How Graal Contributes:** GraalVM's build-time analysis needs to know which classes might be deserialized. A permissive configuration opens the door for attackers to exploit deserialization flaws.
    *   **Example:** The serialization configuration allows deserialization of a class known to have gadget chains that can be exploited for remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Can lead to remote code execution if the application deserializes untrusted data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Deserialization:** Only allow deserialization of explicitly trusted classes.
        *   **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**  Prefer safer data exchange formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers when dealing with external input.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate any data being deserialized.
        *   **Use Deserialization Filters:** Implement deserialization filters to restrict the classes that can be deserialized at runtime.

## Attack Surface: [Truffle/Polyglot Language Interoperability Issues](./attack_surfaces/trufflepolyglot_language_interoperability_issues.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Truffle/Polyglot Language Interoperability Issues
    *   **Description:** When using GraalVM's Truffle framework to embed other languages, security vulnerabilities can arise from the interaction between these languages and the host Java environment. This includes potential sandbox escapes or unexpected behavior due to type confusion or privilege escalation across language boundaries.
    *   **How Graal Contributes:** GraalVM's polyglot capabilities introduce a new dimension of interaction between different runtime environments, potentially creating unforeseen security risks.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in the JavaScript engine allows an attacker to escape the JavaScript sandbox and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Java application.
    *   **Impact:** High - Could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Guest Language Implementations:** Use up-to-date and secure versions of the guest language implementations.
        *   **Strict Sandboxing:** Enforce strict sandboxing for guest languages to limit their access to host resources.
        *   **Secure Interoperability APIs:** Carefully design and review the APIs used for communication between languages.
        *   **Input Validation at Language Boundaries:** Validate data passed between different languages.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Guest Code:** Grant guest code only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Build-time Dependency Chain Compromise](./attack_surfaces/build-time_dependency_chain_compromise.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Build-time Dependency Chain Compromise
    *   **Description:** The native image generation process relies on various build-time dependencies (e.g., compilers, linkers, libraries). If any of these dependencies are compromised, malicious code could be injected into the generated native image.
    *   **How Graal Contributes:** The native image build process introduces a dependency chain that, if not secured, can be a point of attack.
    *   **Example:** A compromised library used during the linking phase injects malicious code into the final executable.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Could lead to the distribution of backdoored applications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use secure dependency management practices and tools.
        *   **Verification of Dependencies:** Verify the integrity of build-time dependencies using checksums or digital signatures.
        *   **Secure Build Environment:** Ensure the build environment is secure and isolated.
        *   **Supply Chain Security Practices:** Implement robust supply chain security practices.
