# Threat Model Analysis for oracle/graal

## Threat: [Insecure Reflection Configuration leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/insecure_reflection_configuration_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit overly permissive or incomplete reflection configuration in a GraalVM Native Image. They might manipulate the `reflect-config.json` or related configurations to gain access to private methods, fields, or constructors that were not intended to be accessible at runtime. This could allow them to bypass security checks or manipulate internal application state.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of application behavior, privilege escalation, or even remote code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** GraalVM Native Image, specifically the reflection configuration mechanism and the Substrate VM's runtime handling of reflection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring reflection. Only allow reflection for explicitly required classes, methods, and fields.
    *   Thoroughly review and audit the `reflect-config.json` file or programmatic reflection configurations.
    *   Use tools provided by GraalVM to analyze reflection usage and identify potential overreach.
    *   Consider using alternatives to reflection where possible, such as interfaces or code generation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Build-Time Dependency Vulnerabilities in Native Image](./threats/exploiting_build-time_dependency_vulnerabilities_in_native_image.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could compromise a build-time dependency used during the GraalVM Native Image creation process. This could involve injecting malicious code into a library or tool that is used to process or link the application code. The malicious code would then be embedded within the final native executable.
*   **Impact:**  The resulting native image would be compromised, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system when the application is run. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** GraalVM Native Image build tools and the dependency management system used *by* the GraalVM build process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust dependency management practices, including using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly update GraalVM build tools and any dependencies it uses to their latest secure versions.
    *   Use checksum verification or other integrity checks for downloaded dependencies used by the GraalVM build.
    *   Consider using a controlled and isolated build environment to minimize the risk of compromise during native image creation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Language Interoperability Vulnerabilities in Polyglot Applications](./threats/exploiting_language_interoperability_vulnerabilities_in_polyglot_applications.md)

*   **Description:** In applications utilizing GraalVM's polyglot capabilities, an attacker could exploit weaknesses in the interoperability between different programming languages. This might involve passing malicious data from one language's context to another without proper sanitization or validation, leading to vulnerabilities like injection attacks or type confusion.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution in the context of another language, data corruption, or bypassing security mechanisms implemented in one of the languages.
*   **Affected Component:** GraalVM's polyglot engine and the interop APIs used for communication between different language runtimes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat data crossing language boundaries as untrusted and implement strict input validation and sanitization.
    *   Be aware of the security implications and differences in language semantics when interacting between languages.
    *   Use secure interop patterns and avoid passing complex or sensitive data directly between languages without careful consideration.
    *   Regularly update GraalVM to benefit from security fixes in the polyglot engine.

## Threat: [Code Injection through Dynamic Polyglot Code Evaluation](./threats/code_injection_through_dynamic_polyglot_code_evaluation.md)

*   **Description:** If an application dynamically evaluates code from user input using GraalVM's polyglot capabilities (e.g., using `Context.eval`), an attacker could inject malicious code in any of the supported languages. This injected code would then be executed within the GraalVM context.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to compromise the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Affected Component:** GraalVM's `Context.eval` methods and the polyglot engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid dynamic code evaluation from untrusted sources whenever possible.
    *   If dynamic evaluation is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent code injection.
    *   Use sandboxing or other isolation techniques to limit the impact of potentially malicious code.
    *   Consider using more restricted evaluation contexts or languages with stronger security features for dynamic code execution.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Substrate VM](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_the_substrate_vm.md)

*   **Description:** The Substrate VM, which is the runtime environment for GraalVM Native Images, could contain its own vulnerabilities. An attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to gain control of the application or the underlying system.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, or other forms of system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** GraalVM Substrate VM.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep GraalVM updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches in the Substrate VM.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to GraalVM.
    *   Implement general security best practices for the operating system and environment where the native image is running.
