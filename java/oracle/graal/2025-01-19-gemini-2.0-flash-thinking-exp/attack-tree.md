## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Native Image Compilation Weaknesses -> Insecure Build Configuration -> Disable Security Features](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_native_image_compilation_weaknesses_-_insecure_build_configuration_-_disabl_64cd2256.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker exploits a lapse in the build configuration process where security features of the GraalVM native image, such as sandboxing or memory protection mechanisms, are intentionally or unintentionally disabled.
    * Impact: Disabling security features significantly increases the attack surface and makes the application more vulnerable to various exploits, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    * Likelihood: Medium - Depends on the rigor of the build process and security awareness of the development team.
    * Effort: Low - Often involves simple configuration changes or omissions.
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate - Requires basic understanding of build processes and GraalVM configuration.
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy (if build process is monitored) / Hard (if not)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Native Image Compilation Weaknesses -> Insecure Build Configuration -> Include Unnecessary or Vulnerable Dependencies in Native Image](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_native_image_compilation_weaknesses_-_insecure_build_configuration_-_includ_987449c7.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker leverages vulnerabilities present in third-party libraries or dependencies that are unnecessarily included in the GraalVM native image during the build process.
    * Impact: Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    * Likelihood: Medium/High -  Due to the prevalence of vulnerabilities in software dependencies.
    * Effort: Low/Medium - Attackers can use automated tools to scan for and exploit known vulnerabilities.
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate - Exploiting known vulnerabilities often requires readily available tools and scripts.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (with dependency scanning) / Hard (without)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Native Image Compilation Weaknesses -> Exploiting Build-Time Dependencies -> Compromise Build Environment](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_native_image_compilation_weaknesses_-_exploiting_build-time_dependencies_-__1a03a47a.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker targets the build environment itself, aiming to compromise the systems or tools used to compile the GraalVM native image. This could involve injecting malicious code into build scripts, compromising build servers, or manipulating the dependency resolution process.
    * Impact: A compromised build environment allows the attacker to inject malicious code directly into the application during the build process, making it extremely difficult to detect and potentially leading to complete control over the application and its environment.
    * Likelihood: Low/Medium - Requires more sophisticated techniques and access to the build infrastructure.
    * Effort: Medium/High -  Involves reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities in build systems, and maintaining persistence.
    * Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced - Requires knowledge of build systems, infrastructure security, and potentially exploit development.
    * Detection Difficulty: Hard -  Requires robust monitoring of the build environment and integrity checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Exploit Polyglot Interoperability Issues -> Code Injection via Polyglot Interface -> Inject Malicious Code through Scripting Languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_exploit_polyglot_interoperability_issues_-_code_injection_via_polyglot_interface_-__4ceabc8f.md)

* Attack Vector: The attacker exploits the interoperability features of GraalVM to inject malicious code written in a scripting language (like JavaScript or Python) into the application. This often occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being passed to a scripting engine.
    * Impact: Successful code injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
    * Likelihood: Medium/High -  A common vulnerability in web applications that utilize scripting languages.
    * Effort: Low/Medium -  Simple injection attacks can be carried out with basic scripting knowledge.
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate -  Basic understanding of scripting languages and injection techniques is sufficient.
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium -  Can be detected with proper input validation and security policies, but often overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 1: Insecure Build Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1_insecure_build_configuration.md)

* Attack Vector: As described in High-Risk Paths 1 and 2, a flawed build configuration acts as an enabler for multiple high-risk scenarios.
    * Impact: Increases the attack surface and weakens the application's defenses.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy/Hard (depending on monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 2: Include Unnecessary or Vulnerable Dependencies in Native Image](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_2_include_unnecessary_or_vulnerable_dependencies_in_native_image.md)

* Attack Vector:  Introducing known vulnerabilities through poorly managed dependencies.
    * Impact: Exposes the application to known exploits.
    * Likelihood: Medium/High
    * Effort: Low/Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium/Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 3: Compromise Build Environment](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_3_compromise_build_environment.md)

* Attack Vector: Gaining control over the systems used to build the application.
    * Impact: Allows for the injection of malicious code directly into the application.
    * Likelihood: Low/Medium
    * Effort: Medium/High
    * Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced
    * Detection Difficulty: Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node 4: Code Injection via Polyglot Interface](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_4_code_injection_via_polyglot_interface.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting the interaction between different languages to inject malicious code.
    * Impact: Direct path to arbitrary code execution.
    * Likelihood: Medium/High
    * Effort: Low/Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
