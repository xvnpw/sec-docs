## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Native Image Build Process Leading to Insecure Binaries](./threats/misconfiguration_of_native_image_build_process_leading_to_insecure_binaries.md)

**Description:** Developers misconfigure the native image build process (e.g., overly permissive reflection). Attackers exploit these misconfigurations in the deployed native image to increase attack surface or bypass security measures.

**Impact:** Increased attack surface, exposure of internal application details, exploitation of reflection vulnerabilities, potential for code execution or data access bypass.

**Graal Component Affected:** Native Image Build Configuration, Reflection Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Adhere to GraalVM security best practices for native image configuration.
*   Minimize reflection usage and carefully configure reflection metadata.
*   Utilize the `native-image` agent to automatically generate reflection configuration.
*   Conduct thorough reviews and audits of native image build configurations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data During Native Image Build Process](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_during_native_image_build_process.md)

**Description:** Sensitive data like API keys or passwords are inadvertently included in the native image during build. Attackers gaining access to the native image can extract these secrets.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to external services, compromise of application security posture.

**Graal Component Affected:** Native Image Build Process, Application Packaging.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid embedding sensitive data directly in application code or build configurations.
*   Employ secure secret management solutions to inject secrets at runtime.
*   Sanitize build logs and artifacts to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information.

## Threat: [Code Injection Vulnerabilities through Polyglot Interoperability](./threats/code_injection_vulnerabilities_through_polyglot_interoperability.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code in one language that is executed in another language within the polyglot application due to improper input sanitization or insecure language boundaries.

**Impact:** Code execution, data breach, cross-language attacks, full application compromise.

**Graal Component Affected:** Polyglot Engine, Language Interoperability APIs.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all inputs passed between different languages.
*   Enforce strict language boundaries and implement robust access control policies.
*   Adopt secure coding practices for polyglot interactions.
*   Consider using language-specific security features and sandboxing.

## Threat: [Type Confusion and Boundary Crossing Vulnerabilities](./threats/type_confusion_and_boundary_crossing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Mismatches in data types between languages in a polyglot application lead to type confusion. Attackers exploit these mismatches to bypass security checks or cause memory corruption, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact:** Code execution, memory corruption, security bypass, privilege escalation.

**Graal Component Affected:** Polyglot Engine, Type Conversion Mechanisms, Language Interoperability APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test polyglot interactions and data type conversions between languages.
*   Understand data type mappings and potential conversion issues between languages.
*   Utilize type-safe language interoperability mechanisms where possible.

## Threat: [Unintended Information Leakage Between Languages](./threats/unintended_information_leakage_between_languages.md)

**Description:** Shared resources between languages in a polyglot application are not properly secured. Attackers exploit this to access sensitive data intended for one language from another language without proper authorization.

**Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data across language boundaries, data breach, privacy violations.

**Graal Component Affected:** Polyglot Engine, Shared Memory Management, Resource Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control policies for all shared resources between languages.
*   Minimize sharing of sensitive data across language boundaries.
*   Utilize language-specific security features to isolate data and resources.

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities in Guest Language Runtimes](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_in_guest_language_runtimes.md)

**Description:** GraalVM relies on guest language runtimes (e.g., JavaScript, Python) which may contain vulnerabilities. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the polyglot application, potentially achieving code execution or sandbox escape.

**Impact:** Code execution within the guest language runtime, denial of service, application compromise, sandbox escape.

**Graal Component Affected:** Guest Language Runtimes (e.g., JavaScript Engine, Python Runtime), Polyglot Engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep GraalVM and all guest language runtimes updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Actively monitor security advisories for guest language runtimes.
*   Limit the use of potentially vulnerable guest language features if possible.

## Threat: [Complex Security Policy Management in Polyglot Environments](./threats/complex_security_policy_management_in_polyglot_environments.md)

**Description:** Managing security policies across multiple languages in a polyglot application is complex and error-prone. Misconfigurations can lead to inconsistent security enforcement and policy bypasses, creating vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Inconsistent security enforcement, security policy bypass, increased risk of vulnerabilities, potential for privilege escalation.

**Graal Component Affected:** Polyglot Engine, Security Policy Management, Language Interoperability APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
