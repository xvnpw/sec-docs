# BUSINESS POSTURE

The GraalVM project aims to provide a high-performance polyglot virtual machine that can execute applications written in various programming languages. It focuses on improving application performance through advanced compilation techniques, including ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The project also emphasizes interoperability between different programming languages, allowing developers to combine components written in different languages within a single application.

Business priorities and goals for the GraalVM project include:

- Performance: Enhance the execution speed and efficiency of applications.
- Polyglotism: Enable seamless integration and execution of code written in multiple programming languages.
- Developer Productivity: Simplify development by allowing developers to choose the best language for each task and reuse existing codebases.
- Platform Adoption: Increase the adoption of GraalVM as a runtime environment for various types of applications.
- Innovation: Drive innovation in virtual machine technology and programming language interoperability.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

- Security vulnerabilities in the GraalVM runtime environment could compromise applications running on it.
- Complexity of polyglot environments might introduce new attack vectors or make security analysis more challenging.
- Supply chain risks associated with dependencies and build processes of GraalVM.
- Compatibility issues and unexpected behavior in polyglot applications could lead to operational disruptions.
- Performance regressions in certain scenarios could negatively impact user experience and business operations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning of the GraalVM codebase (Likely, but needs confirmation from project documentation).
- security control: Secure coding practices followed by the development team (Likely, but needs confirmation from project documentation).
- security control: Use of standard build tools and processes (GitHub Actions for CI, based on repository observation).
- security control: Code reviews for contributions (Standard practice for open-source projects, observable in pull request history).
- security control: Community engagement and reporting of security issues (Open-source nature encourages community contributions and issue reporting).

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities in the complex runtime environment.
- accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by GraalVM.
- accepted risk: Security implications of running untrusted code in a polyglot environment.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- security control: Conduct regular penetration testing of GraalVM in representative deployment scenarios.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers building applications on GraalVM.
- security control: Implement runtime security mechanisms to mitigate risks from dynamically loaded code and polyglot interactions.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
  - Not directly applicable to GraalVM itself, as it is a runtime environment. Authentication is the responsibility of applications running on GraalVM.
- Authorization:
  - GraalVM should provide mechanisms for applications to implement fine-grained authorization controls.
  - Applications running on GraalVM need to manage authorization based on their specific requirements.
- Input Validation:
  - GraalVM should enforce strict input validation at the boundaries between different language runtimes to prevent injection attacks.
  - Applications running on GraalVM must perform thorough input validation for all external data sources.
- Cryptography:
  - GraalVM should provide secure and performant cryptographic libraries for applications that require encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
  - Applications should use strong cryptographic algorithms and best practices for key management.

2. The CI System (GitHub Actions, based on repository observation) is triggered by code changes.
3. The CI System sets up a Build Environment.
4. Dependency Management tools resolve and download project dependencies.
5. Compilation & Packaging steps compile the code and package it into build artifacts (e.g., binaries, container images).
6. Security Checks are performed, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning to identify vulnerabilities.
7. Build Artifacts are generated if security checks pass.
8. Build Artifacts are stored in an Artifact Repository for deployment.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Secure Source Code Repository (GitHub): Access control, branch protection, audit logging.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Application code: Confidentiality and integrity of application source code and compiled binaries. Sensitivity: High (Confidential, Integrity).
- Application data: Data processed and stored by applications running on GraalVM. Sensitivity: Varies depending on the application (Confidential, Integrity, Availability).
- Build artifacts: Integrity of build artifacts to prevent supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: High (Integrity).
- GraalVM runtime environment: Integrity and availability of the GraalVM runtime itself. Sensitivity: High (Integrity, Availability).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What are the specific security compliance requirements for applications built on GraalVM (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?
- What is the target deployment environment for GraalVM applications (cloud, on-premise, embedded)?
- What is the expected level of security expertise of developers using GraalVM?
- Are there specific performance-critical applications that are the primary focus for GraalVM adoption?
- What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in GraalVM?

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: Performance and polyglotism are key business drivers for GraalVM adoption. Security is a critical but secondary consideration compared to functionality and performance for initial adoption, but will become increasingly important as adoption grows.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The GraalVM project follows standard open-source security practices, but there is room for improvement in automated security checks and formal vulnerability management processes. Security is primarily focused on the GraalVM runtime environment itself, with application security being the responsibility of developers.
- DESIGN: The design assumes a typical server-side application deployment scenario in a cloud environment. The build process utilizes standard CI/CD practices and tools like GitHub Actions. The C4 model provides a high-level architectural overview and can be further detailed as needed.
