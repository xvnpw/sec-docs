## Attack Tree Path: [Publicly Known Vulnerability (CVE) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/publicly_known_vulnerability__cve___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Publicly Known Vulnerability (CVE) [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Description:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in third-party libraries or dependencies used by the Spring Boot application.
*   **Spring Boot Specific Context:** Spring Boot applications rely heavily on a vast ecosystem of dependencies managed through Maven or Gradle. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can directly impact the application.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **Dependency Analysis:** Attackers analyze the application's dependency tree (e.g., using `mvn dependency:tree` or `dependency-check:aggregate`) to identify used libraries and their versions.
    *   **CVE Lookup:** They search for known CVEs associated with the identified library versions using public databases (NVD, CVE.org) or vulnerability scanners.
    *   **Exploit Development/Acquisition:** If a relevant CVE exists, attackers either find publicly available exploits or develop their own.
    *   **Exploit Execution:** They craft malicious requests or payloads that trigger the vulnerability in the application, leading to compromise.
*   **Example:** Exploiting Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) in Log4j if a Spring Boot application uses a vulnerable version of Log4j directly or indirectly through a dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL NODE] (via Dependency Vulnerability)**
*   **Description:**  This is the ultimate goal when exploiting dependency vulnerabilities. Attackers aim to achieve Remote Code Execution, allowing them to run arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Spring Boot application.
*   **Spring Boot Specific Context:** RCE vulnerabilities in dependencies can directly compromise the application's runtime environment, bypassing application-level security controls.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **Vulnerability Identification:** As described in "Publicly Known Vulnerability (CVE)".
    *   **Exploit Crafting for RCE:** Attackers focus on vulnerabilities that allow code execution. They craft exploit payloads that inject and execute malicious code on the server. This might involve:
        *   Exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities to execute code during object deserialization.
        *   Exploiting injection vulnerabilities (e.g., command injection, template injection) within the vulnerable dependency.
        *   Leveraging memory corruption vulnerabilities to gain control of program execution.
    *   **Post-Exploitation:** Once RCE is achieved, attackers can install backdoors, steal data, pivot to internal networks, or perform other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposed Actuator Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exposed_actuator_endpoints__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Exposed Actuator Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Description:** Spring Boot Actuator endpoints provide monitoring and management capabilities. If these endpoints are exposed to the public internet without proper authentication, they become a significant attack vector.
*   **Spring Boot Specific Context:** Actuators are a core feature of Spring Boot, often enabled by default. Misconfiguration leading to public exposure is a common issue.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **Endpoint Discovery:** Attackers scan for common Actuator endpoint paths (e.g., `/actuator`, `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`, etc.) using automated tools or manual browsing.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access Attempt:** They attempt to access these endpoints without providing any credentials.
    *   **Information Gathering:** If endpoints are exposed and unsecured, attackers can access sensitive information like:
        *   Application information (`/actuator/info`)
        *   Environment variables and configuration (`/actuator/env`) - potentially revealing database credentials, API keys, etc.
        *   System metrics (`/actuator/metrics`) - providing insights into application behavior.
        *   Loggers configuration (`/actuator/loggers`) - allowing manipulation of logging levels.
        *   Heap and thread dumps (`/actuator/heapdump`, `/actuator/threaddump`) - potentially revealing sensitive data in memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsecured Actuator Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/unsecured_actuator_endpoints__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Unsecured Actuator Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Description:** Even if Actuator endpoints are not directly exposed to the public internet, they might be accessible on internal networks or without proper authentication mechanisms in place.
*   **Spring Boot Specific Context:**  Default Spring Boot Actuator configuration often does not enforce authentication. Developers must explicitly configure Spring Security or other mechanisms to secure these endpoints.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **Endpoint Discovery:** Similar to "Exposed Actuator Endpoints", but potentially targeting internal networks or less obvious paths.
    *   **Bypass Authentication (if any weak mechanism exists):** If a weak or default authentication mechanism is in place, attackers attempt to bypass it (e.g., default credentials, weak passwords, easily bypassed custom authentication).
    *   **Exploitation:** Once access is gained, attackers can perform actions as described in "Exposed Actuator Endpoints" and potentially more dangerous actions like application manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sensitive Information Leakage via Actuator [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/sensitive_information_leakage_via_actuator__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Sensitive Information Leakage via Actuator [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Description:**  Unsecured Actuator endpoints can leak sensitive information that aids further attacks.
*   **Spring Boot Specific Context:** Actuator endpoints, by design, expose internal application details. If unsecured, this information becomes readily available to attackers.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **Access Unsecured Actuator Endpoints:** As described in "Exposed Actuator Endpoints" or "Unsecured Actuator Endpoints".
    *   **Information Extraction:** Attackers specifically target endpoints like `/actuator/env`, `/actuator/configprops`, `/actuator/beans`, `/actuator/mappings` to extract sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Chain:** Leaked information is used to:
        *   Gain deeper understanding of the application's architecture and internal workings.
        *   Identify potential vulnerabilities based on dependency versions, configuration details, or exposed internal paths.
        *   Obtain credentials (database passwords, API keys) from environment variables or configuration properties.
        *   Bypass security controls by understanding internal logic or access patterns.

*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **DevTools Detection:** Attackers check for the presence of DevTools by:
        *   Looking for the `/devtools` endpoint (though this might be disabled in recent versions).
        *   Checking for specific HTTP headers added by DevTools (e.g., `spring-boot-devtools-restart`).
    *   **Exploit DevTools Endpoints:** If DevTools is enabled, attackers can access exposed endpoints like:
        *   **Groovy Console:**  Provides a web-based Groovy shell, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.
        *   **LiveReload Server:**  Potentially exploitable for cross-site scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.

*   **Description:** Certain Actuator endpoints, if unsecured, allow attackers to manipulate the application's runtime behavior, leading to Denial of Service or potentially further compromise.
*   **Spring Boot Specific Context:**  Endpoints like `/actuator/shutdown`, `/actuator/loggers`, and `/actuator/env` (if writable) offer manipulation capabilities.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **Access Unsecured Actuator Endpoints:** As described previously.
    *   **Trigger Application Shutdown via `/actuator/shutdown` [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Attackers send a POST request to `/actuator/shutdown` (if enabled and unsecured) to immediately shut down the Spring Boot application, causing a Denial of Service.
    *   **Execute JMX Operations via `/actuator/jolokia` [CRITICAL NODE]:** If Jolokia Actuator endpoint is enabled and unsecured, attackers can use Jolokia's API to interact with Java Management Extensions (JMX) beans. This can potentially lead to:
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing JMX attributes to retrieve sensitive data.
        *   **Application Manipulation:** Modifying JMX attributes to alter application behavior.
        *   **Remote Code Execution:**  Exploiting JMX beans with methods that allow code execution (e.g., through MLet service or other vulnerable JMX beans).
    *   **Change Logging Levels via `/actuator/loggers`:** Attackers can modify logging levels (e.g., set root logger to `OFF`) to suppress logging of their malicious activities, making detection harder. They can also increase logging verbosity for reconnaissance purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Application Shutdown via `/actuator/shutdown` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_application_shutdown_via__actuatorshutdown___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Trigger Application Shutdown via `/actuator/shutdown` [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers send a POST request to `/actuator/shutdown` (if enabled and unsecured) to immediately shut down the Spring Boot application, causing a Denial of Service.
    *   **Action:** Cause a Denial of Service by shutting down the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute JMX Operations via `/actuator/jolokia` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_jmx_operations_via__actuatorjolokia___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Execute JMX Operations via `/actuator/jolokia` [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** If Jolokia Actuator endpoint is enabled and unsecured, attackers can use Jolokia's API to interact with Java Management Extensions (JMX) beans. This can potentially lead to:
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing JMX attributes to retrieve sensitive data.
        *   **Application Manipulation:** Modifying JMX attributes to alter application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/mass_assignment_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in Spring Data REST [CRITICAL NODE]**
*   **Description:** Spring Data REST automatically exposes JPA repositories as REST endpoints. Mass assignment vulnerabilities occur when these endpoints allow attackers to modify unintended fields of entities during updates or creations.
*   **Spring Boot Specific Context:** Spring Data REST simplifies REST API development but can introduce mass assignment risks if not properly secured.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    *   **Identify Spring Data REST Endpoints:** Attackers identify REST endpoints exposed by Spring Data REST, typically following patterns like `/api/{entityName}`.
    *   **Analyze Entity Structure:** They analyze the entity structure (e.g., by examining API documentation or making requests) to understand available fields and their properties.
    *   **Craft Malicious Request:** Attackers craft PUT or PATCH requests to update entities, including parameters that correspond to fields they are not intended to modify (e.g., `isAdmin`, `role`, `password`).
    *   **Privilege Escalation/Data Manipulation:** If mass assignment is successful, attackers can:
        *   Elevate their privileges by setting `isAdmin` or similar fields to `true`.
        *   Modify sensitive data fields they should not have access to.
        *   Bypass security checks by manipulating internal state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Binding Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/data_binding_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector: Data Binding Vulnerabilities in Spring MVC/WebFlux [CRITICAL NODE]**
