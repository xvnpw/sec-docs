It prioritizes developer productivity, ease of use, and convention over configuration. It enables rapid application prototyping and deployment, making it suitable for agile development environments.
 - Priority: Speed of development and time to market for applications.
 - Priority: Operational efficiency and ease of deployment.
 - Priority: Scalability and resilience of applications.
 - Priority: Developer experience and community support.

- Business Risks
 - Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in applications built with Spring Boot due to developer errors or misconfigurations.
 - Business Risk: Dependency management issues leading to vulnerable libraries being included in applications.
 - Business Risk: Operational risks associated with deploying and managing applications in various environments.
 - Business Risk: Performance bottlenecks in applications due to inefficient coding or configuration.
 - Business Risk: Lack of skilled developers proficient in Spring Boot and its ecosystem.
 - Business Risk: Compatibility issues with other systems and technologies.
 - Business Risk: Vendor lock-in to the Spring ecosystem.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls
 - security control: Dependency Management: Spring Boot uses Maven or Gradle for dependency management, allowing for control over included libraries. Described in: pom.xml and build.gradle files in the repository.
 - security control: Spring Security: Spring Boot integrates with Spring Security, a comprehensive and customizable security framework for authentication and authorization. Described in: Spring Security documentation and examples within the Spring Boot project.
 - security control: Secure Defaults: Spring Boot provides sensible default configurations that promote security, such as disabling certain features by default if they are not explicitly enabled. Described in: Spring Boot documentation and source code.
 - security control: HTTPS Configuration: Spring Boot simplifies the configuration of HTTPS for web applications. Described in: Spring Boot documentation and examples.
 - security control: Actuator Endpoints Security: Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, which provide operational information, can be secured using Spring Security. Described in: Spring Boot Actuator documentation.
 - security control: Input Validation: Spring Boot supports standard Java validation annotations for input validation. Described in: Spring Boot documentation and Java Bean Validation (JSR-380) specification.
 - security control: CSRF Protection: Spring Security provides default CSRF protection for web applications. Described in: Spring Security documentation.
 - security control: CORS Configuration: Spring Boot allows configuration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies. Described in: Spring Boot documentation.

- Accepted Risks
 - accepted risk: Reliance on developers to correctly implement security features provided by Spring Boot and Spring Security.
 - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies despite dependency management controls.
 - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of security settings leading to vulnerabilities.
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or operating system.
 - accepted risk: Social engineering and phishing attacks targeting developers or operators.
 - accepted risk: Insider threats from malicious or negligent employees.

- Recommended Security Controls
 - recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools integrated into the build pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
 - recommended security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
 - recommended security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools to test running applications for vulnerabilities.
 - recommended security control: Penetration testing by security experts to identify weaknesses in the application and infrastructure.
 - recommended security control: Security training for developers on secure coding practices and Spring Security best practices.
 - recommended security control: Regular security audits of the application and infrastructure.
 - recommended security control: Security incident response plan to handle security breaches effectively.
 - recommended security control: Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
 - recommended security control: Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) to detect and prevent attacks in runtime.

- Security Requirements
 - Authentication: Applications should implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities. Spring Security provides various authentication methods, including username/password, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
 - Authorization: Applications should enforce fine-grained authorization to control access to resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions. Spring Security provides role-based and permission-based authorization.
 - Input Validation: All user inputs should be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). Spring Boot supports Java Bean Validation and custom validation logic.
 - Cryptography: Sensitive data at rest and in transit should be encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms. Spring Security provides support for secure password hashing and HTTPS configuration. Applications may need to implement further encryption for sensitive data storage.
 - Session Management: Secure session management practices should be implemented to protect user sessions from hijacking and other attacks. Spring Security provides secure session management features.
 - Error Handling and Logging: Applications should handle errors gracefully and log security-related events for auditing and incident response. Spring Boot provides logging frameworks and error handling mechanisms.
 - Security Headers: Applications should configure security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security) to protect against various browser-based attacks. Spring Boot allows configuration of these headers.
 - Rate Limiting and Throttling: Implement rate limiting and throttling to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks. This can be implemented using Spring Security or external components.
