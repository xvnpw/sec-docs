# Attack Surface Analysis for spring-projects/spring-boot

## Attack Surface: [Actuator Endpoint Exposure](./attack_surfaces/actuator_endpoint_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Unsecured or improperly secured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints expose sensitive application and environment information, and can allow for remote control of the application.
*   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot Actuator provides these endpoints *by default*, making them readily available if not explicitly secured. This is a direct contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses `/actuator/env` and obtains database credentials. An attacker uses `/actuator/shutdown` to cause a denial of service. `/actuator/jolokia` (if present) is used for RCE.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, potential remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if exposed publicly without authentication) / High (if exposed with weak authentication).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:** Use `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include/exclude` in `application.properties/yml`. Disable in production if possible.
    *   **Require Authentication and Authorization:** Use Spring Security. Configure specific roles (e.g., `ACTUATOR_ADMIN`).
    *   **Network Restrictions:** Restrict access via firewall rules or Spring Security's `hasIpAddress()`. Consider a separate port.
    *   **Sanitize Sensitive Data:** Use property placeholders and external configuration. Customize `/actuator/env` output.
    *   **Monitor Access:** Log and monitor all access. Implement intrusion detection/prevention.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies (Supply Chain Attacks) - *Indirectly via Starters*](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies__supply_chain_attacks__-_indirectly_via_starters.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot applications can be vulnerable to attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in their dependencies.
*   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** While dependency management is not *unique* to Spring Boot, Spring Boot *Starters* can simplify the inclusion of vulnerable *transitive* dependencies, increasing the likelihood of unknowingly including a vulnerable library. This is an indirect, but significant contribution.
*   **Example:** A Spring Boot Starter pulls in an old version of a library with a known RCE vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical / High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or similar tools.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Spring Boot and all dependencies updated.
    *   **Minimal Starters:** Choose the most specific Starters.
    *   **Explicit Dependency Management:** Consider explicitly declaring dependencies.
    *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Generate and maintain an SBOM.

## Attack Surface: [Auto-Configuration Misuse](./attack_surfaces/auto-configuration_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot's auto-configuration can lead to unintended exposure of services or insecure default settings.
*   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Auto-configuration is a *core feature* of Spring Boot, making this a direct and significant contribution.
*   **Example:** Auto-configuration enables an embedded H2 database console at `/h2-console` without authentication.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data modification, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Understand Auto-Configuration:** Read the Spring Boot documentation.
    *   **Override Defaults:** Explicitly configure security settings and critical parameters.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Auto-Configuration:** Use the `exclude` attribute of `@SpringBootApplication` or `@EnableAutoConfiguration`.
    *   **Review Effective Configuration:** Use secured actuator endpoints like `/actuator/configprops` and `/actuator/beans`.

## Attack Surface: [Data Binding Vulnerabilities (Mass Assignment)](./attack_surfaces/data_binding_vulnerabilities__mass_assignment_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate request parameters to set unintended object properties.
*   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot's data binding mechanism, a *core feature* for handling web requests, is directly involved in this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker adds `admin=true` to a registration form, gaining admin privileges.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Use DTOs instead of binding directly to domain objects.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Fields:** Use `@InitBinder` and `setAllowedFields()`.
    *   **Input Validation:** Use Spring's validation framework (`@Valid`, `@Validated`, validation annotations).

## Attack Surface: [SpEL Injection](./attack_surfaces/spel_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Untrusted input in Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions allows for code injection.
*   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** SpEL is *deeply integrated* into Spring and Spring Boot, used in security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`, etc.) and potentially in template engines. This is a direct contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects SpEL into a search field used in a `@PreAuthorize` annotation.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, bypassing security.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Untrusted Input:** Never use untrusted input directly in SpEL.
    *   **Sanitize Input:** Thoroughly sanitize if user input is unavoidable. Use a whitelist.
    *   **Parameterized Expressions:** Use parameterized SpEL where possible.
    *   **Restricted Evaluation Context:** Use `SimpleEvaluationContext` or a custom context.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection (Thymeleaf, etc.) - *Indirectly via Integration*](./attack_surfaces/template_injection__thymeleaf__etc___-_indirectly_via_integration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into templates if untrusted input is used directly.
*   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** While template engines are not *part* of Spring Boot, Spring Boot provides *seamless integration* with them (e.g., Thymeleaf), making them a common choice and thus increasing the risk if not used securely. This is an indirect, but significant contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a comment field displayed unsanitized in a Thymeleaf template (XSS).
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Contextual Escaping:** Ensure the template engine is configured for auto-escaping (Thymeleaf does this by default).
    *   **Sanitize Input:** Sanitize user input *before* displaying it, even with auto-escaping.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP.
    *   **Avoid Inline Scripts/Styles:** Minimize their use in templates.

## Attack Surface: [Embedded Server Vulnerabilities - *Indirectly via Inclusion*](./attack_surfaces/embedded_server_vulnerabilities_-_indirectly_via_inclusion.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the embedded web server (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) can be exploited.
*   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot applications *typically include* an embedded server by default. While the server itself isn't part of Spring Boot, its inclusion is a direct consequence of using Spring Boot, making this an indirect but significant contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of Tomcat embedded in a Spring Boot application.
*   **Impact:** Varies; potentially RCE, DoS, or information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High / Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Spring Boot Updated:** Updating Spring Boot usually updates the embedded server.
    *   **Explicit Server Version:** If needed, explicitly specify the server version in your build configuration.
    *   **Secure Server Configuration:** Harden the configuration of the embedded server. Disable unnecessary features and use strong security settings.
