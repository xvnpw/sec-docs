# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for spring-projects/spring-boot

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Actuator Endpoints](./mitigation_strategies/secure_actuator_endpoints.md)

  **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Required Actuators:** Analyze your application's monitoring and management needs. Determine which actuators (e.g., `/health`, `/metrics`, `/info`) are *essential*.
        2.  **Disable Unnecessary Actuators:** In your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file, add the following line to disable all actuators by default:
            ```yaml
            management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=*
            ```
        3.  **Enable Required Actuators:** Selectively enable the necessary actuators using the `include` property. For example:
            ```yaml
            management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
            ```
        4.  **Implement Spring Security:**
            *   Add the Spring Security starter dependency to your project (Maven or Gradle).
            *   Create a security configuration class annotated with `@EnableWebSecurity`.
            *   Configure an `AuthenticationManager` (e.g., using an in-memory user store, a database, or an external identity provider).
            *   Configure `HttpSecurity` to require authentication for actuator endpoints.  Example:
                ```java
                @Configuration
                @EnableWebSecurity
                public class SecurityConfig {

                    @Bean
                    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
                        http
                            .authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -> authz
                                .requestMatchers("/actuator/**").hasRole("ADMIN") // Require ADMIN role for all actuators
                                .anyRequest().authenticated() // Require authentication for all other requests
                            )
                            .httpBasic(withDefaults()); // Use basic authentication (or another method)
                        return http.build();
                    }

                    @Bean
                    public InMemoryUserDetailsManager userDetailsService() {
                        UserDetails user = User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
                                .username("admin")
                                .password("adminpassword")
                                .roles("ADMIN")
                                .build();
                        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user);
                    }
                }
                ```
        5.  **(Optional) Change Management Port and Base Path:**  For defense-in-depth, add these to `application.properties` or `application.yml`:
            ```yaml
            management.server.port=8081  # Different port
            management.endpoints.web.base-path=/manage # Different base path
            ```
        6.  **(Optional) Use a Reverse Proxy:** Configure your reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache, etc.) to block external access to the `/actuator` path (or your custom management path).  This is *not* strictly a Spring Boot mitigation, but it complements the other steps.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive application internals (environment variables, configuration properties, thread dumps, etc.) exposed by actuators.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Some actuators (e.g., `/shutdown`) could be used for DoS attacks if exposed.  Securing them prevents this.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):**  While less common, some actuators (especially custom ones or those with vulnerabilities) *could* potentially be exploited for RCE.  Proper security drastically reduces this risk.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from High to Low (if Spring Security is implemented) or Medium (if only port/path changes are made).
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
        *   **Remote Code Execution:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Actuators are partially secured.  `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info` is set.  Spring Security is *not* implemented for actuators. The management port and base path are at their defaults.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Full Spring Security integration for actuator endpoints is missing.  This is the most critical gap.
        *   Changing the management port and base path are missing (defense-in-depth).
        *   Reverse proxy configuration to block actuator access is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage Dependencies and Scan for Vulnerabilities (Focus on Spring Boot Starters)](./mitigation_strategies/manage_dependencies_and_scan_for_vulnerabilities__focus_on_spring_boot_starters_.md)

    **Description:**
        1.  **Use Spring Boot Dependency Management:** Ensure your project uses the Spring Boot parent POM (in Maven) or the Spring Boot Gradle plugin. This provides curated dependency versions, *specifically for Spring Boot starters and their transitive dependencies*.
        2.  **Regularly Update Spring Boot:**  At least monthly (or more frequently for critical security updates), update your Spring Boot version. This is crucial because Spring Boot releases often include updates to address vulnerabilities in Spring Framework components and managed dependencies.
        3.  **Integrate Vulnerability Scanning:**
            *   Choose a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, JFrog Xray).
            *   Integrate the tool into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).  Configure the tool to scan your dependencies on every build.  *Pay close attention to vulnerabilities reported in Spring Boot starters and their transitive dependencies.*
            *   Set up alerts or build failures for detected vulnerabilities based on severity thresholds.
        4.  **Address Identified Vulnerabilities:**
            *   If a vulnerability is found in a Spring Boot starter or its transitive dependencies, prioritize updating to a patched Spring Boot version.
            *   If an update is not immediately available, consider temporary mitigations (e.g., dependency overrides â€“ *use with extreme caution and only if you understand the implications*).  Spring Boot's dependency management makes overrides more manageable, but still requires careful testing.
            *   Document any exceptions or accepted risks.
        5. **Generate SBOM:** Use tools to generate SBOM, for example cyclonedx-maven-plugin.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Critical to Low Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities in Spring Framework components and other libraries pulled in by Spring Boot starters.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced, potentially from Critical to Low, depending on the vulnerability and the speed of patching.  Focusing on Spring Boot updates ensures you get timely fixes for Spring-specific issues.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   The project uses the Spring Boot parent POM.
        *   Dependencies are updated sporadically, but not on a regular schedule.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated vulnerability scanning is *completely missing*. This is a major gap.
        *   A formal process for regularly updating Spring Boot and its dependencies is not in place.
        *   SBOM generation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Spring Data REST Endpoints](./mitigation_strategies/secure_spring_data_rest_endpoints.md)

    **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Exposed Repositories:** Review your project and identify all Spring Data REST repositories.
        2.  **Limit Repository Exposure:** For any repository that does *not* need to be exposed via REST, add the following annotation (this is a *direct Spring Boot feature*):
            ```java
            @RepositoryRestResource(exported = false)
            public interface MyRepository extends JpaRepository<MyEntity, Long> { ... }
            ```
        3.  **Implement Spring Security:**
            *   (Similar to Actuator security) Add the Spring Security starter.
            *   Create a security configuration class.
            *   Configure `AuthenticationManager` and `HttpSecurity`.
            *   Define authorization rules for your REST endpoints.  This leverages Spring Security, which integrates tightly with Spring Data REST. Example:
                ```java
                http
                    .authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -> authz
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/myEntities").hasRole("ADMIN") // Only admins can create
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/myEntities/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN") // Users and admins can read
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE, "/myEntities/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                        // ... other rules ...
                        .anyRequest().authenticated()
                    )
                    .httpBasic(withDefaults());
                ```
        4.  **(Optional) Customize Resource Exposure:** Use `@RepositoryRestResource` and related annotations (provided by Spring Data REST) to further control exposed methods and paths.  This is a *direct Spring Boot feature*.
        5.  **Implement Validation:** Add validation annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`, `@Size`) to your entity classes and ensure validation is enforced. While not *exclusively* a Spring Boot feature, Spring's validation support integrates well with Spring Data REST.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from reading, creating, updating, or deleting data through your Spring Data REST endpoints.
        *   **Data Modification (High Severity):**  Protects against unauthorized modification of your data.
        *   **Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Proper validation helps mitigate injection attacks through REST endpoints.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Risk reduced from High to Low (with Spring Security).
        *   **Data Modification:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
        *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No specific security measures are in place for Spring Data REST endpoints.  All repositories are exposed with default settings.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Spring Security integration for Spring Data REST is *completely missing*.
        *   Limiting repository exposure (`exported = false`) is not used.
        *   Customization of resource exposure is not used.
        *   While basic validation exists on entities, it's not consistently enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Customize Error Handling (Spring Boot Defaults)](./mitigation_strategies/customize_error_handling__spring_boot_defaults_.md)

    **Description:**
        1.  **Disable Stack Traces in Production:** In your `application.properties` or `application.yml`, set (this is a *direct Spring Boot configuration property*):
            ```yaml
            server.error.include-stacktrace=never
            ```
        2.  **Create a Global Exception Handler:**
            *   Create a class annotated with `@ControllerAdvice`. This is a Spring Framework annotation, but it's commonly used in Spring Boot applications.
            *   Define methods annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` to handle specific exceptions.
            *   Within these methods, log the full error details (including the stack trace) to your application logs.
            *   Return a generic error response to the client, without revealing sensitive information.  Example:
                ```java
                @ControllerAdvice
                public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

                    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class);

                    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
                    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleException(Exception ex) {
                        logger.error("An unexpected error occurred", ex); // Log the full exception
                        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse("An internal server error occurred.");
                        return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
                    }

                    // Add more @ExceptionHandler methods for specific exception types
                }
                ```
        3.  **(Optional) Create Custom Error Pages:** Create HTML templates (e.g., in `src/main/resources/templates/error`) to display user-friendly error messages for specific HTTP status codes (e.g., `404.html`, `500.html`). Spring Boot automatically serves these pages based on the status code.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from gaining insights into your application's internal structure and code by analyzing detailed error messages and stack traces, which are provided by default by Spring Boot.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `server.error.include-stacktrace` is set to `on-param`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A global exception handler (`@ControllerAdvice`) is *not* implemented.  Error responses may still contain sensitive information.
        *   Custom error pages are not defined.
