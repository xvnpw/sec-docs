# Attack Surface Analysis for spring-projects/spring-boot

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured or Publicly Accessible Actuator Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_or_publicly_accessible_actuator_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot Actuator provides endpoints for monitoring and managing the application. If these endpoints are not properly secured, they can expose sensitive information or allow for malicious actions.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot makes it easy to enable and use Actuator endpoints with minimal configuration. The default behavior, if not explicitly secured, is often to expose these endpoints without authentication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/env` endpoint without authentication and retrieves database credentials stored as environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data, application internals), potential for configuration manipulation, and in some cases, remote code execution (depending on enabled endpoints and Spring Boot version).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement Spring Security to secure Actuator endpoints. Require authentication and authorization for access.
        *   **Developers:** Disable or restrict access to sensitive Actuator endpoints in production environments.
        *   **Developers:** Use Spring Boot Actuator's built-in security features (e.g., `management.server.address` for restricting access by IP).

## Attack Surface: [Spring Boot DevTools Enabled in Production](./attack_surfaces/spring_boot_devtools_enabled_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot DevTools provides development-time features like live reload and automatic restarts. If left enabled in production, these features can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot automatically includes DevTools as a dependency when using the `spring-boot-devtools` starter. It's easy to forget to exclude it for production builds.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits the live reload functionality (in older versions) to execute arbitrary code on the server. Or, an attacker accesses the embedded H2 console (if enabled) and manipulates the database.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, unauthorized database access and manipulation, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure `spring-boot-devtools` is excluded from production builds. This can be done by setting the `spring.devtools.restart.enabled` property to `false` in production or by properly configuring build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle).

## Attack Surface: [Transitive Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/transitive_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot manages dependencies, including transitive ones. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, the application becomes vulnerable.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot's dependency management simplifies adding libraries, but it also pulls in transitive dependencies that developers might not be aware of. Vulnerabilities in these transitive dependencies can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A Spring Boot application uses a library (as a direct or transitive dependency) with a known deserialization vulnerability. An attacker sends a malicious serialized object to the application, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, and more.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
        *   **Developers:**  Keep Spring Boot and all dependencies updated to the latest stable versions.
        *   **Developers:**  Be mindful of the dependencies being pulled in and investigate any potential security concerns.
        *   **Developers:**  Consider using dependency management features to exclude or override vulnerable transitive dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Data Binding and Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/data_binding_and_mass_assignment_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot's data binding features automatically map request parameters to object properties. If not carefully managed, attackers can manipulate request parameters to set unintended object properties.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot's ease of use in data binding can lead to developers not explicitly defining which properties are allowed to be bound, potentially exposing sensitive attributes.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the HTTP request parameters to set the `isAdmin` property of a user object to `true`, granting them unauthorized administrative privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly define the data that can be bound from requests.
        *   **Developers:** Implement whitelisting of allowed fields for data binding.
        *   **Developers:** Avoid directly binding request parameters to sensitive domain objects.

## Attack Surface: [Unintentional Data Exposure via Spring Data REST](./attack_surfaces/unintentional_data_exposure_via_spring_data_rest.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Data REST automatically creates RESTful endpoints for JPA repositories. If not properly configured with appropriate access controls, it can unintentionally expose sensitive data.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot's Spring Data REST module simplifies the creation of REST APIs, but the default behavior can sometimes expose more data than intended if not carefully configured.
    *   **Example:** A Spring Data REST repository for `User` entities is exposed without authentication or proper authorization. An attacker can access `/api/users` and retrieve a list of all users, including sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for Spring Data REST endpoints using Spring Security.
        *   **Developers:**  Carefully configure the `@RepositoryRestResource` annotation to control which endpoints are exposed and how.

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Secrets in Configuration](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_secrets_in_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might accidentally hardcode sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or encryption keys in application configuration files.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot's configuration system, while convenient, can lead to developers placing secrets directly in `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials are hardcoded in the `application.properties` file and are accessible if the configuration file is exposed or the application is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise if critical credentials are leaked.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid hardcoding secrets in configuration files.
        *   **Developers:** Use environment variables or externalized configuration for sensitive information.
        *   **Developers:** Utilize secure secret management tools and vaults.
