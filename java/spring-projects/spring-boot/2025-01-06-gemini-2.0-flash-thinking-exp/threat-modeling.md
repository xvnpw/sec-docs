# Threat Model Analysis for spring-projects/spring-boot

## Threat: [Malicious Auto-configuration](./threats/malicious_auto-configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could introduce a malicious dependency into the project. Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature would then automatically configure and instantiate beans from this dependency, leading to arbitrary code execution during application startup or runtime. The attacker might craft a dependency that, when initialized, executes malicious code, modifies application behavior, or establishes a backdoor by leveraging Spring Boot's automatic component scanning and bean creation.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server. This could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Affected Component:** `spring-boot-autoconfigure` module, specifically the auto-configuration mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control and review project dependencies.
    *   Utilize dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle) to manage and verify dependencies.
    *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
    *   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
    *   Consider using dependency constraints or dependency management plugins to enforce allowed dependencies.

## Threat: [Unsecured Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints](./threats/unsecured_spring_boot_actuator_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit publicly accessible and unsecured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints. They might use these endpoints to gather sensitive information about the application's internal state (e.g., environment variables, health status, metrics) directly exposed by Spring Boot's monitoring capabilities, trigger administrative actions (e.g., shutdown, thread dump) provided by Spring Boot, or even manipulate application configuration if endpoints like `/env` or `/configprops` are writable, which are features directly managed by the Spring Boot Actuator.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, potential privilege escalation if writable endpoints are exposed, and insights into the application's architecture for further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** `spring-boot-actuator` module, specifically the exposed HTTP endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security. Implement authentication and authorization.
    *   Disable or restrict access to sensitive Actuator endpoints in production environments.
    *   Use management port configuration to expose Actuator endpoints on a separate, secured port.
    *   Consider network segmentation to limit access to Actuator endpoints.
    *   Regularly audit the enabled and exposed Actuator endpoints.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Spring Security](./threats/misconfiguration_of_spring_security.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigurations in Spring Security, which is a common and recommended security framework integrated with Spring Boot. Incorrectly configured security rules, authentication mechanisms, or improper handling of security contexts within a Spring Boot application can lead to authentication bypasses, authorization failures, or other security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation, data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** `spring-boot-starter-security` and the configured security rules and filters.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow Spring Security best practices for authentication and authorization.
    *   Implement robust access control rules based on the principle of least privilege.
    *   Securely configure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, SAML).
    *   Regularly review and test security configurations.
    *   Utilize Spring Security's testing support to verify security rules.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive configuration data, such as database credentials, API keys, or internal service URLs, if not properly secured within the Spring Boot application's configuration mechanisms. This could happen through various means, including exposed Actuator endpoints (as mentioned above), insecure storage of configuration files managed by Spring Boot, or environment variable handling within the Spring Boot context.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, and the ability to impersonate the application.
*   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot's configuration management system (`@ConfigurationProperties`, `application.properties`, `application.yml`), environment variable handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in application.properties or application.yml.
    *   Utilize secure secret management solutions like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
    *   Encrypt sensitive configuration data at rest and in transit.
    *   Secure access to configuration files and environment variables.
    *   Secure Spring Cloud Config Server with appropriate authentication and authorization if used within the Spring Boot application.
