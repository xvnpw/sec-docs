# Threat Model Analysis for spring-projects/spring-boot

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Sensitive Actuator Endpoints](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_sensitive_actuator_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could directly access publicly exposed actuator endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`) without providing any credentials. They could then gather sensitive information about the application's status, configuration, and internal workings.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data like environment variables, internal network configurations, and application dependencies. This information can be used to plan further attacks. In some cases, write-enabled endpoints could be abused to manipulate the application.
*   **Affected Component:** `spring-boot-actuator` module, specifically the HTTP endpoint exposure functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security. Implement authentication and authorization rules to restrict access.
    *   Disable or relocate sensitive endpoints in production environments.
    *   Use Spring Boot's management context path to change the default `/actuator` base path, adding a layer of obscurity.
    *   Consider network segmentation to limit access to actuator endpoints from internal networks only.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via DevTools in Production](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_devtools_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** If Spring Boot DevTools is accidentally included in a production deployment and the remote debugging feature is enabled (even unintentionally), an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the server. This often involves tricking a developer's browser into connecting to the production instance.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to execute any command, install malware, steal data, or disrupt services.
*   **Affected Component:** `spring-boot-devtools` module, specifically the live reload and remote debugging functionalities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure DevTools is properly excluded from production builds. Use Maven or Gradle scopes (`<scope>runtime</scope>`) to manage dependencies correctly.
    *   Verify that the `spring.devtools.remote.secret` property is not set or is set to a strong, randomly generated value if remote debugging is absolutely necessary (highly discouraged in production).
    *   Implement network restrictions to prevent unauthorized access to the DevTools port (default 8080 + random port).

## Threat: [Inclusion of Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies via Starters](./threats/inclusion_of_vulnerable_transitive_dependencies_via_starters.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot starters pull in a set of dependencies. Some of these transitive dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the application's classpath.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to various impacts, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot's dependency management system, specifically the `spring-boot-starter-*` dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit project dependencies using tools like the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin or Snyk.
    *   Utilize dependency management tools (Maven Enforcer Plugin, Gradle Dependency Verification) to enforce dependency versions and block known vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Keep Spring Boot and its starters updated to the latest versions, as these often include updates to address vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Explicitly declare and manage the versions of critical transitive dependencies in your project's dependency management.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attacks](./threats/dependency_confusion_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could publish a malicious library with a similar name to an internal or private dependency used by the Spring Boot application. If the application's build configuration is not properly secured, the build system might mistakenly download and use the malicious dependency.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious code during the build process or at runtime, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot's dependency management in conjunction with build tools like Maven or Gradle.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize private artifact repositories with strict access controls and dependency verification mechanisms.
    *   Configure build tools to prioritize internal repositories and fail if dependencies cannot be resolved from trusted sources.
    *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis on all dependencies, including internal ones.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Spring Security Auto-Configuration](./threats/misconfiguration_of_spring_security_auto-configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Spring Boot's auto-configuration for Spring Security simplifies setup but can lead to unintended security configurations if not properly understood and customized. Developers might rely on defaults that are not secure enough for their specific application.
*   **Impact:** Weak authentication or authorization mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities.
*   **Affected Component:** `spring-boot-starter-security` and Spring Security's auto-configuration logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly understand Spring Security's configuration options and how Spring Boot's auto-configuration interacts with them.
    *   Explicitly configure security rules and access controls using Spring Security's DSL or annotations.
    *   Avoid relying solely on default security configurations in production environments. Regularly review and test security configurations.
