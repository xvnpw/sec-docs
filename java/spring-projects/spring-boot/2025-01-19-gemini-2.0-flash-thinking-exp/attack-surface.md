# Attack Surface Analysis for spring-projects/spring-boot

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured or overly permissive Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_or_overly_permissive_spring_boot_actuator_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Unsecured or overly permissive Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot provides Actuator endpoints for monitoring and management, which are enabled by default and can expose sensitive information or allow administrative actions if not secured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the `/actuator/env` endpoint without authentication and retrieves database credentials stored as environment variables.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive data (credentials, API keys, internal configurations), potential for application manipulation (shutdown, log level changes), or even remote code execution (via JMX if Jolokia is enabled).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable Actuator endpoints in production if not needed.
        *   Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security. Implement authentication and authorization rules to restrict access based on roles or IP addresses.
        *   Use management port and address to isolate Actuator endpoints.
        *   Audit enabled Actuator endpoints and their accessibility.

## Attack Surface: [Inclusion of vulnerable dependencies managed by Spring Boot's dependency management.](./attack_surfaces/inclusion_of_vulnerable_dependencies_managed_by_spring_boot's_dependency_management.md)

*   **Description:** Inclusion of vulnerable dependencies managed by Spring Boot's dependency management.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot simplifies dependency management by providing starter POMs that include a curated set of dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, the application inherits those risks.
    *   **Example:** A Spring Boot application includes an older version of a Jackson library with a known deserialization vulnerability. An attacker sends a malicious JSON payload that exploits this vulnerability, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Spring Boot version. Spring Boot often updates its managed dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency management tools (e.g., Maven Dependency Check, OWASP Dependency-Check) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Explicitly override vulnerable dependency versions in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the dependencies used in your project.

## Attack Surface: [Expression Language Injection (SpEL) vulnerabilities in Spring applications.](./attack_surfaces/expression_language_injection__spel__vulnerabilities_in_spring_applications.md)

*   **Description:** Expression Language Injection (SpEL) vulnerabilities in Spring applications.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** While not directly introducing SpEL, Spring Boot applications often utilize SpEL for dynamic configuration or evaluation. If user-controlled input is used within SpEL expressions without proper sanitization, it can lead to remote code execution.
    *   **Example:** An error message is constructed using user-provided input within a SpEL expression. An attacker crafts a malicious input that executes arbitrary code when the error message is processed.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full control over the application server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in SpEL expressions.
        *   If SpEL is necessary, sanitize user input rigorously before incorporating it into expressions.
        *   Consider alternative templating engines or approaches that do not involve dynamic code evaluation.
        *   Regularly audit code for potential SpEL injection points.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization vulnerabilities when handling untrusted data.](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_when_handling_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:** Deserialization vulnerabilities when handling untrusted data.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot applications often use libraries like Jackson for JSON serialization and deserialization. If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation, it can be vulnerable to deserialization attacks, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Example:** An application receives a serialized Java object in a request body from an untrusted source. A malicious payload within the serialized object exploits a vulnerability in a deserialization library, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full control over the application server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization practices.
        *   Configure Jackson to disable default typing or use a safe type hierarchy.
        *   Consider using alternative data formats like JSON or Protobuf that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly update serialization libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Leaving Spring Boot DevTools enabled in production environments.](./attack_surfaces/leaving_spring_boot_devtools_enabled_in_production_environments.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving Spring Boot DevTools enabled in production environments.
    *   **How Spring Boot Contributes:** Spring Boot DevTools provides helpful features during development, such as automatic restarts and live reload. However, leaving it enabled in production exposes sensitive information and potential attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses DevTools endpoints (e.g., `/jolokia`) which might be inadvertently left enabled, allowing them to interact with the application's JMX beans and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, remote code execution, application manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Spring Boot DevTools is disabled in production deployments. This is typically done by excluding the dependency or setting the `spring.devtools.restart.enabled` property to `false`.
        *   Verify the application's dependencies and configurations in production to confirm DevTools is not active.
