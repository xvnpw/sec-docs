Here is the updated threat list, including only high and critical threats directly involving Spring Boot:

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Unsecured Actuator Endpoint
    *   **Description:** An attacker could access unsecured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/env`, `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/health`) to gather sensitive information about the application's configuration, environment variables, internal state, and dependencies. This information can be used to plan further attacks or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (API keys, database credentials, internal network details), insights into application vulnerabilities, potential for account takeover or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot Actuator - specific endpoints like `/env`, `/metrics`, `/health`, `/beans`, `/configprops`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement Spring Security and configure authentication and authorization for all Actuator endpoints.
        *   Use Spring Boot Actuator's built-in security features to restrict access based on roles or IP addresses.
        *   Avoid exposing Actuator endpoints publicly; restrict access to internal networks or authorized users.
        *   Regularly review and update Actuator endpoint configurations.

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Application State via Unsecured Actuator Endpoint
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit unsecured Actuator endpoints that allow modification of the application's state (e.g., `/actuator/loggers`, `/actuator/caches`). They could change logging levels to mask malicious activity, evict cache entries to disrupt performance, or trigger other administrative functions.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, disruption of application functionality, masking of malicious activities, potential for data manipulation or corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot Actuator - specific endpoints like `/loggers`, `/caches`, `/shutdown`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure all Actuator endpoints with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Disable or restrict access to sensitive management endpoints in production environments.
        *   Implement auditing and logging of Actuator endpoint access and modifications.

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution via Exposed DevTools
    *   **Description:** If Spring Boot DevTools are accidentally included and enabled in a production environment, attackers could potentially exploit features like the remote debug endpoint to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server, data breaches, installation of malware, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot DevTools - specifically the remote debugging functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Spring Boot DevTools are excluded from production builds. Use the `spring.devtools.restart.enabled=false` property in production.
        *   Verify the `spring-boot-devtools` dependency is not included in the final production artifact.
        *   Implement strict build processes to prevent accidental inclusion of development dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Mass Assignment Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** Attackers could manipulate request parameters to set unintended properties of Java objects during data binding, a core feature of Spring Boot's MVC framework. This can lead to unauthorized modification of sensitive data or application state if not properly handled.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of user roles, permissions, or other critical data; potential for privilege escalation or data corruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot Data Binding mechanism within the Spring MVC framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly define which fields can be bound from requests.
        *   Avoid directly binding request parameters to domain entities.
        *   Utilize `@JsonIgnoreProperties` or similar annotations to exclude sensitive fields from data binding.
        *   Implement proper input validation and sanitization.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker could publish a malicious library with a similar name to a legitimate internal or private dependency used by the Spring Boot application. If the application's build process, managed by tools often integrated with Spring Boot projects (like Maven or Gradle), is not properly configured, it might download and use the malicious dependency.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Spring Boot's dependency management through its integration with build tools like Maven or Gradle, and the application's build configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure your build tool (Maven or Gradle) to use private or internal repositories for internal dependencies.
        *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis tools in your CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Use dependency management features like dependency verification or checksum validation.
        *   Regularly review and audit your project's dependencies.
