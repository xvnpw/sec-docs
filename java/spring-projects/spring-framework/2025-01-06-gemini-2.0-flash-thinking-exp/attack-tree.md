## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Binding Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_binding_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Exploit Data Binding Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Submit request to modify sensitive application state (Mass Assignment):**
        * **Attack Vector:**  The application's backend directly binds request parameters to internal objects (like database entities) without proper filtering or validation.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a malicious request containing extra parameters that correspond to sensitive fields they shouldn't be able to modify. The framework automatically updates these fields upon binding.
        * **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of sensitive data, privilege escalation, or corruption of application state.
    * **Trigger unexpected behavior or errors leading to information disclosure or further exploitation (Type Coercion):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application relies on automatic type conversion provided by the framework without sufficient validation.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker sends request parameters with unexpected data types. The framework attempts to convert these, potentially leading to errors, exceptions, or unexpected behavior that reveals information or opens new attack vectors.
        * **Impact:** Information disclosure (stack traces, internal data), denial of service, or enabling further exploitation.
    * **Achieve unintended side effects or data modification (Property Accessor Manipulation):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application uses custom getters or setters in its data objects that have side effects beyond simply getting or setting a value.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker manipulates input data in a way that triggers these custom accessors, leading to unintended actions or data changes.
        * **Impact:**  Unexpected application behavior, data corruption, or potential for further exploitation depending on the side effects.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

* **Exploit Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection:**
    * **Inject malicious SpEL expression through user-controlled input or compromised configuration (SpEL in Annotations):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application uses SpEL expressions within annotations (e.g., for caching or scheduling) and allows user-controlled input to influence these expressions, or the configuration itself is compromised.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker injects malicious SpEL code into the vulnerable input or modifies the configuration. When the annotation is processed, the malicious code is executed by the SpEL interpreter.
        * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or other malicious actions (SpEL in Annotations):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Successful injection of malicious SpEL code as described above.
        * **Exploitation:** The SpEL interpreter executes the attacker's code.
        * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breach, installation of malware, denial of service.
    * **Inject malicious SpEL expression through input fields or URL parameters (SpEL in View Technologies):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application uses a view technology (like Thymeleaf) that allows SpEL expressions to be evaluated during rendering, and user-provided data is included in these expressions without proper sanitization.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts malicious SpEL code within input fields or URL parameters. When the view is rendered, the SpEL interpreter executes the attacker's code within the context of the server or the user's browser.
        * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing the attacker to execute scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or, in some cases, Remote Code Execution on the server.
    * **Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or potentially RCE depending on the context (SpEL in View Technologies):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Successful injection of malicious SpEL code in the view layer.
        * **Exploitation:** The SpEL interpreter executes the attacker's code in the user's browser or potentially on the server.
        * **Impact:**  XSS leading to session hijacking, information theft, defacement, or potentially RCE on the server depending on the environment and SpEL capabilities.
    * **Achieve unintended message routing, data manipulation, or code execution (SpEL in Spring Integration):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Spring Integration components use SpEL for dynamic message routing or processing, and an attacker can control the input used in these expressions.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker injects malicious SpEL code into message payloads or configuration used by Spring Integration. This can lead to messages being routed to unintended destinations, data being manipulated, or even code execution within the integration flow.
        * **Impact:**  Disruption of message flow, data corruption, unauthorized access to internal systems, or potentially Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Spring Security Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_spring_security_configuration.md)

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Spring Security Configuration:**
    * **Gain access to protected resources without valid credentials (Authentication Bypass):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Misconfigured authentication rules or filters in Spring Security allow requests to bypass the intended authentication checks.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts specific requests that exploit these misconfigurations, allowing them to access protected resources without providing valid credentials.
        * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities.
    * **Access resources or perform actions beyond authorized privileges (Authorization Bypass):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Misconfigured authorization rules or role assignments in Spring Security allow users to access resources or perform actions they are not intended to.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker exploits these misconfigurations to gain access to resources or functionalities that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.
        * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized modification or deletion of data, or unauthorized execution of administrative functions.
    * **Impersonate legitimate users (Insecure Session Management):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in session handling, such as predictable session IDs or the absence of `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, allow attackers to hijack user sessions.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker obtains a valid session ID (e.g., through session fixation or stealing) and uses it to impersonate a legitimate user.
        * **Impact:** Full access to the victim's account, allowing the attacker to perform any action the victim could.
    * **Trick authenticated users into executing the malicious requests (CSRF Vulnerabilities):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Lack of or misconfigured Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection allows attackers to force authenticated users to perform unintended actions on the application.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks an authenticated user into submitting it (e.g., through a link in an email or on a malicious website). The application, trusting the user's session, executes the request.
        * **Impact:** Unauthorized state changes, data modification, or actions performed on behalf of the victim user.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_dependencies_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Exploit Dependencies with Known Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Identify vulnerable dependencies used by the Spring application (direct or transitive):**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application uses third-party libraries (dependencies) that have known security vulnerabilities.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers use publicly available information and tools to identify these vulnerable dependencies by analyzing the application's dependencies.
        * **Impact:** This step itself doesn't directly compromise the application, but it's a crucial prerequisite for exploiting the vulnerabilities.
    * **Compromise the application through the vulnerable dependency:**
        * **Attack Vector:** A known vulnerability exists in one of the application's dependencies.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers leverage known exploits for the identified vulnerability. This might involve sending specific API calls, manipulating input data in a certain way, or other techniques specific to the vulnerability.
        * **Impact:**  Varies widely depending on the vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure and denial of service to Remote Code Execution, allowing full control of the application and server.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Misconfigurations in Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_misconfigurations_in_spring_boot_actuator_endpoints__if_enabled_.md)

* **Exploit Misconfigurations in Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints:**
    * **Access Sensitive Information:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, designed for monitoring and management, are exposed without proper authentication.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers access these unprotected endpoints to gather sensitive information about the application's configuration, environment variables, dependencies, and health status.
        * **Impact:** Information disclosure that can be used for further attacks, such as identifying internal network configurations, database credentials, or other vulnerabilities.
    * **Trigger Destructive Actions:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Spring Boot Actuator endpoints that allow state changes or management operations (like shutting down the application or changing logging levels) are exposed without proper authorization.
        * **Exploitation:** Attackers access these unprotected endpoints to perform destructive actions, such as shutting down the application, modifying its configuration, or causing other forms of denial of service.
        * **Impact:** Denial of service, disruption of application functionality, data loss (depending on the action).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Less Direct, but Possible)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__less_direct__but_possible_.md)

* **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) when the object is deserialized:**
        * **Attack Vector:** The application deserializes untrusted data, and a vulnerable class is present in the classpath that can be exploited during deserialization to execute arbitrary code.
        * **Exploitation:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object containing code that will be executed when the object is deserialized by the application.
        * **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
