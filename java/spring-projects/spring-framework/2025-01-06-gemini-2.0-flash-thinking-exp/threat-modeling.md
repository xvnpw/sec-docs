# Threat Model Analysis for spring-projects/spring-framework

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized Java object and sends it to an endpoint or process that uses Spring to deserialize it. Upon deserialization, the malicious object executes arbitrary code on the server. This can happen through various channels like HTTP requests, RMI, or messaging systems if Spring is configured to handle serialized objects.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** `spring-core` module, specifically the `ObjectInputStream` used in various parts of the framework for deserialization (e.g., RMI, caching).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
* If deserialization is necessary, use secure alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
* If Java serialization is unavoidable, implement filtering mechanisms to restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
* Keep the Spring Framework and its dependencies updated to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./threats/expression_language__spel__injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious SpEL expressions into input fields or configuration that are then evaluated by the Spring Framework. This can occur in various contexts, such as `@Value` annotations, Spring Security expressions, or dynamic method invocation. The attacker can leverage SpEL's capabilities to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive information.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `spring-expression` module, used by various components like `spring-beans` for property resolution and `spring-security` for authorization rules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using user-controlled input directly in SpEL expressions.
* If user input is necessary, sanitize it rigorously to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
* Consider using parameterized expressions where possible to separate code from data.
* Regularly review and update dependencies that might rely on SpEL.

## Threat: [Bean Property Binding Vulnerabilities (Mass Assignment)](./threats/bean_property_binding_vulnerabilities__mass_assignment_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates HTTP request parameters to bind values to bean properties that were not intended to be exposed or modified. This can lead to unauthorized changes in application state, privilege escalation, or bypassing security checks. For example, an attacker might modify an `isAdmin` flag in a user object through request parameters.

**Impact:** Privilege escalation, data manipulation, security bypass.

**Affected Component:** `spring-beans` module, specifically the `BeanWrapperImpl` class used for property binding in Spring MVC and other areas.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly define the properties that can be bound from requests.
* Utilize the `@ModelAttribute` annotation with the `allowedFields` attribute to restrict the fields that can be bound.
* Consider using `@BindProperty` with explicit `name` attributes for stricter control.
* Implement proper input validation and authorization checks after data binding.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Request Mapping](./threats/path_traversal_via_request_mapping.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious URLs that exploit insufficiently restrictive `@RequestMapping` patterns in Spring MVC controllers. By manipulating path segments (e.g., using `../`), they can access resources outside the intended scope, potentially accessing sensitive files or triggering unintended actions.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (accessing sensitive files), unauthorized access to functionalities.

**Affected Component:** `spring-webmvc` module, specifically the `@RequestMapping` annotation and the request mapping mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use specific and restrictive path patterns in `@RequestMapping` annotations.
* Avoid using wildcards or overly permissive patterns that could lead to traversal.
* Implement input validation and sanitization on path parameters to prevent traversal sequences.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Misconfiguration](./threats/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks an authenticated user into making unintended requests on the application. While CSRF is a general web vulnerability, the way Spring Security handles it is a Spring-specific concern. If CSRF protection is disabled or misconfigured in Spring Security, the application becomes vulnerable.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or transferring funds.

**Affected Component:** `spring-security-web` module, specifically the CSRF protection mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure CSRF protection is enabled in Spring Security (it's enabled by default in most recent versions).
* Use appropriate methods for including CSRF tokens in requests (e.g., synchronizer token pattern).
* Handle CSRF tokens correctly in client-side code.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Misconfigurations in authentication providers, authorization rules (`@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`), or custom security filters can lead to bypasses, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities. This could involve flaws in custom authentication logic or incorrect role-based access control setup.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Various modules within `spring-security`, including `spring-security-core`, `spring-security-web`, and potentially custom security components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test authentication and authorization logic.
* Use well-established and tested authentication providers.
* Regularly review and update access control rules.
* Ensure that authorization checks are applied consistently across all protected resources.
