# Attack Surface Analysis for spring-projects/spring-framework

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of Java serialization/deserialization mechanisms where untrusted data is deserialized, leading to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring uses Java serialization in various features like caching (e.g., Redis, Hazelcast), remoting (e.g., RMI), and potentially message handling. If these systems are configured to deserialize data from untrusted sources without proper validation, it becomes a vulnerability directly facilitated by Spring's architecture and integration points.
*   **Example:** A Spring application using Redis as a cache might deserialize data retrieved from Redis. If an attacker can inject a malicious serialized object into the Redis cache, upon retrieval and deserialization by the application, it could lead to code execution within the Spring application context.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to gain complete control over the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources within Spring-managed components.
    *   If deserialization is necessary, implement robust input validation and consider using safer serialization alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers within the Spring application.
    *   For caching solutions integrated with Spring, restrict access to the cache and ensure only trusted applications can write to it.
    *   Keep Java and Spring Framework versions updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities affecting Spring's internal mechanisms or dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of the Spring Expression Language (SpEL) by injecting malicious expressions through user-controlled input, leading to potential code execution or data access.
*   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring uses SpEL extensively in core functionalities like `@Value` annotations for configuration, Spring Security expression-based access control, and programmatic evaluation of expressions. This direct integration of SpEL into Spring's core makes it a significant attack vector if not used carefully.
*   **Example:** A Spring MVC controller might use `@Value("#{ systemProperties['user.dir'] }")` to retrieve a system property. If an attacker can control the value of `user.dir` (e.g., through a crafted request that influences system properties), they could inject a malicious SpEL expression like `#{T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('malicious_command')}` leading to code execution within the Spring application.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), unauthorized data access, or denial of service directly through Spring's expression evaluation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly within SpEL expressions within Spring components.
    *   If dynamic expressions are necessary, carefully sanitize and validate user input before incorporating it into SpEL evaluations managed by Spring.
    *   Consider alternative approaches if the risk of SpEL injection is high within the Spring application's logic.
    *   Keep Spring Framework versions updated as vulnerabilities in SpEL parsing might be discovered and patched by the Spring team.

## Attack Surface: [Data Binding Vulnerabilities (Mass Assignment)](./attack_surfaces/data_binding_vulnerabilities__mass_assignment_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting Spring MVC's data binding mechanism to modify object properties that the user should not have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification or privilege escalation.
*   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring MVC's automatic data binding is a core feature. The framework's design allows request parameters to be directly mapped to object properties, and if safeguards aren't implemented, this can be abused.
*   **Example:** A user registration form might bind request parameters to a `User` object using Spring's data binding. If the `isAdmin` property is not explicitly excluded from binding and an attacker includes `isAdmin=true` in the request, Spring's data binding mechanism will set this property, potentially elevating the user's privileges.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation directly facilitated by Spring's data binding.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) specifically designed for data binding within Spring MVC controllers, containing only the properties that should be modifiable by the user.
    *   Utilize `@ModelAttribute` and `@Validated` annotations with validation groups within Spring controllers to control which properties are bound and validated in different contexts.
    *   Use the `allowedFields` or `disallowedFields` attributes of the `@InitBinder` annotation within Spring controllers to explicitly control which fields can be bound.
    *   Avoid directly binding request parameters to domain entities within Spring MVC.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal through Static Resource Handling](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_through_static_resource_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting improper configuration or lack of validation in Spring MVC's static resource handling to access files outside the intended directory on the server.
*   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring MVC provides a mechanism to serve static resources. The configuration of this feature within Spring is the direct source of this vulnerability if not done securely.
*   **Example:** If Spring MVC is configured to serve static resources from `/static/**` and an attacker requests `/static/../../../../etc/passwd`, a vulnerable Spring configuration might allow access to the sensitive `/etc/passwd` file.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files, potential information disclosure directly due to misconfiguration of Spring's static resource handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure proper configuration of Spring MVC's static resource handlers, restricting access to the intended directories within the Spring configuration.
    *   Avoid using wildcards that are too broad in static resource mappings within Spring's configuration.
    *   Implement robust path validation and sanitization within the Spring application if custom static resource handling is implemented.

## Attack Surface: [Spring Actuator Exposure](./attack_surfaces/spring_actuator_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Unsecured or improperly secured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints exposing sensitive information about the application's internal state, metrics, and environment, potentially leading to information disclosure or even remote code execution.
*   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring Boot Actuator is a module within the Spring ecosystem that provides built-in endpoints. The presence and configuration (or lack thereof) of security for these endpoints are directly managed by Spring Boot.
*   **Example:** An exposed `/env` endpoint provided by Spring Boot Actuator could reveal sensitive environment variables, including database credentials or API keys. An exposed `/jolokia` endpoint (if present) could potentially be used for remote code execution by interacting with the JVM through Spring Actuator's capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, exposure of sensitive credentials, potential for remote code execution or denial of service depending on the exposed Spring Actuator endpoints.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on exposed endpoints)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Spring Boot Actuator endpoints using Spring Security configurations.
    *   Disable or restrict access to sensitive Actuator endpoints in production environments via Spring Boot configuration.
    *   Utilize Spring Boot Actuator's built-in security features for authentication and authorization.
    *   Carefully review the list of enabled Spring Boot Actuator endpoints and their security implications during development and deployment.
