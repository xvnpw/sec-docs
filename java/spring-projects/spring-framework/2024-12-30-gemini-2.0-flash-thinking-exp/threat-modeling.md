### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Spring Framework

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the Spring Framework.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data leading to Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object and injects it into the application's input stream. When the application attempts to deserialize this object using **Spring's data binding or other deserialization mechanisms**, the malicious payload is executed, potentially granting the attacker full control over the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and the underlying server. Attackers can execute arbitrary code, install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.
    *   **Affected Component:** `spring-core` (Object deserialization), `spring-web` (data binding), `spring-messaging` (message deserialization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization mechanisms and restrict the classes that can be deserialized (e.g., using allow lists).
        *   Keep the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Spring Framework dependencies up-to-date to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using alternative data formats like JSON, which are generally safer than Java serialization.

*   **Threat:** Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SpEL expressions into input fields or configuration parameters that are processed by the **Spring Framework's expression evaluation engine**. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the application and the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** `spring-expression` (SpEL evaluation), various Spring modules that utilize SpEL (e.g., `spring-security`, `spring-integration`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in SpEL expressions.
        *   If SpEL is necessary with user input, sanitize and validate the input rigorously to prevent the injection of malicious expressions.
        *   Consider alternative templating or expression languages that are less powerful and have fewer security risks.
        *   Disable SpEL evaluation if it's not required.

*   **Threat:** Bean Property Binding Vulnerabilities leading to Object Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates HTTP request parameters or other input data to bind values to Java bean properties in unintended ways. This can lead to the modification of critical application state, bypassing security checks, or data corruption due to **Spring's bean property binding mechanism**.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data breaches, denial of service, or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:** `spring-beans` (BeanWrapperImpl, DataBinder), `spring-web` (data binding in controllers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation for all data bound to Java beans.
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to explicitly define the properties that can be bound from external input, preventing unintended property modifications.
        *   Avoid binding directly to sensitive domain objects.
        *   Use Spring's validation framework (e.g., JSR-303 annotations) to enforce data constraints.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Aspects in Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces or modifies aspects within the application to intercept method calls, modify data, or execute arbitrary code before or after legitimate operations, leveraging **Spring's AOP framework**.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or remote code execution depending on the actions performed by the malicious aspect.
    *   **Affected Component:** `spring-aop` (AOP framework, AspectJ integration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the application's build and deployment pipeline to prevent unauthorized modification of application code and dependencies.
        *   Implement code signing and integrity checks for application artifacts.
        *   Carefully review and control the aspects defined in the application.
        *   Monitor the application for unexpected AOP behavior.

*   **Threat:** Indirect JDBC Injection through Dynamic Queries in Spring Data
    *   **Description:** While Spring Data helps prevent direct SQL injection, developers might still construct dynamic queries or use insufficiently parameterized queries within **Spring Data repositories** or custom query methods. An attacker can then manipulate input parameters to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service against the database.
    *   **Affected Component:** `spring-data-jpa`, `spring-jdbc` (data access abstractions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database.
        *   Leverage Spring Data's query derivation features carefully and avoid constructing dynamic queries from user input.
        *   Thoroughly validate any custom query logic.
        *   Use database-specific escaping functions if dynamic query construction is absolutely necessary (though highly discouraged).

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information via Unsecured Spring Actuator Endpoints
    *   **Description:** **Spring Actuator endpoints** provide valuable information for monitoring and management. If these endpoints are not properly secured, attackers can access sensitive data like configuration details, environment variables, health information, and even perform actions like shutting down the application.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further attacks based on exposed information, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `spring-boot-actuator` (Actuator endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security.
        *   Restrict access to Actuator endpoints based on roles or IP addresses.
        *   Disable or customize endpoints that are not needed.
        *   Avoid exposing Actuator endpoints publicly.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Spring Security Filters leading to Authentication or Authorization Bypass
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities can exist within the **Spring Security framework** itself, potentially allowing attackers to bypass authentication or authorization checks under specific conditions or configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `spring-security-core`, `spring-security-web` (Spring Security filter chain).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Spring Security dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches.
        *   Follow security best practices for configuring Spring Security.
        *   Thoroughly test authentication and authorization rules.
