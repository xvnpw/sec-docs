# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
  - To provide a comprehensive and widely adopted open-source framework for building Java applications.
  - To simplify enterprise Java development by offering reusable components and abstractions.
  - To enable developers to build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications efficiently.
  - To foster a strong community around the framework, driving innovation and adoption.
  - To ensure the framework remains relevant and adaptable to evolving technology landscapes.
- Most important business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could impact a vast number of applications built upon it, leading to widespread security incidents and reputational damage.
  - Lack of adoption or developer dissatisfaction could lead to the decline of the framework and impact projects relying on it.
  - Performance bottlenecks or architectural limitations could hinder the ability to build high-performance applications.
  - Incompatibility with new technologies or platforms could limit the framework's future relevance.
  - Open-source nature requires careful community management and contribution governance to maintain quality and direction.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The Spring Framework source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. Implemented in: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Community Security Audits - The large and active community around Spring Framework implicitly contributes to security audits through code review and vulnerability reporting. Implemented in: Community forums, issue trackers.
  - security control: Vulnerability Reporting Process - Spring Security project has a documented process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities. Described in: Spring Security documentation and security advisories.
  - security control: Regular Security Releases - The Spring team releases patched versions of the framework to address identified security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: Spring project release cycle.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Spring Boot helps manage dependencies, including security-related libraries, potentially simplifying updates and reducing vulnerability exposure. Implemented in: Spring Boot project.
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure - Security vulnerabilities, once discovered, are publicly disclosed, potentially creating a window of opportunity for attackers before patches are widely applied.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Vigilance - The security of the framework relies to some extent on the community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities - Spring Framework depends on numerous third-party libraries, which may contain their own vulnerabilities that could indirectly affect Spring applications.
- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Implement automated SAST tools in the build pipeline to detect potential security vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework code itself.
  - security control: Automated Dependency Scanning - Integrate dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by Spring Framework.
  - security control: Regular Penetration Testing - Conduct periodic penetration testing by security experts to identify vulnerabilities that may not be caught by automated tools or community review.
  - security control: Security Champions Program - Establish a security champions program within the Spring development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
  - security control: Security Incident Response Plan - Develop and maintain a detailed incident response plan specifically for security vulnerabilities discovered in the Spring Framework.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Spring Framework should provide robust and flexible mechanisms for application developers to implement authentication in their applications.
    - Implementation: Spring Security project provides comprehensive authentication features.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Spring Framework should offer comprehensive authorization capabilities to control access to application resources based on user roles and permissions.
    - Implementation: Spring Security project provides comprehensive authorization features.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Spring Framework should encourage and facilitate secure input validation practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
    - Implementation: Spring Framework provides features like data binding and validation annotations that can be used for input validation.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Spring Framework should provide secure and easy-to-use cryptographic functionalities for developers who need to implement encryption, hashing, and other cryptographic operations in their applications.
    - Implementation: Spring Security and Spring Framework core provide support for various cryptographic operations and integrations with security providers.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process we are trying to protect:
  - Development and distribution of the Spring Framework, ensuring its integrity, availability, and security for the global Java developer community and applications built upon it.
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - Source code: Highly sensitive. Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in the framework and all applications using it.
  - Build artifacts (JAR files): Medium sensitivity. Compromised artifacts could be distributed and used in applications, leading to widespread impact.
  - Build system credentials and secrets: Highly sensitive. Compromise could allow unauthorized modifications to the build process and artifact distribution.
  - Vulnerability reports: Sensitive. Premature disclosure could be exploited by attackers.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the target audience for this design document? Is it for the Spring team, security auditors, or application developers using Spring?
  - Are there any specific deployment environments or scenarios that should be prioritized for threat modeling?
  - What level of detail is required for the threat model that will follow this design document?
  - Are there any specific regulatory compliance requirements that are relevant to the Spring Framework project?
- Assumptions:
  - The Spring Framework project prioritizes security and aims to provide a secure foundation for building Java applications.
  - The project follows a secure software development lifecycle, including security considerations in design, development, testing, and deployment.
  - The project has a dedicated security team or individuals responsible for security aspects of the framework.
  - The project values community contributions and leverages the community for security reviews and vulnerability reporting.
  - The deployment scenario described (Application Server in a traditional environment) is representative of a common use case for Spring applications.
