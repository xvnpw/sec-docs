# Attack Surface Analysis for spring-projects/spring-framework

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting insecure deserialization of Java objects to execute arbitrary code. An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized by the application, triggers harmful actions.
    *   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring's dependency injection and object management can lead to scenarios where untrusted data is deserialized, especially if using features like remote method invocation (RMI) or handling serialized objects in HTTP requests without proper safeguards. Libraries often used with Spring, like Jackson or XStream, can have deserialization vulnerabilities that Spring applications might be susceptible to.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted serialized object in a request body to a Spring MVC endpoint. If the application deserializes this object without proper validation, it could lead to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and libraries.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
        *   Keep all dependencies, including Jackson and XStream, up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Consider using alternative data formats like JSON where deserialization risks are lower.

## Attack Surface: [Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./attack_surfaces/spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious code into SpEL expressions, which are then evaluated by the Spring Framework, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring uses SpEL extensively for configuration, data binding, and annotation attributes (e.g., `@Value`). If user-controlled input is directly used within SpEL expressions without proper sanitization, it creates an injection point.
    *   **Example:** A web application allows users to specify a sorting criteria, which is then used in a SpEL expression to dynamically order data. An attacker could inject a malicious SpEL expression to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in SpEL expressions.
        *   If absolutely necessary, sanitize and validate user input rigorously before incorporating it into SpEL expressions.
        *   Consider alternative approaches that don't involve dynamic SpEL evaluation with user input.
        *   Implement strict input validation rules and use parameterized queries where applicable.

## Attack Surface: [Data Binding Vulnerabilities (Mass Assignment)](./attack_surfaces/data_binding_vulnerabilities__mass_assignment_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting Spring's data binding mechanism to modify unintended object properties, potentially including sensitive attributes, by providing extra or malicious request parameters.
    *   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring MVC automatically binds request parameters to object properties. If not carefully configured, this can allow attackers to set values for properties that should not be user-modifiable.
    *   **Example:** A user registration form allows setting the `isAdmin` flag by including it as a request parameter, even if the form doesn't explicitly display this field.
    *   **Impact:** High - Privilege escalation, data manipulation, unauthorized access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) specifically designed for data binding, containing only the fields that should be exposed.
        *   Utilize `@Validated` and validation annotations to enforce constraints on input data.
        *   Use `@BindProperty` with `ignoreUnknownFields = true` to prevent binding of unexpected parameters.
        *   Carefully review and restrict which fields are exposed for data binding in your controllers.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (when using Spring Data)](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities__when_using_spring_data_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious SQL code into database queries, allowing attackers to bypass security measures, access sensitive data, or manipulate the database.
    *   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** While Spring Data JPA and JDBC provide mechanisms to prevent SQL injection (e.g., parameterized queries), developers might still introduce vulnerabilities by constructing dynamic queries using string concatenation with user-provided input, especially when using native queries or less secure query building techniques within Spring Data repositories.
    *   **Example:** A Spring Data repository method constructs a native SQL query by directly embedding user-provided search terms, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL.
    *   **Impact:** High - Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential for denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or named parameters provided by Spring Data JPA or JDBC.
        *   Avoid constructing dynamic SQL queries using string concatenation with user input within Spring Data repositories.
        *   Utilize Spring Data JPA's query derivation or JPQL/HQL with caution, ensuring user input is properly handled.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on user-provided data before using it in database queries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Spring Actuator Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/insecure_spring_actuator_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:** Exposing sensitive information or allowing administrative actions through unsecured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
    *   **How Spring-Framework Contributes:** Spring Boot Actuator, a module within the Spring ecosystem, provides endpoints for monitoring and managing applications. If these endpoints are not properly secured, they can reveal sensitive configuration details, environment variables, or even allow for actions like shutting down the application or triggering heap dumps.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses an unsecured `/actuator/env` endpoint to view environment variables, potentially revealing database credentials or API keys. Certain endpoints like `/actuator/jolokia` can even lead to RCE if not secured.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical - Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution (depending on enabled endpoints), denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on exposed endpoints)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Actuator endpoints using Spring Security.
        *   Restrict access to Actuator endpoints based on roles or IP addresses.
        *   Disable or remove unnecessary Actuator endpoints.
        *   Use Spring Boot Actuator's built-in security features to authenticate and authorize access.
