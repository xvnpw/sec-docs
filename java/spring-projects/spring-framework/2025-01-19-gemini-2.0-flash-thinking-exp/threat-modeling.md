# Threat Model Analysis for spring-projects/spring-framework

## Threat: [SpEL Injection](./threats/spel_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expressions if user-provided input is not properly sanitized before being used in SpEL evaluation. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server. Attackers could gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:** `org.springframework.expression.spel.*` (SpEL module), specifically where `ExpressionParser.parseExpression()` or similar methods are used with unsanitized user input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using user input directly in SpEL expressions.
*   If necessary, sanitize and validate user input rigorously before using it in SpEL.
*   Consider using alternative templating engines or safer ways to handle dynamic values.
*   Implement input validation on the server-side.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerability](./threats/deserialization_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious serialized objects and send them to the application. If the application deserializes this untrusted data without proper safeguards, it could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This often exploits vulnerabilities in libraries used by Spring for serialization.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server. Attackers could gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or disrupt services.

**Affected Component:**  `org.springframework.core.serializer.*`, `org.springframework.messaging.converter.*` (where object deserialization is performed), and potentially third-party libraries used for serialization (e.g., Jackson, XStream) when integrated with Spring.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization mechanisms like allow-lists for allowed classes.
*   Prefer safer serialization formats like JSON.
*   Keep Spring Framework and its dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using tools like `SerialKiller` to prevent deserialization of dangerous classes.

## Threat: [Actuator Endpoint Exposure](./threats/actuator_endpoint_exposure.md)

**Description:** If Spring Boot Actuator endpoints are not properly secured, attackers can access sensitive information about the application's configuration, environment, and internal state. Some endpoints can even be used to perform administrative actions.

**Impact:**  Information disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data like API keys, database credentials, or internal network configurations. Exposure of administrative endpoints could lead to complete application compromise or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `org.springframework.boot.actuate.endpoint.*` (Spring Boot Actuator module).

**Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive endpoints are exposed)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure Spring Actuator endpoints using Spring Security.
*   Restrict access to Actuator endpoints to authorized users or internal networks.
*   Disable or customize sensitive endpoints if they are not needed in production.
*   Use management port configuration to separate actuator endpoints.

## Threat: [CSRF Vulnerability due to Missing or Misconfigured Spring Security](./threats/csrf_vulnerability_due_to_missing_or_misconfigured_spring_security.md)

**Description:** If Spring Security's CSRF protection is not enabled or correctly configured, attackers can potentially trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on the application by crafting malicious requests.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a legitimate user, potentially leading to data modification, financial loss, or other harmful consequences.

**Affected Component:** `org.springframework.security.web.csrf.*` (Spring Security's CSRF protection mechanisms).

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the criticality of the actions that can be performed).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable CSRF protection in Spring Security.
*   Ensure CSRF tokens are properly included in forms and AJAX requests.
*   Use `@CsrfToken` tag in Thymeleaf or equivalent mechanisms in other view technologies.
*   Consider customizing CSRF token repository if needed.
