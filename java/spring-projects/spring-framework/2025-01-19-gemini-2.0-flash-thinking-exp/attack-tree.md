## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the application server, leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Binding Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_binding_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Attackers manipulate request parameters to bind malicious data to application objects.
*   This can lead to arbitrary property modification or, more critically, trigger malicious code execution through deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Malicious Code Execution via Gadgets](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_malicious_code_execution_via_gadgets.md)

*   This involves exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities by crafting or using existing "gadget chains" - sequences of method calls within the application's dependencies that can be triggered during deserialization to execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   Insecure deserialization occurs when the application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation. This allows attackers to inject malicious serialized objects that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payload in Request](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payload_in_request.md)

*   The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object and includes it in a request to the application. This payload is designed to exploit known gadget chains.
    *   Insight: Disable default data binding for complex objects and use explicit deserialization with strict type checking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Classpath Gadgets (e.g., Commons Collections)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_classpath_gadgets__e_g___commons_collections_.md)

*   Specific libraries like Apache Commons Collections contain classes that can be chained together to achieve remote code execution during deserialization. Attackers leverage these existing classes.
    *   Insight: Regularly update dependencies and consider using tools to detect and mitigate gadget chain vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Spring Expression Language (SpEL) Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_spring_expression_language__spel__injection.md)

*   Attackers inject malicious SpEL expressions into parts of the application that evaluate them. If user-controlled input is used in SpEL expressions without proper sanitization, it can lead to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious SpEL Expression](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_spel_expression.md)

*   The attacker crafts a SpEL expression that, when evaluated by the Spring Framework, executes arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target `@Value` annotations with user-controlled input](./attack_tree_paths/target__@value__annotations_with_user-controlled_input.md)

*   If user-provided input is directly used within `@Value` annotations, it can be interpreted as a SpEL expression and executed.
                *   Insight: Avoid using user-provided input directly in SpEL expressions. Sanitize or parameterize input if necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deserialization in Message Handling (if using Spring Messaging)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization_in_message_handling__if_using_spring_messaging_.md)

*   Similar to data binding, if the application uses Spring Messaging and deserializes messages without proper safeguards, attackers can send malicious serialized objects via message brokers or endpoints to achieve RCE.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Serialized Object](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_serialized_object.md)

*   The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object and sends it as a message to a vulnerable endpoint or broker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit default deserialization mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_deserialization_mechanisms.md)

*   Default deserialization mechanisms in Java and some libraries are often vulnerable to gadget chain attacks. If the application relies on these defaults without implementing secure deserialization, it's susceptible.
                    *   Insight: Configure message converters to use secure deserialization methods and restrict allowed classes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in Spring Boot Actuator Endpoints (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_spring_boot_actuator_endpoints__if_enabled_.md)

*   Spring Boot Actuator endpoints provide monitoring and management capabilities. If these endpoints are not properly secured with authentication and authorization, attackers can access sensitive information or even execute code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of authentication/authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   If Actuator endpoints are exposed without requiring authentication or proper authorization checks, anyone can access them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access endpoints like `/jolokia` or `/heapdump`](./attack_tree_paths/access_endpoints_like__jolokia__or__heapdump_.md)

*   Specific Actuator endpoints like `/jolokia` allow for JMX access, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. `/heapdump` can expose sensitive information.
                    *   Insight: Secure Actuator endpoints with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
