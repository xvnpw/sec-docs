# Attack Surface Analysis for spring-projects/spring-framework

## Attack Surface: [SpEL Injection](./attack_surfaces/spel_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of Spring Expression Language (SpEL) by injecting malicious code through user-supplied input that is incorporated into SpEL expressions.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring's pervasive use of SpEL in annotations (e.g., `@Value`, `@PreAuthorize`), configuration, and integration with template engines (like Thymeleaf) creates numerous potential injection points *unique to Spring*.  This is a core Spring feature that introduces this risk.
*   **Example:**
    ```java
    @PreAuthorize("#input == 'safeValue'") //Vulnerable if 'input' comes from user without sanitization
    public void securedMethod(String input) { ... }
    ```
    An attacker providing `input` as `T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec('calc')` could execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing attackers to take complete control of the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User Input in SpEL:** The primary mitigation is to *never* directly incorporate unsanitized user input into SpEL expressions.
    *   **Strict Whitelisting:** If user input *must* be used, implement strict whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns. Reject any input that doesn't match the whitelist. Escaping is *not* sufficient.
    *   **Limited SpEL Context:** Use a `SimpleEvaluationContext` (instead of `StandardEvaluationContext`) to restrict the available SpEL features, significantly reducing the attack surface. This limits access to reflection and system calls, a Spring-specific mitigation.
    *   **Template Engine Security:** When using SpEL in template engines (e.g., Thymeleaf), rely on the template engine's built-in escaping mechanisms (e.g., `th:text` in Thymeleaf). Avoid unescaped output (`th:utext`) with user-provided data.

## Attack Surface: [Mass Assignment / Over-Posting](./attack_surfaces/mass_assignment__over-posting.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers submit extra, unexpected fields in HTTP requests that are bound to internal object models, bypassing intended security checks or modifying sensitive data.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring's data binding mechanisms (e.g., `@ModelAttribute`, `@RequestBody`) are *specifically* designed to automatically bind request data to objects. This core Spring feature, while convenient, is the *direct cause* of this vulnerability if not handled carefully.
*   **Example:**
    ```java
    // Vulnerable Controller
    @PostMapping("/updateProfile")
    public String updateProfile(@ModelAttribute User user) {
        // ... saves the user object, potentially including unintended fields ...
    }
    ```
    An attacker could submit `isAdmin=true` along with other profile data, potentially gaining administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, data corruption, bypassing security controls.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Use DTOs that precisely define the expected input fields. This is the *best* practice and directly addresses the Spring data binding mechanism.
    *   **`@InitBinder` with `setAllowedFields` or `setDisallowedFields`:** In controllers, use `@InitBinder` (a Spring-specific feature) to explicitly whitelist or blacklist fields that can be bound. This provides fine-grained control over Spring's data binding.
    *   **`@JsonView` (with Jackson):** For JSON payloads, use `@JsonView` (often used with Spring) to control which fields are included during serialization and deserialization, mitigating the risk at the data binding level.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code when the application deserializes untrusted data.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring provides mechanisms for deserializing data from various sources (e.g., `@RequestBody` with JSON, XML, or, historically, Java Serialization). Spring Boot's auto-configuration can also influence which deserialization features are enabled.  The vulnerability arises from *how Spring handles* deserialization.
*   **Example:** Using `@RequestBody` with a vulnerable Jackson configuration (e.g., default typing enabled) to deserialize untrusted JSON, or using Java Serialization with untrusted input.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Java Serialization:** If at all possible, *completely avoid* using Java Serialization with untrusted data.
    *   **Restrict Deserialized Types (JSON):** When using JSON deserialization (e.g., with Jackson, commonly used with Spring), use `@JsonTypeInfo` with a *whitelist* of allowed types. *Never* use default typing or overly permissive type configurations. This directly controls Spring's deserialization behavior.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If you must use a format prone to deserialization issues, consider using libraries specifically designed for safe deserialization.
    *   **Input Validation:** Even with safe deserialization practices, thoroughly validate the deserialized data *after* deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [Spring Boot Actuator Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/spring_boot_actuator_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of sensitive information or management capabilities through Spring Boot Actuator endpoints without proper authentication and authorization.
*   **Spring Contribution:** Spring Boot Actuator is a *Spring Boot-specific* feature that provides these endpoints. The vulnerability is *entirely* due to the presence and misconfiguration of this Spring Boot component.
*   **Example:** Accessing `/actuator/env` or `/actuator/heapdump` without authentication, revealing environment variables (including secrets) or a heap dump (containing sensitive data).
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further attacks (e.g., using exposed credentials).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on exposed information)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Require Authentication:** Use Spring Security to require authentication for *all* Actuator endpoints. This leverages Spring Security to protect a Spring Boot feature.
    *   **Restrict Access:** Implement authorization rules to limit access to specific roles or users, again using Spring Security.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Endpoints:** Disable any Actuator endpoints that are not absolutely necessary. Use `management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude` in `application.properties` or `application.yml` (Spring Boot configuration).
    *   **Customize Endpoint Exposure:** Fine-tune which endpoints are exposed and what information they reveal using Spring Boot configuration properties.
    *   **Separate Management Port:** Consider running Actuator endpoints on a separate port (using `management.server.port`, a Spring Boot property) that is not exposed to the public internet.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Spring Security](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_spring_security.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrectly configured authorization rules, weak password hashing, or other security misconfigurations *within Spring Security itself*.
*   **Spring Contribution:**  This vulnerability is *entirely* within the scope of Spring Security, a major Spring project.  The misconfiguration is of a *Spring-provided* security mechanism.
*   **Example:**
    *   Using `permitAll()` for sensitive endpoints in your Spring Security configuration.
    *   Using a weak password hashing algorithm (e.g., plain text, MD5) or a low iteration count for BCrypt *within Spring Security's configuration*.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each user role *within Spring Security*.
    *   **Method Security:** Prefer method-level security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize` - Spring Security features) over URL-based configuration.
    *   **Strong Password Hashing:** Use a strong password hashing algorithm (e.g., BCrypt or Argon2) with a high cost factor/iteration count, configured *within Spring Security*.
    *   **Session Fixation Protection:** Rely on Spring Security's built-in session fixation protection (it's enabled by default).
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit your Spring Security configuration.
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test your Spring Security configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Query Injection (Spring Data)](./attack_surfaces/query_injection__spring_data_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious code into queries used by Spring Data modules (e.g., Spring Data JPA, Spring Data MongoDB).
*   **Spring Contribution:** While Spring Data simplifies data access, the *use of custom queries* (e.g., `@Query` annotation) within Spring Data, combined with unsanitized user input, creates this Spring-specific vulnerability. The core issue is how Spring Data handles these custom queries.
*   **Example:**
    ```java
    // Vulnerable repository method (Spring Data JPA)
    @Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.username = '" + username + "'") // Vulnerable!
    User findByUsernameVulnerable(String username);
    ```
    If `username` is attacker-controlled, they could inject SQL.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries:** *Always* use parameterized queries or Spring Data's query methods (which inherently use parameters). *Never* construct queries using string concatenation with user input. This directly addresses how Spring Data interacts with the database.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate user input even when using parameterized queries, as an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Use QueryDSL:** Consider using QueryDSL (often used with Spring Data) for type-safe query construction, further reducing the risk.
