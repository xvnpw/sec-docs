## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Binding and Injection Vulnerabilities](./mitigation_strategies/data_binding_and_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Data Binding with Spring's Mechanisms

**Description:**
1.  **Specific DTOs:** Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) with well-defined fields for request data, rather than binding directly to domain or generic objects. This limits the attack surface.
2.  **`@InitBinder` Whitelisting:** Within your Spring controllers, use `@InitBinder` methods to *explicitly* define which fields are allowed to be bound from request parameters. This provides a whitelist approach.
    ```java
    @InitBinder
    public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
        binder.setAllowedFields("firstName", "lastName", "email"); // Only these fields
    }
    ```
3.  **`DataBinder.setDisallowedFields()` Blacklisting:** Use `DataBinder.setDisallowedFields()` to explicitly *disallow* binding to sensitive fields, such as those related to class loaders or other internal mechanisms (e.g., `class`, `classLoader`, `protectionDomain`). This is a crucial defense against vulnerabilities like Spring4Shell.
    ```java
    @InitBinder
    public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
        binder.setDisallowedFields("class.*", "Class.*", "*.class.*", "*.Class.*");
    }
    ```
4.  **Avoid `@ModelAttribute` on `Class` Objects:**  Never use `@ModelAttribute` to bind request data directly to `java.lang.Class` or related objects. This is a high-risk practice.
5. **Leverage Spring's Validation Framework:** Use Spring's built-in validation features (`@Valid`, validation annotations like `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Email`, etc.) on your DTOs. This integrates with Spring's data binding and provides a convenient way to enforce validation rules.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Property Injection (e.g., Spring4Shell) (Severity: Critical):** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Spring's data binding mechanisms to inject malicious values and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Property Manipulation (Severity: High):** Unauthorized modification of object properties through Spring's data binding, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low/Medium, depending on the completeness of the implementation, especially the use of `setDisallowedFields()`).
*   **Property Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* `@InitBinder` used in `UserController` and `ProductController`. DTOs used for most request payloads. Basic validation with `@Valid`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* `DataBinder.setDisallowedFields()` not consistently used across all controllers. Some older controllers still use broad `@ModelAttribute` binding.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Expression Language Injection (SpEL Injection)](./mitigation_strategies/expression_language_injection__spel_injection_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Secure SpEL Usage within Spring

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid User Input in SpEL:** The *primary* mitigation is to avoid directly embedding user-supplied input into SpEL expressions used within Spring (e.g., in `@PreAuthorize`, view templates, or other Spring components).
2.  **Parameterized SpEL (Spring Security):** When using SpEL in Spring Security annotations (like `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`), use *parameterized expressions* instead of string concatenation. This is a key Spring Security best practice.
    ```java
    // Vulnerable:
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole('" + userRole + "')")

    // Mitigated (using parameter):
    @PreAuthorize("hasRole(#role)")
    public void someMethod(@Param("role") String role) { ... }
    ```
3.  **Restricted `EvaluationContext` (Advanced):** If you *must* use dynamic SpEL evaluation with some influence from user input, create a custom `StandardEvaluationContext` and *restrict* the available variables and functions. This significantly limits the attacker's capabilities, even if they can inject some SpEL code. This is a Spring-specific technique.
    ```java
    StandardEvaluationContext context = new StandardEvaluationContext();
    context.setVariable("userInput", sanitizedUserInput); // Sanitize!
    // ... restrict available functions and properties ...
    ExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser();
    Expression exp = parser.parseExpression("someExpression");
    Object result = exp.getValue(context);
    ```

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via SpEL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious SpEL expressions into Spring components.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium/High):** Attackers can access sensitive data exposed through SpEL expressions within Spring.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low/Medium, depending on the strictness of the restrictions and the avoidance of direct user input).
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (from Medium/High to Low/Medium).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Most uses of `@PreAuthorize` use parameterized expressions.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* A custom `EvaluationContext` is not yet implemented for a specific feature that uses dynamic SpEL based on user-configured settings. A comprehensive audit of all SpEL usage within Spring components is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Spring Security Misconfigurations (Focusing on Spring Security Features)](./mitigation_strategies/spring_security_misconfigurations__focusing_on_spring_security_features_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Correct and Complete Spring Security Configuration

**Description:**
1.  **Proper Authentication and Authorization:** Use Spring Security's features (e.g., `@EnableWebSecurity`, `@PreAuthorize`, `@PostAuthorize`, method security) *correctly*. Define clear authentication and authorization rules. Avoid overly permissive configurations.
2.  **CSRF Protection (Spring Security):** Ensure that Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is *enabled* (it's on by default in recent Spring Security versions) and that your forms include the CSRF token. This is a core Spring Security feature.
3.  **Session Management (Spring Security):** Configure Spring Security's session management to prevent session fixation attacks. Use features like `sessionManagement().sessionFixation().migrateSession()` (or `newSession()`) in your Spring Security configuration.
4. **Secure Actuator Endpoints (Spring Boot):** If using Spring Boot Actuator, secure its endpoints appropriately. Either disable them in production if not needed (`management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=*`) or restrict access using *Spring Security*.
5. **Disable TRACE Method (Spring MVC):** If you are using Spring MVC, disable the HTTP TRACE method using Spring configuration.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Authentication Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Unauthorized access due to misconfigured Spring Security authentication.
*   **Authorization Bypass (Severity: Critical):** Users accessing resources they shouldn't, due to misconfigured Spring Security authorization.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Severity: High):** Attackers performing actions on behalf of users, mitigated by Spring Security's CSRF protection.
*   **Session Fixation (Severity: High):** Attackers hijacking sessions, mitigated by Spring Security's session management.
*   **Information Disclosure via Actuator (Severity: Medium/High):** Leakage of sensitive information through Spring Boot Actuator, mitigated by securing or disabling the endpoints using Spring Security.
*   **Cross-Site Tracing (XST) (Severity: Medium):**  Potential exposure of cookies or headers, mitigated by disabling TRACE method.

**Impact:**
*   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (from Critical to Low, with proper Spring Security configuration).
*   **CSRF:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low, with Spring Security's CSRF protection enabled).
*   **Session Fixation:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low, with proper Spring Security session management).
*   **Information Disclosure (Actuator):** Risk reduced (from Medium/High to Low/Medium, by securing or disabling Actuator endpoints with Spring Security).
*   **XST:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   *Example:* Spring Security configured with basic role-based access control. CSRF protection is enabled. Actuator endpoints are secured using Spring Security.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   *Example:* Session fixation protection not explicitly configured (relying on default, which might not be the most secure option). A comprehensive review of all `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize` annotations is needed. TRACE method is not disabled.
