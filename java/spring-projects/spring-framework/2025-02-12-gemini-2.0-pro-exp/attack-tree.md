## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Spring Data Binding Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_spring_data_binding_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Spring binds HTTP request parameters to Java objects. This can allow them to manipulate objects in unexpected ways, potentially leading to RCE or data modification.

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **CVEs (***):**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting known, publicly documented vulnerabilities (identified by CVE numbers) in specific versions of the Spring Framework related to data binding. Examples include "Spring4Shell" (CVE-2022-22965).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on patching)
        *   **Impact:** High (Often RCE)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits may be public)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

    *   **Improper Type Conversion [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:** Abusing situations where the application doesn't strictly validate or restrict the types of objects being bound. Attackers might inject malicious objects or manipulate existing ones. This is particularly relevant with `PropertyEditor` or custom converters.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (RCE or object manipulation)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Spring Actuator Endpoints Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_spring_actuator_endpoints_misconfiguration__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage improperly secured Spring Boot Actuator endpoints, which are designed for monitoring and managing the application. If exposed without proper authentication or authorization, these endpoints can leak sensitive information or allow for RCE.

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

    *    **Unauthenticated Access:**
         *   **Description:** Actuator endpoints are accessible without any authentication, allowing anyone to interact with them.
         *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconfiguration)
         *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the endpoint)
         *   **Effort:** Low
         *   **Skill Level:** Low
         *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure (***):**
        *   **Description:** Even with authentication, certain endpoints can expose sensitive data if not properly configured or restricted.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

        *   **Specific High-Risk Endpoints:**

            *   **Heap Dump (***):**
                *   **Description:** The `/heapdump` endpoint allows downloading a complete memory dump of the application, potentially containing secrets like passwords, API keys, and session tokens.
                *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Should be highly restricted)
                *   **Impact:** High (Full memory exposure)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

            *   **Env Vars (***):**
                *   **Description:** The `/env` endpoint reveals environment variables, which might include database credentials, cloud provider keys, or other secrets.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Often exposed by default)
                *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Sensitive environment variables)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Low
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
