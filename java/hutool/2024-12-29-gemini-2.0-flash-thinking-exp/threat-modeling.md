*   **Threat:** Malicious Deserialization
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious serialized object and provide it to the application, which then deserializes it using Hutool's `ObjectUtil`. Upon deserialization, this object could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. The attacker might achieve this by exploiting endpoints that accept serialized data or by manipulating data streams.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `cn.hutool.core.util.ObjectUtil.unserialize()` function within the `core` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization.
        *   Consider using alternative, safer serialization mechanisms.
        *   Keep Hutool updated to the latest version, as security patches may address deserialization vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Operations
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input used in file path construction with Hutool's `FileUtil` to access files or directories outside the intended scope. This could allow them to read sensitive files, overwrite critical system files, or execute arbitrary code if they can write to an executable location. The attacker might exploit input fields, API parameters, or configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification or deletion, potential for code execution if write access is gained to executable locations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions within the `cn.hutool.core.io.FileUtil` class in the `core` module, such as `readString()`, `writeString()`, `copy()`, `move()`, `getInputStream()`, `getOutputStream()`, etc.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input used in file path construction.
        *   Use absolute paths or canonical paths to prevent traversal.
        *   Implement access controls and permissions to restrict file system access.
        *   Avoid directly using user input in file path construction; instead, use predefined base directories and append validated filenames.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious commands into input that is subsequently used by Hutool's `RuntimeUtil` to execute system commands. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application. This could be achieved through vulnerable input fields, API parameters, or by manipulating data processed by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions within the `cn.hutool.core.util.RuntimeUtil` class in the `core` module, such as `exec()` and `execForLines()`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `RuntimeUtil` to execute commands based on user input whenever possible.
        *   If command execution is absolutely necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input.
        *   Use parameterized commands or libraries specifically designed for safe command execution.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege for the application's execution environment.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate URLs provided to Hutool's `HttpUtil` to make requests to unintended internal or external resources. This allows the attacker to probe internal network services, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or triggering actions on those services. They might achieve this by manipulating URL parameters or input fields used in HTTP request construction.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems, denial of service against internal or external targets.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions within the `cn.hutool.http.HttpUtil` class in the `http` module, such as `get()`, `post()`, and other HTTP request methods.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided URLs before making HTTP requests.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed destination hosts or IP addresses.
        *   Disable or restrict access to internal network resources from the application server.
        *   Consider using a dedicated library for handling HTTP requests with built-in SSRF protection.
