# Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `hutool-http`

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities when using the `hutool-http` component, specifically its `HttpUtil` class, within an application.  This includes:

*   Identifying specific code patterns that are vulnerable to SSRF.
*   Understanding the potential impact of successful SSRF exploitation.
*   Developing concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating SSRF risks, going beyond the high-level strategies already identified.
*   Providing developers with clear guidance on secure usage of `HttpUtil`.
*   Assessing the effectiveness of different mitigation techniques.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on SSRF vulnerabilities arising from the use of `hutool-http`'s `HttpUtil` for making HTTP requests.  It does *not* cover:

*   Other potential SSRF vulnerabilities in the application that don't involve `HttpUtil`.
*   Other attack vectors against `hutool-http` (e.g., denial-of-service, header injection, *unless* they directly contribute to SSRF).
*   Vulnerabilities in other Hutool modules.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Code Review:**  Examining the source code of `hutool-http` (specifically `HttpUtil` and related classes) to understand its internal workings and identify potential weaknesses.  This includes looking at how URLs are parsed, connections are established, and redirects are handled.
*   **Static Analysis:** Using static analysis tools (e.g., FindSecBugs, SonarQube) to automatically detect potential SSRF vulnerabilities in code that uses `HttpUtil`.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  Describing how dynamic analysis (e.g., using a web application security scanner like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite) could be used to identify SSRF vulnerabilities at runtime.  We won't perform actual dynamic analysis, but we'll outline the approach.
*   **Threat Modeling:**  Considering various attack scenarios and how an attacker might exploit `HttpUtil` to achieve SSRF.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  Reviewing established security best practices for preventing SSRF, including OWASP guidelines and other relevant resources.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1.  Vulnerable Code Patterns

The core vulnerability lies in using user-supplied input directly or indirectly to construct the URL passed to `HttpUtil` methods.  Here are specific examples:

*   **Direct User Input:**
    ```java
    String userInput = request.getParameter("url");
    String response = HttpUtil.get(userInput); // Vulnerable!
    ```
*   **Indirect User Input (e.g., from a database):**
    ```java
    String urlFromDatabase = getUrlFromDatabase(userId); // Assume this is attacker-controlled
    String response = HttpUtil.post(urlFromDatabase, data); // Vulnerable!
    ```
*   **Partial User Input (Concatenation):**
    ```java
    String baseUrl = "http://example.com/api/";
    String endpoint = request.getParameter("endpoint"); // Attacker controls this
    String response = HttpUtil.get(baseUrl + endpoint); // Vulnerable!  Attacker can set endpoint to "../../../internal-service"
    ```
* **Bypassing weak validation:**
    ```java
    String userInput = request.getParameter("url");
    if (userInput.startsWith("http://example.com")) {
        String response = HttpUtil.get(userInput); // Vulnerable! Attacker can use http://example.com@attacker.com or http://example.com.attacker.com
    }
    ```
* **Using HttpUtil.createGet/createPost without proper validation:**
    ```java
    String userInput = request.getParameter("url");
    HttpRequest request = HttpUtil.createGet(userInput); //Vulnerable
    HttpResponse response = request.execute();
    ```

### 4.2.  Exploitation Scenarios

An attacker can exploit SSRF in several ways:

*   **Accessing Internal Services:**  The attacker provides a URL like `http://localhost:8080/admin` or `http://192.168.1.1/internal-api` to access services that are not exposed to the public internet.  This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
*   **Port Scanning:**  The attacker can probe internal ports to discover running services.  For example, they might try URLs like `http://localhost:22`, `http://localhost:3306`, etc.
*   **Cloud Metadata Services:**  If the application is running on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP), the attacker can access metadata services to obtain sensitive information, including credentials.  Example (AWS): `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.
*   **Reading Local Files:**  In some cases, the attacker might be able to use the `file://` protocol to read local files on the server.  Example: `file:///etc/passwd`.  This depends on the underlying HTTP client implementation and server configuration.
*   **Blind SSRF:**  Even if the application doesn't return the response body, the attacker can still infer information based on response times or error messages.  This can be used for port scanning or identifying internal services.
*   **Bypassing IP-Based Access Controls:**  If the application uses IP whitelisting to restrict access to certain resources, SSRF can bypass this by making the request from the server itself (which is likely on the whitelist).

### 4.3.  Detailed Mitigation Strategies

Beyond the high-level mitigations, here are more specific and robust approaches:

*   **1.  Avoid User-Provided URLs (Ideal):**  The most secure approach is to avoid using user input to construct URLs entirely.  Use predefined URLs or configuration settings whenever possible.

*   **2.  Strict Whitelist (Domain and Protocol):**
    *   **Domain Whitelist:**  Maintain a list of *fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)* that are allowed.  Do *not* use partial matching or regular expressions that can be bypassed.
        ```java
        Set<String> allowedDomains = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(
            "api.example.com",
            "cdn.example.net"
        ));

        String userInput = request.getParameter("url");
        URL url;
        try {
            url = new URL(userInput);
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            // Handle invalid URL
            return;
        }

        if (!allowedDomains.contains(url.getHost())) {
            // Reject the request
            return;
        }

        String response = HttpUtil.get(userInput);
        ```
    *   **Protocol Whitelist:**  Explicitly allow only specific protocols (e.g., `https` and *maybe* `http`).  Reject `file://`, `ftp://`, `gopher://`, etc.
        ```java
        if (!url.getProtocol().equals("https") && !url.getProtocol().equals("http")) {
            // Reject the request
            return;
        }
        ```
    *   **Port Restriction:** If possible, restrict allowed ports. For example, only allow 80 and 443.
        ```java
        int port = url.getPort();
        if (port != -1 && port != 80 && port != 443) {
            // Reject
            return;
        }
        ```

*   **3.  Input Validation (Beyond Basic Format):**
    *   **DNS Resolution Check:**  After validating the URL format, resolve the hostname to an IP address and check if it's a public IP.  This helps prevent access to internal IP ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`).
        ```java
        try {
            InetAddress address = InetAddress.getByName(url.getHost());
            if (address.isLoopbackAddress() || address.isSiteLocalAddress() || address.isLinkLocalAddress()) {
                // Reject the request - it's an internal IP
                return;
            }
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            // Handle DNS resolution failure
            return;
        }
        ```
    *   **Prevent URL Redirection to Internal Resources:**  Configure `HttpUtil` to *not* follow redirects, or to limit redirects to the same whitelisted domain.  This prevents an attacker from using an external URL that redirects to an internal resource.
        ```java
        // Disable redirects
        HttpRequest request = HttpUtil.createGet(userInput).disableRedirect();
        HttpResponse response = request.execute();

        // OR, limit redirects to the same domain (more complex, requires custom logic)
        ```
    *   **Reject IP Addresses Directly:** Prevent users from providing IP addresses directly in the URL. Force them to use domain names, which you can then resolve and validate.
    * **Reject encoded characters:** Check and reject any encoded characters in the URL, such as `%2e` (.), `%2f` (/), etc.

*   **4.  Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the application server from internal services using network segmentation (e.g., firewalls, VLANs).  This limits the impact of a successful SSRF attack.

*   **5.  Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the least privileges necessary.  This reduces the potential damage if an attacker gains access to internal resources.

*   **6.  Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement logging and monitoring to detect suspicious HTTP requests, such as requests to internal IP addresses or unusual URLs.  Set up alerts to notify administrators of potential SSRF attempts.

*   **7.  Consider a Proxy:**  Use a forward proxy to control outbound HTTP traffic.  Configure the proxy to only allow connections to the whitelisted domains.

* **8. Use dedicated library for URL validation:** Use a dedicated, well-tested library for URL validation, such as the `java.net.URI` class or a third-party library like Apache Commons Validator.
