## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Hutool Serialization Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_hutool_serialization_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Critical Node: `1.1 Insecure Deserialization of Untrusted Data via SerializeUtil`**
    *   **Description:** This is the core vulnerability. If the application uses `SerializeUtil` (or related functions like `deserialize`) to process serialized data from an untrusted source (e.g., user input, a network request, an external API), it is highly susceptible to a Java deserialization attack.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if untrusted data is deserialized)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Remote Code Execution is almost certain)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Attack Step: `1.1.1 Craft Malicious Payload`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker creates a specially crafted serialized object. This object contains a "gadget chain" â€“ a sequence of Java classes that, when deserialized by the vulnerable application, will execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (given the vulnerability exists)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (Tools like `ysoserial` can automate payload generation)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Payloads can be obfuscated)

*   **Attack Step: `1.1.2 Find Existing Gadget Chain`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker researches and identifies a suitable gadget chain. This chain must be compatible with the libraries present in the application's classpath (including Hutool and its dependencies). Publicly available resources and tools like `ysoserial` list many known gadget chains.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the application's classpath)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Many pre-built gadget chains are available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner - Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Hutool Utility Functions (Mis)use (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_hutool_utility_functions__mis_use__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Step: `2.1 Abuse HttpUtil for SSRF or Data Leakage`**
    *    **Description:** The attacker exploits the application's use of Hutool's `HttpUtil` to make unauthorized requests to internal or external resources. This is often achieved by manipulating input parameters that control the target URL of the HTTP request.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on how `HttpUtil` is used and input validation)
    *   **Impact:** Medium - High (Data leakage, access to internal resources, potentially RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low - Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner - Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Attack Step: `2.1.1 Craft Malicious Request`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts input that, when processed by the application, causes `HttpUtil` to make a request to a URL of the attacker's choosing. This could be an internal IP address, a sensitive internal endpoint, or an external server controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium - High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **Attack Step: `2.1.2 Use `HttpUtil` to Access Internal Resources`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker successfully uses the manipulated `HttpUtil` call to access internal resources that should not be accessible from the outside. This could include internal databases, file systems, or other services.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on network configuration and internal service security)
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low - Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
