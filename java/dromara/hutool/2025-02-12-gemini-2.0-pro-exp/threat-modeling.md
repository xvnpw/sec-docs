# Threat Model Analysis for dromara/hutool

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data via `hutool-core`](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_via__hutool-core_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious serialized data to an application endpoint that uses Hutool's `SerializeUtil` (or related functions in `hutool-core`) for deserialization.  The attacker crafts the serialized data to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization. This is a classic Java deserialization vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server.  The attacker gains full control of the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Affected Hutool Component:** `hutool-core`, specifically functions related to serialization and deserialization (e.g., `SerializeUtil.deserialize()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:**  *Never* deserialize data from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs) using `SerializeUtil` or similar functions. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Use Safe Alternatives:** If serialization/deserialization is necessary, use safer alternatives like JSON or XML serialization with strict schema validation and whitelisting of allowed classes. Hutool's `JSONUtil` can be used *if* you properly validate the structure and content of the JSON.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):** While input validation is generally good, it's *not* a reliable defense against deserialization vulnerabilities.  Attackers can often bypass validation checks.
    *   **Object Input Stream Filtering (Java 9+):** If using Java 9 or later, configure `ObjectInputStream` filters to restrict the classes that can be deserialized. This provides a stronger defense, but requires careful configuration.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via `hutool-core` File Utilities](./threats/path_traversal_via__hutool-core__file_utilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted file path (e.g., "../../etc/passwd") to an application function that uses Hutool's `FileUtil` (or related functions in `hutool-core`) to read or write files.  The attacker aims to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:**  Information Disclosure (reading sensitive files), Data Modification (overwriting critical files), or potentially Denial of Service (deleting essential files).
*   **Affected Hutool Component:** `hutool-core`, specifically functions related to file operations (e.g., `FileUtil.readBytes()`, `FileUtil.writeBytes()`, `FileUtil.getInputStream()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  *Always* validate and sanitize file paths received from untrusted sources.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only specific characters and patterns.  Reject any path containing ".." or other suspicious sequences.
    *   **Canonicalization:**  Use `File.getCanonicalPath()` (or Hutool's equivalent) to resolve the absolute path *after* validation. This helps prevent bypasses using symbolic links or other tricks.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary file system permissions.  Avoid granting write access to sensitive directories.
    *   **Chroot/Jail (Advanced):**  In high-security environments, consider running the application in a chroot jail or container to restrict its file system access.

## Threat: [Weak Cryptography via `hutool-crypto`](./threats/weak_cryptography_via__hutool-crypto_.md)

*   **Description:** A developer uses `hutool-crypto` but chooses weak cryptographic algorithms (e.g., DES, MD5), short key lengths, predictable initialization vectors (IVs), or insecure cipher modes (e.g., ECB).  The attacker exploits these weaknesses to decrypt encrypted data or forge signatures.
*   **Impact:**  Information Disclosure (decryption of sensitive data), Data Tampering (modification of encrypted data), or Authentication Bypass (forging signatures).
*   **Affected Hutool Component:** `hutool-crypto`, all functions related to encryption, decryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Strong Algorithms:**  Always use strong, modern cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256, SHA-256, RSA with at least 2048-bit keys).  Avoid deprecated or weak algorithms.
    *   **Sufficient Key Lengths:**  Use appropriate key lengths for the chosen algorithm (e.g., 256 bits for AES, 2048 bits or more for RSA).
    *   **Random IVs:**  For ciphers that require an IV (e.g., CBC mode), always use a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate a unique IV for each encryption operation. *Never* reuse IVs.
    *   **Secure Cipher Modes:**  Use secure cipher modes like GCM or CTR.  Avoid ECB mode.
    *   **Key Management:**  Implement secure key management practices.  Store keys securely and protect them from unauthorized access.
    * **Avoid using deprecated methods:** Deprecated methods may have known security issues.

## Threat: [Insecure HTTP Requests via `hutool-http`](./threats/insecure_http_requests_via__hutool-http_.md)

*   **Description:** A developer uses `hutool-http` to make HTTP requests but disables SSL/TLS certificate verification, sends sensitive data over unencrypted HTTP connections, or ignores hostname verification.  An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to intercept or modify the communication.
*   **Impact:**  Information Disclosure (interception of sensitive data), Data Tampering (modification of requests or responses), or potentially Session Hijacking.
*   **Affected Hutool Component:** `hutool-http`, functions related to making HTTP requests (e.g., `HttpRequest`, `HttpUtil`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable SSL/TLS Verification:**  *Always* enable SSL/TLS certificate verification when making HTTPS requests.  Do *not* disable certificate validation.
    *   **Use HTTPS:**  Use HTTPS for all communication that involves sensitive data.  Avoid using plain HTTP.
    *   **Hostname Verification:**  Ensure that hostname verification is enabled to prevent MitM attacks using forged certificates.
    *   **Secure Headers:**  Use appropriate security headers (e.g., HSTS, Content Security Policy) to protect against various web attacks.

## Threat: [XXE (XML External Entity) Injection via `hutool-poi` or `hutool-core` (XML Parsing)](./threats/xxe__xml_external_entity__injection_via__hutool-poi__or__hutool-core___xml_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious XML document containing external entity references to an application that uses Hutool's XML parsing capabilities (either through `hutool-poi` for Excel files or directly via `hutool-core`'s XML utilities). The attacker aims to read local files, access internal network resources, or cause a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (reading local files or internal network data), Denial of Service, or potentially Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Affected Hutool Component:** `hutool-poi` (if used for processing Excel files with XML content) and `hutool-core` (functions related to XML parsing, e.g., `XmlUtil`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Entities:**  When parsing XML, explicitly disable the resolution of external entities and DTDs.  This is the most effective mitigation.  Hutool's `XmlUtil` provides options for this.
    *   **Use a Safe XML Parser:**  Ensure that the underlying XML parser used by Hutool is configured securely to prevent XXE attacks.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited Effectiveness):**  While input validation is good practice, it's not a reliable defense against XXE.  Attackers can often bypass validation checks.
