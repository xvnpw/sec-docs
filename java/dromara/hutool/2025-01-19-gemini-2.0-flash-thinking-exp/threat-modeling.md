# Threat Model Analysis for dromara/hutool

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization](./threats/insecure_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious serialized data and, if the application deserializes this data using Hutool's serialization utilities without proper validation, execute arbitrary code on the server or perform other malicious actions. This is done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to instantiate malicious objects.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to full system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.util.ObjectUtil` (e.g., `deserialize`), `cn.hutool.core.io.SerializeUtil` (e.g., `deserialize`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, implement robust input validation and sanitization before deserialization.
        *   Consider using safer serialization mechanisms like JSON or Protocol Buffers if possible.
        *   Keep Hutool updated to the latest version, as vulnerabilities might be patched.

## Threat: [Path Traversal via File System Utilities](./threats/path_traversal_via_file_system_utilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-provided input that is used by Hutool's file system utilities (e.g., reading or writing files) to access or modify files outside the intended directory. This is achieved by including path traversal sequences like `../` in the input.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification of critical system files, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.io.FileUtil` (e.g., `readString`, `writeString`, `copy`), `cn.hutool.core.io.resource.ResourceUtil`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided input used in file path construction.
        *   Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths.
        *   Implement access controls and ensure the application runs with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct file paths.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) through HTTP Client](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__through_http_client.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could control the destination URL used by Hutool's HTTP client (`HttpUtil`) to make requests to internal resources or external services. This allows them to bypass firewalls, access internal APIs, or potentially interact with unintended third-party systems.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems, or abuse of external services.
    *   **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.http.HttpUtil` (e.g., `get`, `post`, other request methods).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all user-provided input used to construct URLs for HTTP requests.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed destination URLs or domains.
        *   Disable or restrict access to sensitive internal networks from the application server.
        *   Consider using a proxy server for outbound requests to enforce security policies.

## Threat: [Command Injection via Process Execution](./threats/command_injection_via_process_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious commands into input that is used by Hutool's process execution utilities (`RuntimeUtil`). If the application executes these commands without proper sanitization, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), leading to full system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.util.RuntimeUtil` (e.g., `exec`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `RuntimeUtil.exec` with user-provided input if possible.
        *   If necessary, strictly sanitize and validate user input to prevent command injection.
        *   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to execute system tasks.
        *   Run the application with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Abuse of Code Generation/Reflection Utilities](./threats/abuse_of_code_generationreflection_utilities.md)

*   **Description:** Hutool offers utilities for code generation and reflection. If used improperly or if vulnerabilities exist within these utilities, attackers might be able to bypass security restrictions, access private members, or even execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, bypassing security mechanisms, or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.util.ReflectUtil`, `cn.hutool.core.lang.generator`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and restrict the usage of Hutool's reflection and code generation utilities.
        *   Avoid using these features with user-controlled input.
        *   Ensure proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized use of these powerful features.
