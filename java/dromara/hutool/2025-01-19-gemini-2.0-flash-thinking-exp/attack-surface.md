# Attack Surface Analysis for dromara/hutool

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Path Traversal Vulnerability
    *   **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `FileUtil` class provides methods for file system operations. If user-controlled input is directly used to construct file paths passed to these methods without proper validation, attackers can access or manipulate files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential data breaches, modification of critical system files, leading to system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate user-provided file paths.
        *   Use canonicalization techniques to resolve symbolic links and relative paths.
        *   Avoid directly using user input in file path construction.

## Attack Surface: [Archive Extraction Vulnerabilities (Zip Bomb, Path Traversal)](./attack_surfaces/archive_extraction_vulnerabilities__zip_bomb__path_traversal_.md)

*   **Description:** Archive Extraction Vulnerabilities (Zip Bomb, Path Traversal)
    *   **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `ZipUtil` and `TarUtil` simplify the extraction of archive files. If these utilities are used to extract archives from untrusted sources without proper safeguards, malicious archives can exploit vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion, arbitrary file write/overwrite leading to potential code execution or data corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate the source and integrity of archive files.
        *   Implement checks to prevent extraction outside the designated directory.
        *   Set limits on the size and number of files within archives.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Command Injection Vulnerability
    *   **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `RuntimeUtil` provides methods for executing system commands. If user-provided input is incorporated into the commands executed by `RuntimeUtil` without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using `RuntimeUtil` with user-provided input whenever possible.
        *   If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the input.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability
    *   **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `HttpUtil` simplifies making HTTP requests. If user-controlled input is directly used as the target URL in `HttpUtil` methods, attackers can potentially make requests to internal resources or external services on behalf of the server.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, ability to interact with internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize user-provided URLs.
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed target domains or protocols.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs for HTTP requests.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerability (if misused)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerability__if_misused_.md)

*   **Description:** Deserialization Vulnerability (if misused)
    *   **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `JSONUtil` and `XMLUtil` provide functionalities for serializing and deserializing data. If used with configurations that allow arbitrary object creation from untrusted data, it can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid deserializing untrusted data into arbitrary objects.
        *   Use safe deserialization configurations.
        *   Be extremely cautious when using custom deserializers or type hints with untrusted data.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Template Engines (if used with untrusted templates)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_template_engines__if_used_with_untrusted_templates_.md)

*   **Description:** Code Injection via Template Engines (if used with untrusted templates)
    *   **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `TemplateUtil` allows for template processing. If user-provided input is used to construct or influence the content of templates that are then processed, it could potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat template files as code and protect them accordingly.
        *   Avoid allowing users to directly modify or upload template files.
        *   Sanitize any user input that is incorporated into templates.
