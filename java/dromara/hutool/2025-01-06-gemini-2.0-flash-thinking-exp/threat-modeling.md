# Threat Model Analysis for dromara/hutool

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Write/Overwrite](./threats/arbitrary_file_writeoverwrite.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths provided to Hutool's file writing utilities (e.g., `FileUtil.writeString`, `FileUtil.writeBytes`) to write or overwrite files in arbitrary locations on the server. This vulnerability arises from how Hutool handles and processes file paths.
- **Impact:**  Modification of application configuration, deployment of malicious code, denial of service by overwriting critical system files.
- **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.io.FileUtil` (specifically methods like `writeString`, `writeBytes`, `copy`).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Sanitize and validate all user-provided file paths *before* passing them to Hutool's file writing utilities.
    - Restrict write access to specific directories at the operating system level.
    - Implement robust access control mechanisms within the application.

## Threat: [Zip Slip Vulnerability during Archive Extraction](./threats/zip_slip_vulnerability_during_archive_extraction.md)

- **Description:** When using Hutool's zip or tar archive extraction utilities (`ZipUtil`, `TarUtil`), an attacker could craft a malicious archive containing entries with filenames that include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../malicious.jsp`). When extracted using Hutool, these files can be written to arbitrary locations outside the intended extraction directory due to insufficient path validation within Hutool's archive handling logic.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to remote code execution by writing executable files to web server directories.
- **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.util.ZipUtil`, `cn.hutool.core.compress.TarUtil` (specifically methods related to extraction).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - When extracting archives using Hutool, validate and sanitize the filenames of the extracted entries *before* writing them to the file system.
    - Use secure extraction methods or libraries that inherently prevent writing files outside the target directory.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

- **Description:** If the application uses Hutool's serialization/deserialization utilities (`ObjectUtil`) with untrusted input, an attacker could provide malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by Hutool, executes arbitrary code. This is a direct consequence of the inherent risks associated with Java's built-in serialization mechanism, which Hutool exposes.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution.
- **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.util.ObjectUtil` (specifically methods like `unserialize`).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Strongly avoid** deserializing data from untrusted sources using Hutool's `ObjectUtil`.
    - If deserialization is absolutely necessary, ensure the input is authenticated and its integrity is verified cryptographically *before* attempting deserialization.
    - Consider using safer serialization formats like JSON instead of Java's built-in serialization.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Expression Evaluation](./threats/code_injection_via_expression_evaluation.md)

- **Description:** If the application uses Hutool's expression evaluation capabilities (`ExprUtil`) with untrusted input, an attacker could inject malicious code or expressions that are then executed by Hutool's expression evaluation engine.
- **Impact:** Remote code execution.
- **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.lang.ExprUtil`.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Absolutely avoid** using Hutool's expression evaluation with any form of untrusted input.
    - If dynamic expression evaluation is required, carefully design and implement a safe and restricted evaluation environment, potentially using a sandboxed or more secure expression language.

## Threat: [Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal](./threats/arbitrary_file_read_via_path_traversal.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could manipulate file paths provided to Hutool's file reading utilities (e.g., `FileUtil.readString`, `FileUtil.getInputStream`) to access files outside the intended directory. This vulnerability stems from how Hutool processes the provided file paths without sufficient validation.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data stored on the server's file system.
- **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.core.io.FileUtil` (specifically methods like `readString`, `getInputStream`, `readLines`).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Sanitize and validate all user-provided file paths *before* using them with Hutool's file reading utilities.
    - Use absolute paths whenever possible and avoid constructing paths based on user input without thorough checks.
    - Implement strict whitelisting of allowed file paths or directories.

## Threat: [Misuse of Cryptographic Functions](./threats/misuse_of_cryptographic_functions.md)

- **Description:** Developers might incorrectly use Hutool's cryptographic utilities (`SecureUtil`, `SymmetricCrypto`, `AsymmetricCrypto`, `Digester`) by using weak algorithms, default keys, or improper padding schemes, leading to insecure encryption or hashing. While the underlying algorithms might be sound, the way Hutool exposes and allows configuration of these functions can lead to developer errors.
- **Impact:** Data breaches, authentication bypass, integrity compromise.
- **Affected Hutool Component:** `cn.hutool.crypto` package.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Follow cryptographic best practices.
    - Use strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms.
    - Properly manage and securely store cryptographic keys (Hutool itself doesn't manage keys securely, this is a developer responsibility when using its crypto features).
    - Understand the implications of different padding schemes and modes of operation.
    - Consult with security experts for cryptographic implementations.
