# Attack Surface Analysis for dromara/hutool

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via File Operations](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_file_operations.md)

* **Attack Surface: Path Traversal via File Operations**
    * **Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths provided to the application to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.
    * **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `FileUtil` class provides convenient methods for file creation, reading, writing, and deletion. If user-controlled input is used directly or indirectly to construct file paths passed to these methods without proper sanitization, it can lead to path traversal.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to download files based on a filename parameter. Using `FileUtil.readBytes(baseDir + userProvidedFilename)`, an attacker could provide a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd` to read sensitive system files.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification of critical application files, or even remote code execution in some scenarios if attackers can overwrite executable files.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Input Validation: Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided file names and paths. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and patterns.
        * Canonicalization:  Resolve canonical paths to ensure the requested path is within the expected directory.
        * Sandboxing:  Restrict the application's file system access to a specific directory.
        * Avoid Direct User Input:  Do not directly use user input to construct file paths. Use predefined identifiers or mappings.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

* **Attack Surface: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    * **Description:** An attacker can induce the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary internal or external destinations, potentially bypassing firewalls or accessing internal services.
    * **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `HttpUtil` class simplifies making HTTP requests. If user-controlled input is used to construct the target URL for methods like `HttpUtil.get()` or `HttpUtil.post()`, an attacker can control the destination of the request.
    * **Example:** An application fetches data from an external API based on a URL provided by the user. Using `HttpUtil.get(userProvidedURL)`, an attacker could provide a URL to an internal service like `http://localhost:8080/admin` to trigger unintended actions.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, denial of service of internal services, or even potential compromise of other systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Input Validation and Whitelisting:  Validate and sanitize user-provided URLs. Maintain a whitelist of allowed domains or IP addresses.
        * URL Parameterization:  If possible, avoid directly constructing URLs from user input. Use predefined parameters or identifiers.
        * Network Segmentation: Isolate internal networks and restrict outbound traffic from the application server.
        * Disable or Restrict Redirection:  Be cautious with automatic HTTP redirects.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

* **Attack Surface: Deserialization of Untrusted Data**
    * **Description:**  An attacker can provide malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by the application, can lead to arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions.
    * **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `ObjectUtil` class provides methods for serialization and deserialization. If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources using `ObjectUtil.deserialize()`, it becomes vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    * **Example:** An application receives serialized objects from a client and uses `ObjectUtil.deserialize()` to process them. An attacker could send a specially crafted serialized object that, upon deserialization, executes malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:  The best defense is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources altogether.
        * Use Secure Serialization Mechanisms:  Consider using safer data exchange formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers.
        * Input Validation (for unavoidable deserialization): If deserialization is unavoidable, implement strict validation of the structure and content of the serialized data.
        * Context-Specific Deserialization:  If possible, deserialize only the necessary parts of the object.
        * Monitor and Patch: Stay updated on known deserialization vulnerabilities and patch Hutool and the JVM accordingly.

## Attack Surface: [Zip Slip Vulnerability during Archive Extraction](./attack_surfaces/zip_slip_vulnerability_during_archive_extraction.md)

* **Attack Surface: Zip Slip Vulnerability during Archive Extraction**
    * **Description:**  When extracting ZIP archives, specially crafted archive entries with relative paths can overwrite files outside the intended extraction directory.
    * **How Hutool Contributes:** Hutool's `ZipUtil` class provides methods for creating and extracting ZIP archives. If the application uses `ZipUtil.unzip()` or similar methods without proper validation of entry names, it's susceptible to zip slip.
    * **Example:** An application allows users to upload ZIP files. An attacker uploads a ZIP file containing an entry named `../../../../tmp/evil.txt`. When extracted using `ZipUtil.unzip()`, this file could be written to `/tmp/evil.txt` instead of the intended subdirectory.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to application compromise or data corruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Validate Entry Names:  Before extracting, validate the names of entries within the ZIP archive to ensure they don't contain relative path components like `..`.
        * Use Secure Extraction Methods:  Ensure the extraction logic prevents writing files outside the target directory. Some libraries offer safer extraction options.
