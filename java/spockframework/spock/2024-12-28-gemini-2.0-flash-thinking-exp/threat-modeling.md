### High and Critical Spock Framework Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the Spock testing framework.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection in Data Tables
    *   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to modify test specifications could inject malicious code (e.g., Groovy scripts) directly into Spock's data tables. This code would then be executed by the Spock framework during test runs, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        *   Access sensitive data within the test environment.
        *   Modify test data or the application's state in an unauthorized manner.
        *   Execute arbitrary commands on the test system.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of the test environment.
        *   Potential exposure of sensitive data used in testing.
        *   False positive test results, masking real vulnerabilities in the application.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `spock-core` module, specifically the Data Tables feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory code reviews for all Spock specifications, paying close attention to the content of data tables.
        *   Enforce input validation and sanitization within data table expressions where external data is used.
        *   Restrict access to the test codebase and development environment through strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Spock Extensions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could create or compromise a Spock extension and introduce malicious functionality that is executed by the Spock framework during test runs. This could lead to:
        *   Arbitrary code execution within the test process.
        *   Manipulation of test results.
        *   Exfiltration of sensitive information from the test environment.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of the test environment.
        *   Potential for backdoors or persistent access within the testing infrastructure.
        *   Undermining the integrity of the testing process.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `spock-core` module, specifically the Extension mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only use Spock extensions from trusted sources.
        *   Thoroughly review the source code of any custom or third-party Spock extensions before using them.
        *   Implement a process for managing and auditing the Spock extensions used in the project.
        *   Restrict the ability to add or modify Spock extensions to authorized personnel.

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Test Outcomes to Hide Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the test codebase could modify Spock specifications to always pass, regardless of the actual behavior of the application. This is achieved by manipulating Spock's specification structure or assertion logic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   False sense of security, as vulnerabilities might go undetected.
        *   Deployment of vulnerable code to production.
        *   Erosion of trust in the testing process.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `spock-core` module, specifically the specification execution and assertion mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to Spock specifications.
        *   Track changes to test code and audit them regularly.
        *   Enforce a separation of duties between developers who write application code and those who write and review tests.
        *   Utilize mutation testing tools to assess the effectiveness of tests and identify potential weaknesses.
