## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Spock's Data-Driven Testing Features](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_spock's_data-driven_testing_features.md)

*   **1.1 Inject Malicious Groovy Code via Data Pipes `[CRITICAL]` `[HIGH RISK]`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious Groovy code and injects it into the application through Spock's data pipe mechanism. This is possible if the application or the test code does not properly validate or sanitize the data received from the data pipe before using it. Since Spock and Groovy are inherently dynamic, this untrusted data can be executed as code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Highly dependent on the presence and effectiveness of input validation.)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to complete system compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Finding the injection point might require some reconnaissance, but the exploitation itself is often straightforward given Groovy's dynamic nature.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of Groovy, Spock's data pipes, and injection techniques.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires careful monitoring of test execution, logs, and potentially dynamic analysis to detect unusual code execution. Subtle injections might be missed.)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse Spock's Dynamic Code Generation](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_spock's_dynamic_code_generation.md)

*   **2.1 Inject Groovy Code into Data Pipes `[CRITICAL]` `[HIGH RISK]`**
    *   **Description:** This is the same attack vector as 1.1, emphasizing its relevance within the context of Spock's dynamic code generation capabilities. The dynamic nature of Groovy and Spock increases the risk of code injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Same as 1.1)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Same as 1.1)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Same as 1.1)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Same as 1.1)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Same as 1.1)

*   **2.2 Exploit Groovy Shell Injection via `@Unroll` or Data Pipes `[HIGH RISK]`**
    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages the `@Unroll` annotation, which is used to generate dynamic test names and descriptions, to inject malicious Groovy code. If the data used to generate these strings comes from an untrusted source (e.g., a data pipe or external file) and is not properly sanitized, the attacker can inject code that will be executed during test execution. The "or Data Pipes" part highlights that the source of unsanitized data could be a data pipe, connecting it to the critical vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Requires a specific misconfiguration where `@Unroll` is used with unsanitized data from an untrusted source.  More specific than 2.1, hence slightly lower likelihood.)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Leads to arbitrary code execution on the server.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploiting a known vulnerability is usually straightforward, but finding the specific misconfiguration might require some effort.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of Spock's `@Unroll` feature, Groovy, and injection techniques.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring test output and logs for unusual behavior.  Might be difficult to detect if the injected code is subtle.)
