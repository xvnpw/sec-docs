## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Mocking/Stubbing with Balanced Testing](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_mockingstubbing_with_balanced_testing.md)

*   **1. Mitigation Strategy: Controlled Mocking/Stubbing with Balanced Testing**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Strategic Mocking:**  Within Spock specifications, consciously decide when to use `Mock()`, `Stub()`, or `Spy()`. Prioritize mocking only truly external dependencies (external APIs, databases).
        2.  **Integration Test Complement:** For every Spock unit test heavily using mocks, ensure there's a corresponding integration test (potentially also using Spock, but with fewer mocks or more realistic test doubles) that verifies the interaction between components.
        3.  **Code Review Focus:** During code reviews of Spock specifications, reviewers should specifically question:
            *   Is this mock *necessary*? Could an integration test be more appropriate?
            *   Are all relevant interaction paths (including error conditions) tested, even with the mock?
            *   Is the mock overly simplistic, potentially hiding real-world complexities?
        4.  **Coverage Analysis (Spock-Aware):** While code coverage tools don't directly understand Spock's mocking, use them to identify areas where mocked code has low *overall* coverage (considering both unit and integration tests). This highlights potential gaps.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Untested Code Paths due to Over-Mocking (High Severity):** Spock's powerful mocking can lead to critical code paths remaining untested if real dependencies are always replaced with simplistic mocks.
        *   **False Confidence from Mock-Heavy Tests (Medium Severity):** Developers might be misled by high unit test coverage achieved through excessive mocking, overlooking integration issues.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Untested Code Paths:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring a balance between unit tests with mocks and integration tests with real (or more realistic) dependencies. (Risk reduction: High)
        *   **False Confidence:** Improves the reliability of the test suite by providing a more accurate assessment of code quality and integration. (Risk reduction: Medium)

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Spock is used for unit tests, with widespread use of mocking.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No formal guidelines for when to use mocks vs. integration tests within the Spock context.
        *   Code reviews don't consistently challenge the *necessity* of mocks.
        *   No systematic analysis of coverage gaps related to mocked code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Data-Driven Testing with Spock (Data Providers)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_data-driven_testing_with_spock__data_providers_.md)

*   **2. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Data-Driven Testing with Spock (Data Providers)**

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **No Hardcoded Secrets in `where:` Blocks:**  Enforce a strict rule: *never* include sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) directly within Spock's `where:` blocks.
        2.  **Environment Variables in `where:`:**  Train developers to use environment variables within `where:` blocks to provide sensitive test data.  Example:
            ```groovy
            where:
            username | password             | expectedResult
            "test"   | System.getenv("TEST_PASSWORD") | true
            ```
        3.  **Secrets Management Integration (Spock Context):** If using a secrets management solution, provide Spock-specific examples of how to retrieve secrets and use them within data providers (e.g., using a helper method that fetches the secret).
        4.  **Data Generation in `where:`:** Encourage the use of test data generation libraries (e.g., Faker) *within* the `where:` block to create realistic but non-sensitive data, especially for PII. Example:
            ```groovy
            where:
            firstName | lastName | email
            Faker.instance().name().firstName() | Faker.instance().name().lastName() | Faker.instance().internet().emailAddress()

            ```
        5.  **Code Review for `where:` Blocks:** Code reviews must *specifically* scrutinize `where:` blocks for any hardcoded sensitive data.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets in Spock Data Providers (High Severity):** Hardcoding secrets in `where:` blocks creates a major risk if the test code is compromised or accidentally committed.
        *   **Accidental Leakage of PII in Tests (Medium Severity):** Using real PII in data providers can lead to privacy violations.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Secrets:** Eliminates the risk of hardcoded secrets within Spock's data-driven tests. (Risk reduction: High)
        *   **Leakage of PII:** Reduces the risk of using real PII by promoting the use of data generators. (Risk reduction: Medium)

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Some tests use environment variables.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No strict policy against hardcoding secrets in `where:` blocks.
        *   No consistent use of environment variables or secrets management within `where:` blocks.
        *   No use of data generation libraries within `where:` blocks.
        *   Code reviews don't always catch hardcoded data in `where:` blocks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Interaction Verification (`interaction {}`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_interaction_verification___interaction_{}__.md)

*   **3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure Interaction Verification (`interaction {}`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Minimize Sensitive Data in Interactions:**  Refactor code or tests, if possible, to avoid passing sensitive data directly to mocked methods that are verified using `interaction {}`.
        2.  **Strategic Argument Matchers:**  Within `interaction {}` blocks, use argument matchers judiciously:
            *   Prefer type-safe matchers (e.g., `String`, `Integer`) over `_` (any argument) when dealing with potentially sensitive data.
            *   Create *custom* argument matchers that verify only the necessary aspects of the data (e.g., length, format) without exposing the actual value.
        3.  **Custom Failure Messages (Spock-Specific):** If sensitive data *must* be part of an interaction, use Spock's features to customize failure messages:
            *   Use `thrown()` with a custom message that redacts or obfuscates the sensitive data.
            *   Create custom assertion methods that provide more controlled failure messages.
        4.  **Code Review of `interaction {}`:** Code reviews should specifically check `interaction {}` blocks for potential exposure of sensitive data in failure messages.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Spock Test Failures (Low Severity):** Failed tests using `interaction {}` might include sensitive arguments in the failure message, potentially exposing them.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data in test failure messages by promoting careful argument matcher use and custom failure messages within Spock. (Risk reduction: Low)

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `interaction {}` blocks are used for verifying mock interactions.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No specific guidelines for secure use of `interaction {}` with sensitive data.
        *   No use of custom argument matchers to protect sensitive data.
        *   No use of custom failure messages to redact sensitive information.
        *   Code reviews don't consistently focus on this specific Spock feature.
