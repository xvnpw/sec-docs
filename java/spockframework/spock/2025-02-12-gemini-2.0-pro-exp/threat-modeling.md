# Threat Model Analysis for spockframework/spock

## Threat: [Test Data Corruption (Due to `@Shared` Misconfiguration)](./threats/test_data_corruption__due_to__@shared__misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Test Data Corruption (Due to `@Shared` Misconfiguration)

    *   **Description:**  If Spock's `@Shared` annotation is used incorrectly, particularly with mutable objects or resources that are not properly managed across test features or specifications, one test *can* directly modify the shared state in a way that affects subsequent tests. This is a *direct* consequence of how Spock manages shared resources. An attacker could potentially introduce a malicious test (e.g., through a compromised dependency) that leverages this misconfiguration to corrupt shared data, leading to unpredictable test results or even affecting a shared test database if proper isolation isn't in place.
    *   **Impact:**  Test results become unreliable. Data used by other tests could be corrupted or lost. If a shared database is used *without* proper transaction management, this could even impact a development or staging environment (though ideally, tests should *never* run against production).
    *   **Spock Component Affected:**  `@Shared` annotation. This is a direct threat because the vulnerability lies in the *mechanism* Spock provides for sharing data between tests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Understand `@Shared` Semantics:**  Thoroughly understand how `@Shared` works, especially regarding object mutability and lifecycle.
        *   **Prefer Immutable `@Shared` Objects:**  Use immutable objects for `@Shared` fields whenever possible to prevent unintended modifications.
        *   **Careful Resource Management:**  If `@Shared` is used with mutable resources (e.g., database connections), ensure proper initialization and cleanup in `setupSpec()` and `cleanupSpec()`, respectively.  *Always* use transactions and rollbacks for database interactions.
        *   **Avoid `@Shared` When Possible:**  Consider alternatives to `@Shared` if data isolation is paramount.  Use test fixtures or setup methods to create fresh data for each test feature if possible.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Pay close attention to the use of `@Shared` during code reviews, ensuring it's used correctly and safely.

## Threat: [Sensitive Information Disclosure via Spock Reporting](./threats/sensitive_information_disclosure_via_spock_reporting.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Information Disclosure via Spock Reporting

    *   **Description:** Spock's reporting features, especially custom report generators or extensions, *could* be configured (or misconfigured) to include sensitive data in generated reports. If a custom report generator inadvertently accesses and includes environment variables, system properties, or data from test fixtures that contain secrets (API keys, database credentials), and these reports are stored insecurely or shared inappropriately, this leads to direct information disclosure. This is a direct threat because it involves Spock's *own reporting mechanism*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to test or even production systems (if credentials are reused).
    *   **Spock Component Affected:** Spock's reporting extensions (e.g., `spock-reports`, custom report generators built using Spock's extension API). The core issue is within Spock's reporting functionality or extensions built upon it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Report Configurations:** Carefully review the configuration of any Spock reporting extensions, ensuring they are *not* configured to include sensitive data.
        *   **Sanitize Report Data:** If creating custom report generators, explicitly *exclude* any sensitive data from being included in the reports. Sanitize any data that *must* be included.
        *   **Secure Report Storage:** Store generated test reports in a secure location with restricted access.
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Test Fixtures:** Do not store sensitive data directly in test fixtures or data providers. Use environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms.
        *   **Use Official/Vetted Extensions:** Prefer using well-maintained and vetted Spock reporting extensions from trusted sources.
