# Threat Model Analysis for spockframework/spock

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker, potentially a compromised developer account or an insider threat, injects malicious Groovy code directly into a Spock specification. This code is then executed by Spock's test runner. The attacker could leverage Spock's ability to execute arbitrary Groovy code to perform actions within the test environment, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying files, or attempting to communicate with external systems.

**Impact:** Data breach from the test environment, corruption of test data or infrastructure, potential for lateral movement if the test environment is not properly isolated.

**Affected Component:** Core Spock Framework (specifically the test execution engine responsible for interpreting and running Groovy code within specifications).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict code review processes for all test specifications, with a focus on identifying potentially harmful code.
*   Enforce strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for the development environment and code repositories.
*   Utilize static analysis tools on test code to detect suspicious patterns or potentially dangerous code constructs.
*   Consider sandboxing or isolating the test execution environment to limit the impact of malicious code execution.
*   Regularly audit changes to test code and the development environment.
