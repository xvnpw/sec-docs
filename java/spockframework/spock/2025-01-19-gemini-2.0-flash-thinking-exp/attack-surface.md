# Attack Surface Analysis for spockframework/spock

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution within Spock Specifications](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_within_spock_specifications.md)

* **Description:** Malicious actors with control over the test codebase can inject arbitrary Groovy code within Spock specifications.
    * **How Spock Contributes:** Spock specifications are written in Groovy, a dynamic language that allows for the execution of arbitrary code. The framework itself doesn't inherently restrict the type of Groovy code that can be included.
    * **Example:** A developer with malicious intent adds a Spock specification that executes a system command to delete files or exfiltrate data when the tests are run.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the test environment, potential access to sensitive data, disruption of CI/CD pipelines, and potentially impacting the application itself if the test environment has access.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rigorous code reviews specifically focusing on Spock specifications to identify and prevent the introduction of malicious or vulnerable code.
        * Restrict access to the test codebase and the ability to modify Spock specifications to trusted developers.
        * Employ static analysis tools that can detect potentially dangerous code patterns within Groovy specifications.
        * Consider using a more restricted subset of Groovy if full flexibility is not required for testing.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information through Test Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_through_test_data.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently included within test data used in Spock specifications.
    * **How Spock Contributes:** Spock's data tables and `where:` blocks make it easy to define and use various data inputs for testing. If developers are not careful, they might include real or sensitive data directly in these definitions.
    * **Example:** A Spock specification includes a data table with real user credentials or API keys to test authentication or authorization flows. This data is then committed to the version control system.
    * **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive credentials or personal data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using real or sensitive data in Spock specifications.
        * Utilize anonymized or synthetic data for testing purposes.
        * If using sensitive data is unavoidable, store it securely (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management) and access it programmatically within the Spock specification, avoiding direct inclusion in the code.
        * Regularly scan the test codebase for potentially exposed secrets.
