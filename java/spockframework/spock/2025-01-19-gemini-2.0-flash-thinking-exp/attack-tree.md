## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Test Code **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_test_code__critical_node_.md)

Objective: Inject and execute malicious code within the Spock test suite.
- Attack Vectors:
  - Inject Malicious Logic in Specifications:
    - Leverage Groovy's Dynamic Nature: Exploiting Groovy's flexible syntax and meta-programming capabilities to embed and execute arbitrary code directly within Spock specifications. This allows attackers to perform actions like reading/writing files, executing system commands, or making network requests during test execution.
      - Execute Arbitrary Code during Test Execution: The successful injection and execution of malicious code within the test environment.
  - Exploit Spock Extensions:
    - Introduce Malicious Extension: Developing and introducing a custom Spock extension containing malicious code that gets executed during the test lifecycle. This requires convincing developers to include the malicious extension in the project.
      - Execute Arbitrary Code during Test Lifecycle: The malicious code within the extension executes during the various phases of the test lifecycle (e.g., before/after specifications, features, or blocks).

Critical Nodes within High-Risk Path 1:

- Compromise Application via Spock: The ultimate goal of the attacker.
- Exploit Malicious Test Code: The stage where the attacker focuses on injecting malicious code into the test suite.
- Inject Malicious Logic in Specifications: The specific tactic of embedding malicious code within Spock specifications.
- Leverage Groovy's Dynamic Nature: The specific Groovy feature exploited for code injection.
- Execute Arbitrary Code during Test Execution: The point where the malicious code is successfully run.
- Exploit Spock Extensions: The stage where the attacker focuses on using Spock extensions for malicious purposes.
- Execute Arbitrary Code during Test Lifecycle: The point where malicious code within an extension is successfully run.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Leakage via Test Reports/Logs](./attack_tree_paths/information_leakage_via_test_reportslogs.md)

Objective: Extract sensitive information from test reports or logs generated during test execution.
- Attack Vectors:
  - Extract Sensitive Data from Test Reports:
    - Tests Accidentally Log Sensitive Information: Developers inadvertently include sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords, internal data) in log messages or test reports generated by Spock or the application under test during the testing process. This information can then be accessed by an attacker who gains access to these logs or reports.

Critical Nodes within High-Risk Path 2:

- Compromise Application via Spock: The ultimate goal of the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Test Execution Environment **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_test_execution_environment__critical_node_.md)

Critical Nodes Outside High-Risk Paths:

- Exploit Test Execution Environment:
  - Influence Test Environment Setup:
    - Introduce Malicious Setup/Cleanup Logic: Injecting malicious code into the scripts or configurations responsible for setting up or cleaning up the test environment. This code can then be executed with the privileges of the test environment, potentially compromising it or even affecting connected systems.
