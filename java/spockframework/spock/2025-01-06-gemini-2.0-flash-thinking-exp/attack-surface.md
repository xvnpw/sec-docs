# Attack Surface Analysis for spockframework/spock

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_execution.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Test Code Execution**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can introduce malicious code within Spock tests that executes during the test phase.
    *   **How Spock Contributes:** Spock's core functionality involves executing arbitrary Groovy code defined within specification blocks. This provides a direct mechanism for running potentially harmful code.
    *   **Example:** A compromised developer account is used to add a test that reads sensitive environment variables (like database credentials) and exfiltrates them to an external server.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, compromise of backend systems, denial of service by manipulating resources, or even code injection into the application if the test environment has write access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mandatory code review for all test code, just as for production code.
        *   Enforce strong access controls and multi-factor authentication for developer accounts.
        *   Run tests in isolated environments with restricted network access and limited permissions.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools on test code to identify potential security vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.
        *   Monitor test execution logs for unusual activity.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Spock Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_spock_extensions.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Malicious Spock Extensions**
    *   **Description:** Spock allows for custom extensions that can modify its behavior. Malicious or poorly written extensions can introduce vulnerabilities into the test execution process.
    *   **How Spock Contributes:** Spock's extension mechanism allows arbitrary code to be executed during the test lifecycle, potentially bypassing security measures or introducing new attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** A malicious Spock extension is created that intercepts test results and sends them to an external server, potentially leaking information about the application's vulnerabilities or internal workings.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, manipulation of test results to hide failures, or even code execution within the test environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium (*Note: While previously marked as Medium, the potential for code execution elevates this to High in some contexts. We'll keep it as Medium based on the prior classification but acknowledge the potential for higher impact.*)

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Spock Data Tables](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_spock_data_tables.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Data Injection via Spock Data Tables**
    *   **Description:** Spock's data tables allow for parameterized tests. If the data used in these tables comes from untrusted sources or is not properly sanitized, it can be used to inject malicious data into the tested application.
    *   **How Spock Contributes:** Spock facilitates the easy use of external data sources (like CSV files or databases) for test data, which can become a vector for injecting malicious payloads if not handled securely.
    *   **Example:** A Spock test uses a data table loaded from a CSV file. An attacker modifies this CSV file to include SQL injection payloads. When the test runs, this malicious data is passed to the application, potentially leading to a database breach.
    *   **Impact:** SQL injection, command injection, or other forms of injection attacks depending on how the test data is used by the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat test data with the same level of security as production data.
        *   Sanitize and validate all data used in Spock data tables, especially if it originates from external or untrusted sources.
        *   Avoid using production data directly in tests; use anonymized or synthetic data instead.
