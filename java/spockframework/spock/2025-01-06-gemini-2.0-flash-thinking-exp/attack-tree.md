## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Spock [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_spock__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal and represents the culmination of all potential attacks. Its criticality stems from the severe impact of a successful compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Test Logic [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_test_logic__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* This path is high risk because vulnerabilities within test logic are relatively common and can directly lead to application compromise.
    * It is a critical node because it's a primary gateway for multiple attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Test Data [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_test_data__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* High-Risk Path: Directly injecting malicious code has a high likelihood of success if input validation is lacking and a severe impact.
        * Critical Node: Successful injection can lead to immediate and significant damage, including arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Spock's Mocking/Stubbing Capabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_spock's_mockingstubbing_capabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

* High-Risk Path: Improper mocking can easily bypass security checks, leading to vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create overly permissive mocks that bypass security checks [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/create_overly_permissive_mocks_that_bypass_security_checks__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* High-Risk Path:  A common mistake with significant security implications.
            * Critical Node: Directly circumvents security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce vulnerabilities through custom mock implementations [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_vulnerabilities_through_custom_mock_implementations__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* High-Risk Path: Treating mocks as production code is not always followed, leading to exploitable flaws.
            * Critical Node:  Custom code within mocks can introduce severe vulnerabilities like injection flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Sensitive Information via Test Output/Reports [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leak_sensitive_information_via_test_outputreports__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* High-Risk Path:  Accidental logging of sensitive data is a frequent occurrence with high impact.
        * Critical Node: Exposure of credentials or other sensitive data can have immediate and severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Spock's Integration with Build Tools and CI/CD [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_spock's_integration_with_build_tools_and_cicd__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* High-Risk Path: CI/CD pipelines are increasingly targeted, and their compromise can have widespread impact.
    * Critical Node: Represents a significant point of control over the application's build and deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Test Execution Environment [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_test_execution_environment__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* High-Risk Path: Gaining control over the test environment allows for manipulation of the application under test.
        * Critical Node: Enables direct interaction and potential compromise of the application during testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Data via Test Reports in CI/CD [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_data_via_test_reports_in_cicd__high_risk_path_.md)

* High-Risk Path:  Exploiting CI/CD reporting mechanisms can allow for stealthy data exfiltration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Spock Framework Itself (Less Likely, but Possible)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_spock_framework_itself__less_likely__but_possible_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via Spock Plugins or Extensions (If Used) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via_spock_plugins_or_extensions__if_used___high_risk_path_.md)

* High-Risk Path:  While less likely than flaws in test code, vulnerabilities in plugins can have a high impact.
