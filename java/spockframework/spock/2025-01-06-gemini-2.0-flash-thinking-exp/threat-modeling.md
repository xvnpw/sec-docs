# Threat Model Analysis for spockframework/spock

## Threat: [Code Injection in Tests](./threats/code_injection_in_tests.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate test data sources (e.g., external files, configuration) to insert malicious Groovy code. When Spock executes the test, this injected code runs due to Spock's Groovy DSL execution. This could involve modifying data table values or exploiting vulnerabilities in custom data providers used by Spock.

**Impact:** Compromise of the testing environment, potential access to sensitive data used in tests, or even manipulation of the application under test if the environment is not isolated.

**Affected Component:** Spock's Groovy DSL execution within the Specification class, specifically features like data tables (`where:` blocks), data pipes (`>>>`), and dynamically constructed code within test methods.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Sanitize and validate all external data sources used in tests.
*   Avoid constructing Groovy code dynamically from untrusted sources within Spock specifications.
*   Implement strict input validation within Spock test setup and data providers.
*   Run tests in isolated environments with limited privileges.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Test Data](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_test_data.md)

**Description:** If test data involves serialized objects, an attacker could provide maliciously crafted serialized data that, when deserialized by Spock or within a Spock extension, leads to arbitrary code execution. This is particularly relevant if Spock extensions handle deserialization of external data.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the testing environment, potentially leading to data breaches or further attacks.

**Affected Component:**  Any part of Spock or its extensions that deserialize data, especially when handling external data sources within Spock specifications or extensions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources within Spock tests or extensions.
*   If deserialization is necessary within Spock components, use secure deserialization techniques and libraries.
*   Implement integrity checks on serialized data handled by Spock.
*   Keep dependencies related to serialization used by Spock extensions updated.

## Threat: [Over-Reliance on Mocks Masking Real Vulnerabilities](./threats/over-reliance_on_mocks_masking_real_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Developers might create mocks and stubs using Spock's mocking features that do not accurately reflect the behavior of real dependencies, including security mechanisms. This is a risk inherent in how Spock allows for interaction and stubbing. This could lead to tests passing even when the actual application has vulnerabilities related to those dependencies.

**Impact:**  Critical vulnerabilities might be missed during testing, leading to exploitable weaknesses in the production application.

**Affected Component:** The mocking and stubbing features of Spock (`given:`, `when:`, `then:` blocks with interactions and stubbing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Ensure mocks and stubs created with Spock accurately reflect the behavior of real dependencies, especially security-related ones.
*   Use integration tests alongside Spock unit tests to verify interactions with real dependencies.
*   Regularly review and update mocks created with Spock to reflect changes in dependencies.
*   Consider using contract testing in conjunction with Spock to ensure compatibility with dependencies.

## Threat: [Bypassing Security Checks in Tests via Mocking](./threats/bypassing_security_checks_in_tests_via_mocking.md)

**Description:** Developers might intentionally mock out security checks (e.g., authentication, authorization) using Spock's mocking capabilities to simplify testing. While convenient, this direct use of Spock's features can lead to a lack of testing for these critical security features, potentially hiding vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Critical security vulnerabilities related to authentication and authorization might not be detected during testing.

**Affected Component:** The mocking and stubbing features of Spock.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid mocking out core security mechanisms entirely when using Spock.
*   Focus on testing the security logic itself with appropriate test cases within Spock specifications.
*   Use different test profiles or configurations to enable/disable security checks for specific Spock test scenarios.
*   Implement dedicated security testing phases alongside Spock unit tests.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Spock Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_spock_extensions.md)

**Description:**  Custom or third-party Spock extensions might contain security vulnerabilities. If an application uses such an extension, these vulnerabilities could be directly exploited during Spock test execution.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the testing environment, potential access to sensitive data, or even manipulation of the application under test.

**Affected Component:** Spock's extension mechanism and the specific vulnerable extension.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability within the extension)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Carefully vet and review all Spock extensions before using them.
*   Keep Spock extensions up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Spock extensions.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Test Results](./threats/manipulation_of_test_results.md)

**Description:** In a compromised development environment, an attacker could potentially modify Spock test code or configurations to alter test results, hiding failures or injecting false positives. This directly involves altering the Spock specifications or the way Spock executes tests. This could lead to the deployment of vulnerable code.

**Impact:**  Deployment of vulnerable applications due to a false sense of security from manipulated test results.

**Affected Component:**  The entire Spock testing process, including Spock specification code, Spock configurations, and the environment where Spock tests are executed.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strong access controls and security measures for the development environment.
*   Use version control for Spock test code and configurations.
*   Implement code review processes for Spock test code.
*   Secure the CI/CD pipeline and build artifacts used for running Spock tests.
