## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Test Logic and Coverage (Spock Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_test_logic_and_coverage__spock_specific_.md)

**Critical Node: Insufficient Test Coverage**
*   **Attack Vector:** Missed Vulnerabilities in Application Code
    *   **Description:** Lack of comprehensive tests, especially in security-sensitive areas, allows vulnerabilities in the application code to remain undetected during development and testing.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High (depending on the missed vulnerability)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Implement comprehensive test suites covering all critical functionalities and edge cases.
        *   Utilize code coverage tools to identify gaps in testing and prioritize testing for uncovered areas.
        *   Focus on testing security-relevant functionalities like authentication, authorization, input validation, and data handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Information Leakage via Spock Tests (Spock Specific Context)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_information_leakage_via_spock_tests__spock_specific_context_.md)

**Critical Node: Sensitive Data Exposure in Test Reports**
*   **Attack Vector:** Accidental Logging of Secrets in Tests
    *   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently log or print sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database credentials) during test execution, which could be exposed in test reports, console output, or logs.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium - High (exposure of secrets, credentials)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Review test code and logging configurations to prevent accidental logging of sensitive information.
        *   Implement secure logging practices that redact or mask sensitive data.
        *   Sanitize test output and reports to remove any sensitive internal information.

**Critical Node: Sensitive Data Hardcoded in Test Code**
*   **Attack Vector:** Credentials, API Keys, etc. in Test Files
    *   **Description:** Developers might mistakenly hardcode sensitive data (credentials, API keys) directly into test files for convenience, leading to secrets being exposed in version control or test environments.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (direct exposure of credentials, API keys)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Never hardcode sensitive data in test files.
        *   Utilize environment variables, secure configuration management, or dedicated test secrets management solutions to manage secrets used in tests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Spock Framework Dependencies (Indirectly Spock Related)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_spock_framework_dependencies__indirectly_spock_related_.md)

**Critical Node: Vulnerable Groovy Version**
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Known Groovy Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Using an outdated and vulnerable version of Groovy, a core dependency of Spock, can expose the application to known Groovy vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Groovy vulnerabilities can be severe)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Regularly update Groovy version used by Spock to the latest stable and secure release.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Groovy to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.

**Critical Node: Vulnerable Transitive Dependencies**
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Spock or its Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies (libraries used by Spock or its direct dependencies) can indirectly affect the application. These are often overlooked during dependency management.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium - High (depending on the vulnerable dependency)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies of Spock and its core components.
        *   Regularly update all dependencies, including transitive ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration of Spock Test Environment (Context Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_of_spock_test_environment__context_specific_.md)

**Critical Node: Insecure Test Database Configuration**
*   **Attack Vector:** Weak Credentials for Test Database
    *   **Description:** Using weak or default credentials for the test database makes it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium - High (data breach, access to test data, potentially pivot to production)
    *   **Actionable Insights:**
        *   Use strong, unique credentials for test databases.
        *   Rotate credentials regularly.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Test Database Accessible from Unintended Networks
        *   **Description:** Allowing the test database to be accessible from unintended networks increases the attack surface and risk of unauthorized access.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium - High (data breach, access to test data, potentially pivot to production)
        *   **Actionable Insights:**
            *   Secure test database access and restrict it to authorized networks and development environments.
            *   Implement network segmentation and firewall rules to limit access.
