# Attack Surface Analysis for spockframework/spock

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  The risk of attackers injecting malicious code disguised as or within legitimate Spock test specifications, leveraging the framework's execution context.
*   **How Spock Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Spock is the execution engine for tests. By design, it executes Groovy code within specifications. If an attacker can inject malicious Spock specifications, they can leverage Spock's capabilities to execute arbitrary code within the test environment.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's Git branch and modifies a Spock specification. They insert code within a `setup:` or `when:` block that, when executed by Spock during the test run, connects to an external server and uploads sensitive data from the test database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure (e.g., extraction of test data, credentials, API keys used in tests).
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) in test environments by injecting resource-intensive Spock specifications.
    *   Tampering with Test Results (manipulating test outcomes to hide vulnerabilities or introduce false positives/negatives, undermining the purpose of testing with Spock).
    *   Indirect Backdoor Installation (subtly altering application state during Spock test execution to create vulnerabilities).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control for Test Code:** Implement robust access control to source code repositories containing Spock specifications. Limit write access to authorized and trusted developers only.
    *   **Mandatory Code Review for Spock Specifications:** Enforce mandatory code reviews for all changes to Spock specifications, focusing on identifying any unusual or suspicious code patterns that could be malicious. Treat test code reviews with the same rigor as production code reviews.
    *   **Secure Development Workstations:** Secure developer workstations to prevent compromise and unauthorized code injection. Use endpoint security solutions and enforce strong password policies.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:** Harden the CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized modifications to the test execution process and ensure the integrity of the test environment where Spock specifications are run.
    *   **Input Sanitization in Test Helpers (if applicable):** If Spock specifications use helper functions or utilities that process external input, ensure these helpers sanitize inputs to prevent potential injection vulnerabilities within the test context itself.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Spock Framework Dependencies (Indirectly via Spock Execution)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_spock_framework_dependencies__indirectly_via_spock_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in libraries that Spock directly depends on, primarily Groovy, which can be exploited during Spock test execution.
*   **How Spock Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Spock relies on Groovy to parse and execute its specifications. Vulnerabilities in Groovy become exploitable within the context of Spock test execution.  Even though the vulnerability is in Groovy, it is Spock's use of Groovy that introduces this attack surface into the testing process.
*   **Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability exists in a specific version of Groovy. A development team uses a vulnerable version of Spock, which transitively includes the vulnerable Groovy version. An attacker crafts a malicious payload that, when processed by Spock during test execution (e.g., through a crafted mock response or test data), triggers the Groovy vulnerability, leading to remote code execution on the test server running Spock tests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) on test servers or development machines executing Spock tests, achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in Spock's dependencies (like Groovy) during test execution.
    *   Information Disclosure if dependency vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access to data within the test environment during Spock test execution.
    *   Compromise of the test environment infrastructure due to successful exploitation of dependency vulnerabilities via Spock.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the nature and exploitability of the dependency vulnerability, especially RCE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Aggressive Spock and Dependency Updates:**  Proactively update Spock and, critically, its dependencies (especially Groovy) to the latest versions. Monitor Spock release notes and security advisories for dependency updates and security patches.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning for Spock Projects:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools specifically configured to scan projects using Spock. These tools should identify known vulnerabilities in Spock's dependencies (including transitive ones like Groovy). Integrate these scans into the CI/CD pipeline to fail builds on detection of high-severity vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring for Groovy and Spock Ecosystem:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and vulnerability databases related to Groovy and the Spock ecosystem to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities and plan timely updates.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) for Spock Projects:** Utilize SCA tools to gain comprehensive visibility into all dependencies of Spock projects, including transitive dependencies, and their associated security risks. This allows for better management and mitigation of dependency-related vulnerabilities in Spock-based testing environments.
