# Threat Model Analysis for spockframework/spock

## Threat: [Hardcoded Secrets in Test Code](./threats/hardcoded_secrets_in_test_code.md)

**Description:** Developers might unintentionally hardcode sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens) directly within Spock specification files (Groovy code). If these specification files are exposed (e.g., through a public repository), an attacker could extract these secrets. The attacker could then use these secrets to gain unauthorized access to protected resources or systems that these secrets are intended to secure.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach leading to unauthorized access to systems and data. This can result in significant data breaches, financial loss, and severe reputational damage.

**Spock Component Affected:** Specification Files (Groovy code within specifications)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Mandatory use of environment variables or configuration files: Enforce the use of environment variables or dedicated configuration files for managing secrets in test environments, completely avoiding hardcoding in Spock specifications.
- Automated Secret Scanning in CI/CD: Integrate automated secret scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect and flag hardcoded secrets within Spock specification files before they are committed to version control.
- Security Focused Code Reviews for Specifications: Conduct mandatory security-focused code reviews specifically for Spock specification files, with a checklist item to explicitly verify the absence of hardcoded secrets.
- `.gitignore` and Pre-commit Hooks: Strictly use `.gitignore` to exclude any files intended to hold secrets from version control. Implement pre-commit hooks that automatically scan for potential secrets in staged Spock specification files and prevent commits if secrets are detected.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Spock Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_spock_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Spock relies on various dependencies (e.g., Groovy, JUnit). If vulnerabilities are discovered in these dependencies, and if these vulnerabilities are exploitable in the context of test execution or if the application also uses these vulnerable dependencies, an attacker could potentially exploit them. This could lead to serious consequences like remote code execution within the test environment or even the application if dependencies are shared and vulnerable in both contexts.

**Impact:** Critical system compromise through remote code execution. This could allow an attacker to gain full control over the test environment and potentially pivot to other systems. If the vulnerable dependencies are also in the application, it could directly compromise the application itself.

**Spock Component Affected:** Spock Dependencies (External libraries Spock relies on)

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability - some dependency vulnerabilities can be critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Proactive Dependency Monitoring and Alerting: Implement a system for proactively monitoring security advisories and vulnerability databases for Spock and all its dependencies. Set up alerts to be immediately notified of any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
- Automated Dependency Scanning and Updates in CI/CD: Integrate automated dependency scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to regularly scan Spock's dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Automate the process of updating Spock and its dependencies to the latest patched versions as soon as security updates are released.
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Tooling: Utilize dedicated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to gain comprehensive visibility into Spock's dependency tree and continuously monitor for vulnerabilities. SCA tools can also provide guidance on remediation and patching.
- Regular Spock and Dependency Version Audits: Conduct regular audits of Spock and its dependency versions to ensure they are up-to-date and patched against known vulnerabilities. Establish a policy for promptly addressing and remediating any identified vulnerabilities.
