### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving NewPipe Library

This list details high and critical threats that directly involve the NewPipe library.

**Threat 1: Metadata Tampering Leading to XSS**

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into video titles, descriptions, or other metadata fields on the target platform. When NewPipe fetches this data and the application renders it without proper sanitization, the script executes in the user's context within the application. The vulnerability lies in NewPipe's fetching and passing of unsanitized data.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application, potentially stealing user credentials, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Affected NewPipe Component:** Extractor modules (e.g., `YoutubeExtractor`, `PeerTubeExtractor`), specifically the functions retrieving metadata.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict output encoding/escaping in the application:** The application *must* properly encode or escape all data received from NewPipe before rendering it in the UI to prevent the execution of malicious scripts. This is the primary defense.
    *   **Regularly update NewPipe:** Ensure the application uses the latest version of NewPipe, which may contain fixes for potential parsing vulnerabilities within NewPipe itself that could facilitate this attack.

**Threat 2: Malicious Media Stream Delivery**

*   **Description:** An attacker uploads a seemingly legitimate video or audio file that contains embedded malicious code or exploits vulnerabilities in media players. When NewPipe downloads this stream, and the application attempts to play it, the malicious code could be executed. The threat originates from the content fetched and delivered by NewPipe.
*   **Impact:**  This could lead to remote code execution on the user's device, system compromise, or data theft.
*   **Affected NewPipe Component:** Downloader module, specifically the functions responsible for downloading media streams.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize secure and updated media playback libraries in the application:** Ensure the application uses well-maintained and patched media playback libraries. This is the primary defense against media player exploits.
    *   **Implement sandboxing for media playback in the application:** Isolate the media playback process to limit the impact of potential exploits triggered by malicious media downloaded by NewPipe.
    *   **Warn users about potential risks:** Inform users about the inherent risks of playing media from untrusted sources accessed through NewPipe.

**Threat 3: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in NewPipe Dependencies**

*   **Description:** NewPipe relies on various third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, and NewPipe doesn't update them, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities through NewPipe.
*   **Impact:**  This could lead to various issues, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
*   **Affected NewPipe Component:**  The dependency management system within NewPipe's build process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update NewPipe:** This is crucial to ensure that NewPipe's dependencies are also updated to their latest secure versions.
    *   **Monitor NewPipe's release notes and security advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities addressed in NewPipe updates, which often include dependency updates.
