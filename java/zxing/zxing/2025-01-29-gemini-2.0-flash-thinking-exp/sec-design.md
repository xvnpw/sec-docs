# BUSINESS POSTURE

The zxing (Zebra Crossing) project is a mature, open-source, multi-format barcode image processing library. It is primarily used for scanning and generating barcodes and QR codes in various applications.

- Business priorities and goals:
 - Provide a reliable, high-performance, and accurate barcode scanning and generation library.
 - Support a wide range of 1D and 2D barcode formats.
 - Maintain cross-platform compatibility and broad language support.
 - Foster a strong open-source community and encourage contributions.
 - Ensure the library is easy to integrate and use for developers.

- Most important business risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to data breaches or application compromise in systems that use zxing for barcode processing.
 - Performance issues or bugs could disrupt critical business processes that rely on barcode scanning, such as inventory management, point-of-sale systems, or access control.
 - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to stagnation and eventual obsolescence of the library, forcing users to migrate to alternative solutions.
 - Compatibility issues with new platforms or barcode standards could limit the library's applicability and user base.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
 - security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub for community review. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
 - security control: Project uses standard build tools and dependency management (Maven, Gradle). (Implemented: Build scripts in repository)
 - security control: Regular updates and bug fixes are released by maintainers. (Observed: GitHub commit history and release notes)

- Accepted risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
 - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities due to the complexity of image processing and barcode formats.
 - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities are publicly known once disclosed.

- Recommended security controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Integrate Dependency Scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by zxing.
 - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
 - security control: Consider adding fuzz testing to proactively discover input validation vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Implement code signing for release artifacts to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.

- Security requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable as zxing is a library and does not handle user authentication directly. Applications using zxing are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
 - Authorization: Not applicable as zxing is a library and does not handle authorization directly. Applications using zxing are responsible for their own authorization mechanisms.
 - Input validation:
  - security requirement: Robust input validation is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities arising from processing maliciously crafted barcode images.
  - security requirement: The library must handle various image formats and barcode types safely, preventing buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other input-related issues.
  - security requirement: Input validation should be applied to image dimensions, file formats, and barcode data itself.
 - Cryptography:
  - security requirement: zxing should correctly implement any cryptographic algorithms required for certain barcode formats that involve encryption or digital signatures.
  - security requirement: Ensure proper handling of cryptographic keys and avoid hardcoding or insecure storage of keys if cryptography is used.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- What are critical business processes we are trying to protect?
 - For zxing itself, the critical process is maintaining the integrity, availability, and reliability of the library for its users.
 - For applications using zxing, critical business processes depend on the application's purpose. Examples include:
  - Point-of-sale systems relying on barcode scanning for transactions.
  - Inventory management systems using barcodes for tracking goods.
  - Access control systems using QR codes for authentication.
  - Mobile applications using barcode scanning for various functionalities.

- What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?
 - Data processed by zxing is primarily barcode image data and the decoded data extracted from barcodes.
 - Sensitivity of data depends entirely on the content encoded in the barcodes. Barcodes can contain:
  - Product identifiers (low sensitivity).
  - URLs (low to medium sensitivity).
  - Personal information (medium to high sensitivity, e.g., contact details, access tokens, medical information in some contexts).
  - Payment information (high sensitivity, though less common in barcodes).
 - The zxing library itself does not store or manage this data persistently. Data sensitivity is primarily a concern for applications that use zxing and how they handle the decoded barcode data.
