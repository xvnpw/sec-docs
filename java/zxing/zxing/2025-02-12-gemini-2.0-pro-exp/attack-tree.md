## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Memory Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_memory_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The attacker aims to crash the application or make it unresponsive by causing it to run out of memory. This is achieved by exploiting ZXing's memory usage when processing large or complex barcode images.

*   **Attack Vectors:**

    *   **Resource-Intensive Decoding (Large Image, High Error Correction) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The attacker submits a barcode image (e.g., a QR code) that is deliberately designed to consume a large amount of memory during processing.
        *   This can be achieved by:
            *   Using a very large image size (high resolution in pixels).
            *   Specifying a high level of error correction (if the application allows control over this). Higher error correction levels require more memory for storing and processing redundant data.
        *   ZXing needs to load the entire image into memory, and complex decoding algorithms can require significant buffer allocations.

    *   **Repeated Requests with Large Images/High Error Correction [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The attacker sends multiple requests, each containing a resource-intensive barcode image.
        *   This amplifies the memory consumption, quickly exhausting available memory and leading to an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) error.
        *   The application may crash, become unresponsive, or be unable to process legitimate requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via CPU Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_cpu_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

*    **Overall Description:** The attacker aims to make the application unresponsive by consuming all available CPU resources. This is achieved by exploiting ZXing's computational intensity when processing complex or damaged barcode images.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Complex QR Code (Many Modules, Error Correction):**
        *   The attacker submits a QR code that is deliberately complex.
        *   This can involve:
            *   A very high density of modules (the black and white squares).
            *   A high level of error correction.
        *   ZXing's decoding process, especially error correction, can be computationally expensive.

    *   **Repeated Requests with Complex Codes [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The attacker sends multiple requests, each containing a complex QR code.
        *   This overwhelms the CPU, causing the application to become slow or unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Leakage via Crafted QR Code [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/information_leakage_via_crafted_qr_code__critical_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** The attacker crafts a QR code that, when decoded, reveals sensitive information due to the application's insecure handling of the decoded output. This is *not* a vulnerability in ZXing itself, but rather in how the application uses ZXing's output.

*   **Attack Vector:**

    *   **Crafted QR Code Containing Sensitive Information (e.g., internal URLs, API keys - if misconfigured/embedded in image) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   The attacker creates a QR code that encodes sensitive data. This data might be:
            *   Internal URLs or API endpoints that should not be publicly accessible.
            *   API keys or other credentials (if, for example, the application mistakenly embeds them in images or allows them to be part of user-supplied data that gets encoded into a QR code).
            *   Other sensitive information that the application might process and then inadvertently display.
        *   The attacker relies on the application *not* sanitizing or validating the decoded data before displaying it or using it in further operations. ZXing simply decodes the data; it doesn't perform any security checks. The vulnerability lies in the application's lack of output validation.
