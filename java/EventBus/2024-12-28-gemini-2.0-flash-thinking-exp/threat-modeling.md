## High and Critical EventBus Threats

Here's a list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve the `greenrobot/EventBus` library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Event Publication
    *   **Description:** An attacker, having gained control of a component within the application, could directly leverage the `EventBus.getDefault().post(event)` method to publish crafted, malicious events. These events can bypass normal application logic and directly trigger unintended actions or state changes in other subscribed components. The attacker exploits the central role of EventBus in facilitating inter-component communication.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access or modification of data within subscribing components, execution of arbitrary code within subscribing components if event handlers are vulnerable, denial of service if malicious events cause crashes or resource exhaustion in subscribers.
    *   **Affected EventBus Component:** `EventBus.getDefault().post(event)` method.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict authorization checks *before* publishing events. Ensure only authorized components can publish specific event types through EventBus.
        *   Employ robust input validation and sanitization within event handlers in subscribing components to prevent malicious data from causing harm.
        *   Consider using signed events or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) at the EventBus level (though not directly supported by the library, this would require custom implementation around the `post` method) to verify the origin and integrity of events before they are delivered.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Unintended Subscription
    *   **Description:** An attacker, through a vulnerability in a component, could exploit the EventBus subscription mechanism (`@Subscribe` annotations or `EventBus.getDefault().register(subscriber)`) to subscribe to event types they are not intended to receive. This allows the attacker to intercept and access sensitive information being broadcasted through the EventBus, directly leveraging its publish/subscribe functionality for unauthorized data access.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of confidential data being transmitted via EventBus, exposure of internal application state communicated through events, which could be used to further compromise the system.
    *   **Affected EventBus Component:** `@Subscribe` annotation processing, `EventBus.getDefault().register(subscriber)` method, event delivery mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained control over event subscriptions. Ensure components can only subscribe to the event types they legitimately need. This might involve custom logic around the registration process.
        *   Avoid broadcasting highly sensitive information directly within events. Consider using indirect references or encrypting sensitive data within event payloads before publishing.
        *   Regularly review and audit event subscriptions to identify and remove any unauthorized or unnecessary subscriptions.
