## Deep Analysis: Manipulate Jenkins Build Process

This analysis delves into the "Manipulate Jenkins Build Process" attack path within a Jenkins environment, focusing on the potential impact, attack vectors, and necessary mitigation strategies. This path represents a critical threat as it targets the core of the software development lifecycle, potentially compromising the integrity and security of the final application.

**Overall Threat Level: Critical**

Successfully manipulating the Jenkins build process can have devastating consequences, allowing attackers to inject malicious code, exfiltrate sensitive information, and ultimately compromise the deployed application and potentially the entire infrastructure.

**Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

**4. Manipulate Jenkins Build Process:**

This high-level goal represents the attacker's intention to interfere with the automated processes that transform source code into deployable artifacts. Success here signifies a significant breach in the security of the software supply chain.

**4.1 Inject Malicious Code into Build Artifacts:**

This sub-goal focuses on embedding malicious code directly into the output of the build process. This is a particularly insidious attack as the malicious code becomes an integral part of the application, potentially bypassing traditional perimeter security measures.

*   **4.1.1 Modify Build Scripts:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers gain access to the Jenkins configuration, job definitions, or pipeline scripts (e.g., Groovy scripts in Jenkinsfiles). They then modify these scripts to include malicious commands or logic. This could involve adding steps to download and execute malware, introduce backdoors, or alter the application's functionality.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Compromised Jenkins Credentials:** Weak or stolen credentials of users with administrative or job configuration privileges.
        *   **Exploiting Jenkins Vulnerabilities:**  Unpatched vulnerabilities in Jenkins itself or its plugins could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and modify configurations.
        *   **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access to Jenkins.
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromise of tools or libraries used in the build process that allows for the injection of malicious code during their integration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Direct Application Compromise:** Malicious code becomes part of the deployed application, allowing attackers to control its behavior, steal data, or use it as a foothold for further attacks.
        *   **Supply Chain Contamination:** If the compromised application is distributed to other users or systems, the malware can spread further.
        *   **Reputational Damage:** Discovery of injected malicious code can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a build script to download and execute a reverse shell after the application is built.

*   **4.1.2 Replace Dependencies with Malicious Versions:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers intercept the dependency resolution process (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm) and replace legitimate libraries or packages with compromised versions. These malicious dependencies contain malware or backdoors that are incorporated into the final application.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Compromised Package Repositories:**  Attackers gain control of public or private package repositories and upload malicious versions of popular libraries.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting network traffic during dependency downloads and injecting malicious packages.
        *   **DNS Spoofing:** Redirecting dependency resolution requests to attacker-controlled servers hosting malicious packages.
        *   **Internal Repository Compromise:**  If the organization uses an internal artifact repository, attackers could compromise it to host malicious dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Hidden Malware:** Malicious code is introduced through trusted channels, making detection more difficult.
        *   **Widespread Impact:**  If a commonly used dependency is compromised, multiple applications within the organization could be affected.
        *   **Long-Term Persistence:** The malicious code can remain undetected for extended periods, allowing attackers to maintain access and control.
    *   **Example:** An attacker replaces a legitimate logging library with a malicious version that exfiltrates sensitive data to an external server.

*   **4.1.3 Compromise Application Deployment:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers target the deployment phase of the build process. This could involve modifying deployment scripts, manipulating deployment tools, or compromising the target environment where the application is deployed.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Compromised Deployment Credentials:**  Stealing credentials used to access deployment environments (e.g., cloud platforms, servers).
        *   **Exploiting Deployment Tool Vulnerabilities:**  Targeting vulnerabilities in tools like Ansible, Kubernetes, or Docker.
        *   **Modifying Deployment Configurations:** Altering configurations to deploy malicious code alongside the legitimate application.
        *   **Compromising Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** If deployment is automated through IaC, attackers could modify the infrastructure definition to introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Direct Access to Production Environment:**  Attackers gain control over the live application and its underlying infrastructure.
        *   **Data Breaches:**  Access to sensitive data stored in the production environment.
        *   **Service Disruption:**  Ability to disrupt the application's functionality or take it offline.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a Kubernetes deployment manifest to include a malicious container that runs alongside the application, granting them a persistent backdoor.

**4.2 Access Sensitive Build Artifacts and Logs:**

This sub-goal focuses on gaining unauthorized access to the outputs of the build process and the records of its execution. This information can be valuable for reconnaissance and further attacks.

*   **4.2.1 Exploit Insufficient Access Controls:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers exploit weak or misconfigured access controls on Jenkins itself, the file system where artifacts and logs are stored, or the systems hosting these resources.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Default Credentials:** Failure to change default passwords for Jenkins or related services.
        *   **Weak Password Policies:** Allowing users to set easily guessable passwords.
        *   **Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granting excessive permissions to users who don't need them.
        *   **Publicly Accessible Artifact Repositories:**  Misconfigured storage buckets or repositories that allow anonymous access.
        *   **Insecure File Permissions:**  Permissions on the Jenkins server or build agents that allow unauthorized access to sensitive files.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  Attackers can access API keys, credentials, and other secrets embedded in artifacts or logs.
        *   **Reconnaissance:**  Understanding the application's architecture, dependencies, and deployment process.
        *   **Planning Further Attacks:**  Using the gathered information to identify vulnerabilities and plan more sophisticated attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials to log into a Jenkins instance and browse build logs containing database connection strings.

*   **4.2.2 Access Sensitive Information (API Keys, Credentials):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Build artifacts and logs often inadvertently contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, access tokens, and other secrets. This can happen due to poor coding practices, lack of secret management, or insufficient sanitization of build outputs.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Hardcoded Secrets:** Developers directly embedding secrets in code or configuration files that are then included in build artifacts.
        *   **Leaked Secrets in Logs:**  Sensitive information being logged during the build process, either intentionally or unintentionally.
        *   **Unencrypted Artifact Storage:** Storing build artifacts and logs without proper encryption.
        *   **Lack of Secret Scanning:**  Not implementing automated tools to scan build outputs for potential secrets.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Direct Application Compromise:** Stolen credentials can be used to directly access and control the application or its associated services.
        *   **Data Breaches:**  Access to databases and other data stores using compromised credentials.
        *   **Lateral Movement:**  Using stolen credentials to gain access to other systems within the organization's network.
    *   **Example:** An attacker finds an API key for a cloud service within a build log and uses it to access sensitive data stored in that service.

*   **4.2.3 Use Information to Compromise Application:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers leverage the sensitive information obtained from build artifacts and logs to directly attack the application or its associated services.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Using Stolen API Keys:**  Accessing protected APIs and performing unauthorized actions.
        *   **Exploiting Database Credentials:**  Accessing and manipulating data in the application's database.
        *   **Impersonating Legitimate Users:**  Using stolen access tokens to gain unauthorized access to the application.
        *   **Bypassing Authentication:**  Using leaked credentials to bypass authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Full Application Control:**  Gaining complete control over the application's functionality and data.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Stealing sensitive data from the application and its backend systems.
        *   **Financial Loss:**  Unauthorized transactions or access to financial data.
        *   **Reputational Damage:**  Public disclosure of the compromise and data breach.
