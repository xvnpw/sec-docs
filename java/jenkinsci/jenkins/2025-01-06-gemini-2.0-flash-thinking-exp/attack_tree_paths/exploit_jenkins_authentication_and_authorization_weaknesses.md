**Detailed Breakdown of Each Node:**

**3. Exploit Jenkins Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses:**

This is the root of the attack path, highlighting the fundamental vulnerability: weaknesses in how Jenkins verifies user identity and manages access permissions. This is a critical area as it forms the gatekeeper to the entire system.

**Sub-Paths:**

* **Brute-Force User Credentials:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers use automated tools to try numerous username and password combinations against the Jenkins login page. This relies on weak or commonly used passwords.
    * **Impact:** Successful brute-forcing grants access to a legitimate user account.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the complexity of user passwords and the presence of account lockout mechanisms. Publicly facing Jenkins instances are more vulnerable.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce complex password requirements (length, character types).
        * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Significantly reduces the effectiveness of brute-force attacks.
        * **Account Lockout Policies:** Temporarily disable accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a specific timeframe.
        * **CAPTCHA:** Implement CAPTCHA on the login page to prevent automated attacks.
        * **Regular Security Audits:** Review user accounts and their associated permissions.

* **Gain Access to Jenkins Account:**
    * **Mechanism:** This is the successful outcome of the brute-force attack.
    * **Impact:** The attacker now possesses the credentials to log in as the compromised user.
    * **Likelihood:** Directly dependent on the success of the brute-force attempt.

* **Perform Actions with User's Permissions:**
    * **Mechanism:** Once logged in, the attacker can perform any action the compromised user is authorized for. This is where the principle of least privilege becomes crucial.
    * **Impact:** The severity depends on the permissions of the compromised user. Even seemingly low-privileged accounts can be used for reconnaissance or to exploit other vulnerabilities.
    * **Likelihood:** High if the compromised user has more permissions than necessary.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
        * **Regular Permission Reviews:** Periodically review and adjust user permissions.
        * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement a robust RBAC system to manage permissions effectively.
        * **Audit Logging:** Monitor user activity to detect suspicious behavior.

* **Exploit Default Credentials:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers attempt to log in using common default usernames and passwords (e.g., admin/admin, user/password) that may not have been changed after installation.
    * **Impact:** Grants immediate administrative access if successful.
    * **Likelihood:** High for newly installed or poorly maintained Jenkins instances.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Mandatory Password Changes:** Force users to change default credentials during the initial setup.

    * **Impact:**  Often grants significant control over the Jenkins instance.
    * **Likelihood:** High if default credentials are not changed.

* **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Jenkins' core authentication or authentication plugins to bypass the login process entirely. This could involve exploiting code flaws, path traversal vulnerabilities, or other security weaknesses.
    * **Impact:** Complete circumvention of the authentication system, granting unauthorized access without needing valid credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the presence of exploitable vulnerabilities in the Jenkins core or its plugins. Requires technical expertise to discover and exploit.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Keep Jenkins Core Updated:** Regularly update Jenkins to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use security scanners to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Jenkins instance.
        * **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** Can help detect and block common web application attacks.
        * **Security Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom plugins or modifications.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Authentication Plugins:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within third-party authentication plugins (e.g., LDAP, SAML, OAuth) to bypass authentication.
    * **Impact:** Similar to bypassing core authentication, but focuses on weaknesses in specific plugins.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the security posture of the installed authentication plugins.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update all installed Jenkins plugins.
        * **Choose Reputable Plugins:** Select plugins from trusted sources with a good security track record.

* **Exploit Weak Session Management:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Jenkins manages user sessions. This could involve session hijacking (stealing session cookies), session fixation (forcing a user to use a known session ID), or other session-related vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** Allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users without knowing their credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the security of session management practices.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Secure Session Cookies:** Use the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags for session cookies.
        * **Session Timeout:** Implement reasonable session timeouts.
        * **Regenerate Session IDs:** Regenerate session IDs upon login and privilege escalation.
        * **Prevent Session Fixation:** Properly handle session creation and validation.
        * **Transport Layer Security (TLS/HTTPS):** Encrypt all communication to prevent session cookie interception.

* **Privilege Escalation:**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers with limited access find ways to elevate their privileges within Jenkins. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in RBAC, misconfigurations, or using legitimate features in unintended ways.
    * **Impact:** Allows attackers to gain access to more sensitive resources and perform more impactful actions.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * **Mechanism:** Attackers exploit flaws in the RBAC implementation to gain roles and permissions they are not intended to have. This could involve bypassing permission checks, manipulating role assignments, or exploiting logic errors in the RBAC system.
    * **Impact:** Grants unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data.
    * **Likelihood:** Depends on the complexity and security of the RBAC configuration and implementation.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Thorough RBAC Configuration:** Carefully design and implement the RBAC system.
