## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jenkins Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jenkins_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**1. Exploit Jenkins Plugin Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Identify Vulnerable Plugin:** Attackers scan Jenkins instances for publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in installed plugins using vulnerability databases and automated tools. They might also attempt to discover zero-day vulnerabilities through reverse engineering or fuzzing.
*   **Exploit Identified Vulnerability:** Once a vulnerable plugin is identified, attackers leverage existing exploits (publicly available or custom-developed) to target the specific vulnerability.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin:** Exploiting certain plugin vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server with the same privileges as the Jenkins process. This often involves sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable plugin's endpoints.
*   **Execute Arbitrary Commands on Jenkins Server:** With RCE achieved, attackers can execute any command the Jenkins user has permissions for, allowing them to install backdoors, access sensitive files, or pivot to other systems.
*   **Gain Access to Application Server/Resources:** From the compromised Jenkins server, attackers can access application servers, databases, and other resources if the Jenkins server has network connectivity and necessary credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Jenkins Scripting Capabilities](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_jenkins_scripting_capabilities.md)

**2. Abuse Jenkins Scripting Capabilities:**

*   **Inject Malicious Script into Build Process:**
    *   **Compromise Source Code Repository:** Attackers gain access to the application's source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) through stolen credentials or vulnerabilities and inject malicious code into build scripts or configuration files.
    *   **Compromise Build Configuration:** Attackers with sufficient Jenkins privileges (or by exploiting authentication weaknesses) modify the build job configurations to include malicious scripts that are executed during the build process.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Build Artifact Download:** Attackers intercept the download of build artifacts (dependencies, libraries) and replace them with malicious versions containing backdoors or malware.
*   **Execute Arbitrary Scripts Directly on Jenkins:**
    *   **Exploit Insufficient Access Controls:** Attackers exploit weak authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain access to Jenkins features like the Script Console without proper credentials.
    *   **Gain Access to Script Console without Authorization:**  Attackers directly access the Script Console, often through default credentials, weak passwords, or unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization:** Attackers bypass authentication checks or exploit authorization flaws to access privileged features like the Script Console.
    *   **Exploit Script Security Sandbox Bypass:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the Groovy sandbox restrictions in Jenkins to execute privileged operations that are normally prevented.
    *   **Execute Privileged Operations:** By bypassing the sandbox, attackers can execute commands with the Jenkins server's privileges, leading to system compromise.
    *   **Gain Access to Application Server/Resources:** Similar to RCE via plugins, successful script execution can allow attackers to access connected application resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jenkins Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jenkins_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses.md)

**3. Exploit Jenkins Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses:**

*   **Brute-Force User Credentials:** Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by trying numerous username and password combinations.
*   **Gain Access to Jenkins Account:** Successful brute-forcing grants access to a Jenkins account with the associated permissions.
*   **Perform Actions with User's Permissions:** Attackers can perform any actions the compromised user is authorized for, which could include viewing sensitive information, modifying jobs, or triggering builds.
*   **Exploit Default Credentials:** Attackers attempt to log in using default usernames and passwords that may not have been changed after installation.
*   **Perform Actions with Default User Permissions:** Similar to compromised user accounts, attackers can perform actions allowed by the default user.
*   **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in Jenkins' core authentication or authentication plugins to bypass the login process entirely.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Authentication Plugins:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party authentication plugins can allow attackers to bypass authentication.
*   **Exploit Weak Session Management:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how Jenkins manages user sessions to hijack active sessions or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers with limited access find ways to elevate their privileges within Jenkins.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Attackers exploit flaws in the RBAC implementation to gain roles and permissions they are not intended to have.
*   **Exploit Misconfigurations in Permissions:** Attackers take advantage of incorrectly configured permissions that grant excessive access to certain users or groups.
*   **Gain Elevated Privileges:** Successful privilege escalation grants the attacker more powerful permissions within Jenkins.
*   **Perform Actions with Administrative Permissions:** With administrative privileges, attackers have full control over Jenkins.
*   **Install Malicious Plugins:** Attackers can install malicious plugins to gain persistent access, execute arbitrary code, or steal sensitive information.
*   **Access Sensitive Credentials:** Administrative access allows attackers to view and exfiltrate stored credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Jenkins Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_jenkins_build_process.md)

**4. Manipulate Jenkins Build Process:**

*   **Inject Malicious Code into Build Artifacts:**
    *   **Modify Build Scripts:** Attackers with access to build scripts insert malicious code that will be included in the final application artifacts.
    *   **Replace Dependencies with Malicious Versions:** Attackers replace legitimate software dependencies with compromised versions that contain malware or backdoors.
    *   **Compromise Application Deployment:** By injecting malicious code, attackers compromise the deployed application, potentially gaining control over it or its data.
*   **Access Sensitive Build Artifacts and Logs:**
    *   **Exploit Insufficient Access Controls:** Attackers exploit weak access controls to view build artifacts and logs that may contain sensitive information.
    *   **Access Sensitive Information (API Keys, Credentials):** Build artifacts and logs can inadvertently contain API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive data.
    *   **Use Information to Compromise Application:**  Stolen credentials and API keys can be used to directly attack the application or its associated services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jenkins Configuration Management Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jenkins_configuration_management_weaknesses.md)

**5. Exploit Jenkins Configuration Management Weaknesses:**

*   **Access Sensitive Credentials Stored in Jenkins:**
    *   **Exploit Weak Encryption of Credentials:** Attackers exploit weak or broken encryption algorithms used to store credentials within Jenkins.
    *   **Exploit Insufficient Access Controls to Credentials:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the credential storage mechanism due to misconfigured permissions.
    *   **Gain Access to Application Databases/Services:** Stolen database or service credentials can be used to directly access and compromise those systems.
*   **Modify Jenkins Configuration:**
    *   **Inject Malicious URLs/Scripts:** Attackers modify Jenkins configurations to inject malicious URLs or scripts that can be executed by Jenkins or its users.
    *   **Disable Security Features:** Attackers disable security features within Jenkins to make it more vulnerable to other attacks.
    *   **Grant Unauthorized Access:** Attackers modify configurations to grant themselves or other malicious actors unauthorized access to Jenkins.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Jenkins API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_jenkins_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**6. Exploit Jenkins API Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to API Endpoints:**
    *   **Exploit Missing Authentication/Authorization:** Attackers access API endpoints that lack proper authentication or authorization checks.
    *   **Retrieve Sensitive Information:**  Attackers use the API to retrieve sensitive data about Jenkins jobs, builds, or configurations.
    *   **Trigger Malicious Actions:** Attackers use the API to trigger builds, modify jobs, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **API Parameter Tampering:**
    *   **Modify API Requests to Achieve Malicious Goals:** Attackers manipulate API request parameters to bypass security checks or achieve unintended actions.
