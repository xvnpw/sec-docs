# Attack Surface Analysis for jenkinsci/jenkins

## Attack Surface: [Jenkins Web Interface Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jenkins_web_interface_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Jenkins web UI to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious actions.
    *   **How Jenkins Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jenkins provides a web interface for managing builds, configurations, and users, which can be targeted with typical web application attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a stored XSS vulnerability in a job description to inject malicious JavaScript that steals the session cookies of administrators.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized job execution, data exfiltration, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Jenkins core and plugins up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce strong Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
        *   Implement and enforce robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., using a security realm and role-based access control).
        *   Regularly review user permissions and remove unnecessary access.
        *   Harden the Jenkins Java web server (e.g., disable unnecessary HTTP methods).

## Attack Surface: [Jenkins API Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/jenkins_api_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the Jenkins REST API or CLI to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **How Jenkins Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jenkins offers a powerful API for automation and integration, which can be abused if not properly secured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker leverages an unauthenticated API endpoint to trigger a build job with malicious parameters, leading to command execution on a build agent.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, data manipulation, information disclosure, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
        *   Use API tokens with appropriate permissions and rotate them regularly.
        *   Sanitize and validate all input received through the API to prevent command injection.
        *   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.
        *   Disable or restrict access to unnecessary API endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Malicious Jenkins Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_malicious_jenkins_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within installed Jenkins plugins or the installation of malicious plugins.
    *   **How Jenkins Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jenkins' extensibility through plugins significantly expands its functionality but also introduces a large and varied attack surface dependent on third-party code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a popular plugin to gain remote code execution on the Jenkins master. Alternatively, a malicious plugin is installed that steals credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Jenkins master or agents, data theft, credential compromise, system instability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install necessary plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Keep all installed plugins up to date.
        *   Regularly review installed plugins and remove any that are unused or have known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using a plugin vulnerability scanner.
        *   Implement a process for vetting new plugins before installation.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Jenkins Agents (Nodes)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_jenkins_agents__nodes_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gaining control of build agents connected to the Jenkins master.
    *   **How Jenkins Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jenkins relies on agents to execute build jobs, and if these agents are compromised, the attacker can influence builds and access sensitive data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability on a build agent to gain root access, allowing them to inject malicious code into build processes or steal secrets from the agent's environment.
    *   **Impact:** Supply chain attacks (injecting malicious code into software builds), data exfiltration, denial of service, lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden build agents with up-to-date operating systems and security patches.
        *   Secure communication between the Jenkins master and agents (e.g., using JNLP over TLS or SSH).
        *   Implement proper agent isolation and resource limits.
        *   Regularly audit the security of build agent infrastructure.
        *   Consider using ephemeral agents that are spun up and destroyed for each build.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Credentials Management within Jenkins](./attack_surfaces/insecure_credentials_management_within_jenkins.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure or compromise of credentials stored within Jenkins.
    *   **How Jenkins Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Jenkins stores credentials for accessing various systems (e.g., source code repositories, deployment targets), and insecure storage or access can lead to compromise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Jenkins master's configuration files and retrieves plaintext credentials stored there.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external systems, data breaches, deployment of malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Jenkins' built-in credential management system with appropriate security settings.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in job configurations or Jenkinsfiles.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for credential access.
        *   Regularly audit credential usage and permissions.
        *   Consider using secrets management solutions integrated with Jenkins.

## Attack Surface: [Pipeline as Code Vulnerabilities (Jenkinsfile)](./attack_surfaces/pipeline_as_code_vulnerabilities__jenkinsfile_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious code or insecure handling of secrets within Jenkins Pipeline definitions.
    *   **How Jenkins Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The "Pipeline as Code" feature allows defining build processes in code, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not written securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious Groovy code into a pipeline definition that executes arbitrary commands during a build.
    *   **Impact:** Secret leakage, remote code execution on the Jenkins master or agents, supply chain compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat Jenkinsfiles as code and apply secure coding practices.
        *   Avoid hardcoding secrets in Jenkinsfiles; use Jenkins' credential management or external secrets management solutions.
        *   Implement code review processes for Jenkinsfile changes.
        *   Enforce sandboxing or secure execution environments for pipeline scripts.
