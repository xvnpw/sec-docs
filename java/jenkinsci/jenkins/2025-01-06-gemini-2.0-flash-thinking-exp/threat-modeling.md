# Threat Model Analysis for jenkinsci/jenkins

## Threat: [Default Administrator Credentials](./threats/default_administrator_credentials.md)

* **Description:** An attacker attempts to log into the Jenkins instance using well-known default administrator credentials (e.g., username 'admin' and password 'admin'). If successful, they gain full administrative access to Jenkins.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins instance, allowing the attacker to configure jobs, access secrets managed by Jenkins, install malicious plugins within Jenkins, and potentially compromise systems integrated with Jenkins.
* **Affected Component:** Jenkins Core Authentication Module
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Immediately change the default administrator password upon installation.
    * Enforce strong password policies for all Jenkins user accounts.
    * Consider disabling the default administrator account after creating a new administrative user in Jenkins.

## Threat: [Exploiting Unpatched Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_unpatched_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Attackers identify and exploit known security vulnerabilities in outdated or unpatched Jenkins plugins. This can lead to remote code execution on the Jenkins master or agents managed by Jenkins, unauthorized access to Jenkins data, or privilege escalation within Jenkins.
* **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can include remote code execution on Jenkins infrastructure, information disclosure from Jenkins, denial of service of Jenkins, and privilege escalation within the Jenkins environment. This can lead to the compromise of Jenkins and potentially the entire build and deployment pipeline managed by Jenkins.
* **Affected Component:** Jenkins Plugin Management, Specific Vulnerable Plugins
* **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update all installed Jenkins plugins to the latest versions.
    * Implement a process for monitoring plugin security advisories and promptly patching vulnerabilities within Jenkins.
    * Consider using a plugin vulnerability scanner for Jenkins.
    * Remove or disable unused plugins within Jenkins to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Code Injection in Pipeline Scripts](./threats/code_injection_in_pipeline_scripts.md)

* **Description:** Attackers with control over Jenkins pipeline configurations (e.g., through compromised Jenkins accounts or access to the pipeline definition repository) inject malicious code into pipeline scripts that are executed by Jenkins. This code is then executed on the Jenkins agent during the build process orchestrated by Jenkins.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution on the build agent managed by Jenkins, allowing the attacker to steal secrets managed by Jenkins, modify build artifacts processed by Jenkins, or pivot to other systems accessible by the Jenkins agent.
* **Affected Component:** Jenkins Pipeline Execution Engine, Scripting Interpreters (e.g., Groovy) within Jenkins
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict access controls within Jenkins for who can modify pipeline definitions.
    * Review pipeline scripts carefully for potential injection vulnerabilities before execution by Jenkins.
    * Use parameterized builds within Jenkins and sanitize user inputs within pipeline scripts executed by Jenkins.
    * Utilize the Script Security Plugin within Jenkins to restrict the capabilities of pipeline scripts.
    * Store pipeline definitions as code in a version control system with proper access controls and review processes outside of Jenkins, but used by Jenkins.

## Threat: [Secret Exposure in Build Logs or Environment Variables Managed by Jenkins](./threats/secret_exposure_in_build_logs_or_environment_variables_managed_by_jenkins.md)

* **Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or database credentials managed within Jenkins are unintentionally logged during build processes orchestrated by Jenkins or exposed as environment variables accessible to the build environment managed by Jenkins. Attackers who gain access to Jenkins build logs or the build environment managed by Jenkins can retrieve these secrets.
* **Impact:** Compromise of external services or systems that rely on the exposed credentials managed by Jenkins. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, or financial loss stemming from compromised credentials managed within Jenkins.
* **Affected Component:** Jenkins Build Execution, Logging Mechanisms within Jenkins, Environment Variable Handling within Jenkins
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid printing sensitive information managed by Jenkins to build logs.
    * Use the Credentials Plugin within Jenkins to securely store and manage secrets.
    * Mask sensitive information in Jenkins build logs using the Mask Passwords Plugin.
    * Avoid exposing secrets as environment variables directly in the Jenkins configuration.
    * Implement secret scanning tools to detect accidental exposure of credentials managed by Jenkins.

## Threat: [Compromised Build Agents Managed by Jenkins](./threats/compromised_build_agents_managed_by_jenkins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers compromise build agents (machines where build jobs are executed by Jenkins). This allows them to inject malicious code into builds orchestrated by Jenkins, steal secrets present on the agent and potentially managed by Jenkins, or use the agent as a pivot point to attack other systems accessible by the Jenkins agent.
* **Impact:** Compromised builds orchestrated by Jenkins, potentially leading to the deployment of malicious code. Access to secrets stored on the agent and potentially managed by Jenkins. Lateral movement within the network from systems managed by Jenkins.
* **Affected Component:** Jenkins Agent, Agent Communication Protocols (e.g., JNLP, SSH) used by Jenkins
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Harden build agents by applying security best practices (e.g., patching, strong passwords, disabling unnecessary services) in the environment managed by Jenkins.
    * Isolate build agents from sensitive networks where possible within the Jenkins infrastructure.
    * Secure communication between the Jenkins master and agents (e.g., using JNLP over TLS or SSH).
    * Regularly audit and monitor build agents for suspicious activity within the Jenkins environment.
    * Consider using ephemeral build agents that are provisioned and destroyed for each build orchestrated by Jenkins.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Agent Communication Managed by Jenkins](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_agent_communication_managed_by_jenkins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers intercept communication between the Jenkins master and build agents, particularly if using insecure protocols like plain JNLP. This allows them to inject malicious commands into the build process managed by Jenkins or steal sensitive information exchanged during communication managed by Jenkins.
* **Impact:** Remote command execution on the build agent managed by Jenkins, potentially leading to the same impacts as a compromised build agent. Exposure of sensitive information exchanged between the Jenkins master and agent.
* **Affected Component:** Jenkins Agent Communication Protocols (JNLP, SSH)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Enforce secure communication protocols between the Jenkins master and agents (e.g., JNLP over TLS, SSH).
    * Disable insecure communication protocols if not required within the Jenkins configuration.
    * Ensure proper certificate management for secure communication within the Jenkins environment.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation within Jenkins](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation_within_jenkins.md)

* **Description:** Attackers with administrative privileges on the Jenkins instance install malicious plugins designed to steal credentials managed by Jenkins, inject code into builds orchestrated by Jenkins, or perform other malicious activities within the Jenkins environment.
* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins instance and potentially the build and deployment pipeline managed by Jenkins.
* **Affected Component:** Jenkins Plugin Management
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Restrict plugin installation privileges within Jenkins to a limited number of trusted administrators.
    * Implement a process for reviewing and vetting plugins before installation within Jenkins.
    * Monitor installed plugins for suspicious activity or unexpected changes within Jenkins.
    * Consider using a plugin allowlist to restrict the installation of only approved plugins within Jenkins.
