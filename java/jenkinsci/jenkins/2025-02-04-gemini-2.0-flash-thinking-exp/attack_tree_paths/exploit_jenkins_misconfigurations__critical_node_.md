##### 4.2.1 Weak Authentication Mechanisms [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Attack Description:** Jenkins is configured with authentication mechanisms that are easily bypassed, brute-forced, or otherwise compromised. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to Jenkins by impersonating legitimate users.

**Technical Details:**

* **Default Jenkins User Database:** Relying solely on the default Jenkins internal user database, especially with weak or default passwords, makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
* **No Authentication Enabled:** In some cases, security might be disabled entirely, allowing anonymous access to Jenkins.
* **Weak Password Policies:** Lack of enforced password complexity, password rotation, or account lockout policies.
* **HTTP Basic Authentication without HTTPS:** Transmitting credentials in plaintext over HTTP Basic Authentication makes them susceptible to interception.

**Impact:**

* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to Jenkins with user privileges.
* **Credential Compromise:** User accounts can be compromised, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Initial access can be leveraged to escalate privileges within Jenkins.

**Likelihood:** High.  Using default settings or failing to implement strong authentication is a common oversight. Brute-force attacks are relatively easy to execute.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Enforce Strong Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Robust Security Realm:** Integrate with a strong security realm like LDAP, Active Directory, or SAML for centralized authentication and stronger password policies.
    * **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for an extra layer of security, requiring users to verify their identity through multiple factors (e.g., password + OTP).
    * **Disable HTTP Basic Authentication:** If possible, disable HTTP Basic Authentication and rely on more secure methods like form-based authentication over HTTPS.
    * **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password complexity requirements, password rotation, and account lockout policies.

**Detection Methods:**

* **Brute-force Attack Detection:** Monitor Jenkins logs for failed login attempts from the same IP address or user account within a short timeframe. Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
* **Account Lockout Monitoring:** Monitor for accounts being locked out due to repeated failed login attempts.
* **Credential Stuffing Detection:** Look for login attempts using known compromised credentials (if possible, integrate with threat intelligence feeds).
* **Security Audits:** Regularly audit authentication configurations and password policies.

---

##### 4.2.2 Overly Permissive Authorization Matrix [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Attack Description:** The Jenkins authorization matrix is misconfigured, granting users or roles more permissions than necessary. This allows users to perform actions beyond their intended scope, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or escalation of privileges.

**Technical Details:**

* **Excessive Global Permissions:** Granting overly broad global permissions like "Administer" to too many users or roles.
* **Permissive Project-Based Permissions:**  Granting excessive permissions on specific Jenkins projects, allowing users to modify build configurations, access sensitive build artifacts, or trigger unauthorized builds.
* **Misconfigured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** If RBAC is used, roles might be defined with overly broad permissions, or users might be assigned to roles inappropriately.

**Impact:**

* **Unauthorized Actions:** Users can perform actions they are not supposed to, such as modifying critical configurations, accessing sensitive data, or triggering unauthorized builds.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Users with limited initial permissions can potentially escalate their privileges by exploiting overly permissive authorization settings.
* **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive build artifacts, credentials, or configuration data.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:** Malicious actors with excessive permissions can modify build pipelines to inject malicious code.

**Likelihood:** Medium.  Misconfiguring authorization matrices is a common mistake, especially in complex Jenkins environments with numerous users and projects.  Administrators may err on the side of granting too many permissions for ease of use, without fully understanding the security implications.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Implement a Restrictive Authorization Matrix:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Apply the principle of least privilege rigorously. Grant users and roles only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job functions.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to manage permissions effectively. Define roles with specific sets of permissions and assign users to roles based on their responsibilities.
    * **Regular Review and Audit:** Regularly review and audit the authorization matrix to identify and rectify overly permissive settings.
    * **Project-Based Permissions:**  Carefully configure project-based permissions to restrict access to sensitive projects and resources.
    * **Granular Permissions:** Utilize Jenkins' granular permission system to define precise permissions for different actions and resources.

**Detection Methods:**

* **Authorization Matrix Auditing:** Regularly audit the Jenkins authorization matrix to identify users or roles with excessive permissions.
* **Permission Analysis Tools:** Utilize tools or scripts to analyze the authorization matrix and identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
* **User Activity Monitoring:** Monitor user activity logs for actions that are outside of their expected scope or that indicate potential privilege escalation attempts.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate Jenkins logs with a SIEM system to detect anomalous user behavior related to permissions.
