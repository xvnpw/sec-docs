## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Secure Agent-to-Master Communication](./mitigation_strategies/6__secure_agent-to-master_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS for Agent-to-Master Communication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Jenkins Master for HTTPS:** Ensure your Jenkins master is configured to use HTTPS. This typically involves setting up a web server (like Nginx or Apache) in front of Jenkins to handle HTTPS termination and proxy requests to Jenkins. Configure a valid SSL/TLS certificate for your Jenkins domain.
    2.  **Configure Agent Connection Protocol:** When configuring agents (e.g., via JNLP or SSH), ensure they are configured to connect to the Jenkins master using the HTTPS URL.
    3.  **Verify Agent Connection:** After configuring agents, verify that they are connecting to the master over HTTPS by checking the agent connection details in the Jenkins UI. The connection URL should start with `https://`.
    4.  **Disable HTTP Agent Listen Port (Optional but Recommended):** If you are only using HTTPS for agent communication, you can disable the HTTP agent listener port on the Jenkins master to further enhance security. This setting is usually found in the Jenkins master configuration (e.g., in the `jenkins.xml` file or via system properties).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from eavesdropping on or manipulating communication between Jenkins master and agents if communication occurs over unencrypted HTTP.
    *   **Credential Theft (High Severity):** Protects credentials exchanged during agent connection and job execution from being intercepted in transit.
    *   **Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Ensures the integrity of data transmitted between master and agents, preventing malicious modification during transit.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for Man-in-the-Middle Attacks and Credential Theft, **Moderate Risk Reduction** for Data Tampering. HTTPS provides encryption and authentication for communication.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if HTTPS is used for agent communication. Example: "Currently implemented with HTTPS configured for Jenkins master and agents connecting over HTTPS."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify if HTTP is still used for agent communication in any part of the project. Example: "No missing implementation identified, all agent communication is over HTTPS."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [7. Secure Jenkins API Access](./mitigation_strategies/7__secure_jenkins_api_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Security Measures for Jenkins API Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure that API access is protected by the same authentication and authorization mechanisms configured for the Jenkins UI (see strategies 1 & 2).
    2.  **Use API Tokens:** For programmatic access to the API, encourage the use of API tokens instead of user passwords. Users can generate API tokens from their Jenkins profile page. Tokens can be revoked if compromised.
    3.  **Restrict API Access by IP (Optional):** If possible, restrict API access to specific IP addresses or networks using firewall rules or reverse proxy configurations.
    4.  **Implement Rate Limiting (Optional):** Consider implementing rate limiting for API requests using a reverse proxy or a Jenkins plugin (if available) to mitigate denial-of-service attacks and brute-force attempts.
    5.  **Monitor API Usage:** Monitor API access logs for unusual patterns or suspicious activity.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or scripts from accessing the Jenkins API to retrieve sensitive information or trigger malicious actions.
    *   **API Abuse and DoS Attacks (Medium Severity):** Mitigates the risk of API abuse, including denial-of-service attacks through excessive API requests.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** Protects sensitive data accessible through the API from unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** **High Risk Reduction** for Unauthorized API Access, **Moderate Risk Reduction** for API Abuse and Data Breaches. Securing API access is crucial for overall Jenkins security.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if API security measures are in place. Example: "Currently implemented with authentication and authorization enforced for API access, API tokens are used for automation scripts."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify areas where API security needs improvement. Example: "Missing rate limiting for API access. Need to implement rate limiting to prevent potential DoS attacks."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [8. Enable CSRF Protection](./mitigation_strategies/8__enable_csrf_protection.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Ensure CSRF Protection is Enabled in Jenkins
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access Global Security Configuration:** Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure Global Security".
    2.  **Verify CSRF Protection:** Ensure the "Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits" checkbox is checked under the "Security" section. This is generally enabled by default.
    3.  **Customize CSRF Protection (Optional):**  Jenkins offers some advanced CSRF protection settings, but the default configuration is usually sufficient. Review the Jenkins documentation for details if customization is needed.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Attacks (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated Jenkins users.
*   **Impact:** **Moderate Risk Reduction** for CSRF Attacks. CSRF protection is a standard web security practice.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if CSRF protection is enabled. Example: "Currently implemented and enabled in Jenkins configuration."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify if CSRF protection is disabled or needs review. Example: "No missing implementation identified, CSRF protection is enabled."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [9. Configure Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/9__configure_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers in Jenkins
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install a CSP Plugin (Optional but Recommended):** While Jenkins has some built-in CSP functionality, using a dedicated CSP plugin (search for "Content-Security-Policy" in "Manage Plugins") can provide more control and flexibility.
    2.  **Configure CSP Headers:**  Configure the CSP headers in Jenkins. This can be done through the CSP plugin's configuration UI (if using a plugin) or by setting system properties or Java arguments for Jenkins.
    3.  **Define CSP Directives:** Define appropriate CSP directives to restrict the sources from which Jenkins can load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.). Start with a restrictive policy and gradually relax it as needed, testing thoroughly. Example directives include `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`, `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`. 
    4.  **Test CSP Implementation:** Thoroughly test Jenkins after implementing CSP to ensure that all functionality works as expected and that no legitimate resources are blocked. Monitor browser console for CSP violation reports and adjust the policy accordingly.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):** Mitigates the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by limiting the ability of attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts in the Jenkins UI.
*   **Impact:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction** for XSS Attacks. CSP is a powerful defense-in-depth mechanism against XSS.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if CSP is implemented and how. Example: "Currently implemented using a CSP plugin with a restrictive policy, primarily focusing on script and style sources."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify if CSP is not implemented or needs improvement. Example: "Missing CSP implementation. Need to research and implement a suitable CSP policy to enhance XSS protection."]
