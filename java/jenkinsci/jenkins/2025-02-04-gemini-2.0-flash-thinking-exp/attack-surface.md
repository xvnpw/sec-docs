# Attack Surface Analysis for jenkinsci/jenkins

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Jenkins plugins, while extending functionality, can contain critical security vulnerabilities like remote code execution (RCE), authentication bypasses, or significant information disclosure.
*   **Jenkins Contribution:** Jenkins' plugin architecture relies on third-party code, increasing the attack surface and potential for vulnerabilities within the Jenkins ecosystem.
*   **Example:** A plugin with an unauthenticated RCE vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server simply by sending a crafted request.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Jenkins server, data breaches, unauthorized access to connected systems, and complete disruption of CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Plugin Updates:** Implement a strict policy for regularly updating plugins to the latest versions, prioritizing security updates.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate automated plugin vulnerability scanning into your Jenkins management process.
    *   **Plugin Whitelisting:**  Restrict plugin installations to a pre-approved list of trusted and regularly vetted plugins.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:**  Reduce the number of installed plugins to the absolute minimum required functionality to decrease the attack surface.
    *   **Security Monitoring & Alerts:**  Actively monitor plugin security advisories and set up alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities in used plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Script Injection in Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/script_injection_in_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:** Jenkins Pipelines, using Groovy scripts, are vulnerable to script injection when user-controlled input or external data is not properly sanitized. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master or agents.
*   **Jenkins Contribution:** Jenkins' "Pipeline as Code" feature, while powerful, inherently involves dynamic script execution, creating a direct pathway for injection vulnerabilities if not secured.
*   **Example:** A pipeline takes a user-provided branch name and uses it unsanitized in a shell command. An attacker injects malicious shell commands within the branch name, leading to command execution on the Jenkins agent.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on Jenkins master or agents, allowing for complete system takeover, data exfiltration, and manipulation of the CI/CD process.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input sanitization and validation for all user-provided data and external data used in Pipeline scripts.
    *   **Secure Scripting Practices:**  Avoid dynamic script evaluation with user input. Use parameterized builds with caution and validate parameters thoroughly.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Pipelines:** Run pipeline scripts with the minimum necessary permissions, avoiding execution as root or with overly broad credentials.
    *   **Static Pipeline Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to automatically scan Jenkinsfile definitions for potential script injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review for Pipelines:** Mandate code reviews for all Jenkinsfile changes to identify and prevent injection vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Jenkins Remoting](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_jenkins_remoting.md)

*   **Description:**  The Jenkins remoting protocol (JNLP or SSH) used for communication between master and agents can be exploited if not properly secured. This includes unencrypted communication, deserialization vulnerabilities, and agent impersonation.
*   **Jenkins Contribution:** Jenkins' distributed architecture relies on remoting, and historically, default configurations might have been insecure (e.g., unencrypted JNLP). Vulnerabilities in the remoting protocol itself are direct Jenkins weaknesses.
*   **Example:** Unencrypted JNLP communication allows network attackers to intercept credentials or inject malicious commands. Deserialization vulnerabilities in older JNLP versions allow RCE by sending crafted serialized objects.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on master or agents, agent hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access to the Jenkins environment and connected systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce JNLP-over-HTTPS or SSH:**  Mandatory configuration to use JNLP-over-HTTPS or SSH for all agent communication to ensure encryption.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary JNLP Ports:** Disable the JNLP port if not actively used or restrict access via firewalls.
    *   **Regularly Update Jenkins Core and Agents:** Keep both Jenkins master and agents updated to patch remoting protocol vulnerabilities, including deserialization issues.
    *   **Agent-to-Master Security Hardening:** Configure agent-to-master security settings to limit agent capabilities and restrict outbound connections from agents.
    *   **Strong Agent Authentication:** Implement robust agent authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized agents from connecting.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Access Control](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_access_control.md)

*   **Description:**  Weak or misconfigured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Jenkins can grant excessive privileges to users, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive configurations, jobs, credentials, and functionalities.
*   **Jenkins Contribution:** Jenkins' flexible RBAC system, if not carefully planned and implemented, can easily result in overly permissive access, directly exposing Jenkins resources.
*   **Example:**  Granting "Administer" permissions to a large number of users, or allowing developers "Job/Configure" access when they only need "Job/Read," enabling them to modify critical build processes or inject malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of Jenkins configurations, jobs, and pipelines, access to sensitive credentials, escalation of privileges, and potential system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning roles and permissions in Jenkins.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control Planning:**  Carefully plan and define roles and permissions based on job functions and responsibilities.
    *   **Regular Access Control Audits:**  Conduct periodic audits of user permissions and role assignments to identify and rectify any over-permissioning.
    *   **Granular Permissions using Matrix-Based Security:** Utilize Jenkins' matrix-based security to fine-tune permissions at a granular level, controlling access to specific jobs and resources.
    *   **External Authentication and Authorization Integration:** Integrate Jenkins with external identity providers (LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth) for centralized user management and consistent access policies.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Jenkins instances left with default administrative credentials are critically vulnerable, allowing immediate and complete takeover by attackers.
*   **Jenkins Contribution:** Jenkins' initial setup, if not properly secured, can leave default credentials active, a direct and easily exploitable vulnerability in a new or misconfigured Jenkins instance.
*   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in using common default credentials like "admin/admin" and gains full administrative access to the Jenkins server.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins server, full administrative control, data breaches, and total disruption of CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Password Change on First Login:** Enforce immediate password change for the administrative user during the initial Jenkins setup.
    *   **Disable Default Accounts:** If possible, disable or remove default administrative accounts after creating secure replacements.
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Implement and enforce strong password policies for all Jenkins users, including administrators.
    *   **Regular Security Scanning for Default Credentials:**  Include checks for default credentials in regular security scans of the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Train administrators and users on the critical importance of changing default credentials and maintaining strong passwords.
