# BUSINESS POSTURE

Jenkins is an open-source automation server. It provides a platform to automate various tasks related to software development, delivery, and operations. Primarily used for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, Jenkins helps teams to automate build, test, and deployment processes, enabling faster and more reliable software releases.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Automate software build, test, and deployment processes to accelerate software delivery cycles.
- Improve software quality and reduce errors through automated testing and validation.
- Enhance developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks and streamlining workflows.
- Provide a central platform for managing and monitoring software delivery pipelines.
- Enable extensibility and customization through a plugin ecosystem to adapt to diverse development needs.

Business Risks:
- Disruption of software delivery pipelines due to Jenkins downtime or failures, leading to delays in releases and impacting business agility.
- Security vulnerabilities in Jenkins or its plugins could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or supply chain attacks, compromising sensitive information and impacting business reputation.
- Misconfiguration or improper management of Jenkins instances could result in deployment failures, security misconfigurations, or performance issues, affecting service availability and reliability.
- Lack of proper access controls and auditing could lead to unauthorized modifications of pipelines or access to sensitive build artifacts and credentials, posing security and compliance risks.
- Dependence on community-maintained plugins introduces risks related to plugin security, compatibility, and long-term maintenance, potentially impacting the stability and security of Jenkins deployments.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Authentication and Authorization: Jenkins provides built-in user management and role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user access and permissions. Implemented within Jenkins core and configurable through the web UI.
- security control: HTTPS Configuration: Jenkins supports HTTPS to encrypt communication between users and the Jenkins server. Configurable within Jenkins server settings and web server configurations.
- security control: CSRF Protection: Jenkins includes Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent unauthorized actions. Enabled by default in Jenkins core.
- security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Jenkins implements CSP headers to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Implemented within Jenkins core.
- security control: Plugin Security: Jenkins provides a plugin management system with features to assess plugin security risks and update plugins. Implemented within Jenkins plugin management UI and update center.
- security control: Credentials Management: Jenkins offers a secure credentials management system to store and manage sensitive information like passwords and API keys. Implemented within Jenkins core and accessible through the web UI.
- security control: Audit Logging: Jenkins provides audit logging capabilities to track user actions and system events. Configurable within Jenkins settings and through plugins.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community-developed plugins: Security and quality of plugins are dependent on community contributions and may vary.
- accepted risk: Complexity of configuration: Jenkins' extensive configuration options can lead to misconfigurations if not managed properly, potentially creating security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature: Publicly known vulnerabilities are potential targets until patched.

    - Requirement: Ability to define roles and permissions based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Requirement: Auditable authorization decisions and access logs.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs, including job configurations, parameters, and plugin settings, must be properly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, script injection, XSS).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied on both client-side and server-side.
    - Requirement: Use of parameterized builds and secure templating mechanisms to minimize injection risks.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data, such as credentials and secrets, must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: Secure communication channels (HTTPS) must be enforced for all web traffic.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer commits code changes to the Code Repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Code Repository sends a webhook notification to Jenkins Master upon code commit.
3. Jenkins Master receives the webhook and triggers a pre-configured Build Job.
4. Jenkins Master schedules the Build Job to be executed on an available Build Agent.
5. Build Agent checks out the latest code from the Code Repository.
6. Build Agent performs build steps as defined in the Jenkins job configuration, including:
    - Compilation of code.
    - Running unit tests and integration tests.
    - Performing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify code vulnerabilities.
    - Performing Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify web application vulnerabilities.
    - Scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
7. Build Agent generates Build Artifacts (e.g., compiled binaries, container images).
8. Build Agent publishes the Build Artifacts to the Artifact Repository (e.g., Nexus).
9. Artifact Repository stores the build artifacts, which are then available for subsequent deployment pipelines.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Software Release Cycle: Jenkins automates the entire software release cycle, from code commit to deployment. Disruption to Jenkins directly impacts the ability to release software updates and new features, affecting business agility and time-to-market.
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: Jenkins enables CI/CD practices, ensuring frequent and reliable software updates. Failure of Jenkins disrupts these processes, leading to integration issues, deployment delays, and potential service disruptions.
- Automated Testing and Quality Assurance: Jenkins automates testing processes, ensuring software quality and reducing errors. Jenkins downtime can halt automated testing, potentially leading to undetected bugs and lower quality releases.

Data Sensitivity:
- Jenkins Configuration Data: Includes job configurations, pipeline definitions, user settings, plugin configurations, and credentials. This data is considered highly sensitive as it can provide insights into development processes, access to systems, and potential vulnerabilities if exposed.
- Build Artifacts: Can include compiled code, application binaries, container images, and deployment packages. Sensitivity depends on the nature of the application being built, but often contains proprietary code and potentially sensitive data.
- Credentials and Secrets: Jenkins manages credentials for accessing code repositories, artifact repositories, deployment environments, and other systems. These credentials are highly sensitive and must be protected to prevent unauthorized access.
- Build Logs and History: May contain sensitive information, including code snippets, environment details, and potential error messages that could be exploited if exposed.
