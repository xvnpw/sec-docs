# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a leading open-source automation server.
*   Enable continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for software projects of any size.
*   Offer a simple way to set up a CI/CD environment.
*   Support a wide range of plugins to extend functionality.
*   Maintain a large and active community for support and development.
*   Ensure the platform is reliable, extensible, and easy to use.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Compromise of the Jenkins server, leading to unauthorized access to connected systems and source code.
*   Supply chain attacks through malicious plugins or dependencies.
*   Data breaches of sensitive information stored or processed by Jenkins (e.g., credentials, API keys).
*   Disruption of CI/CD pipelines, impacting software delivery schedules.
*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or incidents.
*   Loss of user trust due to perceived lack of security.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Jenkins supports various authentication mechanisms, including its own user database, LDAP, and delegated authentication to external providers (e.g., GitHub, Active Directory). Described in Jenkins documentation and various plugins.
*   security control: Authorization: Jenkins provides role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Described in Jenkins documentation and various plugins.
*   security control: Security Realms: Define how and where Jenkins verifies user credentials. Described in Jenkins documentation.
*   security control: Authorization Strategies: Define how Jenkins controls access to resources. Described in Jenkins documentation.
*   security control: CSRF Protection: Jenkins includes protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Described in Jenkins documentation.
*   security control: Plugin Management: Jenkins allows administrators to manage plugins, including installing, updating, and removing them. Described in Jenkins documentation.
*   security control: Credentials Management: Jenkins provides a mechanism to securely store and manage credentials. Described in Jenkins documentation.
*   security control: Audit Logging: Jenkins logs various events, which can be used for auditing and troubleshooting. Described in Jenkins documentation.
*   security control: Regular Security Advisories: The Jenkins project publishes security advisories to inform users about vulnerabilities and their fixes.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The vast plugin ecosystem introduces a significant attack surface, as plugins may have varying levels of security and maintenance.
*   accepted risk: Default configurations may not be secure, requiring administrators to properly configure security settings.
*   accepted risk: Users may not follow security best practices, such as using strong passwords or regularly updating Jenkins and plugins.
*   accepted risk: Running builds with elevated privileges can pose a risk if the build process is compromised.
*   accepted risk: Depending on external services (e.g., for authentication or artifact storage) introduces a dependency on the security of those services.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement mandatory code review and security testing for all core Jenkins code and officially endorsed plugins.
*   security control: Introduce a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Jenkins and its plugins to improve supply chain security.
*   security control: Implement a robust vulnerability management program with regular penetration testing and security audits.
*   security control: Provide more granular permission controls for managing credentials and accessing sensitive resources.
*   security control: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative users.
*   security control: Implement network segmentation to isolate Jenkins from other critical systems.
*   security control: Provide built-in support for secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
*   security control: Implement runtime application self-protection (RASP) capabilities to detect and prevent attacks at runtime.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Integration with existing enterprise identity providers (e.g., SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
    *   Strong password policies and enforcement.
    *   Session management with secure timeouts and invalidation.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and responsibilities.
    *   Principle of least privilege enforced throughout the system.
    *   Ability to restrict access to specific projects, jobs, and resources.
    *   Delegation of administrative privileges with appropriate controls.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs, including those from plugins, must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, command injection).
    *   Whitelist-based validation should be preferred over blacklist-based validation.
    *   Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3, AES-256).
    *   Secure storage of sensitive data, including credentials, API keys, and secrets.
    *   Proper key management practices, including key rotation and secure storage.
    *   Protection of data in transit and at rest.

    GitPush --> Webhook(("Webhook Trigger"))
    Webhook --> JenkinsMaster(("Jenkins Master"))
    JenkinsMaster --> JenkinsAgent(("Jenkins Agent"))

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits and pushes code changes to a Git repository.
2.  A webhook triggers a build in Jenkins.
3.  Jenkins Master schedules the build on an available Jenkins Agent.
4.  The Jenkins Agent checks out the source code from the Git repository.
5.  The code is compiled.
6.  Unit and integration tests are executed.
7.  A Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scan is performed to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
8.  If applicable, a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scan is performed on a deployed test environment.
9.  The build artifact is packaged.
10. The artifact is published to an artifact repository.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Git repository access controls: Limit access to the source code repository to authorized users.
*   security control: Webhook security: Verify the authenticity of webhook requests to prevent unauthorized build triggers.
*   security control: Jenkins Agent isolation: Run Jenkins Agents in isolated environments (e.g., containers) to prevent them from interfering with each other or the Master.
*   security control: SAST scanning: Use a SAST tool to identify vulnerabilities in the code during the build process.
*   security control: DAST scanning: Use a DAST tool to identify vulnerabilities in a deployed test environment.
*   security control: Dependency scanning: Scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Artifact signing: Digitally sign build artifacts to ensure their integrity.
*   security control: Secure build environment: Ensure the build environment is secure and free from malware.
*   security control: Least privilege: Run build steps with the minimum required privileges.
