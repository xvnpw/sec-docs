# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jenkinsci/jenkins

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Plugin Management](./mitigation_strategies/strict_plugin_management.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Inventory:** Within Jenkins, use the Plugin Manager to list all installed plugins.
2.  **Justification:** For each plugin, document (within Jenkins, perhaps using a wiki page or a dedicated job) the specific functionality it provides and why it's *essential*.
3.  **Removal:** Uninstall any unjustified plugins directly through the Jenkins Plugin Manager.
4.  **Vetting:** Before installing *any* new plugin:
    *   Use the Jenkins Update Center to check for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Research the plugin's author/maintainer within the Jenkins community context.
5.  **Updates:** Configure Jenkins (in the Plugin Manager) to automatically check for updates. Establish a process (documented within Jenkins) for reviewing and applying updates.
6.  **Sandboxing:** If a plugin offers sandboxing (visible in the plugin's configuration within Jenkins), enable it.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugins (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of installing a plugin designed to compromise Jenkins.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugins (Severity: High to Critical):** Minimizes the attack surface. Regular updates address known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: High to Critical):** Vetting plugins helps mitigate compromised plugins.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Plugins:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugins:** Reduces risk proportionally to removals and updates.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Reduces risk, but requires vigilance.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Plugin update notifications are enabled within Jenkins.
    *   Basic plugin inventory exists within the Plugin Manager.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal justification process documented within Jenkins.
    *   Thorough vetting process before installation.
    *   Automated vulnerability scanning (requires integration with external tools, but initiated from Jenkins).
    *   Consistent sandboxing use.
    *   Dedicated testing environment (ideally, a separate Jenkins instance).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Script Approval and Sandboxing](./mitigation_strategies/secure_script_approval_and_sandboxing.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Enable Script Security:** In Jenkins' global security configuration, ensure the Script Security Plugin is enabled.
2.  **Mandatory Approval:** Configure Jenkins (via the Script Security Plugin) to require manual approval for *all* Groovy scripts.
3.  **Review Process:** Establish a formal script review process (documented within Jenkins, e.g., using a wiki). Approvals should be done within the Jenkins "In-process Script Approval" page.
4.  **Sandbox (Pipeline):** For Pipeline scripts, enable the Groovy sandbox within the `Pipeline: Groovy` plugin's configuration in Jenkins.
5.  **`@NonCPS` Review:** If a script uses `@NonCPS`, require *extra* scrutiny and justification (documented within Jenkins).
6.  **Shared Libraries:** Encourage shared libraries (managed within Jenkins). Apply the same script approval process to shared library code.
7.  **Restrict Admin Scripts:** Limit users who can approve/run admin-level scripts (configured through Jenkins' RBAC).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents unauthorized Groovy scripts.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Limits attackers gaining elevated privileges.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Restricts scripts accessing sensitive data.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: Medium to High):** Mitigates malicious/negligent insiders.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Reduces risk (with RBAC).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Reduces risk (depends on review thoroughness).
    *   **Insider Threats:** Reduces risk (relies on approver integrity).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Script Security Plugin is installed.
    *   Groovy sandbox is enabled for *some* Pipeline jobs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mandatory approval for *all* Groovy scripts.
    *   Formal, documented script review process within Jenkins.
    *   Consistent Groovy sandbox use.
    *   Strict control over `@NonCPS`.
    *   Widespread shared library adoption.
    *   Restricted access to admin-level script execution (via RBAC).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Plugin Selection:** Choose an RBAC plugin (Matrix Authorization or Role-based Authorization) within Jenkins.
2.  **Role Definition:** Define granular roles with specific permissions *within the chosen plugin's configuration in Jenkins*.
3.  **Permission Assignment:** For each role, assign the *minimum* necessary permissions within the Jenkins interface.
4.  **User Assignment:** Assign users to roles within Jenkins' user management section.
5.  **Regular Review:** Regularly review role definitions and assignments *within Jenkins*.
6.  **Project-Based Access (Optional):** Use Project-Based Matrix Authorization (configured within Jenkins).
7. **Disable Anonymous Access:** In Jenkins' global security settings, ensure anonymous access is disabled.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: High to Critical):** Prevents unauthorized access.
