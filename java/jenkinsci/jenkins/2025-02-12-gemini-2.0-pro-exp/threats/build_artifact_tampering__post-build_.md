Okay, let's craft a deep analysis of the "Build Artifact Tampering (Post-Build)" threat for a Jenkins-based application.

## Deep Analysis: Build Artifact Tampering (Post-Build) in Jenkins

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1. Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Build Artifact Tampering (Post-Build)" threat, identify specific vulnerabilities within a Jenkins environment, evaluate the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and recommend concrete actions to minimize the risk.  We aim to go beyond the high-level description and delve into the technical details of *how* this attack could be carried out and *how* to prevent it effectively.

**1.2. Scope:**

This analysis focuses on the following aspects:

*   **Jenkins Core and Plugins:**  We'll consider the built-in artifact storage mechanisms of Jenkins, as well as commonly used plugins for artifact management (e.g., Artifactory Plugin, Nexus Artifact Uploader).
*   **Artifact Storage Locations:**  This includes the Jenkins master's local filesystem, network shares, and external artifact repositories (Artifactory, Nexus, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.).
*   **Access Control Mechanisms:**  We'll examine Jenkins' role-based access control (RBAC), project-based matrix authorization, and any access controls provided by external artifact repositories.
*   **Artifact Lifecycle:**  The analysis covers the period *after* the build completes and the artifact is stored, up to the point of deployment.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** We'll consider attackers with varying levels of access, from unauthorized external actors to malicious insiders with limited Jenkins permissions.

**1.3. Methodology:**

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  We'll build upon the existing threat model entry, expanding on the attack vectors and potential consequences.
*   **Code Review (Targeted):**  We'll examine relevant sections of Jenkins core code and plugin code (where source is available) to identify potential vulnerabilities related to artifact handling and access control.  This is *targeted* because a full code review of Jenkins is beyond the scope of this single-threat analysis.
*   **Vulnerability Research:**  We'll research known vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to Jenkins artifact management and external repository integrations.
*   **Best Practices Analysis:**  We'll compare the proposed mitigations against industry best practices for secure software development and deployment.
*   **Scenario Analysis:**  We'll construct realistic attack scenarios to illustrate how the threat could manifest in practice.
*   **Penetration Testing Principles:** We will consider how penetration tester will try to exploit this threat.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Attack Vectors:**

An attacker could tamper with build artifacts post-build through several avenues:

*   **Direct Filesystem Access (Jenkins Master):** If an attacker gains shell access to the Jenkins master server (e.g., through an unpatched vulnerability, compromised credentials, or a misconfigured SSH service), they could directly modify files within the `JENKINS_HOME/jobs/<job_name>/builds/<build_number>/archive/` directory.
*   **Compromised Jenkins Credentials:**  An attacker with valid Jenkins credentials (even with limited build permissions) might be able to use the Jenkins API or UI to overwrite existing artifacts, depending on the authorization configuration.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Artifact Management Plugins:**  Plugins used to interact with external repositories (Artifactory, Nexus, etc.) might have vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized artifact modification.  This could include improper authentication, insufficient access controls, or injection flaws.
*   **Compromised External Repository Credentials:**  If an attacker gains access to the credentials used by Jenkins to interact with an external repository (e.g., Artifactory API key, Nexus username/password), they could directly modify artifacts within that repository.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  If communication between Jenkins and an external repository is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS with valid certificates), an attacker could intercept and modify artifacts in transit.  This is less likely for post-build tampering but still a consideration.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls on External Repository:**  Even if Jenkins' interaction with the repository is secure, weak access controls *within* the repository itself (e.g., overly permissive user roles) could allow an attacker to modify artifacts.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks on Plugins:** A compromised plugin, obtained from a malicious source or through a compromised update mechanism, could be designed to tamper with artifacts.

**2.2. Impact Analysis (Detailed):**

The impact of successful artifact tampering goes beyond the general "deployment of compromised software."  Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Data Breaches:**  Modified artifacts could contain code designed to exfiltrate sensitive data (database credentials, API keys, customer information) from the production environment.
*   **System Compromise:**  Attackers could inject backdoors or remote access Trojans (RATs) into the artifact, allowing them to gain full control of the deployed system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Modified artifacts could contain code that disrupts the application's functionality, causing a denial of service.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack could severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Data breaches, system downtime, and recovery efforts can result in significant financial losses.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:**  Depending on the nature of the compromised application and the data it handles, the organization could face legal penalties and regulatory fines.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised artifact can be used as starting point to attack other systems.

**2.3. Vulnerability Analysis (Specific Examples):**

*   **CVE-2019-1003000 (and related):**  A series of vulnerabilities in Jenkins related to Stapler, the web framework used by Jenkins.  These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to bypass access controls and potentially modify files on the Jenkins master, including artifacts.
*   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:**  Regularly check for security advisories related to any artifact management plugins used in your Jenkins environment.  For example, search for "Artifactory Plugin security advisory" or "Nexus Plugin CVE."
*   **Misconfigured RBAC:**  A common vulnerability is overly permissive role-based access control in Jenkins.  For example, granting the "Overall/Administer" permission to too many users, or giving "Job/Configure" access to users who should only have "Job/Build" access.
*   **Weak External Repository Credentials:**  Storing external repository credentials in plain text within Jenkins job configurations or global settings is a significant vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Audit Logging:**  Without proper audit logging, it can be difficult or impossible to determine *who* modified an artifact and *when*.

**2.4. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation:**

Let's evaluate the proposed mitigations in more detail:

*   **Artifact Integrity Checks (Checksums):**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective at *detecting* tampering, but does not *prevent* it.  Requires a process for securely storing and comparing checksums.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use the `checksum` step in a Jenkins Pipeline, or a plugin like the "Fingerprint Artifacts" plugin.  Store checksums in a secure location (e.g., a separate database, a secrets management system).  Compare checksums *before* deployment.
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires careful management of the checksum database.  If the checksum database is compromised, the attacker could modify both the artifact and the checksum.

*   **Digital Signatures:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective at both *detecting* and *preventing* tampering (if implemented correctly).  Provides strong assurance of authenticity.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use a code signing tool (e.g., GPG, jarsigner) to sign artifacts after the build.  Verify signatures before deployment.  Requires a robust key management infrastructure.
    *   **Limitations:**  More complex to implement than checksums.  Requires careful management of private keys.  If the private key is compromised, the attacker can forge signatures.

*   **Secure Artifact Storage:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Essential for preventing unauthorized access.  Includes both physical security (for on-premise repositories) and logical access controls.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use a reputable artifact repository (Artifactory, Nexus, etc.) with strong access controls and audit logging.  Configure Jenkins to use secure protocols (HTTPS) for communication with the repository.  Regularly review and update access control policies.
    *   **Limitations:**  Does not prevent tampering if the repository itself is compromised or if an attacker gains valid credentials.

*   **Immutable Artifacts:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  A strong preventative measure.  Once an artifact is created, it cannot be modified.  Any changes require creating a new artifact with a new version number.
    *   **Implementation:**  Configure the artifact repository to enforce immutability (most repositories support this).  Use a versioning scheme that prevents overwriting existing artifacts (e.g., semantic versioning).
    *   **Limitations:**  Requires a well-defined versioning strategy.  May require changes to deployment processes to handle new artifact versions.

**2.5. Scenario Analysis (Example):**

**Scenario:**  A malicious insider with "Job/Configure" access to a specific Jenkins project wants to inject malicious code into a Java web application.

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The insider examines the project's build configuration and identifies the artifact storage location (e.g., an Artifactory repository).
2.  **Exploitation:** The insider modifies the build script (e.g., the `pom.xml` file for a Maven project) to include a malicious dependency or to execute a shell script that downloads and installs a backdoor during the build process.
3.  **Build Trigger:** The insider triggers a new build of the project.
4.  **Artifact Creation:** The build process creates a new artifact (e.g., a WAR file) containing the malicious code.
5.  **Artifact Storage:** The artifact is uploaded to the Artifactory repository.  Because the insider has "Job/Configure" access, they can potentially overwrite an existing artifact with the same version number (if immutability is not enforced).
6.  **Deployment:** The compromised artifact is deployed to the production environment.
7.  **Exploitation (Post-Deployment):** The malicious code within the artifact executes, allowing the insider to gain access to the production system or exfiltrate data.

**2.6 Penetration Testing Approach**
1.  **Access Jenkins Interface:** Attempt to gain access to the Jenkins web interface through various methods, including:
    *   **Default Credentials:** Trying default usernames and passwords.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attempting to guess usernames and passwords.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Using credentials obtained from previous breaches.
    *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:** Targeting known vulnerabilities in Jenkins or its plugins.
2.  **Identify Artifact Storage:** Once inside Jenkins, determine where build artifacts are stored:
    *   **Jenkins Master Filesystem:** Check the default artifact storage location.
    *   **External Repositories:** Identify if Artifactory, Nexus, or cloud storage is used.
3.  **Attempt Direct Modification:**
    *   **Filesystem Access:** If access to the Jenkins master is achieved, try to directly modify artifact files.
    *   **Repository Access:** If external repositories are used, attempt to gain access using discovered credentials or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository software.
4.  **Leverage Jenkins Features:**
    *   **Overwrite Artifacts:** Use the Jenkins UI or API to attempt overwriting existing artifacts.
    *   **Modify Build Scripts:** Inject code into build scripts to tamper with artifacts during the build process.
5.  **Bypass Security Controls:**
    *   **Checksum Validation:** Attempt to modify both the artifact and its checksum.
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Try to forge signatures or obtain the private key used for signing.
    *   **Immutability:** Attempt to circumvent immutability rules by creating new artifacts with the same name or exploiting repository misconfigurations.
6.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** If communication between Jenkins and the artifact repository is not secure, attempt to intercept and modify artifacts in transit.

### 3. Recommendations

Based on the deep analysis, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Implement Multiple Layers of Defense:**  Do not rely on a single mitigation strategy.  Use a combination of checksums, digital signatures, secure artifact storage, and immutable artifacts.
2.  **Enforce Strict Access Control:**  Implement the principle of least privilege.  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions in Jenkins and the artifact repository.  Regularly review and audit access control policies.
3.  **Use a Dedicated Artifact Repository:**  Avoid storing artifacts directly on the Jenkins master's filesystem.  Use a reputable artifact repository like Artifactory or Nexus.
4.  **Configure Immutability:**  Enforce immutability for all build artifacts.  This is the strongest preventative measure.
5.  **Implement Robust Key Management:**  If using digital signatures, implement a secure key management system to protect private keys.
6.  **Regularly Update Jenkins and Plugins:**  Keep Jenkins and all plugins up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
7.  **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:**  Implement audit logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized access or modification of artifacts.
8.  **Conduct Regular Security Assessments:**  Perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify and address security weaknesses.
9.  **Secure Communication:**  Use HTTPS with valid certificates for all communication between Jenkins and external repositories.
10. **Secure Credentials:**  Never store credentials in plain text.  Use Jenkins' built-in credentials management system or a dedicated secrets management solution.
11. **Harden Jenkins Master:** Secure operating system on Jenkins Master.

By implementing these recommendations, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of build artifact tampering and protect its software development pipeline from malicious attacks. This multi-layered approach, combining preventative and detective controls, is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of deployed software.
