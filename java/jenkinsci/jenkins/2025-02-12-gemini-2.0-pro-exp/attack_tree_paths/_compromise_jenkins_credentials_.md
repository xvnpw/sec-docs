Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of Jenkins Attack Tree Path: Compromise Jenkins Credentials (Brute Force - Default/Common)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Compromise Jenkins Credentials" attack path, specifically focusing on the "Brute Force" method using "Default/Common" credentials.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific vulnerabilities and risks associated with this attack path.
*   Identify the technical details of how an attacker would execute this attack.
*   Evaluate the likelihood and impact of a successful attack.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
*   Determine appropriate detection mechanisms to identify attempted or successful attacks.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **Target System:** Jenkins instances (as defined by the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins)).  This includes both self-hosted and cloud-hosted Jenkins deployments.
*   **Attack Path:**  Specifically, the path:  `[Compromise Jenkins Credentials] -> [Brute Force] -> [[Default/Common]]`.  We will *not* analyze other credential compromise methods (e.g., phishing, credential stuffing, keylogging) or other brute-force variations (e.g., dictionary attacks against non-default usernames).
*   **Credentials:**  We focus on the Jenkins web interface login credentials (username and password).  We will not cover API tokens or SSH keys in this specific analysis (though they are related and should be addressed separately).
* **Jenkins Version:** The analysis will consider the latest stable release of Jenkins, but will also acknowledge that older, unpatched versions may have additional vulnerabilities.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Review Jenkins documentation, security advisories, and known vulnerabilities related to default credentials and brute-force attacks.
2.  **Technical Analysis:**  Describe the technical steps an attacker would take to exploit this vulnerability.  This includes examining the Jenkins login mechanism and potential weaknesses.
3.  **Likelihood and Impact Assessment:**  Quantify (where possible) and qualify the likelihood of a successful attack and the potential impact on the system and organization.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable steps to prevent or mitigate the attack.  This will include both technical and procedural controls.
5.  **Detection Strategy Development:**  Outline methods to detect attempted or successful brute-force attacks against default/common credentials.
6.  **Documentation:**  Present the findings in a clear, concise, and actionable report (this document).

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path

### 2.1 Vulnerability Research

*   **Jenkins Documentation:** The official Jenkins documentation strongly recommends changing the default administrator password immediately after installation.  It also highlights the importance of strong password policies.
*   **Security Advisories:** While there aren't specific CVEs *solely* for default credentials (as it's a configuration issue, not a software bug), numerous advisories relate to vulnerabilities that are *exacerbated* by weak or default credentials.  For example, an unauthenticated user might be able to exploit a separate vulnerability if they can guess the default admin password.
*   **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE):** This attack path falls under CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials and CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts.
* **OWASP:** OWASP Top 10 lists "Broken Authentication" (A02:2021) as a critical web application security risk, which directly relates to this attack.

### 2.2 Technical Analysis

1.  **Attack Setup:**
    *   **Attacker Goal:** Gain administrative access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Target:** The Jenkins web interface login page (typically `/login`).
    *   **Tools:**  Attackers can use readily available tools like:
        *   **Burp Suite:**  A web application security testing tool with intruder capabilities for brute-forcing.
        *   **Hydra:**  A dedicated password-cracking tool.
        *   **Custom Scripts:**  Simple Python scripts using libraries like `requests` can automate login attempts.
        *   **Browser Developer Tools:**  Can be used to inspect the login form and understand the request structure.

2.  **Attack Execution:**
    *   **Identify the Login Endpoint:** The attacker first needs to locate the Jenkins login page.  This is usually straightforward, as it's often at the root URL or `/login`.
    *   **Craft Login Requests:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of the login POST request.  This typically involves sending a username and password in the request body.  They can use browser developer tools or a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept a legitimate login attempt and analyze the request.
    *   **Automated Attempts:** The attacker uses a tool (Burp Suite, Hydra, or a custom script) to repeatedly send login requests with the default username (e.g., "admin") and a list of common passwords (e.g., "admin", "password", "123456", "jenkins").
    *   **Success Condition:** The attacker monitors the responses.  A successful login will typically result in a redirect (e.g., to the Jenkins dashboard) or a specific HTTP status code (e.g., 302 Found).  An unsuccessful login will likely return a different status code (e.g., 401 Unauthorized) or an error message.

3.  **Jenkins Login Mechanism (Simplified):**
    *   Jenkins uses a standard form-based authentication mechanism.
    *   Upon receiving a login request, Jenkins checks the provided credentials against its internal user database (or an external authentication provider, if configured).
    *   If the credentials are valid, Jenkins creates a session for the user and sets a session cookie.
    *   Subsequent requests with the valid session cookie are authenticated.

4.  **Potential Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Rate Limiting (Historically):** Older versions of Jenkins (and some plugins) might not have implemented robust rate limiting, making brute-force attacks easier.  Modern Jenkins versions generally include some protection, but it might be configurable or bypassable.
    *   **Lack of Account Lockout:**  Similar to rate limiting, account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts is a crucial defense.  While Jenkins has this feature, it might be disabled or configured with a high threshold.
    *   **Predictable Error Messages:**  Error messages that reveal too much information (e.g., "Invalid username" vs. "Invalid username or password") can help the attacker refine their attack.
    * **Lack of CAPTCHA or MFA:** The absence of CAPTCHA or Multi-Factor Authentication makes automated attacks much easier.

### 2.3 Likelihood and Impact Assessment

*   **Likelihood:**
    *   **If default credentials are unchanged:**  **High**.  The attack is trivial to execute, and default credentials are widely known.
    *   **If default credentials are changed, but a common password is used:**  **Medium**.  The attacker needs a list of common passwords, but these are readily available.
    *   **If a strong, unique password is used:**  **Low**.  Brute-forcing a strong password is computationally expensive and time-consuming.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **High**.  Successful compromise of an administrative account grants the attacker full control over the Jenkins instance.  This can lead to:
        *   **Code Execution:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server and any connected build agents.
        *   **Data Breach:**  Access to sensitive data stored in Jenkins (e.g., source code, credentials, API keys).
        *   **Build Manipulation:**  The attacker can modify build configurations, inject malicious code into builds, or disrupt the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker can use the compromised Jenkins server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.
        *   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy

1.  **Immediate Actions (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Change Default Credentials:**  Immediately change the default administrator password to a strong, unique password.  This is the single most important mitigation.
    *   **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**  Configure Jenkins to enforce strong password policies for all users.  This should include:
        *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12 characters).
        *   Complexity requirements (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
        *   Password expiration policies.
        *   Prohibition of common passwords (using a blacklist).

2.  **Technical Controls:**
    *   **Enable Account Lockout:**  Configure Jenkins to lock accounts after a specified number of failed login attempts.  Choose a reasonable threshold (e.g., 5-10 attempts) and lockout duration (e.g., 30 minutes).
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Ensure that Jenkins has rate limiting enabled to prevent rapid-fire login attempts.  This should be configured at both the application level and potentially at the web server or firewall level.
    *   **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  MFA adds a significant layer of security by requiring a second factor (e.g., a one-time code from an authenticator app) in addition to the password.  This makes brute-force attacks much more difficult, even if the password is weak.
    *   **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block brute-force attacks by analyzing traffic patterns and identifying suspicious behavior.
    *   **Regularly Update Jenkins:**  Keep Jenkins and all installed plugins up to date to patch any security vulnerabilities.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If the "Remember Me" feature is not essential, disable it to reduce the risk of session hijacking.

3.  **Procedural Controls:**
    *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate all Jenkins users about the importance of strong passwords and the risks of phishing and other social engineering attacks.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Jenkins instance to identify and address any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid using the administrator account for routine tasks.
    * **Secure Configuration Management:** Store Jenkins configuration files securely and version-control them to track changes and prevent unauthorized modifications.

### 2.5 Detection Strategy

1.  **Monitor Login Logs:**  Jenkins logs failed login attempts.  Regularly review these logs (or use a centralized logging system) to identify suspicious activity.  Look for:
    *   A high number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.
    *   Failed login attempts using the default username ("admin").
    *   Failed login attempts using common passwords.

2.  **Implement Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  An IDS can monitor network traffic and detect patterns associated with brute-force attacks.

3.  **Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  A SIEM system can collect and correlate logs from various sources (including Jenkins, web servers, and firewalls) to provide a comprehensive view of security events.  Configure alerts for:
    *   Multiple failed login attempts within a short time frame.
    *   Successful login after multiple failed attempts.
    *   Login attempts from unusual locations or IP addresses.

4.  **Regular Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities.

5. **Monitor for Account Lockout Events:** Configure alerts for account lockout events. This can indicate an ongoing brute-force attack.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Compromise Jenkins Credentials" attack path via brute-forcing default or common credentials represents a significant security risk.  However, this risk can be effectively mitigated through a combination of technical and procedural controls.  Changing the default password, enforcing strong password policies, enabling account lockout and rate limiting, and implementing MFA are crucial steps.  Regular monitoring, security audits, and penetration testing are essential for maintaining a strong security posture. By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack.
