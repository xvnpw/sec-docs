### Key Attack Surface List: Apache Zookeeper (High & Critical - Zookeeper Specific)

**I. Unsecured Client Connection Ports**

*   **Description:** Zookeeper clients connect to the server on configurable ports (default: 2181). If these ports are exposed without proper network controls, unauthorized clients can attempt to connect.
*   **How Zookeeper Contributes:** Zookeeper's design requires open ports for client communication. The default port is well-known, increasing the likelihood of targeted attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network or with internet access to the Zookeeper server's port attempts to connect using a Zookeeper client library.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Zookeeper data, potential for data manipulation or deletion, denial of service by overwhelming the server with connections.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to Zookeeper client ports to only authorized client IP addresses or networks.
    *   Utilize network segmentation to isolate the Zookeeper cluster within a secure network zone.
    *   Consider using a VPN or other secure tunneling mechanisms for client connections.

**II. Lack of Encryption for Client-Server Communication**

*   **Description:** By default, communication between Zookeeper clients and servers is not encrypted.
*   **How Zookeeper Contributes:** Zookeeper's default configuration does not enforce encryption, leaving data in transit vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between an application and the Zookeeper server and reads sensitive configuration data or coordination messages.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data or internal architecture details.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for client-server communication using Zookeeper's built-in support or by using a TLS-terminating proxy.
    *   Ensure proper certificate management and rotation.

**III. Weak or Default Authentication Schemes**

*   **Description:** Zookeeper supports various authentication schemes (e.g., Digest, SASL). Using weak schemes or failing to change default credentials can allow unauthorized access.
*   **How Zookeeper Contributes:** Zookeeper's security relies on the chosen authentication mechanism. Weak choices undermine this security.
*   **Example:** An attacker attempts to authenticate using default credentials or brute-forces a weak password configured for Zookeeper authentication.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Zookeeper data, ability to manipulate or delete data, potential for complete cluster compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms like Kerberos (via SASL) where appropriate.
    *   Avoid using the "world" or "anyone" authentication scheme in production environments.
    *   Regularly review and update authentication credentials.

**IV. Insufficient Authorization Controls (ACLs)**

*   **Description:** Zookeeper uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage permissions on zNodes. Misconfigured or overly permissive ACLs can grant unauthorized access.
*   **How Zookeeper Contributes:** Zookeeper's security model relies heavily on correctly configured ACLs to restrict access to specific data.
*   **Example:** An application component or a compromised client with overly broad permissions modifies or deletes critical zNodes, disrupting the application's functionality.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data deletion, application malfunction, potential for privilege escalation if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring ACLs. Grant only the necessary permissions to specific users or applications.
    *   Regularly audit and review ACL configurations to ensure they remain appropriate.
    *   Use more restrictive ACL schemes like "auth" or specific user/group identifiers instead of "world:anyone".
