Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve Apache Tomcat:

*   **Threat:** Default Manager Application Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to log in to the Tomcat Manager application using default credentials (e.g., username "tomcat", password "tomcat" or no password). If successful, the attacker gains administrative access to the Tomcat server.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can deploy, undeploy, start, and stop web applications, potentially uploading malicious WAR files leading to remote code execution, data theft, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Manager Application (specifically the authentication mechanism)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change the default username and password for the Manager and Host Manager applications immediately upon installation.
        *   Use strong, unique credentials and store them securely.
        *   Consider disabling the Manager and Host Manager applications if they are not required.
        *   Restrict access to the Manager and Host Manager applications to specific IP addresses or networks.

*   **Threat:** Exposed AJP Connector (Ghostcat Vulnerability)
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector, which is often enabled by default. By sending specially crafted AJP requests, the attacker can bypass authentication checks and access web application resources or even read arbitrary files on the server.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within web applications, potentially read configuration files, and in some cases, achieve remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** AJP Connector (specifically the request processing logic)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the AJP connector if it is not being used.
        *   If the AJP connector is required, ensure it is only listening on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1) and is accessed via a reverse proxy.
        *   Upgrade to a patched version of Tomcat that addresses the "Ghostcat" vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938).
        *   Implement network segmentation to restrict access to the AJP port (default 8009).

*   **Threat:** Insecure Session Management Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Tomcat's session management. This could involve session fixation (forcing a user to use a known session ID) or session hijacking (stealing a valid session ID).
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can impersonate legitimate users, gaining access to their accounts and data, and potentially performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Affected Component:** Session Management Module
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure secure session cookies by setting the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.
        *   Use HTTPS to encrypt all communication and protect session cookies from interception.
        *   Implement session timeout mechanisms to limit the lifespan of sessions.
        *   Regenerate session IDs after successful login to prevent session fixation.
        *   Consider using stronger session ID generation algorithms.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Tomcat's Servlet Container
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities within the Tomcat servlet container itself. These vulnerabilities could range from denial-of-service attacks to remote code execution flaws.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the specific vulnerability, the attacker could crash the server, gain unauthorized access to data, or execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Servlet Container (core functionality)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Tomcat updated to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for announcements of new vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management process to regularly scan and address known issues.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Host Manager Application
    *   **Description:** Similar to the Manager application, an attacker attempts to log in to the Tomcat Host Manager application using default or weak credentials. Successful login allows the attacker to manage virtual hosts.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can deploy, undeploy, and manage virtual hosts, potentially disrupting services or introducing malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:** Host Manager Application (specifically the authentication mechanism)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Change the default username and password for the Host Manager application.
        *   Restrict access to the Host Manager application to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   Consider disabling the Host Manager application if it is not required.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Native (APR) Library
    *   **Description:** If Tomcat is configured to use the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library for performance enhancements, vulnerabilities in the native APR code can be exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting APR vulnerabilities can lead to crashes, memory corruption, or even remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Native Libraries (APR)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the APR library updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor for security advisories related to APR.
        *   If APR is not strictly necessary, consider disabling it.
