# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Joda-Time library is a date and time library for Java. It aims to provide a more user-friendly and comprehensive API for handling dates and times compared to the built-in Java Date and Calendar classes.

- Business priorities:
  - Provide a robust, reliable, and accurate date and time library for Java developers.
  - Maintain the library's stability and backward compatibility to minimize disruption for existing users.
  - Ensure the library is well-documented and easy to use.

- Business goals:
  - Simplify date and time manipulation in Java applications.
  - Offer a better alternative to the legacy Java date and time classes.
  - Support a wide range of date and time operations and time zones.

- Business risks:
  - Bugs or inaccuracies in date and time calculations could lead to application errors and data corruption in systems relying on Joda-Time.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors if applications use Joda-Time to process untrusted date/time inputs.
  - Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could result in the library becoming outdated and potentially vulnerable to newly discovered security issues or incompatible with newer Java versions.
  - Dependency on community contributions for bug fixes and security patches might lead to delays in addressing critical issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Open Source Community Review - The Joda-Time library is open source, allowing for community review of the code, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub repository and public code access.
  - security control: Unit and Integration Testing - Joda-Time has a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of date and time calculations and the overall stability of the library. Described in the 'src/test' directory of the GitHub repository.
  - security control: Release Process via Maven Central - Joda-Time releases are published to Maven Central, a widely trusted repository for Java libraries. This ensures the integrity and authenticity of the distributed library. Described in project documentation and build scripts (pom.xml).

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community for Security Vulnerability Disclosure - As an open-source project, Joda-Time relies on the community to report security vulnerabilities. There is a risk that vulnerabilities might not be reported or addressed promptly.
  - accepted risk: Potential for Undiscovered Vulnerabilities - Despite testing and community review, there is always a possibility of undiscovered security vulnerabilities in the code.
  - accepted risk: Dependency on Third-Party Libraries - Joda-Time might depend on other third-party libraries, which could introduce their own security vulnerabilities.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically scan the Joda-Time codebase for potential security vulnerabilities during development.
  - security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning - Implement dependency vulnerability scanning to identify and track known vulnerabilities in Joda-Time's dependencies.
  - security control: Security Code Reviews for Critical Changes - Conduct focused security code reviews for significant code changes, especially those related to input parsing or date/time calculations, to proactively identify potential security issues.
  - security control: Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear security vulnerability disclosure policy to provide a channel for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable to a library. Joda-Time itself does not handle authentication. Applications using Joda-Time are responsible for their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not applicable to a library. Joda-Time does not perform authorization. Authorization is the responsibility of applications using Joda-Time.
  - Input validation: Joda-Time must perform robust input validation when parsing date and time strings from external sources to prevent injection attacks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities due to malformed inputs. Input validation should be implemented in parsing methods throughout the library.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for Joda-Time's primary functionality. However, if Joda-Time were to handle sensitive time-related data (which is not its current scope), appropriate cryptographic measures would be necessary to protect that data. Currently, cryptography is not a relevant security requirement.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process: Providing accurate and reliable date and time calculations for applications that depend on Joda-Time. Incorrect calculations can lead to functional errors, data inconsistencies, and potentially security vulnerabilities in dependent applications.

- Data we are trying to protect:
  - Integrity of the Joda-Time library code: Ensuring that the code is not tampered with and remains accurate and reliable. Sensitivity: High, as compromised code could lead to widespread issues in applications using Joda-Time.
  - Availability of the Joda-Time library: Ensuring that the library is accessible to developers and applications when needed. Sensitivity: Medium, as unavailability would disrupt development and potentially application functionality.
  - Intellectual Property (Source Code): Protecting the source code from unauthorized access or modification. Sensitivity: Medium, as the source code is open source, but maintaining control over changes is important.
