# Attack Tree Analysis for jodaorg/joda-time

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or disrupt the application's functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Joda-Time library (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application via Joda-Time **[CRITICAL NODE]**
* Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Malicious Format String Injection **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * User-Controlled Format String **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            * Inject format specifiers leading to information disclosure (e.g., memory addresses)
            * Trigger exceptions leading to denial of service
    * Input Data Exploitation **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Components
            * Provide extremely large or small values for year, month, day, etc., leading to unexpected behavior or crashes
    * Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if Joda-Time objects are serialized/deserialized) **[HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Java Deserialization Attack **[CRITICAL NODE]**
            * Craft malicious serialized Joda-Time objects to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization (requires vulnerable dependencies or application code)

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Malicious Format String Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__malicious_format_string_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

* **User-Controlled Format String [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Inject format specifiers leading to information disclosure (e.g., memory addresses):**
        * **Likelihood:** Low
        * **Impact:** Medium to High (Exposure of sensitive data or internal state)
        * **Effort:** Medium
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High
        * **Description:** If the application allows user input to directly influence the format string used for parsing or formatting dates, an attacker can inject special format specifiers to read arbitrary memory locations, potentially revealing sensitive data or internal application details.
    * **Trigger exceptions leading to denial of service:**
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** Medium (Temporary disruption of service)
        * **Effort:** Low to Medium
        * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
        * **Description:** By injecting specific format specifiers or malformed patterns, an attacker can cause the Joda-Time library to throw exceptions, potentially crashing the application or consuming excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Input Data Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__input_data_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Overflow/Underflow in Date/Time Components:**
    * **Provide extremely large or small values for year, month, day, etc., leading to unexpected behavior or crashes:**
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** Medium (Unexpected behavior, potential crashes, denial of service)
        * **Effort:** Low
        * **Skill Level:** Beginner
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
        * **Description:** By providing input values for date and time components (like year, month, or day) that are outside the valid range, an attacker can trigger errors, unexpected behavior, or even crashes within the Joda-Time library or the application's logic that uses it. This often happens when input validation is insufficient.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__deserialization_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Java Deserialization Attack [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Craft malicious serialized Joda-Time objects to execute arbitrary code upon deserialization (requires vulnerable dependencies or application code):**
        * **Likelihood:** Low
        * **Impact:** High (Remote Code Execution, full system compromise)
        * **Effort:** High
        * **Skill Level:** Expert
        * **Detection Difficulty:** High
        * **Description:** If the application serializes Joda-Time objects and then deserializes them (especially from untrusted sources), it becomes vulnerable to Java deserialization attacks. An attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, exploits vulnerabilities in the application's classpath (or its dependencies) to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a severe vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.
