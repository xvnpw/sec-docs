# Threat Model Analysis for jodaorg/joda-time

## Threat: [Malicious Input Parsing Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/malicious_input_parsing_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might submit specially crafted, excessively long, or deeply nested date/time strings through input fields or APIs that are then processed by Joda-Time's parsing functions (e.g., `DateTimeFormatter.parseDateTime()`). This could cause the parsing logic within Joda-Time to consume excessive CPU time and memory, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service. The vulnerability lies within Joda-Time's parsing implementation and its susceptibility to complex or malformed input.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, services are unavailable to legitimate users, server overload, potential for application crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatter` (parsing methods).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation on all user-provided date/time strings *before* passing them to Joda-Time.
    *   Use predefined `DateTimeFormatter` patterns instead of relying on automatic pattern detection, which can be more vulnerable to complex inputs.
    *   Set maximum lengths for input strings containing date/time information.
    *   Implement timeouts for date/time parsing operations to prevent indefinite processing within Joda-Time.
    *   Consider migrating to `java.time` which may have different parsing characteristics and potentially better resilience against such attacks.
