# Attack Surface Analysis for jodaorg/joda-time

## Attack Surface: [Locale and Time Zone Manipulation Leading to Incorrect Interpretation](./attack_surfaces/locale_and_time_zone_manipulation_leading_to_incorrect_interpretation.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Locale and Time Zone Manipulation Leading to Incorrect Interpretation
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to influence the locale or time zone settings used by Joda-Time without proper validation, attackers could manipulate how dates and times are interpreted and displayed.
    *   **How Joda-Time Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Joda-Time uses `Locale` and `DateTimeZone` objects for formatting and calculations. If these are derived directly from untrusted input, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sets the time zone to a significantly different zone, causing scheduled events or access control checks based on time to behave incorrectly. For instance, a resource might become accessible earlier or later than intended.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect business logic execution, potential bypass of security checks, information disclosure based on time zone differences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Whitelist Allowed Locales/Time Zones: Only allow a predefined set of supported locales and time zones.
        *   Server-Side Control: Prefer setting locales and time zones on the server-side rather than relying on client-provided values.
        *   Input Sanitization: If accepting locale/timezone input, strictly validate it against known valid values.
        *   Consistent Configuration: Ensure consistent locale and time zone settings across the application.

## Attack Surface: [Object Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Joda-Time Objects are Deserialized)](./attack_surfaces/object_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_joda-time_objects_are_deserialized_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Object Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Joda-Time Objects are Deserialized)
    *   **Description:** If the application serializes and deserializes Joda-Time objects (e.g., `DateTime`, `LocalDate`) without proper safeguards, it could be vulnerable to object deserialization attacks.
    *   **How Joda-Time Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Joda-Time objects, like any Java objects, can be targets of deserialization attacks if the application deserializes untrusted data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized Joda-Time object that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary code or performs other harmful actions.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, and other severe security breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data: The primary defense is to avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   Use Secure Serialization Mechanisms: If serialization is necessary, consider using safer alternatives to Java's built-in serialization, such as JSON or Protocol Buffers.
        *   Implement Deserialization Filters: Use deserialization filters (available in newer Java versions) to restrict the classes that can be deserialized.
        *   Keep Joda-Time Updated: While Joda-Time itself might not have direct deserialization vulnerabilities, keeping it updated is a general security best practice.
