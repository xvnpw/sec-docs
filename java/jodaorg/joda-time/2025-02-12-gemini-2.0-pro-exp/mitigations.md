## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit and Correct `DateTimeZone` Handling](./mitigation_strategies/explicit_and_correct__datetimezone__handling.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Avoid Default Time Zone:**  Never use Joda-Time methods that implicitly rely on the system's default time zone.  This includes constructors like `new DateTime()` and methods like `DateTime.now()` without a `DateTimeZone` parameter.
2.  **Explicit `DateTimeZone` Objects:**  Always explicitly create and use `DateTimeZone` objects.  Use `DateTimeZone.forID("TimeZoneID")` with a valid IANA time zone ID (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles", "UTC").  Prefer `DateTimeZone.UTC` for internal representations.
3.  **Constructor and Method Parameters:**  Pass the `DateTimeZone` object to constructors and methods that accept it.  For example:
    *   `new DateTime(dateTimeZone)`
    *   `dateTime.withZone(dateTimeZone)`
    *   `formatter.withZone(dateTimeZone)`
4.  **User Input Validation:** If accepting time zone IDs from users, validate them against the list returned by `DateTimeZone.getAvailableIDs()`.  Reject invalid IDs.
5.  **Canonicalization:** Before using a user-supplied time zone ID, canonicalize it using `DateTimeZone.forID()` to handle variations in representation (e.g., "PST" vs. "America/Los_Angeles").

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Time Zone Confusion (High Severity):**  Incorrect or inconsistent time zone handling can lead to significant logic errors and data corruption.
    *   **Security Bypass (Medium Severity):**  Exploiting time zone differences could potentially bypass security checks based on time.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Time Zone Confusion:** Risk significantly reduced (90-95%) by enforcing explicit and consistent time zone handling.
    *   **Security Bypass:** Risk moderately reduced (50-70%) by validating and canonicalizing user-provided time zone input.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Some code uses explicit `DateTimeZone`, but other areas rely on the default. User input validation is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of explicit `DateTimeZone` in *all* Joda-Time interactions.
    *   Robust validation and canonicalization of all user-supplied time zone IDs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled and Safe Deserialization of Joda-Time Objects](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_and_safe_deserialization_of_joda-time_objects.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Avoid Direct Deserialization (Preferred):** If possible, *do not* directly serialize/deserialize Joda-Time objects. Instead, serialize a simpler, safer representation (e.g., milliseconds since the epoch as a `long`, or an ISO 8601 string).  Reconstruct the Joda-Time object on the receiving end using appropriate constructors and methods.
2.  **Safe Deserialization Libraries (If Necessary):** If direct deserialization is *unavoidable*, *never* use standard Java deserialization with untrusted input. Use a secure library like:
    *   **Jackson:**
        *   **Disable Default Typing:**  Call `objectMapper.disableDefaultTyping()`. This is crucial to prevent polymorphic deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Whitelist Allowed Classes:**  Use a whitelist to explicitly specify which classes are allowed to be deserialized. Include only the necessary Joda-Time classes (e.g., `DateTime`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `DateTimeZone`).
        *   **Configure `JodaModule`:**  Register the `JodaModule` with the `ObjectMapper` to handle Joda-Time types correctly: `objectMapper.registerModule(new JodaModule());`
        *   **Disable `FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` (with caution):** If you are absolutely sure about the structure of your JSON, you might consider disabling this feature, but be very careful as it can mask errors.
    *   **Gson:** Create and register custom `TypeAdapter` instances for each Joda-Time class you need to deserialize.  Within the `TypeAdapter`, perform strict validation of the incoming data before creating the Joda-Time object.
3.  **Input Validation (Before Deserialization):**  Even with safe libraries, perform strict input validation *before* passing data to the deserialization library.  Check for expected data types and formats.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Severity):** Insecure deserialization is a major vulnerability that can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Data Tampering (High Severity):** Attackers could modify serialized data to alter the state of Joda-Time objects.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Risk drastically reduced (95-99%) by avoiding insecure deserialization and using safe libraries with proper configuration.
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%) by combining safe deserialization with strict input validation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Jackson is used in some areas, but default typing is not always disabled, and whitelisting is not consistently applied. Input validation is incomplete.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of safe deserialization practices (avoiding direct deserialization where possible, disabling default typing in Jackson, using whitelists, and implementing custom `TypeAdapter`s for Gson).
    *   Comprehensive input validation *before* any deserialization occurs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Correct and Consistent Parsing with `DateTimeFormatter`](./mitigation_strategies/correct_and_consistent_parsing_with__datetimeformatter_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Explicit `DateTimeFormatter`:**  Always use `DateTimeFormatter` for parsing strings into Joda-Time objects. Avoid using constructors that directly accept strings.
2.  **Lenient vs. Strict:**  Be explicit about whether you want lenient or strict parsing.
    *   **Strict Parsing (Recommended):** Use `formatter.withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle.STRICT)` to reject any input that doesn't precisely match the specified format.
    *   **Lenient Parsing (Use with Caution):** If you *must* use lenient parsing, be extremely careful about the potential for accepting malformed input.  Thoroughly validate the resulting Joda-Time object after parsing.
3.  **Specify Time Zone:**  Use `formatter.withZone()` to explicitly set the time zone for parsing if the input string doesn't contain time zone information.
4.  **Specify Chronology:** Use `formatter.withChronology()` to explicitly set the chronology if you need a chronology other than the default (ISO).
5.  **Locale:** Use `formatter.withLocale()` to specify the locale for parsing, especially if dealing with localized date/time formats.
6. **Input Validation:** Validate the input string *before* parsing, checking for length, character restrictions, and any other constraints that can be applied *before* attempting to parse.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Input Validation Bypass (Medium Severity):** Lenient parsing can allow attackers to bypass input validation by providing unexpected date/time strings.
    *   **Incorrect Date/Time Calculations (High Severity):** Incorrect parsing can lead to incorrect date/time values, causing logic errors.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity):**  Malformed input could potentially lead to excessive resource consumption during parsing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Input Validation Bypass:** Risk significantly reduced (70-80%) by using strict parsing and pre-parsing input validation.
    *   **Incorrect Date/Time Calculations:** Risk significantly reduced (80-90%) by using explicit formatters and correct parsing settings.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk slightly reduced (10-20%) by pre-parsing input validation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. `DateTimeFormatter` is used, but strict parsing is not consistently enforced, and time zones/chronologies are not always explicitly specified.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of `formatter.withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle.STRICT)`.  
    *   Explicit `withZone()`, `withChronology()`, and `withLocale()` calls where appropriate.
    *   Thorough input validation *before* parsing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prefer Specific Joda-Time Types](./mitigation_strategies/prefer_specific_joda-time_types.md)

**Description:**

1. **Analyze Requirements:** Carefully analyze the specific date/time requirements of each part of the application.
2. **Choose Most Specific Type:** Use the most specific Joda-Time class that meets the needs. Avoid using more general types when a more specific type is sufficient.
    *   Use `LocalDate` if you only need a date (year, month, day).
    *   Use `LocalTime` if you only need a time (hour, minute, second, millisecond).
    *   Use `LocalDateTime` if you need a date and time *without* a time zone.
    *   Use `DateTime` if you need a date and time *with* a time zone.
    *   Use `Instant` if you need a point in time (milliseconds since the epoch).
    *   Use `Duration` or `Period` for representing time spans.
3. **Avoid Unnecessary Conversions:** Minimize conversions between different Joda-Time types, as each conversion introduces a potential point of error.

* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
     * **Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Using a more general type than necessary can increase the complexity of the code and make it more prone to errors.
     * **Unintended Time Zone Handling (Medium Severity):** Using `DateTime` when `LocalDateTime` is sufficient could introduce unintended time zone conversions.

* **Impact:**
    * **Logic Errors:** Risk moderately reduced (30-50%) by simplifying the code and reducing the potential for mistakes.
    * **Unintended Time Zone Handling:** Risk moderately reduced (40-60%) by avoiding unnecessary `DateTime` usage.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Partially. Some areas use appropriate specific types, but others use `DateTime` unnecessarily.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Consistent application of the principle of using the most specific Joda-Time type throughout the codebase.
