## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary attack path. The attacker leverages vulnerabilities in how Joda-Time (or libraries using it) handles the deserialization of Java objects. When untrusted data is deserialized, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Untrusted Data Input [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__untrusted_data_input__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the *essential* starting point. The attacker needs to provide data that the application will deserialize. This data is considered "untrusted" because it originates from a source the application cannot fully control (e.g., user input, external API, network request).
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** N/A (This is a prerequisite, not an attack itself)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Direct Deserialization [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__direct_deserialization__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The application explicitly uses Java's `ObjectInputStream` (or a similar mechanism) to deserialize data that contains Joda-Time objects (like `DateTime`, `Interval`, etc.) directly from an untrusted source. This is the most obvious and dangerous form of deserialization vulnerability. The attacker crafts a serialized object containing a "gadget chain" that, when deserialized, executes their code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2. Indirect Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2__indirect_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses a higher-level library or framework (e.g., a message queue, caching system, ORM) that *internally* performs deserialization. The application developer might not be aware that deserialization is happening, making this a more subtle vulnerability. The attacker provides input to the application, which is then passed to the vulnerable library, triggering the deserialization exploit.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3. Via 3rd Party Library](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3__via_3rd_party_library.md)

*   **Description:** A library used by the application (a dependency) itself contains a deserialization vulnerability related to Joda-Time. The application is vulnerable *transitively* through its dependency. The attacker exploits the vulnerability in the third-party library by providing input to the main application, which then gets processed by the vulnerable library.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
