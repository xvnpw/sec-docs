# Threat Model Analysis for jodaorg/joda-time

## Threat: [Malformed Date/Time String Exploitation](./threats/malformed_datetime_string_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a deliberately crafted, invalid, or unexpectedly formatted date/time string to a Joda-Time parsing method. This could be through user input fields, API parameters, or data files. The attacker aims to cause an error, exception, or potentially overload the parsing process.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service due to resource exhaustion during parsing, unexpected program behavior, or potentially the ability to bypass validation checks if the parsing error is not handled correctly.

**Affected Component:** `org.joda.time.format` package, specifically methods like `DateTimeFormatter.parseDateTime()`, `DateTime.parse()`, and similar parsing functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation *before* passing data to Joda-Time parsing methods.
*   Use specific `DateTimeFormatter` instances with predefined formats instead of relying on automatic format detection.
*   Implement error handling (try-catch blocks) around parsing calls to gracefully handle exceptions.
*   Consider using regular expressions to pre-validate the format of date/time strings before parsing.

## Threat: [Time Zone Manipulation Leading to Incorrect Logic](./threats/time_zone_manipulation_leading_to_incorrect_logic.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the time zone information associated with `DateTime` objects or provides incorrect time zone IDs. This can lead to incorrect calculations, scheduling errors, or bypasses in time-based access control mechanisms.

**Impact:** Incorrect data processing, unauthorized access to resources based on time, scheduling failures, business logic errors.

**Affected Component:** `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone` and methods that handle time zone conversions and adjustments within `org.joda.time.DateTime`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Be explicit about time zones when creating and manipulating `DateTime` objects.
*   Use `DateTimeZone.UTC` when a specific time zone is not required or when dealing with timestamps that should be time zone agnostic.
*   Validate user-provided time zone IDs against a known list of valid time zones.
*   Avoid relying on the server's default time zone if consistency across environments is critical.
