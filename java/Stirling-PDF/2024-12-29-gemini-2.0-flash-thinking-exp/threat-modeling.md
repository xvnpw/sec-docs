### High and Critical Stirling-PDF Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Stirling-PDF library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious File Upload Leading to Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF or other supported file format that exploits a vulnerability within Stirling-PDF's core processing libraries. This could involve triggering memory corruption issues during file parsing or manipulation, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Stirling-PDF.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core processing libraries used by Stirling-PDF (e.g., PDF parsing library, image rendering library, document conversion tools).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Stirling-PDF updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Run Stirling-PDF in a sandboxed environment or with restricted user privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools on Stirling-PDF's codebase if possible.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal Vulnerability via Filenames
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious filename containing path traversal characters (e.g., `../../evil.sh`) during an operation where Stirling-PDF uses the filename for internal file operations, such as saving output files or accessing temporary files. Stirling-PDF might not properly sanitize or validate these filenames, allowing the attacker to read or write files outside of the intended directories.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files on the server, potential for overwriting critical system files, or executing arbitrary code if the attacker can write to an executable location.
    *   **Affected Component:** File handling logic within Stirling-PDF, specifically functions related to saving or accessing files based on user-provided names.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Stirling-PDF's configuration (if any) related to output paths is securely configured and not user-controllable.
        *   If possible, configure Stirling-PDF to use a fixed output directory and prevent user-controlled filenames for output.

*   **Threat:** Command Injection through Filename or Content Manipulation
    *   **Description:** Stirling-PDF, during certain operations (e.g., using external tools for conversion), might construct and execute shell commands based on filenames or content extracted from the uploaded file. If input sanitization within Stirling-PDF is insufficient, an attacker can inject malicious commands into these strings.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the Stirling-PDF process, leading to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Functions within Stirling-PDF that interact with the operating system by executing external commands or scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   If possible, configure Stirling-PDF to avoid using shell commands based on user-provided input.
        *   If external commands are necessary within Stirling-PDF, ensure they are constructed using parameterized commands or safe APIs that prevent command injection.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Large or Complex Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker uploads extremely large or computationally complex files that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk space) during processing by Stirling-PDF. This can overwhelm the server and lead to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, potential impact on other services running on the same server, and increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core processing modules of Stirling-PDF responsible for handling and manipulating files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure resource limits (e.g., memory limits, CPU quotas) for the Stirling-PDF process.
        *   Implement timeouts for Stirling-PDF operations to prevent indefinite processing.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Stirling-PDF's Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Stirling-PDF relies on various third-party libraries and tools for its functionality. These dependencies might contain known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers *directly targeting Stirling-PDF*.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service *within the context of Stirling-PDF*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Third-party libraries and tools used by Stirling-PDF.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Stirling-PDF to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
        *   Monitor Stirling-PDF's release notes and security advisories for information about dependency vulnerabilities.
