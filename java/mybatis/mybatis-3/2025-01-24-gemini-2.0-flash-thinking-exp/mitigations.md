# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mybatis/mybatis-3

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Parameterized Queries (Placeholders)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_parameterized_queries__placeholders_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all MyBatis mapper files (XML or annotated interfaces).**
    2.  **Review each SQL statement within the mappers.**
    3.  **For any SQL statement that incorporates user-supplied input, ensure you are using `#{}`**, not `${}`.
        *   `#{}` acts as a placeholder. MyBatis will use JDBC PreparedStatement to safely handle the input, escaping special characters.
        *   `${}` performs direct string substitution. Avoid this for user input as it is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    4.  **Replace all instances of `${}` with `#{}` where user input is involved.**
    5.  **Test all affected functionalities to ensure they still work as expected after the change.**
    6.  **Educate developers on the importance of using `#{}` and the dangers of `${}` for user input within MyBatis mappers.**
    7.  **Establish code review processes to enforce the correct usage of placeholders in MyBatis mappers.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code through user input to manipulate the database via MyBatis.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Significantly reduces - Effectively eliminates the most common SQL injection vector in MyBatis applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented in all newly developed modules and data access objects (DAOs) using MyBatis mappers. Developers are trained to use `#{}` by default.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not fully implemented in legacy modules that were developed before the strict enforcement of parameterized queries. Some older mappers might still contain `${}` for user input, requiring a systematic review and update.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits of MyBatis Mappers](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_of_mybatis_mappers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule regular security audits of all MyBatis mapper files (XML and annotated interfaces).**
        *   This should be part of the regular code review process and also conducted periodically by security-focused personnel.
    2.  **During audits, specifically look for:**
        *   Instances of `${}` used with user input within MyBatis mappers.
        *   Complex dynamic SQL constructions in MyBatis mappers that might be prone to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
        *   Areas where input validation might be missing or insufficient in conjunction with the SQL queries defined in MyBatis mappers.
        *   Any SQL statements within MyBatis mappers that seem overly complex or potentially vulnerable.
    3.  **Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools that can analyze MyBatis mappers for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.**
        *   Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan MyBatis mappers on each code commit or build.
    4.  **Document findings from security audits and track remediation efforts related to MyBatis mappers.**
    5.  **Provide security training to developers on MyBatis security best practices and common vulnerabilities specific to MyBatis mapper design.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   SQL Injection (Severity: High) - Proactively identifies and remediates potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in MyBatis mappers before they can be exploited through MyBatis.
    *   Configuration Errors (Severity: Low to Medium) - Can identify misconfigurations or insecure coding practices within MyBatis mappers.

*   **Impact:**
    *   SQL Injection: Significantly reduces - Proactive detection and remediation minimizes the risk of SQL injection via MyBatis.
    *   Configuration Errors: Moderately reduces - Helps identify and fix configuration issues within MyBatis mappers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, code reviews are conducted for all mapper changes.  A basic SAST tool is integrated into the CI pipeline, but its MyBatis-specific SQL injection detection capabilities are limited.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More comprehensive SAST tools specifically designed for MyBatis and SQL injection detection in mappers should be evaluated and implemented.  Security audits are not yet conducted on a regular, scheduled basis by dedicated security personnel focusing on MyBatis mapper security; this needs to be formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable External Entity Processing in XML Parsers (If Using XML Configuration for MyBatis)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_external_entity_processing_in_xml_parsers__if_using_xml_configuration_for_mybatis_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify the XML parser being used by MyBatis to process its configuration files (mybatis-config.xml) and mapper XML files.** (Typically Java's built-in XML parsers if using XML configuration in Java).
    2.  **Configure the XML parser to disable the processing of external entities and DTDs when parsing MyBatis XML configuration files.**
        *   **For Java's `DocumentBuilderFactory` (used for DOM parsing):**
            ```java
            DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
            factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true); // Disallow DOCTYPE declarations
            factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false); // Disable external general entities
            factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false); // Disable external parameter entities
            factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false); // Disable external DTD loading
            ```
        *   **For Java's `SAXParserFactory` (used for SAX parsing):**
            ```java
            SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
            factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
            factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
            factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
            factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
            ```
    3.  **Apply these configurations when creating `DocumentBuilderFactory` or `SAXParserFactory` instances specifically used for parsing MyBatis configuration or mapper files.**
    4.  **Test the application to ensure MyBatis XML parsing still works correctly after disabling external entity processing.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from exploiting XXE vulnerabilities through MyBatis XML configuration files to read local files, perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), or cause denial-of-service (DoS).

*   **Impact:**
    *   XXE Injection: Significantly reduces - Effectively eliminates XXE vulnerabilities related to MyBatis XML configuration and mapper files.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, the XML parser factories used for MyBatis configuration parsing are configured to disable external entity processing in the application's core initialization logic.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure that *only* the XML parsers used for MyBatis configuration are configured this way. Verify that other XML parsing in the application (if any) is also securely configured, although this mitigation is primarily focused on MyBatis XML processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Coding Practices in Custom Handlers (MyBatis Type and Result Handlers)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_coding_practices_in_custom_handlers__mybatis_type_and_result_handlers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review all custom type handlers and result handlers implemented for MyBatis in the application.**
    2.  **Identify any MyBatis handlers that involve deserialization of data.**
    3.  **For each MyBatis handler involving deserialization, analyze the source of the data being deserialized.**
        *   If the data originates from untrusted sources (e.g., data retrieved from the database that might have been tampered with, though less likely in typical MyBatis usage, or external systems if handlers interact with them), carefully examine the deserialization process for potential vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Implement secure coding practices in custom MyBatis handlers:**
        *   **Avoid deserializing untrusted data directly within MyBatis handlers if possible.**
        *   **If deserialization is necessary in MyBatis handlers, validate and sanitize the data *before* deserialization.**
        *   **Use safe deserialization methods and libraries that are less prone to vulnerabilities within MyBatis handlers.** Consider using JSON or Protocol Buffers instead of Java serialization if applicable.
        *   **Implement input validation on the deserialized objects within MyBatis handlers to ensure they conform to expected structures and values.**
    5.  **Conduct security code reviews of custom MyBatis handlers to identify potential deserialization vulnerabilities.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities within custom MyBatis type or result handlers to execute arbitrary code, cause denial-of-service, or gain unauthorized access through MyBatis.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Deserialization Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces - Mitigates risks associated with insecure deserialization in custom MyBatis handlers.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Custom MyBatis handlers are generally reviewed during code reviews, but specific focus on deserialization security in handlers is not yet a formal part of the review process.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalize security code review guidelines for custom MyBatis handlers, specifically addressing deserialization risks.  Implement static analysis tools that can detect potential deserialization vulnerabilities in custom MyBatis handlers.  Consider migrating away from Java serialization in custom MyBatis handlers if alternatives like JSON or Protocol Buffers are feasible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure MyBatis Configuration (mybatis-config.xml or Programmatic Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_mybatis_configuration__mybatis-config_xml_or_programmatic_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review the `mybatis-config.xml` file (or programmatic configuration) specifically for MyBatis security-related settings.**
    2.  **Ensure sensitive information is not hardcoded in the MyBatis configuration file.**
        *   Database credentials used by MyBatis should be externalized and managed securely (e.g., using environment variables, configuration management tools, or secrets management systems).
    3.  **Restrict access to the MyBatis configuration file to authorized personnel only.**
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions are set to prevent unauthorized modification or access to the MyBatis configuration.
    4.  **Avoid overly permissive MyBatis configurations that might expose unnecessary functionalities or information.**
        *   Review MyBatis settings related to logging, caching, and other features to ensure they are configured securely in the context of MyBatis.
    5.  **Regularly audit the MyBatis configuration to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations or security weaknesses specific to MyBatis.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium) - Prevents exposure of sensitive MyBatis configuration data like database credentials used by MyBatis.
    *   Unauthorized Access (Severity: Medium) - Restricting access to MyBatis configuration files prevents unauthorized modifications that could compromise MyBatis security.
    *   Configuration Errors (Severity: Low to Medium) - Regular audits help identify and correct MyBatis misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Significantly reduces - Prevents hardcoded MyBatis credentials and sensitive data exposure in MyBatis configuration.
    *   Unauthorized Access: Moderately reduces - Limits unauthorized modification of MyBatis configuration.
    *   Configuration Errors: Moderately reduces - Proactive identification and correction of MyBatis configuration issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, database credentials for MyBatis are externalized using environment variables. Access to MyBatis configuration files is restricted through standard file system permissions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal, documented security review checklist specifically for MyBatis configuration is needed to ensure all MyBatis security-relevant settings are regularly audited.  Consider using configuration management tools to enforce secure MyBatis configuration settings automatically.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging Configuration (Related to MyBatis Logging)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_configuration__related_to_mybatis_logging_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review the logging configuration used by MyBatis and the application, specifically focusing on MyBatis-related logging.**
    2.  **Identify and remove any logging of sensitive data that might be logged by MyBatis or related components.**
        *   **Never log passwords, API keys, personally identifiable information (PII), or other confidential data in plain text, including data potentially logged by MyBatis.**
        *   Mask or redact sensitive data in MyBatis logs if logging is absolutely necessary for debugging purposes.
    3.  **Configure MyBatis logging levels appropriately.**
        *   Avoid overly verbose MyBatis logging in production environments, as it can generate large log files and potentially expose more information than necessary from MyBatis operations.
        *   Use appropriate MyBatis logging levels (e.g., `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to capture relevant MyBatis events without excessive detail.
    4.  **Ensure log files, including MyBatis logs, are stored securely and access is restricted to authorized personnel.**
        *   Use appropriate file system permissions and access control mechanisms to protect log files containing MyBatis logs.
    5.  **Consider using structured logging and security information and event management (SIEM) systems for MyBatis logs.**
        *   Structured logging makes MyBatis logs easier to parse and analyze for security events related to MyBatis.
        *   SIEM systems can aggregate MyBatis logs with other logs, detect security threats, and trigger alerts based on MyBatis activity.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive data through MyBatis log files.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Logs (Severity: Medium) - Restricting access to MyBatis logs prevents unauthorized viewing of potentially sensitive information logged by MyBatis.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Significantly reduces - Prevents logging of sensitive data by MyBatis.
    *   Unauthorized Access to Logs: Moderately reduces - Limits access to MyBatis log files.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, logging is configured to avoid logging passwords and sensitive data, including in MyBatis logs. Log files are stored on secure servers with restricted access.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   PII is not consistently masked or redacted in all logs, including MyBatis logs. A review is needed to identify and implement masking/redaction for PII in MyBatis logging.  Structured logging and integration with a SIEM system for MyBatis logs are not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep MyBatis and Dependencies Updated (MyBatis Library Updates)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_mybatis_and_dependencies_updated__mybatis_library_updates_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a process for regularly checking for updates to MyBatis-3 and its direct dependencies.**
        *   Monitor MyBatis release notes and security advisories specifically for MyBatis-3.
        *   Use dependency management tools (Maven, Gradle, etc.) to track MyBatis-3 and its direct dependency versions and identify available updates.
    2.  **Regularly update MyBatis-3 and its direct dependencies to the latest stable versions.**
        *   Prioritize security updates and patches for MyBatis-3 and its dependencies.
        *   Test updates thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying to production, ensuring MyBatis functionality remains intact.
    3.  **Automate the MyBatis and dependency update process as much as possible.**
        *   Use dependency management tools and CI/CD pipelines to streamline MyBatis updates.
    4.  **Subscribe to security vulnerability databases and notification services to receive alerts about vulnerabilities specifically in MyBatis and its direct dependencies.**

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of MyBatis-3 or its direct dependencies.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: Significantly reduces - Addresses known vulnerabilities in MyBatis by applying patches and updates.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, dependency management tools (Maven) are used.  Developers are generally aware of the need to update MyBatis and dependencies, but the process is not fully automated or consistently enforced specifically for MyBatis updates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automate MyBatis and dependency updates as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Implement vulnerability scanning specifically focused on MyBatis and its dependencies.  Establish a formal policy and schedule for regular MyBatis and dependency updates, especially security updates.
