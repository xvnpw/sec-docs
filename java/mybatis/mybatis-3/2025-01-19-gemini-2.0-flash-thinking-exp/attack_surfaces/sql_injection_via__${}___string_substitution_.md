**4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: SQL Injection via `${}`**

**4.1. Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the way MyBatis-3 handles the `${}` syntax within its mapper files. Unlike the `#{} `syntax, which utilizes prepared statements and parameter binding, `${}` performs direct string substitution. This means that whatever string is placed within the `${}` will be directly inserted into the SQL query *without any escaping or sanitization*.

*   **`#{}` (Parameter Binding):** When using `#{}`, MyBatis treats the value as a parameter. It sends the SQL query structure and the parameter values separately to the database. The database driver then handles the proper escaping and quoting of the parameter value, preventing it from being interpreted as SQL code. This is the **secure and recommended approach** for handling user-provided input.

*   **`${}` (String Substitution):**  With `${}`, MyBatis simply replaces the placeholder with the provided string *before* sending the query to the database. This makes the application directly vulnerable to SQL injection if the string originates from an untrusted source, such as user input.

**4.2. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through various input channels where user-controlled data is used within `${}`. Common scenarios include:

*   **Web Forms:**  Input fields in web forms (e.g., search bars, login forms) are prime targets. An attacker can craft malicious SQL within these fields.
*   **API Parameters:**  If API endpoints accept parameters that are directly used in `${}` within MyBatis queries, attackers can inject SQL through API requests.
*   **URL Parameters:**  Similar to API parameters, data passed through URL parameters can be exploited if used with `${}`.
*   **Indirect Input:**  Data stored in databases or other systems that is later retrieved and used within `${}` without proper sanitization can also be a source of injection.

**Example Attack Scenario (Expanding on the provided example):**

Consider the provided example:

```xml
<select id="getUserByName" resultType="User">
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'
</select>
```

If the `username` parameter is derived directly from a web form input, an attacker could provide the following input:

*   `' OR '1'='1`

This would result in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
```

Since `'1'='1'` is always true, this query would return all users in the `users` table, effectively bypassing authentication or revealing sensitive data.

More sophisticated attacks could involve:

*   **Data Modification:** Injecting `'; DELETE FROM users; --` to delete all users.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In environments where the database user has sufficient privileges, attackers could execute commands to grant themselves administrative access.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Using `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from other tables or databases.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Database Dependent):** Some database systems allow the execution of operating system commands through SQL.

**4.3. Impact Assessment:**

The impact of successful SQL injection via `${}` can be severe and far-reaching:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, financial records, and proprietary business data. This can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:**  Attackers can insert, update, or delete data, leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, and disruption of business operations.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  As demonstrated in the example, attackers can bypass login mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to the application and its functionalities.
*   **Account Takeover:**  By manipulating user data or bypassing authentication, attackers can take control of legitimate user accounts.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers might be able to execute queries that consume excessive resources, leading to application downtime and unavailability.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In certain database environments, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server, leading to complete system compromise. This is a critical risk and should be a major concern.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Reinforcement and Expansion):**

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial and should be strictly enforced:

*   **Always Use `#{}`, Not `${}` for User-Provided Input:** This is the **primary and most effective mitigation**. By using `#{}`, you leverage prepared statements, which prevent the interpretation of user input as executable SQL code. This practice should be a mandatory coding standard.

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (If `${}` is Absolutely Necessary):**  If there's an unavoidable need to use `${}` (e.g., for dynamic table or column names, which should be rare), rigorous input validation and sanitization are essential. This involves:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Allowing only explicitly permitted characters or patterns. For example, if a table name is expected, validate that the input matches a predefined list of valid table names.
    *   **Escaping:**  Manually escaping special characters that could be used in SQL injection attacks. However, this is error-prone and should be avoided if possible.
    *   **Regular Expression Matching:**  Using regular expressions to ensure the input conforms to the expected format.
    *   **Contextual Encoding:** Encoding data based on the context where it will be used.

**Important Considerations for Mitigation:**

*   **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews to identify and rectify instances of improper `${}` usage.
*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Utilize SAST tools to automatically scan the codebase for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities related to `${}`.
*   **Developer Training:**  Educate developers on the dangers of SQL injection and the proper use of MyBatis syntax, emphasizing the importance of `#{} `for user input.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user used by the application has only the necessary permissions to perform its functions. This can limit the damage an attacker can inflict even if SQL injection is successful.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application. While not a primary defense against this specific MyBatis issue, it provides an additional layer of security.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.

**5. Conclusion and Recommendations:**

The misuse of the `${}` syntax in MyBatis-3 presents a critical SQL injection vulnerability with potentially severe consequences. The development team must prioritize the elimination of this attack surface by adhering to secure coding practices.

**Key Recommendations:**

*   **Establish a strict policy against using `${}` for user-provided input.**  The default and preferred approach should always be `#{} `.
*   **Conduct a thorough audit of the codebase to identify and replace all instances of `${}` that handle user input.**
*   **Implement mandatory code reviews with a focus on identifying potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.**
*   **Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect insecure usage of `${}`.**
*   **Provide comprehensive security training to developers on SQL injection prevention and secure MyBatis usage.**
*   **Maintain a strong security posture by implementing defense-in-depth strategies, including input validation, least privilege, and regular security assessments.**

By understanding the mechanics of this vulnerability and diligently implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection and protect the application and its data from potential attacks. The criticality of this issue cannot be overstated, and immediate action is required to address this significant security concern.
