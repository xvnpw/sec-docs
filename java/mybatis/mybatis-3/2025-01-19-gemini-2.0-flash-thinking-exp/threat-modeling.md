# Threat Model Analysis for mybatis/mybatis-3

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Unsafe `${}` Substitution](./threats/sql_injection_via_unsafe__${}__substitution.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into user-provided input that is directly substituted into an SQL query using the `${}` syntax in MyBatis mapper files. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database. They might attempt to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute database administration commands.

**Impact:** Critical. Could lead to complete compromise of the database, including data breaches, data corruption, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.ibatis.scripting.xmltags.TextSqlNode` (processing of `${}` placeholders in mapper XML).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strongly prefer using parameterized queries with `#{}`, which automatically handles escaping.**
*   If `${}` is absolutely necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on the server-side.
*   Use allow-lists for permitted characters or patterns in user input intended for `${}`.
*   Consider using MyBatis's built-in escaping mechanisms if applicable and unavoidable.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Malicious Input in `<bind>` Element Expressions](./threats/sql_injection_via_malicious_input_in__bind__element_expressions.md)

**Description:** An attacker can craft malicious input that, when used within the expression of a `<bind>` element in a MyBatis mapper, results in the execution of unintended SQL code. This occurs when the expression concatenates user input without proper sanitization. The attacker's goal is similar to the previous threat: to manipulate the SQL query for malicious purposes.

**Impact:** Critical. Similar to direct `${}` injection, this can lead to full database compromise.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.ibatis.scripting.xmltags.BindNode` (processing of `<bind>` elements in mapper XML).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Treat values used within `<bind>` expressions with the same caution as `${}`.
*   Sanitize or validate user input before incorporating it into `<bind>` expressions.
*   Avoid constructing SQL fragments directly within `<bind>` using user input.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Verbose MyBatis Logging](./threats/data_exposure_through_verbose_mybatis_logging.md)

**Description:** If MyBatis logging is configured at a verbose level (e.g., logging SQL statements with parameter values), sensitive data passed as parameters in SQL queries might be exposed in the logs. An attacker gaining access to these logs could retrieve confidential information like passwords, API keys, or personal data.

**Impact:** High. Potential for significant data breaches and privacy violations.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.ibatis.logging` (MyBatis logging framework).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure MyBatis logging to an appropriate level for production environments, avoiding the logging of sensitive data.
*   Secure access to log files, ensuring only authorized personnel can view them.
*   Consider using parameterized queries, as logs often show the query structure and parameters separately, making it harder to extract sensitive information directly.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in MyBatis Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_mybatis_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Storing database credentials directly within MyBatis configuration files (e.g., `mybatis-config.xml`) or mapper files makes them vulnerable if these files are accessed by an attacker. This could happen through various means, such as unauthorized access to the server or a code repository leak.

**Impact:** Critical. Direct access to the database allows attackers to perform any operation, leading to complete compromise.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.ibatis.datasource` (MyBatis data source configuration).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never store database credentials directly in configuration files.**
*   Use environment variables to store and access database credentials.
*   Utilize secure configuration management tools or secrets management systems.
*   Consider using JNDI lookups for data sources.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of External Resource Loading](./threats/insecure_handling_of_external_resource_loading.md)

**Description:** MyBatis allows loading external resources (like mapper files) via URLs. If not handled carefully, an attacker might be able to manipulate the configuration to load malicious resources from an untrusted source, potentially leading to code execution or other vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** High. Could lead to remote code execution or other forms of application compromise.

**Affected Component:** `org.apache.ibatis.builder.xml.XMLConfigBuilder` and `org.apache.ibatis.builder.xml.XMLMapperBuilder` (components responsible for parsing configuration and mapper files).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict the locations from which MyBatis can load external resources.
*   Avoid dynamic or user-controlled paths for resource loading.
*   Prefer loading resources from the classpath.
