#### 4.1. Understanding the Attack Surface: Custom Components in MyBatis

MyBatis is a powerful framework that allows developers to map SQL queries to Java methods. To extend its functionality and adapt it to specific application needs, MyBatis provides extension points through **Type Handlers** and **Plugins**.

*   **Type Handlers:**  Responsible for converting between Java data types and JDBC types. MyBatis provides default Type Handlers for common types, but developers can create custom Type Handlers to handle specific data types or complex conversions. These custom handlers are invoked by MyBatis when setting parameters in prepared statements and retrieving results from result sets.
*   **Plugins (Interceptors):**  Allow developers to intercept and modify the execution of MyBatis framework methods. Plugins can intercept calls to `Executor`, `StatementHandler`, `ParameterHandler`, and `ResultSetHandler`. This provides a powerful mechanism to add custom logic, such as logging, performance monitoring, or security checks, at various stages of MyBatis execution.

Both Type Handlers and Plugins are custom code components developed by application developers. If these components are designed to handle data from external or untrusted sources and involve deserialization, they become potential entry points for deserialization vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2. Deserialization Vulnerability Deep Dive

Deserialization vulnerabilities arise when an application deserializes data from an untrusted source without proper validation and security measures.  **Java serialization**, a common mechanism for converting Java objects to a byte stream and vice versa, is particularly prone to these vulnerabilities.

**How it works in the context of custom components:**

1.  **Vulnerable Custom Component:** A custom Type Handler or Plugin is designed to process data that might be serialized. For example:
    *   A Type Handler might retrieve binary data from a database column intended to store serialized Java objects.
    *   A Plugin might receive serialized data as part of an external request or configuration.
2.  **Untrusted Data Source:** The data source from which the custom component receives serialized data is considered untrusted. This could be a database controlled by potentially malicious actors, external APIs, or even configuration files if they can be manipulated.
3.  **Deserialization Process:** The custom component uses a deserialization mechanism (e.g., `ObjectInputStream` in Java serialization) to convert the byte stream back into Java objects.
4.  **Malicious Payload:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized object. This object, when deserialized, is designed to execute arbitrary code on the server. This is often achieved by leveraging known "gadget chains" in commonly used Java libraries that are present in the application's classpath.
5.  **Code Execution:** When the vulnerable custom component deserializes the malicious object, the gadget chain is triggered, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled code on the server.

**Why Java Serialization is Risky:**

*   **Powerful but Insecure by Default:** Java serialization is a powerful feature but was not designed with security as a primary concern. It allows for the reconstruction of complex object graphs, including their state and behavior.
*   **Gadget Chains:**  Numerous publicly known "gadget chains" exist in popular Java libraries (like Apache Commons Collections, Spring, etc.). These chains are sequences of method calls that, when triggered during deserialization, can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Complexity of Secure Deserialization:**  Securing Java deserialization is complex and requires careful consideration of object filtering, whitelisting, and potentially using alternative serialization mechanisms.

#### 4.3. Attack Vectors in MyBatis Applications

In the context of MyBatis applications with custom Type Handlers and Plugins, potential attack vectors for injecting malicious serialized data include:

*   **Database Injection:** If a custom Type Handler retrieves data from a database column and deserializes it, an attacker who can control the database content can inject malicious serialized objects into that column. This is a significant risk if the application interacts with databases that are not fully trusted or if there are vulnerabilities in database access controls.
*   **External Data Sources:** If a custom Plugin or Type Handler processes data from external APIs or services, and this data is serialized, an attacker who can compromise or manipulate these external sources can inject malicious payloads.
*   **Configuration Files (Less Common but Possible):** In some scenarios, configuration files used by MyBatis or custom components might contain serialized data. If these configuration files are not properly secured and can be modified by attackers, they could be used to inject malicious payloads.
*   **Application Input (Indirect):** While less direct for Type Handlers and Plugins, application input that eventually influences data processed by these components (e.g., user input leading to database updates) could indirectly lead to the injection of malicious serialized data.

#### 4.4. Impact and Severity

The impact of successful deserialization vulnerabilities in custom MyBatis components is **Critical**. The primary consequence is **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.

**Consequences of RCE:**

*   **Full System Compromise:**  Successful RCE allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the MyBatis application. This can lead to complete control over the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of system configurations, and installation of malware.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database or processed by the application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can disrupt the application's availability by crashing the server or consuming resources.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised servers can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.

Due to the potential for immediate and severe impact, deserialization vulnerabilities are consistently ranked as high-severity security risks. In the context of custom MyBatis components, this risk remains critical if developers are not aware of and do not implement proper mitigation strategies.

#### 4.5. Detailed Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate deserialization vulnerabilities in custom MyBatis Type Handlers and Plugins, developers should implement the following strategies:

1.  **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Best Practice):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Deserialization:** The most secure approach is to **completely avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources** within custom Type Handlers and Plugins whenever possible.
    *   **Re-evaluate Data Handling:**  Carefully review the design of custom components. Question whether deserialization is truly necessary. Can the data be handled in a different format that does not involve deserialization, such as plain text, JSON, or other safer serialization formats?
    *   **Alternative Data Formats:** If data needs to be stored or transmitted in a structured format, prefer using secure and less vulnerable formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers. These formats are generally safer because they do not inherently allow for arbitrary code execution during parsing.

2.  **Use Secure Deserialization Practices (If Deserialization is Unavoidable):**
    *   **Prefer Safe Serialization Formats:** If serialization is absolutely necessary, **avoid Java serialization**. Opt for safer alternatives like JSON, Protocol Buffers, or other formats that are designed with security in mind and do not have the same inherent RCE risks as Java serialization.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If Java serialization must be used, implement **strict input validation and sanitization** on the data before deserialization. However, relying solely on input validation for Java deserialization is generally considered insufficient due to the complexity of gadget chains.
    *   **Object Filtering and Whitelisting:** Implement **object filtering or whitelisting** during deserialization. This involves creating a list of allowed classes that can be deserialized and rejecting any objects that do not belong to this whitelist. This can significantly reduce the attack surface by preventing the deserialization of malicious gadget chain classes. Libraries like **`SerialKiller`** or **`SafeObjectInputStream`** can assist with this.
    *   **Minimize Deserialization Scope:**  Limit the scope of deserialization to only the necessary data. Avoid deserializing entire complex object graphs if only a small portion of the data is needed.
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep all Java libraries and dependencies up to date. Vulnerabilities in serialization libraries or gadget chain libraries are often discovered and patched. Regular updates are crucial to benefit from these security fixes.

3.  **Code Review and Security Audits:**
    *   **Dedicated Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews specifically focused on identifying potential deserialization vulnerabilities in custom Type Handlers and Plugins. Involve security experts in these reviews.
    *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan code for potential deserialization flaws. Consider dynamic analysis security testing (DAST) to test the application in a runtime environment and identify vulnerabilities that might not be apparent in static analysis.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Include deserialization vulnerability testing as part of regular penetration testing exercises for the MyBatis application.

4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Restrict Application Permissions:** Run the MyBatis application process with the **minimum necessary privileges**. If the application is compromised through a deserialization vulnerability, limiting its privileges can reduce the potential damage an attacker can inflict. Avoid running the application as root or with overly broad permissions.
    *   **Database Access Control:** Implement strict access control to the databases used by the MyBatis application. Limit the permissions of database users used by the application to only what is necessary for its functionality. This can help mitigate the impact of database injection attacks.

#### 4.6. Developer Security Checklist for Custom MyBatis Components

When developing custom Type Handlers and Plugins for MyBatis, developers should adhere to the following security checklist to minimize deserialization risks:

*   **[ ] Question the Need for Deserialization:**  Before implementing deserialization, critically evaluate if it is truly necessary. Explore alternative data handling approaches that avoid deserialization.
*   **[ ] Avoid Java Serialization if Possible:**  If serialization is required, strongly prefer safer formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers over Java serialization.
*   **[ ] If Java Serialization is Unavoidable:**
    *   **[ ] Implement Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize data before deserialization, although this is not a foolproof solution for Java deserialization.
    *   **[ ] Implement Object Filtering/Whitelisting:** Use libraries like `SerialKiller` or `SafeObjectInputStream` to whitelist allowed classes for deserialization.
    *   **[ ] Minimize Deserialization Scope:** Only deserialize the necessary data, avoiding complex object graphs if possible.
*   **[ ] Conduct Thorough Code Reviews:**  Specifically review custom components for potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **[ ] Utilize Security Testing Tools:** Employ SAST and DAST tools to identify potential deserialization flaws.
*   **[ ] Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep all Java libraries and dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **[ ] Apply Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal necessary privileges and restrict database access.

By following these guidelines and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities in their MyBatis applications and protect against potential Remote Code Execution attacks.
