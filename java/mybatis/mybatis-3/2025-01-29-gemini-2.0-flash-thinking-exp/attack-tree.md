## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application inputs that are processed by MyBatis and executed against the database.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** This is the overarching category of high-risk attacks.
    *   **Unparameterized Queries [CRITICAL]:** The root cause of many SQL injection vulnerabilities in MyBatis applications.
    *   **Directly Inject SQL via String Concatenation [CRITICAL]:** The most basic and common form of SQL injection, occurring when user input is directly concatenated into SQL strings.
    *   **Vulnerable Dynamic SQL Construction [CRITICAL]:** SQL injection arising from flaws in how dynamic SQL is built using MyBatis's `<if>`, `<choose>`, etc. tags.
    *   **Improper Use of `${}` (Substitution) Instead of `#{}` (Parameterization) [CRITICAL]:** Using `${}` for user inputs instead of `#{}` bypasses prepared statements and leads to direct SQL injection.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Data Breach, Data Manipulation, Privilege Escalation, Code Execution on the database server.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries (`#{}`):** This is the primary defense.
    *   **Avoid string concatenation for SQL construction.**
    *   **Carefully review and test dynamic SQL queries.**
    *   **Educate developers on the difference between `#{}` and `${}` and enforce correct usage.**
    *   **Implement input validation as a defense-in-depth measure.**
    *   **Use least privilege database accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XML Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xml_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsing of MyBatis configuration files (`mybatis-config.xml`, mapper XMLs), specifically XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Exploit XML Configuration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** The category of attacks targeting XML processing in MyBatis configuration.
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in MyBatis Configuration Files [CRITICAL]:** The specific vulnerability where attackers inject malicious XML to exploit insecure XML parsing.
    *   **External Entity Declaration in `mybatis-config.xml` [CRITICAL]:** XXE attacks targeting the main MyBatis configuration file.
    *   **External Entity Declaration in Mapper XML Files [CRITICAL]:** XXE attacks targeting mapper XML files.
*   **Impact:** High - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Local File Disclosure, Denial of Service.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Disable external entity processing in the XML parser used by MyBatis.** This is the most effective mitigation.
    *   **Securely configure the XML parser (e.g., using `setFeature` in Java XML parsers).**
    *   **Regularly review configuration files for suspicious external entity declarations.**
    *   **Restrict access to configuration files to prevent unauthorized modification.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MyBatis Configuration Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mybatis_configuration_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit insecure configurations of MyBatis, leading to information disclosure or unauthorized access.
*   **High-Risk Paths:**
    *   **Verbose Logging Exposing Sensitive Information:**
        *   **Logging SQL Queries with Sensitive Data:**  Overly verbose logging in production can expose sensitive data in log files.
    *   **Insecure Database Connection Configuration [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files [CRITICAL]:** Storing database credentials directly in configuration files makes them vulnerable to theft.
*   **Critical Nodes:**
    *   **Insecure Database Connection Configuration [CRITICAL]:**  A critical misconfiguration leading to potential database compromise.
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files [CRITICAL]:** A severe security flaw in configuration management.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Verbose Logging:** Medium - Information Disclosure (Credentials, PII, Business Logic).
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:** High - Credential Theft, Unauthorized Database Access.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Configure logging levels appropriately for production (less verbose).**
    *   **Sanitize sensitive data in logs if verbose logging is necessary.**
    *   **Securely store and access log files.**
    *   **Externalize database credentials using environment variables or secrets management systems.**
    *   **Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in configuration files.**
    *   **Securely store and manage configuration files.**

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in MyBatis Dependencies (Indirect)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_mybatis_dependencies__indirect_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries that MyBatis depends on (e.g., XML parsers, logging libraries).
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Vulnerable Libraries Used by MyBatis (e.g., XML Parsers, Logging Libraries):**
        *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**  Leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities in MyBatis's dependencies.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability - potentially Critical (RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Regularly update MyBatis and all its dependencies to the latest versions.**
    *   **Implement dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.**
    *   **Monitor security advisories for MyBatis and its dependencies to stay informed about new vulnerabilities and updates.**
