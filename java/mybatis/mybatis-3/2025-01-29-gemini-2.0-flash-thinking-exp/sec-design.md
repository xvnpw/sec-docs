# BUSINESS POSTURE

The MyBatis project is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java. It simplifies the process of interacting with databases by mapping Java objects to database records.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a flexible and powerful ORM solution for Java developers.
  - Offer fine-grained control over SQL queries compared to full ORM frameworks.
  - Support a wide range of databases.
  - Maintain high performance and efficiency in database interactions.
  - Foster a strong community and provide comprehensive documentation.

- Most important business risks:
  - Data breaches due to SQL injection vulnerabilities if MyBatis is misused or misconfigured.
  - Performance bottlenecks if queries are not optimized or MyBatis is not configured correctly.
  - Compatibility issues with new database versions or Java environments.
  - Security vulnerabilities in MyBatis core library itself that could be exploited by attackers.
  - Lack of adoption or community support leading to project stagnation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Reliance on JDBC drivers for database connection security. JDBC drivers are expected to handle secure connections to databases (e.g., TLS/SSL). (Implemented in: JDBC driver configuration within MyBatis configuration files)
  - security control: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. MyBatis encourages and facilitates the use of parameterized queries. (Implemented in: MyBatis framework design and documentation)
  - security control: Input validation is expected to be handled by the application code using MyBatis, not directly by MyBatis itself. (Implemented in: Application code using MyBatis)
  - security control: Dependency management using Maven or Gradle, allowing for dependency vulnerability scanning at the application level. (Implemented in: Project build files - pom.xml or build.gradle)
  - security control: Open source nature allows for community review and vulnerability reporting. (Implemented in: GitHub repository and open development model)

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration by developers leading to insecure database connections or SQL injection vulnerabilities if parameterized queries are not used correctly.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in underlying JDBC drivers or database systems.
  - accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in MyBatis library itself that might be discovered and need patching.
  - accepted risk: Lack of comprehensive security audits of the MyBatis codebase.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Provide clear and prominent security guidelines in documentation, emphasizing secure coding practices with MyBatis, especially around SQL injection prevention and secure database connection configurations.
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST and dependency scanning) in the MyBatis CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the codebase and dependencies.
  - security control: Offer security-focused configuration examples and best practices for common use cases.
  - security control: Encourage community security audits and vulnerability reporting through a clear security policy.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: MyBatis itself does not handle user authentication. Authentication is delegated to the underlying database system.
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage database credentials used by MyBatis. Configuration should support secure credential management practices (e.g., environment variables, secrets management).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: MyBatis relies on the database's authorization mechanisms. Authorization is managed through database user permissions and roles.
    - Requirement: Application developers should design database schemas and user permissions to enforce proper authorization controls.
  - Input validation:
    - Requirement: MyBatis strongly encourages the use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This is the primary input validation mechanism.
    - Requirement: Application developers are responsible for validating other inputs outside of SQL queries that might affect application logic or security.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: MyBatis itself does not provide built-in cryptography features.
    - Requirement: If data encryption is required, it should be handled either by the database system itself (e.g., transparent data encryption) or by the application code before data is passed to MyBatis for database interaction. MyBatis should not hinder the use of cryptography at the application or database level.
    - Requirement: Secure communication to the database should be ensured using TLS/SSL, configured through the JDBC driver.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process we are trying to protect:
  - Secure and reliable data access for Java applications using MyBatis.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the MyBatis library itself as a widely used open-source component.

- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - The data being protected is the application data stored in databases that MyBatis interacts with.
  - Sensitivity of data depends on the specific application using MyBatis. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data.
  - MyBatis itself does not store application data, but facilitates access to it. Therefore, the security of MyBatis directly impacts the security of the data accessed through it.
  - Protecting against unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data through vulnerabilities in applications using MyBatis or in MyBatis itself is crucial.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA) for applications that will use MyBatis? This will influence the required security controls.
  - What is the risk appetite of organizations using MyBatis? This will determine the level of security investment and rigor required.
  - Are there specific security features or integrations that are highly desired by the MyBatis community?
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in MyBatis? Is there a security policy or dedicated security team?

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - MyBatis is primarily used in enterprise Java applications where data security and integrity are important.
    - Performance and ease of use are key drivers for MyBatis adoption.
    - The MyBatis project aims to be a reliable and trustworthy component for data access.
  - SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Security is a concern for MyBatis users, especially regarding SQL injection and data breaches.
    - Users expect MyBatis to provide guidance and mechanisms for secure data access.
    - Security vulnerabilities in MyBatis itself need to be addressed promptly and effectively.
  - DESIGN:
    - MyBatis is designed to be a flexible and non-intrusive ORM framework.
    - It relies on standard Java and database security practices.
    - Deployment scenarios are varied, but containerized cloud deployments are increasingly common.
    - Build process is automated and includes basic security checks.
