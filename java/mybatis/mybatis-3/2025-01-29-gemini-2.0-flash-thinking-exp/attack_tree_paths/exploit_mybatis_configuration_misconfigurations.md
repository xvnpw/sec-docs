### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files

#### 2.1 Vulnerability Description: Hardcoded Credentials in Configuration Files

This vulnerability arises when developers directly embed sensitive database credentials (usernames, passwords, connection strings) within MyBatis configuration files. These files are often stored in version control systems, deployed with the application, and may be accessible through various means, making the hardcoded credentials easily discoverable by attackers.

**Why is this a vulnerability?**

*   **Exposure in Version Control:** Configuration files are frequently committed to version control systems (like Git). If credentials are hardcoded, they become part of the repository history, potentially accessible to anyone with access to the repository, including past employees or compromised accounts.
*   **Exposure in Deployment Artifacts:**  Configuration files are typically packaged with the application during deployment (e.g., in JAR/WAR files). Attackers gaining access to these deployment artifacts can easily extract the configuration files and retrieve the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Exposure on Servers:**  Even if not in version control or deployment artifacts, configuration files reside on application servers. If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the server (e.g., through web server vulnerabilities, SSH compromise, or insider threats), they can read these files and obtain the credentials.
*   **Static and Predictable:** Hardcoded credentials are static and predictable. Once compromised, they remain valid until manually changed, giving attackers a persistent access window.
*   **Scalability Issue:**  Managing and rotating hardcoded credentials across multiple environments (development, staging, production) becomes extremely complex and error-prone.

#### 2.2 Attack Vector Analysis

**Attack Scenario:**

1.  **Reconnaissance and Access:** An attacker aims to gain access to the application's configuration files. This can be achieved through various means:
    *   **Version Control System Breach:** Compromising the organization's version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or gaining unauthorized access to a repository containing the MyBatis configuration files.
    *   **Deployment Artifact Access:**  Gaining access to deployment artifacts (JAR/WAR files) through insecure storage, compromised build servers, or intercepted network traffic.
    *   **Server Compromise:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application server, web server, or operating system to gain unauthorized access to the server's file system where configuration files are stored.
    *   **Insider Threat:**  Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access to systems or repositories can intentionally or unintentionally expose the configuration files.

2.  **Credential Extraction:** Once access to configuration files is obtained, the attacker searches for database connection configuration sections within MyBatis configuration files (e.g., `mybatis-config.xml`, mapper files). They look for tags and attributes commonly used to define database connections, such as:
    *   `<dataSource>` tag in `mybatis-config.xml`
    *   `url`, `username`, `password` attributes within `<dataSource>`
    *   Connection string properties directly within the configuration.

    Attackers can use simple text searching tools or scripts to quickly identify these patterns and extract the hardcoded credentials.

3.  **Database Access and Exploitation:** With the extracted database credentials, the attacker can now attempt to connect directly to the database server.  Successful connection grants them unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to:
    *   **Data Breach:**  Exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database, including customer information, financial records, intellectual property, and more.
    *   **Data Manipulation:**  Modify, delete, or corrupt data within the database, potentially leading to data integrity issues, business disruption, and reputational damage.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  If the compromised database user has elevated privileges, the attacker might be able to escalate their privileges within the database system or even gain access to the underlying operating system.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overload the database server with malicious queries or operations, leading to performance degradation or service outages.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Use the compromised database as a pivot point to access other systems and resources within the network.

#### 2.3 Technical Deep Dive: MyBatis Configuration and Credential Placement

MyBatis offers several ways to configure database connections, and hardcoded credentials can appear in various locations:

*   **`mybatis-config.xml`:** This is the primary MyBatis configuration file. Database connection details are often defined within the `<environments>` and `<environment>` sections, using the `<dataSource>` tag.  Credentials can be hardcoded directly as attributes of the `<dataSource>` tag or within `<property>` tags.

    ```xml
    <environment id="development">
        <transactionManager type="JDBC"/>
        <dataSource type="POOLED">
            <property name="driver" value="${database.driver}"/>
            <property name="url" value="${database.url}"/>
            <property name="username" value="hardcoded_username"/>  <!-- VULNERABLE: Hardcoded username -->
            <property name="password" value="hardcoded_password"/>  <!-- VULNERABLE: Hardcoded password -->
        </dataSource>
    </environment>
    ```

*   **Mapper XML Files (Less Common but Possible):** While less common, developers might mistakenly include database connection details or even credentials within mapper XML files, especially if they are attempting to perform database operations outside of the standard MyBatis mapping framework. This is highly discouraged and represents a severe misconfiguration.

*   **Programmatic Configuration (Less Likely for Hardcoding):** When configuring MyBatis programmatically using Java code, developers *could* still hardcode credentials directly in the code. However, programmatic configuration often encourages the use of externalized configuration sources, making hardcoding less likely in this scenario.

*   **Properties Files (If Hardcoded in Properties):** MyBatis allows referencing properties defined in external properties files (e.g., using `${property.name}`). If these properties files themselves contain hardcoded credentials and are deployed with the application or accessible to attackers, the vulnerability persists.

**Key takeaway:**  Any location where database connection details are defined in a static, easily accessible, and unencrypted manner within the application's configuration is a potential point for hardcoding credentials and creating this vulnerability.

#### 2.4 Impact Assessment: High - Credential Theft, Unauthorized Database Access

The impact of hardcoded credentials in MyBatis configuration files is **HIGH** due to the potential for:

*   **Credential Theft:**  Attackers can easily steal valid database credentials, bypassing authentication mechanisms.
*   **Unauthorized Database Access:**  Compromised credentials grant attackers full access to the database, enabling a wide range of malicious activities.
*   **Data Breach (Confidentiality Impact):**  Sensitive data stored in the database can be exfiltrated, leading to significant financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and regulatory penalties (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Data Manipulation/Corruption (Integrity Impact):**  Attackers can modify or delete critical data, disrupting business operations, causing data inconsistencies, and potentially leading to financial losses and operational failures.
*   **Denial of Service (Availability Impact):**  Attackers can overload the database, causing performance degradation or complete service outages, impacting application availability and user experience.
*   **Lateral Movement and Further Compromise:**  Database access can be used as a stepping stone to compromise other systems and resources within the network, expanding the scope of the attack.
*   **Long-Term Persistent Access:**  Hardcoded credentials, once compromised, can provide persistent access until they are manually changed, potentially allowing attackers to maintain access for extended periods without detection.

**Severity:** **CRITICAL**. This vulnerability is considered critical because it directly leads to a high probability of significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of hardcoded credentials in MyBatis configurations, implement the following strategies:

1.  **Externalize Database Credentials:**  **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]**
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Store database credentials as environment variables on the application server. MyBatis can be configured to read these variables using property placeholders (e.g., `${env.DB_USERNAME}`). This prevents credentials from being stored in configuration files and keeps them separate from the application code.
    *   **Secrets Management Systems:**  Utilize dedicated secrets management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, CyberArk) to securely store, manage, and rotate database credentials. MyBatis applications can retrieve credentials from these systems at runtime using appropriate client libraries or integrations.

2.  **Secure Configuration File Storage and Access:**
    *   **Restrict File System Permissions:**  Ensure that configuration files are stored with appropriate file system permissions, limiting access to only authorized users and processes on the application server.
    *   **Encrypt Configuration Files (Less Recommended for Credentials):** While encrypting configuration files *can* add a layer of security, it's generally less effective for credential management than externalization. The encryption keys themselves need to be managed securely, and decryption still needs to happen at runtime, potentially exposing credentials in memory. Focus on externalization as the primary mitigation.

3.  **Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Information in Configuration Files:** **[CRITICAL MITIGATION]**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Only grant the application the necessary database permissions required for its functionality. Avoid using overly privileged database accounts.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of MyBatis configurations and application code to identify and eliminate any instances of hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.
    *   **Static Code Analysis:**  Employ static code analysis tools to automatically scan configuration files and code for potential hardcoded credentials and other security vulnerabilities.

4.  **Secure Version Control Practices:**
    *   **Credential Scanning in CI/CD Pipelines:**  Integrate credential scanning tools into CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect and prevent commits containing hardcoded credentials.
    *   **Repository Access Control:**  Implement strict access control policies for version control repositories, limiting access to only authorized personnel.
    *   **Regular Repository Audits:**  Periodically audit version control repositories for sensitive information leaks and enforce secure coding practices.

5.  **Secure Logging Practices (Indirectly Related):**
    *   While not directly mitigating hardcoded credentials, secure logging practices are crucial to prevent accidental credential exposure in logs. Avoid logging database connection strings or credentials in application logs.

#### 2.6 Best Practices for Secure Credential Management in MyBatis Applications

*   **Never hardcode database credentials in configuration files or code.**
*   **Always externalize credentials using environment variables or secrets management systems.**
*   **Implement robust access control for configuration files and version control repositories.**
*   **Regularly audit configurations and code for security vulnerabilities.**
*   **Automate credential scanning in CI/CD pipelines.**
*   **Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks of hardcoded credentials.**
*   **Implement a secrets management strategy for the entire organization.**
*   **Rotate database credentials periodically as part of a security policy.**
