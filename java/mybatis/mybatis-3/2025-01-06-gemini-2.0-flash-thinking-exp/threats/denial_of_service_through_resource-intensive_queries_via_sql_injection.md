        print("This threat is a secondary consequence of successful SQL injection. The attacker's primary goal in this scenario is not necessarily data exfiltration or manipulation, but rather to disrupt the application's availability by overwhelming the database.")
        print("The attack unfolds as follows:")
        print("1. **SQL Injection:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's code where user-supplied data is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This could occur in various MyBatis mapping configurations:")
        print("   * **String concatenation in `<select>` tags:** Directly embedding user input within SQL strings.")
        print("   * **`${}` syntax in `<select>` tags:** While powerful, this syntax bypasses MyBatis' parameter binding, making it vulnerable if not handled carefully.")
        print("   * **Insecure use of dynamic SQL:** Complex conditional logic in SQL mappings can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly constructed.")
        print("2. **Crafting Malicious Queries:** Once a SQL injection point is identified, the attacker crafts specific SQL queries designed to consume excessive resources. Examples include:")
        print("   * **Large Cartesian Products:** Joining large tables without appropriate `WHERE` clauses, resulting in an exponentially large result set.")
        print("   * **Recursive Queries without Limits:** Unbounded recursive common table expressions (CTEs) can consume significant memory and CPU.")
        print("   * **Full Table Scans on Large Tables:** Queries that force the database to scan entire tables without using indexes.")
        print("   * **Resource-Intensive Functions:** Using database functions that are computationally expensive or involve heavy I/O operations.")
        print("   * **`SLEEP()` or `BENCHMARK()` functions:** Some database systems offer functions that can intentionally delay execution or consume CPU cycles.")
        print("3. **MyBatis Execution:** MyBatis, being responsible for executing the SQL queries defined in the mapping files, faithfully executes the attacker's injected malicious query.")
        print("4. **Database Overload:** The execution of these resource-intensive queries consumes significant CPU, memory, and I/O resources on the database server.")
        print("5. **Denial of Service:** As database resources become saturated, legitimate user requests slow down or fail entirely.")

        print("\n### Impact Analysis (Detailed)")
        print("* **Application Unavailability:** Legitimate users will be unable to access the application or its core functionalities.")
        print("* **Performance Degradation:** Even if the application remains partially accessible, response times will be significantly slower, leading to a poor user experience.")
        print("* **Financial Losses:** Downtime can result in lost revenue, missed business opportunities, and potential penalties depending on service level agreements.")
        print("* **Reputational Damage:**  Prolonged or frequent outages can erode user trust and damage the organization's reputation.")
        print("* **Increased Operational Costs:**  Responding to and mitigating a DoS attack requires significant resources from IT and security teams.")

        print("\n### MyBatis' Role and Vulnerabilities")
        print("MyBatis, as the ORM framework, is the direct conduit for executing the injected SQL. While MyBatis itself doesn't introduce the SQL injection vulnerability, its configuration and usage patterns can contribute to the risk.")
        print("* **Dynamic SQL:** While powerful, the improper use of dynamic SQL constructs in MyBatis mapping files can create opportunities for SQL injection if user input is directly embedded.")
        print("* **`${}` Substitution:** The `${}` syntax in MyBatis mapping files performs string substitution before sending the query to the database, making it highly susceptible to SQL injection if used with untrusted user input. **This should be avoided for user-provided data.**")
        print("* **Lack of Input Validation in Mappers:** MyBatis itself doesn't inherently provide input validation. This responsibility falls on the application code *before* passing data to MyBatis.")

        print("\n### Deep Dive into Mitigation Strategies")

        print("\n#### 1. Primarily Mitigated by Preventing SQL Injection Vulnerabilities")
        print("This is the **most critical** mitigation strategy. If SQL injection is prevented, this DoS threat is effectively neutralized.")
        print("* **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the **gold standard**. MyBatis strongly encourages the use of `#{}` syntax, which creates parameterized queries where user input is treated as data, not executable code.")
        print("   ```xml")
        print("   <select id=\"getUserById\" parameterType=\"int\" resultType=\"User\">")
        print("     SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{id}")
        print("   </select>")
        print("   ```")
        print("* **Avoid `${}` Syntax for User-Supplied Data:**  The `${}` syntax performs string substitution *before* the query is sent to the database, making it vulnerable. Use it only for static values or when absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.")
        print("* **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While not a primary defense against SQL injection, validating and sanitizing user input *before* it reaches MyBatis can reduce the attack surface. However, relying solely on this is insufficient.")
        print("   * **Validate data types and formats:** Ensure input conforms to expected patterns.")
        print("   * **Sanitize potentially dangerous characters:** Escape or remove characters that could be used in SQL injection attacks. **Caution:** This should be a secondary measure.")
        print("* **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:** The application's database user should have only the necessary permissions to perform its functions. This limits the potential damage even if SQL injection occurs.")
        print("* **Code Reviews and Static Analysis Tools:** Regularly review MyBatis mapping files and application code to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Utilize static analysis tools that can automatically detect such flaws.")
        print("* **Security Training for Developers:** Ensure developers understand the risks of SQL injection and how to write secure MyBatis code.")

        print("\n#### 2. Implement Database-Level Resource Limits and Query Timeouts")
        print("These are **secondary defense mechanisms** that can limit the impact of resource-intensive queries, even if SQL injection occurs.")
        print("* **Query Timeouts:** Configure the database to automatically terminate queries that exceed a defined execution time. This prevents runaway queries from consuming resources indefinitely.")
        print("   * **Database-specific settings:** Most database systems offer configuration options for setting query timeouts (e.g., `statement_timeout` in PostgreSQL, `max_execution_time` in MySQL).")
        print("* **Resource Limits (e.g., CPU, Memory):** Some database systems allow setting limits on the resources a single query or user can consume. This can prevent a single malicious query from monopolizing the entire database server.")
        print("* **Connection Pooling Configuration:** Properly configure connection pooling to limit the number of concurrent connections and prevent resource exhaustion due to excessive connection requests.")

        print("\n#### 3. Monitor Database Performance and Identify Potentially Malicious or Inefficient Queries")
        print("This is a **detection and response strategy** that allows for early identification and mitigation of ongoing attacks.")
        print("* **Database Performance Monitoring Tools:** Utilize tools that track key database metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and query execution times. Look for sudden spikes or unusual patterns.")
        print("* **Query Logging and Analysis:** Enable database query logging and regularly analyze the logs for suspicious patterns, such as:")
        print("   * **Unusually long-running queries.**")
        print("   * **Queries originating from unexpected sources or users.**")
        print("   * **Queries with unusual syntax or keywords (e.g., `SLEEP()`, large `JOIN`s without `WHERE` clauses).**")
        print("   * **High frequency of similar queries.**")
        print("* **Anomaly Detection:** Implement systems that can detect deviations from normal database behavior, which could indicate an ongoing attack.")
        print("* **Alerting Mechanisms:** Configure alerts to notify security and operations teams when performance thresholds are exceeded or suspicious queries are detected.")

        print("\n### Recommendations for the Development Team")
        print("* **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:** Enforce the use of parameterized queries (`#{}`) for all user-supplied data in MyBatis mapping files.")
        print("* **Ban `${}` for User Input:**  Establish a clear policy against using the `${}` syntax for handling user-provided data.")
        print("* **Implement Robust Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize user input before it reaches MyBatis, but remember this is a secondary defense.")
        print("* **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on MyBatis mapping files and database interaction logic, to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.")
        print("* **Utilize Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate static analysis tools into the development pipeline to automatically detect SQL injection flaws.")
        print("* **Database Resource Limits and Timeouts:** Collaborate with database administrators to implement appropriate resource limits and query timeouts.")
        print("* **Implement Database Monitoring:** Set up comprehensive database performance monitoring and alerting systems.")
        print("* **Security Training:** Provide regular security training to developers, emphasizing secure coding practices for MyBatis and SQL injection prevention.")
        print("* **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.")
        print("* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for handling potential DoS attacks via SQL injection.")
