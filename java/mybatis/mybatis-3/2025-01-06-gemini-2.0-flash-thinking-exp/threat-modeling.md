# Threat Model Analysis for mybatis/mybatis-3

## Threat: [SQL Injection via `${}` Placeholders](./threats/sql_injection_via__${}__placeholders.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by providing unsanitized input that is directly substituted into the SQL query using the `${}` placeholder in MyBatis mapper files. This allows them to bypass intended query logic and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, execute administrative commands on the database, or potentially compromise the entire application and underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis Mapper Files, specifically the use of `${}` for parameter substitution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never use `${}` for user-provided input.** Always favor the `#` placeholder for parameter binding, which ensures proper escaping and prevents SQL injection.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application layer before passing data to MyBatis.
        *   If absolutely necessary to use `${}` for dynamic column or table names (not user input values), ensure strict whitelisting and validation of the input.

## Threat: [SQL Injection in Dynamic SQL Constructs](./threats/sql_injection_in_dynamic_sql_constructs.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could manipulate input to exploit vulnerabilities in dynamically generated SQL queries within MyBatis mappers (using `<if>`, `<choose>`, `<foreach>`, etc.). By carefully crafting input, they can alter the intended SQL logic, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to the previous threat, this can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential system compromise. The complexity of dynamic SQL can make these vulnerabilities harder to identify.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis Dynamic SQL features ( `<if>`, `<choose>`, `<foreach>`, etc.) within Mapper Files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all dynamic SQL constructs.
        *   Implement strong input validation before constructing dynamic SQL fragments.
        *   Utilize MyBatis' built-in features for safe parameter handling within dynamic SQL, such as using `#` placeholders within dynamic tags.
        *   Consider using query builder libraries or ORM features that offer more robust protection against SQL injection in dynamic scenarios.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Resource-Intensive Queries via SQL Injection](./threats/denial_of_service_through_resource-intensive_queries_via_sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Through successful SQL injection attacks (as described above), attackers could execute malicious queries that consume excessive database resources (CPU, memory, I/O), leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. This directly involves MyBatis' role in executing the injected SQL.
    *   **Impact:**  Application unavailability, performance degradation, and potential financial losses due to downtime.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis execution of SQL queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Primarily mitigated by preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities (see the first two threats).
        *   Implement database-level resource limits and query timeouts to prevent single queries from consuming excessive resources.
        *   Monitor database performance and identify potentially malicious or inefficient queries.

## Threat: [Configuration Vulnerabilities: Plaintext Credentials](./threats/configuration_vulnerabilities_plaintext_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers who gain access to the application's MyBatis configuration files (e.g., `mybatis-config.xml`) might find database credentials stored in plain text, allowing them to directly access the database. This is a direct consequence of how MyBatis is configured.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the database, including access to all data, ability to modify or delete data, and potential use of the database as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis Configuration Files (e.g., `mybatis-config.xml`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never store database credentials directly in plain text in configuration files.**
        *   Utilize secure configuration management techniques, such as environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or encrypted configuration files.
        *   Restrict access to configuration files to only authorized personnel and processes.
