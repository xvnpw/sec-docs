## Deep Analysis of MyBatis SQL Injection Attack Path

This document provides a deep dive into the identified high-risk path for SQL Injection within an application utilizing MyBatis. We will analyze the attack vectors, critical nodes, their impact, and elaborate on the proposed mitigation strategies.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit SQL Injection via MyBatis**

This path highlights a common and dangerous vulnerability in applications using MyBatis: the exploitation of dynamic SQL features when handling user-provided input. A successful attack can have severe consequences, potentially compromising the entire application and its underlying data.

**Attack Vector: Inject Malicious SQL through Dynamic SQL**

This attack vector focuses on the misuse of MyBatis's dynamic SQL capabilities. While powerful for building flexible queries, these features can become a significant security risk if not handled with utmost care.

**Critical Node: Unsanitized User Input in Dynamic SQL Fragments**

* **Description:** This is the core vulnerability. MyBatis allows developers to construct SQL queries dynamically using XML tags like `<if>`, `<where>`, `<foreach>`, etc. These tags evaluate conditions and conditionally include SQL fragments. The danger arises when user-provided data is directly incorporated into these fragments without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code that will be executed by the database.

* **Technical Deep Dive:**
    * **How it Works:** When MyBatis processes the mapper XML, it evaluates the dynamic SQL tags. If a tag's condition relies on user input or directly includes user input without proper escaping, the attacker can manipulate this input to alter the intended SQL query structure.
    * **Example Scenario:** Consider a search functionality where a user provides a search term. The MyBatis mapper might have a `<where>` clause like this:
        ```xml
        <select id="searchUsers" parameterType="map" resultType="User">
            SELECT * FROM users
            <where>
                <if test="username != null">
                    AND username LIKE '%${username}%'
                </if>
                <if test="email != null">
                    AND email LIKE '%${email}%'
                </if>
            </where>
        </select>
        ```
        If a malicious user provides the following input for `username`: `admin' OR '1'='1`, the resulting SQL query becomes:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%admin' OR '1'='1%'
        ```
        The `' OR '1'='1'` condition is always true, effectively bypassing the intended filtering and potentially returning all users. More sophisticated injections can lead to data extraction, modification, or even remote code execution depending on database permissions.
    * **Vulnerable Tags:** While `<if>` and `<where>` are common culprits, any dynamic SQL tag that directly incorporates user input without proper handling can be exploited. This includes `<set>`, `<foreach>` (especially when building `IN` clauses dynamically), and custom dynamic SQL logic.

* **Impact:**
    * **Data Breach (access to sensitive data):** Attackers can craft SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, financial data, and personal details.
    * **Data Modification or Deletion:** Malicious SQL can be injected to update or delete data within the database, potentially causing significant damage and disruption.
    * **Potential Remote Code Execution (depending on database privileges and capabilities):**  If the database user has sufficient privileges, attackers can execute operating system commands through database functionalities like `xp_cmdshell` (SQL Server) or `SYS_EXECUTE` (Oracle). This allows for complete control over the server.

* **Mitigation:**
    * **Always use parameterized queries (`#{}`) for user input, even within dynamic SQL blocks where possible:** This is the **most critical** mitigation. MyBatis handles the necessary escaping and quoting when using `#{}`. The input is treated as a literal value, not as executable SQL code.
        * **Example (Secure):**
            ```xml
            <select id="searchUsers" parameterType="map" resultType="User">
                SELECT * FROM users
                <where>
                    <if test="username != null">
                        AND username LIKE CONCAT('%', #{username}, '%')
                    </if>
                    <if test="email != null">
                        AND email LIKE CONCAT('%', #{email}, '%')
                    </if>
                </where>
            </select>
            ```
    * **If parameterization is not feasible, rigorously sanitize user input to escape or remove potentially harmful SQL characters and keywords:** This should be considered a **last resort** and requires careful implementation. Blacklisting specific characters or keywords is generally insufficient as attackers can often find ways to bypass these filters. Consider using established libraries for input sanitization specific to your database dialect.
    * **Implement input validation to ensure user input conforms to expected formats and lengths:** Validate the type, format, and length of user input on the application side before it reaches the MyBatis layer. This can prevent many basic injection attempts. For example, if a field is expected to be an integer, reject any input that is not.

**Attack Vector: Bypass Parameterization**

This attack vector specifically targets a common mistake developers make when working with MyBatis: using the incorrect syntax for including values in SQL queries.

**Critical Node: Using `${}` instead of `#{}` for User-Controlled Values**

* **Description:** MyBatis provides two primary ways to include values in SQL queries: `#{}` (parameterization) and `${}` (string substitution). The crucial difference is how MyBatis handles these values. `#{}` treats the value as a parameter, sending it separately to the database, which then safely substitutes it. `${}` performs direct string substitution, literally inserting the value into the SQL query string *before* it's sent to the database. This makes it highly vulnerable to SQL injection if used with user-controlled input.

* **Technical Deep Dive:**
    * **How it Works:** When MyBatis encounters `${variableName}`, it directly replaces it with the string value of `variableName`. If this value originates from user input and contains malicious SQL, that SQL will become part of the executed query.
    * **Example Scenario:** Consider an order by clause that attempts to allow users to choose the sorting column:
        ```xml
        <select id="getUsersSortedBy" parameterType="map" resultType="User">
            SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY ${sortColumn} ${sortOrder}
        </select>
        ```
        If a malicious user provides the input `sortColumn = "username; DELETE FROM users;"` and `sortOrder = "ASC"`, the resulting SQL query becomes:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY username; DELETE FROM users; ASC
        ```
        The database will execute both the `SELECT` query and the malicious `DELETE` query, potentially wiping out the entire user table.
    * **Legitimate Use Cases (Rare and Controlled):**  `${}` should **only** be used for values that are **not** controlled by the user and are guaranteed to be safe. This might include referencing table names or column names that are hardcoded or determined by the application logic in a secure manner. However, even in these cases, careful consideration and validation are necessary.

* **Impact:** The impact is similar to the previous attack vector, but often more direct and easier to exploit due to the straightforward nature of string substitution.
    * **Data breach, data modification or deletion, potential remote code execution:** The attacker has full control over the injected SQL, allowing for a wide range of malicious actions.

* **Mitigation:**
    * **Strictly avoid using `${}` for any user-controlled input.** This is the **golden rule**. There are very few legitimate use cases where the risk associated with using `${}` with user input is acceptable.
    * **Enforce this rule through code reviews, static analysis tools, and developer training:** Educate developers on the critical difference between `#{}` and `${}` and the security implications of using the latter incorrectly. Implement code review processes to catch instances of this vulnerability. Utilize static analysis tools that can flag potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, including the misuse of `${}`.
    * **If `${}` is absolutely necessary for non-user-controlled values (e.g., for table or column names), carefully review and control the source of these values:** Ensure that the values used with `${}` are derived from trusted sources and are validated to prevent manipulation. Consider using whitelisting approaches to restrict the possible values.

**Holistic Security Considerations:**

While mitigating these specific attack vectors is crucial, a holistic approach to security is essential. Consider the following:

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user used by the application has the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict even if they successfully inject SQL.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including SQL injection flaws.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.
* **Security Training for Developers:**  Invest in training developers on secure coding practices, specifically addressing common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and the proper use of ORM frameworks like MyBatis.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep MyBatis and other dependencies up-to-date to patch known security vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The identified attack path highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices when working with dynamic SQL in MyBatis. The misuse of dynamic SQL and the incorrect handling of user input are common sources of SQL injection vulnerabilities. By adhering to the mitigation strategies outlined above, particularly the consistent use of parameterized queries (`#{}`) and the avoidance of `${}` for user-controlled values, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and protect their applications and data. A layered security approach, combining secure coding practices with other security measures, is crucial for building robust and resilient applications.
