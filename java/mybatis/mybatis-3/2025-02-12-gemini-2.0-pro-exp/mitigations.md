# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mybatis/mybatis-3

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries (Prefer over `${}`)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__prefer_over__${}__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  `#{}` Parameterized Queries (Prefer over `${}`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify all SQL statements:**  Examine all MyBatis mapper XML files (`.xml`).  Locate all `<select>`, `<insert>`, `<update>`, and `<delete>` tags.
        2.  **Analyze dynamic SQL:** Within each SQL statement, identify any parts that are dynamically generated based on input (e.g., `WHERE` clauses, `ORDER BY` clauses, table names, column names).
        3.  **Replace `${}` with `#{}`:**  Wherever possible, replace direct string substitution (`${}`) with parameterized queries (`#{}`).  `#{}` tells MyBatis to treat the value as a parameter, which will be properly escaped by the underlying JDBC driver.
        4.  **Use `<bind>` for complex expressions:** If you need to perform string concatenation or other operations *before* passing the value to the query, use the `<bind>` element to create a new variable within the MyBatis context.  This keeps the logic within MyBatis and allows it to handle escaping.  Example:
            ```xml
            <select id="findUsersByName" resultType="User">
              <bind name="pattern" value="'%' + _parameter + '%'" />
              SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE #{pattern}
            </select>
            ```
        5.  **Test thoroughly:** After making changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure that the queries still function correctly and that no SQL injection vulnerabilities are present. Use a variety of inputs, including potentially malicious ones.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):**  Direct string substitution (`${}`) allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or even complete system compromise.  `#{}` prevents this by treating input as data, not code.
        *   **Second-Order SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):**  Even if data is initially sanitized, if it's later used in a dynamic SQL statement with `${}`, it could still be vulnerable.  `#{}` mitigates this risk.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduction: Very High (near elimination if used consistently).  `#{}` is the primary defense against SQL injection in MyBatis.
        *   **Second-Order SQL Injection:** Risk reduction: Very High.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Mapper XML files: `userMapper.xml`, `productMapper.xml` (mostly implemented, some `${}` usage remains in `orderMapper.xml`).
        *   Java code interacting with mappers: Generally uses parameterized methods.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `orderMapper.xml`:  Contains several instances of `${}` for dynamic `ORDER BY` clauses.  These need to be refactored to use `#{}` or a safe alternative (see below).
        *   Dynamic table name selection in `reportService.java`:  Currently uses string concatenation to build the table name. This needs to be addressed (see "Dynamic Table/Column Names" mitigation below).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Dynamic `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` (MyBatis-Specific Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_dynamic__order_by__and__limit___mybatis-specific_handling_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Safe Dynamic `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` (MyBatis-Specific Handling)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses:**  Locate all dynamic `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses in your mapper XML files.
        2.  **Whitelist approach (for `ORDER BY` within MyBatis):** While the *safest* approach involves whitelisting in your Java service layer *before* calling MyBatis, you *can* implement a limited form of whitelisting *within* the MyBatis XML using `<choose>`, `<when>`, and `<otherwise>`:
            ```xml
            <select id="findUsers" resultType="User">
              SELECT * FROM users
              ORDER BY
              <choose>
                <when test="orderBy == 'username'">username</when>
                <when test="orderBy == 'creation_date'">creation_date</when>
                <otherwise>id</otherwise> <!-- Default sort column -->
              </choose>
              <if test="orderDirection != null">
                <choose>
                  <when test="orderDirection == 'ASC'">ASC</when>
                  <when test="orderDirection == 'DESC'">DESC</when>
                  <otherwise>ASC</otherwise>
                </choose>
              </if>
            </select>
            ```
            This approach is less flexible than a Java-side whitelist but is *far* safer than using `${}` directly with user input.  The `orderBy` and `orderDirection` variables would still be passed in from Java, but their values are now constrained within the XML.
        3.  **Parameterize `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`:**  Always use `#{}` for `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` values.  These are often controlled by user input (e.g., pagination).  This is a direct MyBatis interaction.
        4. **MyBatis Timeout Configuration:** Set `timeout` attribute in your statements.
            ```xml
            <select id="findUsers" resultType="User" timeout="10">
              ...
            </select>
            ```

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):**  Attackers could inject malicious SQL into `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT` clauses.
        *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):**  An attacker could provide a very large `LIMIT` value or a complex `ORDER BY` that causes performance issues.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduction: High (using the `<choose>` approach within MyBatis). Very High if combined with Java-side whitelisting.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduction: High (by limiting the `LIMIT` value and setting timeouts).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` are generally parameterized using `#{}`.
        *   No timeout configuration

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `orderMapper.xml`:  `ORDER BY` is still handled using `${}`. The `<choose>` approach (or a Java-side whitelist) needs to be implemented.
        *   Timeout configuration in all mappers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dynamic Table/Column Names (MyBatis-Specific Handling)](./mitigation_strategies/dynamic_tablecolumn_names__mybatis-specific_handling_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Dynamic Table/Column Names (MyBatis-Specific Handling)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify dynamic table/column names:**  Locate any instances where table names or column names are dynamically generated based on input within your MyBatis XML mappers.
        2.  **Whitelist approach (Strongly Recommended, often best done *outside* MyBatis):** Ideally, handle whitelisting in your Java service layer.  However, if you *must* handle it within MyBatis, use the `<choose>`, `<when>`, `<otherwise>` structure, similar to the `ORDER BY` example above.  This is *less* ideal than Java-side whitelisting because it can become complex and harder to maintain.
            ```xml
            <select id="getData" resultType="MyData">
              SELECT
              <choose>
                <when test="columnName == 'col1'">col1</when>
                <when test="columnName == 'col2'">col2</when>
                <otherwise>default_col</otherwise>
              </choose>
              FROM
              <choose>
                <when test="tableName == 'table1'">table1</when>
                <when test="tableName == 'table2'">table2</when>
                <otherwise>default_table</otherwise>
              </choose>
            </select>
            ```
        3.  **Avoid `${}`:**  Absolutely avoid using `${}` for dynamic table/column names with any input that could be influenced by a user.  Even with the `<choose>` approach, ensure the variables passed to the mapper come from a trusted source.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):**  Dynamic table/column names are a high-risk area for SQL injection.
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):**  An attacker might be able to probe for the existence of tables or columns.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** Risk reduction: High (with the `<choose>` approach within MyBatis, but ideally handled in Java).
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Moderate.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No consistent approach is currently implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `reportService.java`:  Uses string concatenation to build table names dynamically.  This needs to be refactored, ideally to use a whitelist *in Java*, and then pass a safe table name to MyBatis.
        *   `dynamicColumnMapper.xml`:  Uses `${}` for dynamic column names.  This needs to be refactored to use the `<choose>` approach (or, preferably, a Java-side whitelist).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable DTDs (XXE Prevention - MyBatis Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_dtds__xxe_prevention_-_mybatis_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Disable DTDs (XXE Prevention - MyBatis Configuration)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Locate `SqlSessionFactory` creation:** Find the code where the `SqlSessionFactory` is created (usually in a configuration class).
        2.  **Set the `disableDtd` property:**  Add the following code to disable DTDs:
            ```java
            configuration.setVariables(new Properties() {{
                setProperty("org.apache.ibatis.parsing.xml.disableDtd", "true");
            }});
            ```
            This should be done *before* building the `SqlSessionFactory`. This is a direct configuration change to MyBatis.
        3.  **Verify custom `XMLMapperEntityResolver` (if any):**  If you have a custom `XMLMapperEntityResolver`, ensure it does *not* load external entities.  The default `XMLMapperEntityResolver` is generally safe. This is a direct check of a MyBatis component.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Severity: Critical):**  XXE attacks can allow attackers to read local files, access internal network resources, or cause a denial of service.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XXE Injection:** Risk reduction: Very High (eliminates the vulnerability if DTDs are not required).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Not explicitly implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The `disableDtd` property should be explicitly set in the `SqlSessionFactory` configuration (`MyBatisConfig.java`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging (MyBatis-Specific Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging__mybatis-specific_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Logging (MyBatis-Specific Configuration)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify logging configuration:** Locate your logging configuration files (e.g., `logback.xml`, `log4j2.xml`).
        2.  **Set appropriate log levels for MyBatis:**  In production environments, set the logging level for MyBatis *specifically* to `WARN` or `ERROR`.  This prevents sensitive SQL queries and parameters from being logged by MyBatis.  Use `DEBUG` or `TRACE` only in development or testing environments.
            ```xml
            <!-- Example for Logback -->
            <logger name="org.apache.ibatis" level="WARN" />
            <logger name="your.package.mappers" level="WARN" />
            ```
            This directly controls MyBatis' logging behavior.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):**  Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) in logs generated by MyBatis.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: High (if logging is configured correctly).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Log levels are set to `INFO` in the production environment, which is too verbose.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The log level for MyBatis and mapper packages needs to be changed to `WARN` in `logback.xml` (production profile).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates (of MyBatis)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates__of_mybatis_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Updates (of MyBatis)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Check for updates:** Regularly check the MyBatis website or GitHub repository for new releases.
        2.  **Review release notes:**  Read the release notes for each new version to see if any security vulnerabilities have been fixed in MyBatis itself.
        3.  **Update dependencies:**  Update the MyBatis dependency in your project's build file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven, `build.gradle` for Gradle). This directly updates the MyBatis library.
        4.  **Test:**  Thoroughly test the application after updating MyBatis to ensure that there are no regressions.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Varies):**  Vulnerabilities discovered and fixed in newer versions of MyBatis.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduction: High (prevents exploitation of known vulnerabilities in MyBatis).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   No formal process for regular updates is in place.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A process needs to be established to regularly check for and apply MyBatis updates.
