# Deep Analysis: Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.1 - Attacker Controls SQL Fragments via `${}` in MyBatis

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the vulnerability presented by attack path 1.1.2.1, "Attacker Controls SQL Fragments via `${}`", within the context of an application using the MyBatis framework.  This includes:

*   Understanding the *precise mechanism* by which the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   Identifying *specific code patterns* that are susceptible to this attack.
*   Assessing the *realistic impact* of a successful exploit.
*   Proposing *concrete and effective mitigation strategies* beyond the high-level recommendation.
*   Providing *guidance for developers* on how to avoid introducing this vulnerability.
*   Developing *detection strategies* to identify existing instances of this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the use of `${}` string interpolation within MyBatis XML mappers and, to a lesser extent, within dynamic SQL tags that might incorporate `${}`.  It considers:

*   **MyBatis Version:**  The analysis is primarily based on the current MyBatis 3 codebase (as per the provided GitHub link), but will note any version-specific differences if relevant.
*   **Database Systems:**  While the vulnerability is database-agnostic in principle (SQL injection is a general concept), the analysis will consider potential variations in exploit payloads based on common database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server).
*   **Application Context:**  The analysis assumes a typical web application context where user-supplied data might be used to construct SQL queries via MyBatis.  It will *not* cover scenarios where `${}` is used exclusively with trusted, internally generated data (although this is still discouraged).
*   **Related Vulnerabilities:** While the primary focus is on `${}`, the analysis will briefly touch upon related vulnerabilities like second-order SQL injection if they are relevant to the exploitation of this specific path.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the MyBatis source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to understand how `${}` interpolation is handled internally.  This will involve looking at the `TextSqlNode`, `DynamicSqlSource`, and related classes.
2.  **Vulnerability Demonstration:**  Construct a simple, vulnerable MyBatis mapper and demonstrate a successful SQL injection exploit using `${}`.  This will provide concrete proof of the vulnerability.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential consequences of a successful exploit, considering various attack scenarios (data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service, etc.).
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation techniques, including code examples and best practices.  This will go beyond the generic recommendation and provide concrete guidance.
5.  **Detection Strategy Development:** Outline methods for identifying existing instances of this vulnerability in a codebase, including static analysis techniques and dynamic testing approaches.
6.  **Developer Guidance:**  Provide clear and concise guidelines for developers to prevent the introduction of this vulnerability in new code.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1.2.1

### 4.1. Mechanism of Exploitation

The core issue lies in how MyBatis handles `${}` interpolation.  Unlike `#{}` (parameterized queries), `${}` performs *direct string substitution* *before* the SQL statement is prepared.  This means the value provided within `${}` is treated as *part of the SQL query itself*, not as a parameter to be safely escaped.

**MyBatis Code (Simplified Illustration):**

Imagine a simplified version of how MyBatis might process a statement:

```java
// Simplified representation - NOT actual MyBatis code
String userInput = ...; // Potentially malicious input
String sqlTemplate = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ${userInput}";
String finalSql = sqlTemplate.replace("${userInput}", userInput);
// Execute finalSql directly
```

If `userInput` contains, for example, `' OR '1'='1`, the `finalSql` becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ' OR '1'='1
```

This is a classic SQL injection, bypassing the intended username check and retrieving all users.

**Key Difference from `#{}`:**

`#{}` uses prepared statements.  The database driver handles escaping special characters in the parameter values, preventing them from being interpreted as SQL code.  With `${}`, there is *no* such protection.

### 4.2. Vulnerable Code Patterns

The most common vulnerable pattern is using `${}` with any data that originates, even indirectly, from user input.  Examples:

*   **Direct User Input:**

    ```xml
    <select id="getUserByName" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ${username}
    </select>
    ```
    If `username` comes directly from a request parameter, it's vulnerable.

*   **Indirect User Input (Concatenation):**

    ```java
    String sortColumn = request.getParameter("sort");
    String orderByClause = "ORDER BY " + sortColumn; // Vulnerable if used with ${}
    ```

    ```xml
    <select id="getUsers" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users ${orderByClause}
    </select>
    ```
    Even though `orderByClause` is constructed in Java, it's still vulnerable because `sortColumn` is user-controlled.

*   **Dynamic SQL with `${}`:**

    ```xml
    <select id="searchUsers" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users
        <where>
            <if test="username != null">
                AND username = ${username}  <!-- Vulnerable -->
            </if>
            <if test="email != null">
                AND email LIKE #{email}  <!-- Safe (using #{}) -->
            </if>
        </where>
    </select>
    ```
    Using `${}` within dynamic SQL tags (`<if>`, `<choose>`, `<foreach>`, etc.) is equally dangerous.

* **Unvalidated Input Used for Table or Column Names:**
    ```xml
    <select id="getData" resultType="MyObject">
        SELECT * FROM ${tableName} WHERE id = #{id}
    </select>
    ```
    If `tableName` is derived from user input without proper validation and sanitization, an attacker could specify a different table, potentially accessing sensitive data.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SQL injection via `${}` is very high, potentially leading to:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can retrieve *any* data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, etc.  They can use techniques like `UNION SELECT` to combine results from different tables.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can insert, update, or delete data in the database.  This could lead to data corruption, account takeover, or unauthorized transactions.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can craft queries that consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), making the database server unresponsive.  Examples include queries that trigger full table scans or complex joins.
*   **Database Server Compromise:**  In some cases, depending on the database configuration and privileges, attackers might be able to execute operating system commands through the database server (e.g., using `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server).
*   **Second-Order SQL Injection:**  If the injected data is stored in the database and later used in another query with `${}`, it can lead to a second-order SQL injection.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

The primary mitigation is to **avoid using `${}` with untrusted data**.  Here are specific strategies:

1.  **Prefer `#{}` for Parameterized Queries:**  Always use `#{}` for passing values to SQL queries whenever possible.  This ensures proper escaping and prevents SQL injection.

2.  **Strict Input Validation and Whitelisting:**  If you *must* use `${}` (e.g., for dynamic table or column names â€“ a rare and generally discouraged practice), implement *extremely strict* input validation.  Use whitelisting (allowing only a predefined set of safe values) rather than blacklisting (trying to block known bad values).

    ```java
    // Example of whitelisting for a table name
    String tableName = request.getParameter("table");
    if (!Arrays.asList("users", "products", "orders").contains(tableName)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid table name");
    }
    ```

3.  **Use an Enum for Known Values:** If the possible values for a dynamic part of the query are limited and known at compile time, use a Java `enum` to represent them. This provides type safety and prevents arbitrary input.

    ```java
    public enum SortOrder {
        ASC, DESC
    }

    // In your Java code:
    SortOrder order = SortOrder.valueOf(request.getParameter("order").toUpperCase());

    // In your MyBatis mapper:
    <select id="getSortedData" resultType="MyObject">
        SELECT * FROM my_table ORDER BY id ${order}
    </select>
    ```
    This is safer because the `valueOf` method will throw an exception if the input is not a valid enum value.

4.  **Database User Permissions:**  Configure the database user account used by the application with the *least privileges necessary*.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully inject SQL.  For example, the application user should not have `DROP TABLE` privileges.

5.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block SQL injection attempts, providing an additional layer of defense.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities, including SQL injection.

7. **Avoid Dynamic Table/Column Names:** Refactor the application logic to avoid the need for dynamic table or column names whenever possible. Often, a better database schema or a different query structure can eliminate this requirement.

### 4.5. Detection Strategies

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   **Code Review:**  Manually inspect MyBatis mapper XML files and Java code for any use of `${}`.  Pay close attention to how the values being interpolated are generated.
    *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs, PMD, SonarQube) with rules configured to detect potentially unsafe string concatenation and `${}` usage in MyBatis mappers.  These tools can automate the code review process. Look for rules specifically targeting SQL injection and MyBatis.
    *   **Grep/Regular Expressions:** Use `grep` or similar tools to search for patterns like `\$\{.*?\}` within your codebase.  This is a quick way to identify potential problem areas, but it will produce false positives.

*   **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Perform penetration testing, specifically targeting SQL injection vulnerabilities.  This involves attempting to inject malicious SQL code through the application's input fields.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanners:**  Use automated web application vulnerability scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix) to scan the application for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Database Query Monitoring:**  Monitor database queries in real-time (using database profiling tools or logging) to look for suspicious or unexpected SQL statements. This can help detect successful SQL injection attacks.

### 4.6. Developer Guidance

*   **Never trust user input.**  Treat all data originating from outside the application (including request parameters, headers, cookies, etc.) as potentially malicious.
*   **Always use `#{}` for parameter values.**  This is the most important rule.
*   **Avoid `${}` whenever possible.**  If you think you need `${}`, reconsider your design.  There's almost always a better way.
*   **If you *must* use `${}` for dynamic SQL elements (table/column names), use strict whitelisting and validation.**
*   **Understand the difference between `#{}` and `${}`.**  This is crucial for writing secure MyBatis code.
*   **Follow secure coding practices.**  This includes input validation, output encoding, least privilege principle, and regular security training.
*   **Use a secure coding checklist.** Include checks for SQL injection vulnerabilities, specifically related to MyBatis.
* **Participate in code reviews.** Have other developers review your code, focusing on security aspects.
