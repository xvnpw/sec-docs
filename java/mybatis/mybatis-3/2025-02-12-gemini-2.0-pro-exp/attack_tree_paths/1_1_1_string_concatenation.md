# Deep Analysis: MyBatis 3 SQL Injection via String Concatenation

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with string concatenation in MyBatis 3 dynamic SQL, educate the development team on its dangers, and establish concrete preventative measures to eliminate this vulnerability from our application.  We aim to move beyond a superficial understanding and delve into the *why* and *how* of this specific attack vector.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **MyBatis 3:**  The specific version of the framework is crucial, as features and recommended practices may evolve across versions.
*   **Dynamic SQL:**  We are concerned with the `<if>`, `<choose>`, `<when>`, `<otherwise>`, `<foreach>`, and `<set>` tags within MyBatis XML mappers, where dynamic SQL generation occurs.  Static SQL statements are not within the scope of this specific analysis (though they could be vulnerable to other issues).
*   **String Concatenation (`$ {}`)**:  The explicit use of string concatenation to incorporate user-provided data directly into SQL queries. This includes both direct concatenation within the XML mapper and any Java/Kotlin code that builds SQL strings passed to MyBatis.
*   **User Input:**  Any data originating from an untrusted source, including but not limited to:
    *   HTTP request parameters (GET, POST, etc.)
    *   Headers
    *   Cookies
    *   Data from external APIs (if not properly validated)
    *   Database fields that could have been previously manipulated by an attacker

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other forms of SQL injection (e.g., second-order injection, blind SQL injection) beyond those directly caused by string concatenation in MyBatis dynamic SQL.
*   Other MyBatis vulnerabilities unrelated to SQL injection.
*   Vulnerabilities in other parts of the application stack (e.g., front-end, database server configuration).

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methods:

1.  **Code Review Simulation:** We will analyze hypothetical (and potentially real, if available) code snippets demonstrating vulnerable and secure MyBatis mapper configurations.
2.  **Exploitation Demonstration:** We will construct example attack payloads to illustrate how string concatenation can be exploited.
3.  **Mitigation Strategy Breakdown:** We will dissect the recommended mitigation (`#{}`) and explain *why* it prevents SQL injection.
4.  **Best Practices Definition:** We will establish clear coding standards and guidelines to prevent future occurrences of this vulnerability.
5.  **Tooling Recommendations:** We will suggest static analysis tools and testing strategies to detect and prevent this vulnerability.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 String Concatenation

### 4.1. Vulnerability Description and Mechanics

MyBatis, like many ORM frameworks, provides a way to construct SQL queries dynamically.  This is often necessary to handle varying search criteria, optional filters, or conditional updates.  MyBatis's dynamic SQL feature, primarily used within XML mapper files, allows developers to embed logic (using tags like `<if>`, `<choose>`, etc.) directly within the SQL statement.

The core vulnerability lies in the use of the `${}` substitution syntax.  When MyBatis encounters `${someVariable}`, it performs *direct string substitution*.  The value of `someVariable` is inserted into the SQL string *without any escaping or sanitization*.  This is fundamentally different from `#{}` (which we'll discuss in the mitigation section).

**Example (Vulnerable):**

```xml
<select id="findUsersByName" resultType="User">
  SELECT * FROM users
  WHERE username = '${username}'
</select>
```

If the `username` variable is populated directly from user input, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Example Attack:**

Let's say the application passes the `username` parameter via a GET request:

```
http://example.com/users?username=admin' OR '1'='1
```

MyBatis will substitute this directly into the query, resulting in:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'
```

The `OR '1'='1'` condition is always true, bypassing the intended username check and returning *all* users from the table.  This is a classic SQL injection attack.  The attacker could further modify the payload to:

*   **Data Exfiltration:**  `admin' UNION SELECT credit_card_number, expiry_date FROM credit_cards --`
*   **Data Modification:** `admin'; UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin'; --`
*   **Data Deletion:** `admin'; DROP TABLE users; --`
*   **Database Enumeration:**  `admin' UNION SELECT table_name, null, null FROM information_schema.tables --`

The `--` at the end of these payloads is a SQL comment, effectively neutralizing any remaining parts of the original query.

### 4.2. Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, and Detection Difficulty (Revisited)

*   **Likelihood: Medium:**  While the dangers of SQL injection are well-known, developers unfamiliar with MyBatis's nuances might mistakenly believe that `${}` provides some level of protection, or they might use it for perceived performance reasons (which are generally negligible and outweighed by the security risk).  Lack of proper code reviews and security training increases the likelihood.
*   **Impact: Very High:**  As demonstrated above, successful SQL injection can lead to complete database compromise, data breaches, data modification, and denial of service.  The impact is almost always severe.
*   **Effort: Very Low:**  Crafting basic SQL injection payloads is trivial, and numerous tools and resources are available online to assist attackers.
*   **Skill Level: Low:**  Exploiting basic string concatenation vulnerabilities requires minimal technical skill.  More advanced attacks (e.g., blind SQL injection) might require more expertise, but the initial entry point is easy.
*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium:**  While the vulnerability is conceptually simple, detecting it requires careful code review and/or the use of static analysis tools.  It can be missed if developers are not specifically looking for it, or if the code is complex and poorly documented.  Dynamic testing (e.g., penetration testing) can also reveal this vulnerability, but it's better to catch it earlier in the development lifecycle.

### 4.3. Mitigation: The Power of `#{}`

The *only* safe way to incorporate user input into MyBatis dynamic SQL is to use the `#{}` parameter syntax.  This syntax leverages JDBC prepared statements.

**Example (Secure):**

```xml
<select id="findUsersByName" resultType="User">
  SELECT * FROM users
  WHERE username = #{username}
</select>
```

**How `#{}` Works:**

1.  **Prepared Statement:** When MyBatis encounters `#{username}`, it instructs the JDBC driver to create a *prepared statement*.  A prepared statement is a precompiled SQL template with placeholders for parameters.
2.  **Parameter Binding:** The value of `username` is *not* directly inserted into the SQL string.  Instead, it is passed to the JDBC driver as a *separate parameter*.
3.  **Database-Level Escaping:** The JDBC driver (and ultimately the database server) is responsible for properly escaping and sanitizing the parameter value *according to the specific database's syntax*.  This prevents any characters in the parameter from being interpreted as SQL code.

**Example (Behind the Scenes):**

Even if the attacker sends the same malicious input (`admin' OR '1'='1`), the database will treat it as a *literal string* to be compared against the `username` column.  The query effectively becomes:

```sql
-- (Conceptual representation - the actual prepared statement is handled internally)
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = ?  -- Placeholder

-- The JDBC driver then binds the parameter:
? = "admin' OR '1'='1'"
```

The database will search for a user with the *exact* username "admin' OR '1'='1'", which will (presumably) not exist.  The injection attempt is foiled.

### 4.4. Best Practices and Coding Standards

To prevent string concatenation vulnerabilities, the following best practices *must* be followed:

1.  **Never Use `${}` with User Input:**  This is the most critical rule.  `#{}` should be used *exclusively* for incorporating any data that originates from an untrusted source.
2.  **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** While `#{}` prevents SQL injection, it's still crucial to validate user input *before* it reaches MyBatis.  This provides an additional layer of defense and helps prevent other types of attacks (e.g., XSS).  Validate data types, lengths, and allowed characters.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary permissions.  Avoid using accounts with `DROP TABLE` or other highly privileged permissions.
4.  **Regular Code Reviews:**  Code reviews should specifically focus on identifying any instances of `${}` being used with potentially untrusted data.
5.  **Security Training:**  All developers working with MyBatis should receive thorough training on SQL injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
6.  **Documentation:** Clearly document the purpose of each dynamic SQL block and the source of any variables used within it.
7. **Whitelisting, not Blacklisting:** If you must use `${}` for dynamic table or column names (which is generally discouraged), use a strict whitelist of allowed values. *Never* try to blacklist potentially dangerous inputs.

### 4.5. Tooling Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **FindBugs/SpotBugs with FindSecBugs:** These tools can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in Java code, including MyBatis mappers.
    *   **SonarQube:** A comprehensive code quality and security platform that can identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL injection.
    *   **PMD:** Another static analysis tool that can be configured to detect SQL injection patterns.
    *   **MyBatis Generator:** While primarily for code generation, it can help enforce consistent use of `#{}`.
*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**
    *   **OWASP ZAP:** A free and open-source web application security scanner that can be used to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Burp Suite:** A commercial web security testing tool with advanced features for detecting and exploiting SQL injection.
*   **Database Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor database query logs for suspicious patterns or errors that might indicate SQL injection attempts.

### 4.6. Conclusion
String concatenation within MyBatis dynamic SQL using `${}` with user-provided input is an extremely dangerous practice that leads to easily exploitable SQL injection vulnerabilities. The use of `#{}` is mandatory for secure parameterization. By understanding the mechanics of the vulnerability, implementing robust mitigation strategies, adhering to strict coding standards, and utilizing appropriate tooling, we can effectively eliminate this attack vector from our application and significantly enhance its security posture. Continuous vigilance, education, and proactive security measures are essential to maintain a secure application.
