# Deep Analysis: MyBatis `${}` SQL Injection Vulnerability

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Improper Use of `${}` Interpolation" vulnerability within the context of a MyBatis-based application.  We aim to understand the root cause, potential attack vectors, exploitation techniques, impact, and effective mitigation strategies.  This analysis will provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent and remediate this specific SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Vulnerability:**  SQL injection arising from the misuse of the `${}` string interpolation syntax in MyBatis XML mappers or annotated Java interfaces.
*   **Framework:** MyBatis 3 (as specified by the provided GitHub repository link).  While the core concepts apply to other versions, specific implementation details might vary.
*   **Data Flow:**  User-provided input reaching a MyBatis mapper and being incorporated into a SQL query using `${}`.
*   **Exclusion:**  This analysis *does not* cover other types of SQLi vulnerabilities in MyBatis (e.g., those arising from dynamic SQL misuse even with `#{}` if not handled carefully), other injection vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, command injection), or general security best practices unrelated to this specific SQLi.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition and Explanation:**  Clearly define the vulnerability and explain the underlying mechanism that makes it exploitable.
2.  **Code Example Analysis:**  Provide concrete examples of vulnerable and secure code snippets using MyBatis.
3.  **Attack Vector Identification:**  Identify common scenarios and user input points where this vulnerability could be exploited.

## 4. Deep Analysis

### 4.1. Vulnerability Definition and Explanation

MyBatis offers two primary ways to embed parameters into SQL queries: `#{}` and `${}`.

*   **`#{}` (Parameter Substitution):** This is the *safe* method.  MyBatis uses JDBC prepared statements and parameter binding.  The database driver handles escaping and sanitization, preventing SQLi.  The value provided is treated as a *literal value*, not as part of the SQL command itself.

*   **`${}` (String Substitution):** This is the *dangerous* method when used with untrusted input.  MyBatis performs direct string substitution *before* the SQL is sent to the database.  The value is inserted directly into the SQL string *without any escaping or sanitization*.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

The core problem is that `${}` treats user input as *code* rather than *data*.

### 4.2. Code Example Analysis

**Vulnerable Code (Java with XML Mapper):**

```xml
<!-- mybatis-config.xml (or similar) -->
<mapper namespace="com.example.UserMapper">
  <select id="getUserByName" resultType="User">
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ${username};
  </select>
</mapper>
```

```java
// Java code
String userInput = request.getParameter("username"); // Untrusted input!
User user = userMapper.getUserByName(userInput);
```

**Secure Code (Java with XML Mapper):**

```xml
<!-- mybatis-config.xml (or similar) -->
<mapper namespace="com.example.UserMapper">
  <select id="getUserByName" resultType="User">
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = #{username};
  </select>
</mapper>
```

```java
// Java code
String userInput = request.getParameter("username"); // Untrusted input
User user = userMapper.getUserByName(userInput);
```

**Vulnerable Code (Java with Annotations):**

```java
// Java code (using annotations)
public interface UserMapper {
    @Select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ${username}")
    User getUserByName(@Param("username") String username);
}

// ... later in the code ...
String userInput = request.getParameter("username"); // Untrusted input!
User user = userMapper.getUserByName(userInput);
```

**Secure Code (Java with Annotations):**

```java
// Java code (using annotations)
public interface UserMapper {
    @Select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = #{username}")
    User getUserByName(@Param("username") String username);
}

// ... later in the code ...
String userInput = request.getParameter("username"); // Untrusted input
User user = userMapper.getUserByName(userInput);
```

The key difference is the use of `#{}` instead of `${}`.  The Java code calling the mapper remains the same; the vulnerability lies solely within the mapper definition.

### 4.3. Attack Vector Identification

Common attack vectors include:

*   **Web Forms:**  Any input field (username, search, etc.) that is directly used in a MyBatis query with `${}`.
*   **API Endpoints:**  Parameters passed to REST or SOAP APIs that are used in a vulnerable MyBatis query.
*   **URL Parameters:**  Data passed in the URL query string (e.g., `example.com/users?username=...`) that is used in a vulnerable query.
*   **Hidden Form Fields:**  Attackers can modify hidden form fields using browser developer tools.
*   **Headers:** Although less common, HTTP headers could also be a source of untrusted input.

### 4.4. Exploitation Demonstration (Conceptual)

Let's assume the vulnerable code from section 4.2:

```xml
<select id="getUserByName" resultType="User">
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ${username};
</select>
```

**Attack 1: Data Exfiltration (UNION-based SQLi)**

An attacker might provide the following input for `username`:

```
' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT null, table_name, null, null FROM information_schema.tables -- 
```

The resulting SQL query (after string substitution) would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT null, table_name, null, null FROM information_schema.tables -- ';
```

*   `'`: Closes the initial single quote.
*   `OR 1=1`:  Ensures the first part of the query always returns all rows (a common SQLi technique).
*   `UNION SELECT ...`:  Combines the results of the original query with a new query that retrieves table names from the `information_schema.tables` (this is database-specific; the attacker would need to adapt it to the target database).
*   `--`:  Comments out the rest of the original query.

This would leak the names of all tables in the database.  The attacker could then refine the query to extract data from specific tables.

**Attack 2: Data Modification (UPDATE)**

An attacker might provide:

```
'; UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin'; -- 
```

Resulting SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; UPDATE users SET password = 'new_password' WHERE username = 'admin'; -- ';
```

This would change the password of the 'admin' user.

**Attack 3: Denial of Service (Time-based SQLi)**

An attacker might provide:

```
' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0); -- 
```

Resulting SQL (MySQL example):

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0); -- ';
```

This would cause the database to pause for 5 seconds for each row in the `users` table.  If the table is large, this could significantly slow down or even crash the application.

### 4.5. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful exploitation is **Very High**:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can steal sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, financial data, and proprietary business information.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can alter data, potentially causing financial loss, reputational damage, or operational disruption.
*   **Data Deletion:**  Attackers can delete data, leading to data loss and service disruption.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Attackers can make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **System Compromise:**  In some cases, SQLi can be used as a stepping stone to further compromise the server (e.g., by executing operating system commands through database extensions).
* **Regulatory Violations:** Data breaches can lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA, resulting in significant fines and legal consequences.

### 4.6. Mitigation Strategy Review

The primary mitigation is to **never use `${}` with untrusted input**.  Always use `#{}` for user-provided data.  ` ${}` should *only* be used for trusted, internally generated values, such as:

*   Dynamically selecting a table or column name from a *pre-defined, whitelisted* set.  **Crucially, this whitelist must be hardcoded and not influenced by user input.**
*   Constructing complex queries where parameter binding is not directly supported (but even then, extreme caution is required, and alternative approaches should be considered first).

**Why `#{}` is Safe:**

`#{}` uses JDBC prepared statements.  The database driver treats the value as a *literal* and handles escaping and sanitization.  The database itself prevents the value from being interpreted as SQL code.

**Additional Mitigations (Defense in Depth):**

*   **Input Validation:**  Validate all user input to ensure it conforms to expected data types, lengths, and formats.  This can help prevent some SQLi attempts, but it is *not* a substitute for using `#{}`.
*   **Least Privilege:**  Ensure the database user account used by the application has the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully exploit a SQLi vulnerability.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF can help detect and block common SQLi attack patterns.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### 4.7. Detection Techniques

*   **Code Review:**  Manually inspect all MyBatis mapper files and annotated interfaces for instances of `${}`.  Pay close attention to the context in which it is used.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (see section 4.8) to automatically scan the codebase for potential SQLi vulnerabilities.  These tools can identify the use of `${}` and flag it as a potential issue.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Perform penetration testing to attempt to exploit SQLi vulnerabilities.  This can help identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis.
*   **Database Query Logging:**  Enable detailed database query logging (with appropriate security precautions to protect sensitive data in the logs).  Review the logs for suspicious SQL queries.
* **Runtime Protection:** Some security tools can monitor application behavior at runtime and detect/prevent SQL injection attempts.

### 4.8. Tooling Recommendations

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **FindBugs/SpotBugs (with FindSecBugs plugin):**  A general-purpose static analysis tool for Java that can detect various security vulnerabilities, including SQLi.  The FindSecBugs plugin adds specific rules for security issues.
    *   **SonarQube:**  A popular platform for continuous inspection of code quality, including security vulnerabilities.  It has rules for detecting SQLi in MyBatis.
    *   **Checkmarx:**  A commercial static analysis tool with comprehensive security vulnerability detection capabilities.
    *   **Veracode:**  Another commercial static analysis tool that focuses on security.
    *   **PMD:** A source code analyzer that can be configured with custom rulesets, including rules for detecting SQLi.
    *   **Semgrep:** A fast, open-source, static analysis tool that supports custom rules and can be used to find patterns like `${}` usage.

*   **MyBatis-specific Linters/Plugins:**
    *   While there isn't a widely-used, dedicated MyBatis SQLi linter, you can often configure general-purpose static analysis tools with custom rules to target MyBatis-specific patterns.

*   **Database Security Tools:**
    *   Database-specific security tools (e.g., Oracle's Database Vault, SQL Server's security features) can help mitigate the impact of SQLi.

*   **Penetration Testing Tools:**
    *   **sqlmap:**  An open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQLi vulnerabilities.
    *   **Burp Suite:**  A widely used web security testing platform that includes tools for identifying and exploiting SQLi.
