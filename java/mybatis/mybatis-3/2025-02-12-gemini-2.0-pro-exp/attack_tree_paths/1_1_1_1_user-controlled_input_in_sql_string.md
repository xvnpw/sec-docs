Okay, here's a deep analysis of the provided attack tree path, focusing on the context of MyBatis 3:

## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1.1 User-Controlled Input in SQL String (MyBatis 3)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the vulnerability represented by attack tree path 1.1.1.1 (User-Controlled Input in SQL String) within the context of a Java application using MyBatis 3.
*   Identify specific code patterns in MyBatis 3 that are susceptible to this vulnerability.
*   Determine the precise impact of a successful exploit.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendation ("Same as 1.1.1 String Concatenation").  We need to translate that into MyBatis-specific best practices.
*   Provide examples of vulnerable and remediated code.
*   Assess the detection difficulty and suggest detection methods.

**Scope:**

*   **Framework:** MyBatis 3 (all versions, unless a specific version is known to have addressed this issue).
*   **Language:** Java (the primary language used with MyBatis).
*   **Attack Type:** SQL Injection (SQLi) specifically arising from direct incorporation of unsanitized user input into SQL query strings.
*   **Data Access:**  We'll focus on how MyBatis interacts with the database and how this interaction can be exploited.
*   **Exclusions:**  We won't delve into database-specific SQLi techniques (e.g., database-specific functions that could be abused).  We'll focus on the MyBatis layer.  We also won't cover other types of injection (e.g., NoSQL injection, OS command injection).

**Methodology:**

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the vulnerability and its root cause.
2.  **MyBatis Code Analysis:**  Examine MyBatis's features and common usage patterns to pinpoint how this vulnerability manifests.  This includes reviewing the MyBatis documentation, common tutorials, and example code.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detail the potential consequences of a successful SQL injection attack, considering data breaches, data modification, denial of service, and other impacts.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Provide specific, actionable recommendations for preventing this vulnerability in MyBatis 3, including code examples.  This will go beyond the generic "parameterized queries" and show how to implement them *correctly* within MyBatis.
5.  **Detection Methods:**  Suggest techniques for identifying this vulnerability in existing code, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and code review.
6.  **Example Scenarios:**  Provide concrete examples of vulnerable code and the corresponding remediated code.

### 2. Deep Analysis

**2.1 Vulnerability Definition:**

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique where an attacker manipulates a web application's database queries by inserting malicious SQL code.  In this specific case (1.1.1.1), the vulnerability stems from directly embedding user-provided input into the SQL query string *without* proper sanitization, escaping, or parameterization.  This allows the attacker to alter the intended query logic, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.

**2.2 MyBatis Code Analysis:**

MyBatis 3 offers several ways to interact with a database:

*   **XML Mappers:**  The most common approach, where SQL queries are defined in XML files.
*   **Annotations:**  Using Java annotations (e.g., `@Select`, `@Insert`, `@Update`, `@Delete`) to define SQL queries directly in Java code.
*   **Dynamic SQL:**  MyBatis provides features (like `<if>`, `<choose>`, `<when>`, `<otherwise>`, `<foreach>`) to build SQL queries dynamically based on conditions.

The vulnerability arises primarily when using **string concatenation** or **string interpolation** to build SQL queries, especially within XML mappers or with the `@SelectProvider`, `@InsertProvider`, `@UpdateProvider`, and `@DeleteProvider` annotations.

**Vulnerable Patterns:**

*   **XML Mapper (String Concatenation):**

    ```xml
    <select id="getUserByName" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'
    </select>
    ```
    The `${username}` syntax performs direct string substitution.  If `username` comes from user input, an attacker can inject SQL.  For example, if the attacker provides `'; DROP TABLE users; --` as the username, the resulting query becomes:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DROP TABLE users; --'
    ```

*   **XML Mapper (String Concatenation with Dynamic SQL):**

    ```xml
    <select id="searchUsers" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users
        <where>
            <if test="name != null">
                AND username LIKE '${name}%'
            </if>
        </where>
    </select>
    ```
    Even with dynamic SQL, using `${}` for user input is dangerous.

*   **Annotations (String Concatenation):**

    ```java
    @Select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'")
    User getUserByName(String username);
    ```
    This is highly vulnerable due to direct string concatenation in the `@Select` annotation.

* **Annotations (Provider with String Concatenation):**
    ```java
    public class UserSqlBuilder {
        public String getUserByName(String username) {
            return "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
        }
    }

    @SelectProvider(type = UserSqlBuilder.class, method = "getUserByName")
    User getUserByName(String username);
    ```
    Using a provider class doesn't automatically make it safe. If the provider builds the SQL string using concatenation with user input, it's still vulnerable.

**2.3 Impact Assessment:**

A successful SQL injection attack against a MyBatis-based application can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can retrieve sensitive data (passwords, credit card numbers, personal information) from the database.
*   **Data Modification:**  Attackers can alter or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can execute queries that consume excessive resources, making the database (and the application) unavailable.
*   **Account Takeover:**  Attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms by injecting SQL to modify user credentials or session data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers might gain administrative privileges within the database or even on the underlying operating system.
*   **Code Execution (in some cases):**  Depending on the database and its configuration, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code on the database server.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful SQLi attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization.
*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to lawsuits, fines, and other legal and financial penalties.

**2.4 Mitigation Strategies (MyBatis Specific):**

The core principle of mitigation is to **never trust user input** and to **always use parameterized queries** or their equivalent in MyBatis.  Here's how to do it correctly:

*   **XML Mappers (Parameterization with `#{}`):**

    ```xml
    <select id="getUserByName" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = #{username}
    </select>
    ```
    The `#{username}` syntax tells MyBatis to treat `username` as a parameter.  MyBatis will use the appropriate JDBC `PreparedStatement` mechanism to safely bind the value, preventing SQL injection.

*   **XML Mappers (Dynamic SQL with `#{}`):**

    ```xml
    <select id="searchUsers" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users
        <where>
            <if test="name != null">
                AND username LIKE #{name}
            </if>
        </where>
    </select>
    ```
    Use `#{}` even within dynamic SQL elements.  For `LIKE` clauses, you'll need to handle the wildcard characters (%) in your Java code or use database-specific concatenation functions safely (see below).

*   **Annotations (Parameterization):**

    ```java
    @Select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = #{username}")
    User getUserByName(@Param("username") String username);
    ```
    Use the `@Param` annotation to explicitly name the parameter and use `#{}` in the SQL string.

* **Annotations (Provider with Parameterization):**
    ```java
    public class UserSqlBuilder {
        public String getUserByName(Map<String, Object> params) {
            String username = (String) params.get("username");
            return new SQL() {{
                SELECT("*");
                FROM("users");
                WHERE("username = #{username}"); // Use parameterization here!
            }}.toString();
        }
    }

    @SelectProvider(type = UserSqlBuilder.class, method = "getUserByName")
    User getUserByName(@Param("username") String username);
    ```
    Use MyBatis's `SQL` builder class and ensure you use `#{}` for parameterization within the `WHERE` clause.  Pass parameters as a `Map`.

*   **Handling `LIKE` Clauses:**

    If you need to use `LIKE` with user input, you have a few options:

    *   **Concatenate in Java (Safely):**

        ```java
        String searchTerm = "%" + userInput.replace("%", "\\%").replace("_", "\\_") + "%";
        ```
        Escape the special characters `%` and `_` in the user input *before* concatenating it with the wildcards.  Then, use `#{searchTerm}` in your MyBatis query.

    *   **Database-Specific Concatenation (If Necessary):**

        ```xml
        <!-- Example for PostgreSQL -->
        <select id="searchUsers" resultType="User">
            SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE CONCAT('%', #{name}, '%')
        </select>
        ```
        Use the database's concatenation function (e.g., `CONCAT` in PostgreSQL, MySQL) and still use `#{}` for the user input.  This is generally preferred over Java-side concatenation.

* **Input Validation:** While not a replacement for parameterized queries, input validation is a crucial defense-in-depth measure. Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths. Reject unexpected characters.

* **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by your application has the minimum necessary privileges.  Don't use a database administrator account for routine operations.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**2.5 Detection Methods:**

*   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools (e.g., FindBugs, PMD, SonarQube with security plugins) to scan your code for patterns that indicate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Look for:
    *   String concatenation or interpolation used to build SQL queries.
    *   Use of `${}` in MyBatis XML mappers.
    *   Missing `@Param` annotations when using annotations.
    *   Lack of input validation.

*   **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):** Use dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to test your running application for SQL injection vulnerabilities.  These tools send specially crafted inputs to your application and analyze the responses to detect vulnerabilities.

*   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to how SQL queries are constructed and how user input is handled.  Look for the vulnerable patterns described above.

*   **Database Query Logging:**  Enable database query logging (with appropriate security precautions to protect sensitive data in the logs) and monitor the logs for suspicious queries.

* **MyBatis Interceptor:** Create a custom MyBatis Interceptor that intercepts all SQL queries before they are executed.  This interceptor can log the queries, check for suspicious patterns (e.g., presence of SQL keywords in unexpected places), or even rewrite queries to add additional security checks. This is an advanced technique, but it can provide a very strong layer of defense.

**2.6 Example Scenarios:**

**Vulnerable Example (XML Mapper):**

```xml
<!-- VulnerableMapper.xml -->
<mapper namespace="VulnerableMapper">
    <select id="getUserByUnsafeInput" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${userInput}'
    </select>
</mapper>
```

```java
// VulnerableService.java
public interface VulnerableMapper {
    User getUserByUnsafeInput(@Param("userInput") String userInput);
}

public class VulnerableService {
    @Autowired
    private VulnerableMapper vulnerableMapper;

    public User getUser(String userInput) {
        return vulnerableMapper.getUserByUnsafeInput(userInput);
    }
}
```

**Remediated Example (XML Mapper):**

```xml
<!-- SafeMapper.xml -->
<mapper namespace="SafeMapper">
    <select id="getUserBySafeInput" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = #{userInput}
    </select>
</mapper>
```

```java
// SafeService.java
public interface SafeMapper {
    User getUserBySafeInput(@Param("userInput") String userInput);
}

public class SafeService {
    @Autowired
    private SafeMapper safeMapper;

    public User getUser(String userInput) {
        // Optional: Add input validation here
        if (userInput == null || userInput.length() > 50) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid username");
        }
        return safeMapper.getUserBySafeInput(userInput);
    }
}
```

### 3. Conclusion

The attack tree path 1.1.1.1, "User-Controlled Input in SQL String," represents a critical SQL injection vulnerability that can be easily exploited in MyBatis 3 applications if developers are not careful.  The key to preventing this vulnerability is to consistently use parameterized queries (using `#{}` in MyBatis) and to avoid any form of string concatenation or interpolation when incorporating user input into SQL queries.  By following the mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and protect their applications and data.  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and code reviews are also essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
