Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "SQL Injection via Dynamic SQL Misuse" threat in MyBatis, following the structure you requested:

## Deep Analysis: SQL Injection via Dynamic SQL Misuse in MyBatis

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "SQL Injection via Dynamic SQL Misuse" threat in the context of MyBatis-3, identify specific vulnerabilities, assess the risk, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the initial threat model description.  The goal is to provide developers with a clear understanding of *how* this vulnerability manifests and *how* to prevent it effectively.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses specifically on MyBatis-3 and its mechanisms for dynamic SQL generation.  It covers both XML mapper files and Java-based `@...Provider` annotations.  It considers the interaction between user-supplied input, MyBatis's dynamic SQL features, and the underlying database.  It does *not* cover general SQL injection principles unrelated to MyBatis (e.g., vulnerabilities in stored procedures called *from* MyBatis, unless those calls are themselves dynamically constructed).

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  We will examine common MyBatis usage patterns that lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, providing concrete code examples.
    2.  **Exploit Demonstration (Conceptual):** We will describe how an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities, outlining the attack vectors and potential payloads.  (No actual exploit code will be provided.)
    3.  **Risk Assessment:** We will re-evaluate the risk severity, considering the likelihood and impact of successful exploitation.
    4.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:** We will expand on the initial mitigation strategies, providing detailed guidance and best practices.
    5.  **Tooling and Automation:** We will identify specific tools and techniques that can be used to detect and prevent this vulnerability.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

#### 2.1 Vulnerability Identification (with Code Examples)

The core vulnerability stems from the misuse of string substitution (`${}`) instead of parameterized queries (`#{}`) when handling user input within dynamic SQL.

**Vulnerable Example 1: XML Mapper (Unsafe Search)**

```xml
<select id="findUsersByName" resultType="User">
  SELECT * FROM users
  WHERE username LIKE '%${username}%'
</select>
```

*   **Explanation:**  The `username` parameter is directly embedded into the SQL query using `${}`.  This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Vulnerable Input:**  `'; DROP TABLE users; --`

**Vulnerable Example 2: XML Mapper (Unsafe Ordering)**

```xml
<select id="getProducts" resultType="Product">
  SELECT * FROM products
  ORDER BY ${orderBy}
</select>
```

*   **Explanation:** The `orderBy` parameter, likely intended to allow sorting by different columns, is directly injected.
*   **Vulnerable Input:** `(CASE WHEN (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password LIKE 'a%')=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` (This is a blind SQL injection example, attempting to extract information bit by bit.)

**Vulnerable Example 3: `@SelectProvider` (Unsafe Filtering)**

```java
@SelectProvider(type = UserSqlProvider.class, method = "buildGetUsersByFilter")
public List<User> getUsersByFilter(String filter);

public class UserSqlProvider {
    public String buildGetUsersByFilter(String filter) {
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE " + filter; // DANGEROUS!
        return sql;
    }
}
```

*   **Explanation:** The `filter` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL string.
*   **Vulnerable Input:** `1=1; DROP TABLE users; --`

**Vulnerable Example 4: Misuse of `<foreach>` with `${}`**

```xml
<select id="findUsersByIds" resultType="User">
    SELECT * FROM users
    WHERE id IN
    <foreach item="item" index="index" collection="ids"
        open="(" separator="," close=")">
        ${item}  <!-- Should be #{item} -->
    </foreach>
</select>
```
* **Explanation:** While `<foreach>` is often used safely with `#{item}`, using `${item}` opens a SQL injection vulnerability.
* **Vulnerable Input (ids):** A list containing a malicious string like `1) OR (1=1`

#### 2.2 Exploit Demonstration (Conceptual)

Let's consider Vulnerable Example 1.  An attacker provides the input `'; DROP TABLE users; --`.  The resulting SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%'; DROP TABLE users; --%';
```

This executes two separate statements:

1.  `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%';` (likely returns nothing)
2.  `DROP TABLE users;` (deletes the `users` table)
3.  `--%';` comments out the rest of original query.

The attacker has successfully deleted the `users` table.  Similar techniques can be used to extract data, modify data, or even execute operating system commands (if the database user has sufficient privileges and the database is configured to allow it).

#### 2.3 Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** High.  The misuse of `${}` is a common mistake, especially for developers new to MyBatis or those unfamiliar with SQL injection risks.  Dynamic SQL is frequently used, increasing the attack surface.
*   **Impact:** Critical.  As stated in the original threat model, data breaches, data modification/deletion, and database server compromise are all possible.
*   **Overall Risk Severity:** Critical.  The combination of high likelihood and critical impact justifies this rating.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

*   **Prefer `#{}` (Parameterized Queries):** This is the *primary* defense.  `#{}` tells MyBatis to treat the value as a parameter, which the database driver will then handle securely, preventing SQL injection.  There should be *very* few legitimate reasons to use `${}` with user-supplied data.

    ```xml
    <!-- Corrected Example 1 -->
    <select id="findUsersByName" resultType="User">
      SELECT * FROM users
      WHERE username LIKE CONCAT('%', #{username}, '%')
    </select>
    ```

    ```java
    // Corrected Example 3
    public class UserSqlProvider {
        public String buildGetUsersByFilter(String filter) {
            // Still DANGEROUS, but showing how to use #{} if you MUST build SQL
            //  In reality, you should use a proper WHERE clause with parameters.
            String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE 1=1 AND " + filter; // STILL VULNERABLE
            // A better approach would be to use a Map and #{key} for each filter condition.
            return sql;
        }
    }
    ```
    * **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** Even with `#{}` usage, rigorous input validation is crucial.  This acts as a second layer of defense.
        *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure that the input matches the expected data type (e.g., integer, string, date).
        *   **Length Restrictions:** Limit the length of string inputs to reasonable values.
        *   **Format Validation:** Use regular expressions to enforce specific formats (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
        *   **Whitelisting:** Define a set of allowed characters or values and reject anything outside that set.  This is *much* safer than blacklisting.
        *   **Example (Java):**
            ```java
            public void searchUsers(String username) {
                if (username == null || username.length() > 50 || !username.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$")) {
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid username");
                }
                // ... use MyBatis with #{username} ...
            }
            ```

*   **Avoid `${}` (String Substitution):**  If you *must* use `${}` (e.g., for dynamically selecting table or column names â€“ a practice to be avoided if possible), you *must* rigorously validate and escape the input.  Use a database-specific escaping library.  *Never* trust user input directly in `${}`.

    *   **Example (Hypothetical - AVOID THIS IF POSSIBLE):**
        ```java
        // HIGHLY DISCOURAGED - Example only for extreme cases
        public String escapeForMyBatis(String input, String dbType) {
            if ("MySQL".equals(dbType)) {
                return input.replace("\\", "\\\\").replace("'", "\\'"); // Basic MySQL escaping
            } else if ("PostgreSQL".equals(dbType)) {
                return input.replace("'", "''"); // Basic PostgreSQL escaping
            }
            // ... other database types ...
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported database type");
        }

        // ... in your MyBatis code ...
        String escapedColumnName = escapeForMyBatis(columnName, "MySQL");
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY " + escapedColumnName; // Still risky!
        ```
        **Important:** The above escaping example is simplified and may not be completely robust.  Always use a well-tested, database-specific escaping library.

*   **Mandatory Code Reviews:**  Code reviews should specifically focus on:
    *   Any use of `${}`.  Justification should be required.
    *   Input validation logic for all parameters, especially those used in dynamic SQL.
    *   Correct usage of `#{}`.

*   **Least Privilege:** The database user account used by your application should have the absolute minimum privileges necessary.  It should *not* have `DROP TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE`, or other administrative privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve SQL injection.

*   **Secure Provider Classes:** The same principles apply to `@...Provider` annotations.  Validate input, use parameterized queries where possible, and escape meticulously if you *must* use string concatenation.

#### 2.5 Tooling and Automation

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**
    *   **FindBugs/SpotBugs with FindSecBugs plugin:** Can detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in Java code, including MyBatis mappers.
    *   **SonarQube:** A comprehensive code quality platform that can identify security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection.
    *   **MyBatis Generator:** While primarily for code generation, it can help enforce consistent use of `#{}`.
    *   **Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode:** Commercial static analysis tools that offer more advanced SQL injection detection capabilities.

*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools (DAST):**
    *   **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):** A free and open-source web application security scanner that can be used to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Burp Suite:** A popular commercial web security testing tool with extensive SQL injection testing capabilities.

*   **Database Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor database logs for suspicious queries or errors that might indicate SQL injection attempts.
    *   Use database auditing features to track changes to data and schema.

* **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    * Write unit tests that specifically attempt to inject malicious SQL through your MyBatis mappers. These tests should *fail* if the application is properly secured.

### 3. Conclusion

SQL Injection via Dynamic SQL Misuse in MyBatis is a critical vulnerability that can have severe consequences. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, implementing robust mitigation strategies (primarily using `#{}` and rigorous input validation), and leveraging appropriate tooling, developers can effectively protect their applications from this threat. Continuous vigilance, code reviews, and security testing are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
