Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the "Deserialization of Untrusted Data" threat within the context of a MyBatis-3 application.

## Deep Analysis: Deserialization of Untrusted Data in MyBatis-3

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Fully understand the mechanics of how a deserialization vulnerability could manifest within a MyBatis-3 application, even though it's uncommon.
*   Identify specific code patterns and configurations that increase the risk.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations to developers to prevent or mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Assess the real-world likelihood and impact, considering typical MyBatis usage patterns.
*   Determine if the provided mitigation strategies are sufficient and propose improvements if necessary.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   Custom `TypeHandler` implementations within MyBatis-3.  We will not analyze the core MyBatis library itself for inherent deserialization vulnerabilities (assuming it's been thoroughly vetted by the MyBatis team).
*   Scenarios where a `TypeHandler` might be used to read data from a database column (the most likely vector) or potentially other external sources.
*   Java's built-in serialization mechanism and its inherent risks.  We'll also briefly touch on alternative serialization formats.
*   The interaction between the `TypeHandler` and the rest of the MyBatis framework.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Code Review Simulation:** We will create hypothetical (but realistic) `TypeHandler` code examples that exhibit the vulnerability and demonstrate how it can be exploited.
2.  **Vulnerability Explanation:** We will break down the code, explaining step-by-step how the deserialization process works and where the vulnerability lies.
3.  **Exploitation Scenario:** We will describe a plausible attack scenario, outlining how an attacker might inject malicious data.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will analyze the effectiveness of the provided mitigation strategies and propose improvements or alternatives where necessary.
5.  **Best Practices:** We will provide clear, concise best practices for developers to follow when creating and using `TypeHandler` implementations.
6.  **Tooling and Detection:** We will discuss potential tools or techniques that could help identify this vulnerability during development or testing.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1. Vulnerability Mechanics and Code Example**

The core issue lies in using Java's built-in serialization (`java.io.ObjectInputStream` and `java.io.ObjectOutputStream`) to handle data that originates from an untrusted source (e.g., a database column controlled by an attacker).  Java deserialization is inherently dangerous because it can allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects and execution of code contained within those objects.

Let's consider a hypothetical (and *highly dangerous*) `TypeHandler`:

```java
package com.example.mybatis.typehandlers;

import org.apache.ibatis.type.BaseTypeHandler;
import org.apache.ibatis.type.JdbcType;

import java.io.*;
import java.sql.CallableStatement;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class VulnerableObjectTypeHandler extends BaseTypeHandler<Object> {

    @Override
    public void setNonNullParameter(PreparedStatement ps, int i, Object parameter, JdbcType jdbcType) throws SQLException {
        try (ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
             ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos)) {
            oos.writeObject(parameter);
            ps.setBytes(i, baos.toByteArray());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error serializing object", e);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Object getNullableResult(ResultSet rs, String columnName) throws SQLException {
        byte[] bytes = rs.getBytes(columnName);
        if (bytes == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return deserializeObject(bytes);
    }

    @Override
    public Object getNullableResult(ResultSet rs, int columnIndex) throws SQLException {
        byte[] bytes = rs.getBytes(columnIndex);
        if (bytes == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return deserializeObject(bytes);
    }

    @Override
    public Object getNullableResult(CallableStatement cs, int columnIndex) throws SQLException {
        byte[] bytes = cs.getBytes(columnIndex);
        if (bytes == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return deserializeObject(bytes);
    }

    private Object deserializeObject(byte[] bytes) throws SQLException {
        try (ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(bytes);
             ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bais)) {
            return ois.readObject(); // DANGER! Arbitrary code execution possible here.
        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            throw new SQLException("Error deserializing object", e);
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`setNonNullParameter`:** This method serializes the provided `Object` into a byte array and stores it in the database.  This part is *not* inherently vulnerable, but it sets the stage for the vulnerability.
*   **`getNullableResult` (all three overloads):** These methods retrieve the byte array from the database (or `CallableStatement`).  The crucial vulnerability lies in the `deserializeObject` method.
*   **`deserializeObject`:** This method takes the raw byte array and uses `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` to deserialize it.  This is where the attacker's malicious payload would be executed.  If the byte array contains a serialized object designed to perform malicious actions upon deserialization (e.g., using a gadget chain), the attacker achieves Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**2.2. Exploitation Scenario**

1.  **Attacker Control:** The attacker needs to find a way to control the data stored in the database column that is handled by the `VulnerableObjectTypeHandler`. This could be through:
    *   A direct SQL injection vulnerability (less likely, as MyBatis is generally good at preventing this).
    *   A flaw in the application logic that allows the attacker to influence the data being saved to that column.  For example, a vulnerable form submission that doesn't properly validate user input.
    *   A compromised account with write access to the relevant table.

2.  **Payload Creation:** The attacker crafts a malicious serialized object.  Tools like `ysoserial` can be used to generate payloads that exploit common Java libraries to achieve RCE.  The payload is designed to execute arbitrary commands on the server when deserialized.

3.  **Data Injection:** The attacker injects the serialized byte array (the payload) into the database column.

4.  **Triggering Deserialization:** The application, through normal operation, retrieves data from the affected column using the `VulnerableObjectTypeHandler`.  This triggers the `getNullableResult` method, which in turn calls `deserializeObject`.

5.  **Code Execution:** The `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` method deserializes the malicious payload, executing the attacker's code and granting them control over the application server.

**2.3. Mitigation Analysis and Improvements**

Let's analyze the provided mitigation strategies and suggest improvements:

*   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:** This is the **most effective and recommended mitigation**.  It completely eliminates the vulnerability.  Developers should strongly question *why* they need to serialize complex objects into the database in the first place.  There are almost always better alternatives.  This should be the *default* stance.

*   **Input Validation and Whitelisting (If Necessary):** This is *extremely difficult* to implement correctly for Java deserialization.  It's practically impossible to create a comprehensive whitelist of "safe" classes, as even seemingly harmless classes can be part of a gadget chain.  **This mitigation is highly discouraged.**  If you *must* deserialize, consider the following (but understand the risks):
    *   **Look-Ahead Object Input Stream:** Use a library like the one provided by Contrast Security ([https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/java-serialization-lookahead](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/java-serialization-lookahead)) that attempts to inspect the serialized stream *before* fully deserializing it.  This can help prevent some common gadget chains.
    *   **Custom `ObjectInputStream`:**  Override the `resolveClass` method of `ObjectInputStream` to implement a very strict whitelist of allowed classes.  This is still risky, as new gadget chains are constantly being discovered.
    *   **Serialization Filters (Java 9+):** Java 9 introduced serialization filters (`ObjectInputFilter`) that allow you to define rules for accepting or rejecting classes during deserialization.  This is a more robust approach than a custom `ObjectInputStream`, but still requires careful configuration and maintenance.

*   **Code Reviews:** Thorough code reviews are essential, but they are not a primary mitigation.  They are a *detective* control, not a *preventative* one.  Code reviews should specifically look for any use of `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` and flag it as a potential security risk.

*   **Safer Serialization Formats:** This is a strong recommendation.  Instead of Java serialization, use:
    *   **JSON (with a schema):**  Use a library like Jackson or Gson to serialize and deserialize data to/from JSON.  Define a strict schema for the JSON data to ensure that only expected data structures are allowed.  This is generally much safer than Java serialization.
    *   **Protocol Buffers:**  A binary serialization format developed by Google.  It's efficient and provides strong type safety.
    *   **XML (with schema validation):**  Similar to JSON, use a schema (XSD) to validate the structure and content of the XML data.

**2.4. Best Practices**

*   **Never deserialize untrusted data using Java's built-in serialization.** This is the most important rule.
*   **Prefer safer serialization formats like JSON (with a schema) or Protocol Buffers.**
*   **If you absolutely must use Java serialization, use a look-ahead object input stream or serialization filters (Java 9+).**  Understand that this is still risky and requires ongoing maintenance.
*   **Design your data model to avoid storing complex, serialized objects in the database.**  Store individual fields or use a more appropriate data representation.
*   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization throughout your application.** This helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious data in the first place.
*   **Regularly update your dependencies, including MyBatis and any libraries used for serialization.**
*   **Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.**

**2.5. Tooling and Detection**

*   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools:** Tools like FindBugs, SpotBugs, SonarQube, and commercial SAST tools can often detect the use of `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` and flag it as a potential vulnerability.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools:**  DAST tools can attempt to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities by sending crafted payloads to the application.
*   **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) tools:** RASP tools can monitor the application at runtime and detect or block deserialization attacks.
*   **Manual Code Review:** As mentioned earlier, thorough code reviews are crucial for identifying this type of vulnerability.
* **Dependency Check tools:** Tools like OWASP Dependency-Check can help identify if any libraries used by the application have known deserialization vulnerabilities.

### 3. Conclusion

The "Deserialization of Untrusted Data" threat in MyBatis-3, while uncommon, is extremely serious if exploited. The best mitigation is to avoid Java's built-in serialization entirely and use safer alternatives like JSON with a schema. If deserialization is unavoidable, use a look-ahead object input stream or serialization filters, but understand the inherent risks.  A combination of secure coding practices, robust input validation, and regular security testing is essential to protect against this vulnerability. The original mitigation strategies were good, but the emphasis on avoiding deserialization altogether and the strong discouragement of relying solely on whitelisting are crucial additions. The inclusion of alternative serialization formats and tooling provides a more comprehensive approach to addressing this threat.
