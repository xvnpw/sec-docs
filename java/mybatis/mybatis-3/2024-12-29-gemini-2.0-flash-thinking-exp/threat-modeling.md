Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the MyBatis library:

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in Dynamic SQL
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by providing unsanitized input that is directly incorporated into dynamically generated SQL queries. This is achieved by manipulating user-supplied data that is used within MyBatis's `<if>`, `<choose>`, `<foreach>`, or other dynamic SQL tags without proper escaping or parameterization.
    *   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to read sensitive data, modify or delete data, execute arbitrary database commands, potentially leading to full database compromise or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis Dynamic SQL Engine (within XML Mapper Files or via Annotations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries (using `#` placeholders) for user-provided input.
        *   Avoid using `$` placeholders for user-provided input.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization at the application layer as a defense-in-depth measure.
        *   Regularly review and audit MyBatis mapper files for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection via Improper Use of `$` Placeholders
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by exploiting the direct string substitution behavior of the `$` placeholder. If developers mistakenly use `$` for user-controlled input, the attacker can inject arbitrary SQL fragments.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to the previous threat, this can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, and potential database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis Statement Handling (within XML Mapper Files or via Annotations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly limit the use of `$` placeholders to identifiers (table names, column names) that are determined by the application logic and are not directly influenced by user input.
        *   Educate developers on the security implications of using `$` placeholders.
        *   Establish code review processes to identify and prevent the misuse of `$` placeholders.

*   **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Custom Type Handlers
    *   **Description:** If the application uses custom type handlers to handle specific data types and these handlers deserialize data from untrusted sources without proper validation, an attacker could exploit deserialization vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis Type Handler Registry and Custom Type Handler Implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review and audit custom type handler implementations, especially those dealing with deserialization.
        *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources within type handlers.
        *   If deserialization is necessary, implement robust input validation and consider using safer serialization mechanisms.
        *   Keep dependencies used by custom type handlers up-to-date to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Database Credentials in Configuration
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the application's configuration files (e.g., `mybatis-config.xml`) could retrieve database credentials if they are stored in plain text within the configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** MyBatis Configuration Loading.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never store database credentials directly in plain text within configuration files.
        *   Utilize secure credential management mechanisms such as environment variables, dedicated secrets management tools, or encrypted configuration files.
        *   Implement proper access controls on configuration files to restrict access to authorized personnel only.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in MyBatis Library or Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities present in the MyBatis library itself or its dependencies if the application is using an outdated or vulnerable version.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it could range from denial of service to remote code execution or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire MyBatis library and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep MyBatis and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for MyBatis and its dependencies to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
