# Attack Surface Analysis for philjay/mpandroidchart

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Chart Data](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_chart_data.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses external or user-provided data to populate the charts without proper validation or sanitization. Maliciously crafted data can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes within the chart rendering process.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart is responsible for rendering the data provided to it. If the input data is malformed or excessively large, the library might struggle to process it, leading to errors or resource exhaustion.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides extremely large numerical values for a bar chart, potentially causing the application to consume excessive memory or processing power during rendering, leading to a crash or unresponsiveness.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, denial of service (local), potential for unexpected UI behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data sources used to populate the charts *before* passing it to MPAndroidChart. Limit the range and format of acceptable data. Consider implementing data sampling or aggregation for very large datasets before passing them to MPAndroidChart.

## Attack Surface: [String Injection in Labels and Tooltips](./attack_surfaces/string_injection_in_labels_and_tooltips.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses user-provided or external data directly as labels, descriptions, or tooltip content within the charts without proper encoding or sanitization. This can allow attackers to inject malicious strings.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart renders the text provided for labels, tooltips, and other textual elements. If this text contains malicious formatting or escape sequences, it could be interpreted in unintended ways by the rendering engine or underlying Android components.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a string containing HTML-like tags or special characters into a chart label. While direct script execution is less likely in a native Android context, it could lead to UI distortion or, in some scenarios, potentially exploit vulnerabilities in how the text is processed by the underlying system.
    *   **Impact:** UI manipulation, potential for information disclosure through crafted text.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Encode or sanitize all user-provided or external strings before using them as labels, tooltips, or other text within the charts. Use appropriate escaping mechanisms provided by Android or dedicated libraries to prevent interpretation of special characters.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Complex Charts](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_charts.md)

*   **Description:** Rendering extremely complex charts with a massive amount of data points or intricate customizations can consume excessive device resources, leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart handles the rendering of complex visualizations. While it's designed to be efficient, rendering a very large number of data points or highly customized charts can still strain device resources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker triggers the display of a line chart with millions of data points, overwhelming the device's CPU and memory, causing the application to freeze or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (local), poor user experience.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement limits on the number of data points displayed in charts. Use data aggregation or sampling techniques for large datasets *before* passing them to MPAndroidChart. Optimize chart rendering settings within MPAndroidChart. Consider lazy loading or rendering only visible portions of the chart.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom MarkerView Content](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_markerview_content.md)

*   **Description:** If the application implements custom `MarkerView` classes and populates them with data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, vulnerabilities similar to string injection can arise within the `MarkerView`'s layout and data binding.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart provides the framework for creating custom `MarkerView`s and renders the content within them. The security of the content displayed within these custom views is directly influenced by how MPAndroidChart handles the provided data.
    *   **Example:** A custom `MarkerView` displays user-provided text without encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious formatting that distorts the `MarkerView`'s appearance or potentially leads to other issues.
    *   **Impact:** UI manipulation within the `MarkerView`, potential for information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Apply the same input validation and sanitization techniques to data displayed within custom `MarkerView`s as you would for any other user-facing content. Ensure proper encoding of strings. Be cautious about using dynamic content or loading external resources within `MarkerView`s.
