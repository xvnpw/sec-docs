# Threat Model Analysis for philjay/mpandroidchart

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection leading to unexpected behavior or crashes](./threats/malicious_data_injection_leading_to_unexpected_behavior_or_crashes.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide specially crafted or malformed data to be charted. This data could exploit vulnerabilities in the library's data parsing or processing logic, leading to unexpected application behavior, crashes, or even potentially memory corruption. This could happen if the application doesn't properly validate data from external sources before passing it to MPAndroidChart.

**Impact:** Application crashes, denial of service, potential data corruption if the library interacts with application data beyond visualization.

**Affected Component:** Data handling and processing logic within various chart types (e.g., `LineChart`, `BarChart`, `PieChart`) and data set classes (e.g., `LineData`, `BarData`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data before passing it to MPAndroidChart.
* Use try-catch blocks around chart rendering logic to gracefully handle unexpected errors.
* Regularly update MPAndroidChart to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Threat: [Exploiting vulnerabilities in MPAndroidChart's dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_mpandroidchart's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** MPAndroidChart might rely on other third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities through the application's use of MPAndroidChart.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Dependencies of MPAndroidChart (check the library's `build.gradle` or similar dependency management files).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be High or Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update MPAndroidChart to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
* Consider using alternative charting libraries if critical vulnerabilities are found in MPAndroidChart's dependencies and are not promptly addressed.

## Threat: [Using an outdated version of MPAndroidChart with known vulnerabilities](./threats/using_an_outdated_version_of_mpandroidchart_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Using an older version of MPAndroidChart that contains known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to potential attacks that exploit these weaknesses.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** The entire MPAndroidChart library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the known vulnerabilities (can be High or Critical).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update MPAndroidChart to the latest stable version.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for MPAndroidChart.
