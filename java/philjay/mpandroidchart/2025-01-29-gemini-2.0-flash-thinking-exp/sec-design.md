# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust, feature-rich, and easy-to-use Android charting library for developers.
  - Foster a strong community around the library to encourage contributions and maintainability.
  - Ensure the library is widely adopted and trusted by Android developers for data visualization needs.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the library could be exploited in applications using it, damaging reputation and trust.
  - Lack of consistent maintenance and updates could lead to the library becoming outdated and less attractive to developers.
  - Poor performance or bugs could negatively impact user experience in applications utilizing the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub - Provides version control and transparency.
  - security control: Open Source License (Apache 2.0) - Allows for community review and contribution.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: No dedicated security team or formal security audit process for the library itself.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to identify potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Conduct periodic dependency checks to identify and update vulnerable dependencies used by the library.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using the library to prevent misuse and security issues in their applications.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, but relevant for any potential future services or components associated with the library (e.g., documentation website, issue tracker).
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself.
  - Input Validation: The library should be designed to handle potentially malicious or unexpected input data gracefully without causing crashes or unexpected behavior in the host application. This is crucial for preventing denial-of-service or other input-related vulnerabilities in applications using the library. Input validation should be implemented at the library's API boundaries.
  - Cryptography: While a charting library may not directly require cryptography, if any future features involve handling sensitive data or secure communication, appropriate cryptographic measures must be implemented and reviewed by security experts. Ensure no unintentional exposure of sensitive data through logging or debugging features.
