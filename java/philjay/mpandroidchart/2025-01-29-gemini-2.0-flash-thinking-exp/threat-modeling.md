# Threat Model Analysis for philjay/mpandroidchart

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection through Chart Data Input](./threats/malicious_data_injection_through_chart_data_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious data payloads and injects them as chart data input to the application. `mpandroidchart` processes this data without proper validation, leading to exploitation of potential parsing vulnerabilities. This could involve sending specially formatted strings, numbers exceeding expected ranges, or data structures designed to trigger errors in the library's data handling logic. If successful, this could lead to Remote Code Execution.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service (application crash), unexpected application behavior.
**Affected Component:** Data Handling Module, Data Parsing Functions, potentially all Chart Types that process external data.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (if Remote Code Execution is possible)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on all data before passing it to `mpandroidchart`. Validate data types, ranges, formats, and sanitize input to remove potentially malicious characters or structures.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around `mpandroidchart` data processing to gracefully handle unexpected or invalid data without crashing the application.
*   **Library Updates:** Keep `mpandroidchart` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerabilities in Labels or Tooltips](./threats/format_string_vulnerabilities_in_labels_or_tooltips.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious input strings that are used by the application to format chart labels, tooltips, or other text elements within `mpandroidchart`. If the application uses insecure string formatting functions (like `String.format` in Java) and directly incorporates unsanitized user input, the attacker can exploit format string vulnerabilities to achieve Remote Code Execution.
**Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure (reading sensitive data from memory), Denial of Service (application crash).
**Affected Component:** Text Rendering Module, Label Generation Functions, Tooltip Generation Functions.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (if Remote Code Execution is possible)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid String.format with User Input:**  Do not directly use user-controlled or unsanitized data within `String.format` or similar formatting functions used for generating chart text elements.
*   **Use Safe String Formatting:** Utilize safer alternatives for string formatting that prevent format string attacks, or sanitize user input before using it in formatting.
*   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate potential format string vulnerabilities in label and tooltip generation.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chart Labels (WebView Context)](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_chart_labels__webview_context_.md)

**Description:** If `mpandroidchart` is used within a WebView to display charts in a web-based interface, and chart labels or tooltips are generated using unsanitized user input, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the data. When the chart is rendered in the WebView, this malicious script can execute in the user's browser context, leading to serious security breaches.
**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or malicious actions performed on behalf of the user within the WebView context.
**Affected Component:** Text Rendering Module (within WebView context), Label Generation Functions, Tooltip Generation Functions.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all user-controlled data before displaying it in chart labels or tooltips within a WebView. Use appropriate encoding functions for the WebView's context (e.g., HTML encoding).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy for the WebView to restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially malicious content.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove or neutralize potentially malicious script tags or JavaScript code before using it to generate chart elements.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries Used by `mpandroidchart`](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by__mpandroidchart_.md)

**Description:** `mpandroidchart` depends on other third-party libraries. If these dependencies have known critical or high severity security vulnerabilities, and `mpandroidchart` uses vulnerable versions, the application indirectly inherits these vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through `mpandroidchart`'s usage of the dependencies, potentially leading to significant compromise.
**Impact:**  Potentially Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, or other severe impacts depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
**Affected Component:** Dependencies Management, potentially all modules that rely on vulnerable dependencies.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan `mpandroidchart`'s dependencies for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools.
*   **Library Updates:** Keep `mpandroidchart` and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported vulnerabilities in `mpandroidchart`'s dependencies.

## Threat: [Undisclosed Vulnerabilities within `mpandroidchart` Code](./threats/undisclosed_vulnerabilities_within__mpandroidchart__code.md)

**Description:** `mpandroidchart` itself may contain undiscovered critical or high severity security vulnerabilities in its code. Attackers who discover these vulnerabilities can exploit them to compromise applications using the library, potentially achieving Remote Code Execution or significant data breaches.
**Impact:** Potentially Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, or other severe impacts depending on the nature of the undisclosed vulnerability.
**Affected Component:** Potentially any module within `mpandroidchart`'s codebase.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the undisclosed vulnerability)
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Library Updates:** Stay updated with the latest versions of `mpandroidchart` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the developers.
*   **Security Monitoring:** Monitor security advisories and vulnerability disclosures related to `mpandroidchart`.
*   **Code Audits (for critical applications):** For applications with high security requirements, consider performing security audits of `mpandroidchart`'s code or using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
