## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation for Chart Data and Labels](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_for_chart_data_and_labels.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Chart Text Inputs:** Determine all places where text data is used within MPAndroidChart, such as chart descriptions (`setDescription()`), axis labels (`setAxisLabels()`, formatters), legend labels, and any custom text annotations or tooltips.
    2.  **Sanitize Text Data:** Before passing text data to MPAndroidChart methods, sanitize it to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.  Focus on characters that could be interpreted as HTML or code if MPAndroidChart were to render text in a WebView (though less common in native Android charts, it's a good general practice). Use Android's `TextUtils.htmlEncode()` for basic HTML escaping or more robust sanitization libraries if needed.
    3.  **Validate Data Types:** Ensure that data passed to MPAndroidChart methods for labels and descriptions is of the expected type (typically strings). Validate the length and format of these strings to prevent unexpected behavior or potential buffer overflows (though less likely in modern Android environments, good practice).
    4.  **Apply to Formatters:** If using custom `ValueFormatter` or `AxisFormatter` classes in MPAndroidChart, ensure that any text generated within these formatters is also sanitized, especially if the formatter logic involves external or user-provided data.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium to High Severity, if chart data is rendered in a WebView or processed in a vulnerable way): Prevents injection of malicious scripts through chart labels or descriptions that could be executed in a web context or exploited by the application.
        *   Injection Attacks (Low to Medium Severity, depending on application logic): Reduces the risk of injecting malicious commands or data through chart inputs that could be processed by backend systems or application logic if chart labels are used in further processing.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS Mitigation: High impact - significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks related to chart text elements.
        *   Injection Attack Mitigation: Medium impact - reduces the risk of certain types of injection attacks related to chart text inputs.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic input validation is implemented for user input fields outside of the charting functionality in `UserInputValidator.java`. However, specific sanitization for text used *within* MPAndroidChart labels and descriptions is **not implemented**.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Sanitization needs to be implemented in the data processing layer, specifically within classes responsible for preparing data for MPAndroidChart (e.g., `ChartDataProcessor.java`). Sanitization should be applied right before setting labels, descriptions, and text elements using MPAndroidChart API calls.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and MPAndroidChart Library Updates](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_mpandroidchart_library_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Gradle Dependency Management:** Ensure your project uses Gradle for dependency management, which is standard for Android projects and essential for managing MPAndroidChart.
    2.  **Regularly Check for MPAndroidChart Updates:** Establish a schedule to check for new releases of the MPAndroidChart library. Monitor the official GitHub repository ([https://github.com/philjay/mpandroidchart](https://github.com/philjay/mpandroidchart)) for release announcements or use Gradle plugins like `com.github.ben-manes.versions` to detect outdated dependencies.
    3.  **Review MPAndroidChart Changelogs:** When updating MPAndroidChart, carefully review the release notes and changelogs provided by the library maintainers. Pay close attention to security fixes, bug fixes, and any notes about potential vulnerabilities addressed in the new version.
    4.  **Test After MPAndroidChart Updates:** After updating the MPAndroidChart library version in your `build.gradle` file and syncing Gradle, thoroughly test the charting functionality in your application. Ensure charts render correctly, data is displayed as expected, and no regressions have been introduced by the update.
    5.  **Consider Vulnerability Scanning for Dependencies:** While MPAndroidChart itself is actively maintained, consider using vulnerability scanning tools (like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk) to scan all your project dependencies, including MPAndroidChart and its transitive dependencies, for known vulnerabilities.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploiting Known MPAndroidChart Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity, depending on the vulnerability): Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities that might be discovered in older versions of the MPAndroidChart library.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Vulnerability Mitigation: High impact - significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities within the MPAndroidChart library itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Gradle is **used** for dependency management in `build.gradle`. Manual MPAndroidChart updates are performed **occasionally**, but there is no regular schedule or automated vulnerability scanning specifically for MPAndroidChart dependencies.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** A regular schedule for checking and updating MPAndroidChart needs to be established and documented. Integrating vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline, specifically targeting dependency vulnerabilities including MPAndroidChart, would enhance security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Management and DoS Prevention related to MPAndroidChart Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/resource_management_and_dos_prevention_related_to_mpandroidchart_rendering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Limit Data Points Rendered by MPAndroidChart:** Be mindful of the number of data points you are feeding into MPAndroidChart, especially for chart types that render many individual elements (e.g., scatter charts, large line charts).  If dealing with very large datasets, consider data aggregation or sampling *before* passing data to MPAndroidChart to reduce the rendering load.
    2.  **Optimize Chart Complexity:** Avoid creating excessively complex chart configurations that could strain device resources.  Limit the number of datasets, series, or annotations in a single chart if performance becomes an issue. Simplify chart styling and animations if necessary.
    3.  **Asynchronous Chart Data Loading:** Load and process chart data asynchronously in the background (e.g., using `AsyncTask`, `ExecutorService`, or Kotlin Coroutines) *before* passing it to MPAndroidChart for rendering. This prevents blocking the main UI thread and ensures the application remains responsive, even when preparing large or complex charts.
    4.  **Handle Large Data Gracefully:** Implement error handling or data truncation if the application encounters datasets that are too large for MPAndroidChart to render efficiently on target devices. Display user-friendly messages or provide options to reduce data complexity instead of crashing or freezing the application.
    5.  **Test on Target Devices:** Thoroughly test chart rendering performance on a range of target Android devices, especially lower-end devices, to identify potential performance bottlenecks related to MPAndroidChart and large datasets.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) via Chart Rendering (Medium Severity): Prevents attackers from causing the application to become unresponsive or crash by providing excessively large or complex datasets that overwhelm MPAndroidChart's rendering capabilities.
        *   Performance Degradation due to Chart Rendering (Low to Medium Severity): Prevents performance issues and slow UI rendering caused by inefficient chart configurations or excessive data, ensuring a smooth user experience.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS Mitigation: Medium to High impact - significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks specifically targeting chart rendering performance.
        *   Performance Degradation Mitigation: High impact - greatly improves application performance and responsiveness related to chart rendering, especially on lower-end devices.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Asynchronous data loading is **implemented** using `AsyncTask` in `ChartDataLoader.java`. Basic data point limits are **partially implemented** in `ChartDataProcessor.java`, but these limits are not strictly enforced in relation to MPAndroidChart rendering performance.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  More robust data point limits should be enforced specifically to prevent performance issues during MPAndroidChart rendering. These limits should be configurable and tested on target devices. Consider implementing dynamic data reduction or simplification techniques if datasets exceed rendering capabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Leakage Prevention through MPAndroidChart Customization Control](./mitigation_strategies/data_leakage_prevention_through_mpandroidchart_customization_control.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Chart Customization Options:** Carefully review all MPAndroidChart customization options you are using, particularly those related to displaying text, tooltips, and data values (e.g., `setValueFormatter()`, `setDescription()`, custom `MarkerView` implementations).
    2.  **Control Tooltip Content:** Be cautious about the information displayed in MPAndroidChart tooltips. Avoid displaying sensitive data in tooltips unless absolutely necessary. Customize tooltips to show only essential information and consider masking or aggregating sensitive values.
    3.  **Limit Data in Labels and Annotations:** Similarly, limit the amount of sensitive data displayed in chart labels, axis labels, and annotations. Use aggregated or anonymized representations of sensitive data in these elements if possible.
    4.  **Secure Custom MarkerViews:** If you are using custom `MarkerView` implementations in MPAndroidChart, ensure that these custom views do not inadvertently expose sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities. Review the layout and data binding logic of custom `MarkerViews`.
    5.  **Regularly Audit Chart Configurations:** Periodically audit your chart configurations to ensure that sensitive data is not being unnecessarily exposed through MPAndroidChart's customization features.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data Leakage / Information Disclosure via Charts (High Severity if sensitive data is exposed through chart elements): Prevents unintentional or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information through chart visualizations due to misconfigured customization options in MPAndroidChart.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Leakage Mitigation: High impact - significantly reduces the risk of sensitive data leakage specifically through MPAndroidChart's customizable elements like tooltips, labels, and annotations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic awareness of data sensitivity exists. However, specific controls or policies regarding the content displayed in MPAndroidChart tooltips, labels, and annotations are **not implemented**. Custom `MarkerViews` are **not currently used**, but this should be considered if implemented in the future.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Guidelines and code reviews should be implemented to ensure that sensitive data is minimized in MPAndroidChart tooltips, labels, and annotations. If custom `MarkerViews` are introduced, security reviews of their implementation should be mandatory.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling and Exception Management for MPAndroidChart Operations](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling_and_exception_management_for_mpandroidchart_operations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Wrap MPAndroidChart Calls in Try-Catch:** Enclose all calls to MPAndroidChart library methods and related data processing logic within `try-catch` blocks. This is crucial to handle potential exceptions that might be thrown by the library or during data preparation for charting.
    2.  **Catch MPAndroidChart Specific Exceptions:**  While general exception handling is important, try to identify and catch specific exception types that MPAndroidChart might throw (refer to MPAndroidChart documentation or source code if available). This allows for more targeted error handling and logging.
    3.  **Log Chart-Related Errors:** Within the `catch` blocks, log any exceptions that occur during MPAndroidChart operations. Include relevant context information in the logs, such as the chart type, data being processed (if safe to log), and the specific MPAndroidChart method that caused the error. Use a secure and centralized logging mechanism.
    4.  **User-Friendly Error Messages:** Display user-friendly error messages to the user if a chart cannot be rendered due to an exception. Avoid displaying detailed technical error messages or stack traces to end-users, as this could reveal sensitive information. Generic messages like "Chart rendering failed" or "Error displaying chart data" are preferable.
    5.  **Graceful Chart Failure:** If a chart rendering error occurs, ensure the application handles it gracefully.  Instead of crashing or freezing, display a message indicating that the chart is unavailable or cannot be displayed at this time. Provide alternative ways for users to access the data if possible (e.g., tabular view).

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Information Disclosure through Chart Error Messages (Low to Medium Severity): Prevents attackers from potentially gaining insights into the application's internal workings or data through overly detailed error messages generated by MPAndroidChart.
        *   Application Instability due to Chart Errors (Medium Severity): Prevents application crashes or unexpected behavior caused by unhandled exceptions originating from the MPAndroidChart library or related data processing.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Disclosure Mitigation: Medium impact - reduces the risk of information disclosure through chart-related error messages.
        *   Application Instability Mitigation: High impact - significantly improves application stability and robustness by handling exceptions during chart operations.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic `try-catch` blocks are **implemented** around some MPAndroidChart calls in `ChartRenderer.java`. Generic error messages are displayed to the user in case of chart rendering failures. Centralized error logging is **partially implemented** using `Log.e()`, but it's not a robust centralized system and may not capture sufficient context for chart-specific errors.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** More specific exception handling should be implemented in `ChartRenderer.java` to catch potential MPAndroidChart-specific exceptions. Error logging should be enhanced to capture more context related to chart operations and integrated into a centralized and secure logging system. User-facing error messages should be reviewed to ensure they are generic and do not reveal sensitive information.
