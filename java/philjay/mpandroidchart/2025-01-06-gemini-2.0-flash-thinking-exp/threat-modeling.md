# Threat Model Analysis for philjay/mpandroidchart

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection Leading to Application Crash or Unexpected Behavior](./threats/malicious_data_injection_leading_to_application_crash_or_unexpected_behavior.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Data Injection Leading to Application Crash or Unexpected Behavior

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted or malformed data to the application, which is then passed *directly to MPAndroidChart* for rendering. This malicious data exploits parsing vulnerabilities or unexpected edge cases *within the library's data handling logic*. This could involve excessively large values, incorrect data types, or specifically crafted strings that the library fails to handle safely.

**Impact:** The application crashes due to an error within MPAndroidChart, exhibits unexpected UI behavior *caused by the library's rendering of the malicious data* (e.g., distorted charts, infinite loops within the charting component), or becomes unresponsive specifically within the charting functionality.

**Affected Component:** `ChartData` objects, data parsing logic within various `Renderer` classes (e.g., `LineChartRenderer`, `BarChartRenderer`), and potentially input handling functions *within the library*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   While application-level input validation is crucial, also consider if MPAndroidChart offers any configuration options to enforce data constraints or handle invalid data more gracefully.
*   Keep MPAndroidChart updated, as updates may include fixes for data parsing vulnerabilities.
*   Thoroughly test the application with a wide range of input data, including edge cases and potentially malicious data patterns, to identify how MPAndroidChart behaves.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Through Complex Chart Rendering](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_complex_chart_rendering.md)

**Threat:** Resource Exhaustion Through Complex Chart Rendering

**Description:** An attacker triggers the rendering of extremely complex charts *by leveraging MPAndroidChart's features* to display large datasets, use intricate styling options supported by the library, or request chart types that are computationally expensive *for MPAndroidChart to render*. This directly overwhelms the device's resources (CPU, memory) *during the chart rendering process within the library*.

**Impact:** The application becomes slow and unresponsive *specifically during chart rendering*, potentially leading to an "Application Not Responding" (ANR) error or even device instability *directly attributable to the resource consumption of the charting library*.

**Affected Component:** Rendering engine within various `Renderer` classes, potentially the `View` component *managed by MPAndroidChart* responsible for drawing the chart.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Investigate if MPAndroidChart offers any built-in mechanisms to limit the complexity of rendering or handle large datasets more efficiently.
*   Consider using different chart types offered by MPAndroidChart that are less resource-intensive for large datasets if appropriate for the data being visualized.
*   Monitor the performance of chart rendering and consider implementing client-side or server-side data aggregation before passing data to MPAndroidChart if performance issues arise.
