## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_&_critical_node_exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles data provided to the MPAndroidChart library. This encompasses flaws in data validation, sanitization, and interpretation.
*   **How:** An attacker provides specially crafted data that is processed by the chart library. This data can exploit weaknesses in the library's or the application's handling of this input.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Data handling is a fundamental aspect of any application using MPAndroidChart. Failures in secure data handling are common and can lead to various severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Data](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_inject_malicious_data.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious content within the data provided to the chart, aiming to execute unintended actions or disclose sensitive information.
*   **How:** An attacker provides data containing malicious scripts or format string specifiers that are then processed and potentially rendered by the application.
*   **Why High Risk:** If the application renders chart elements (like labels or descriptions) in a context that allows script execution (e.g., a WebView without proper sanitization), injected scripts can compromise the user's session or perform unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH & CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Script in Labels/Descriptions](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_&_critical_node_inject_malicious_script_in_labelsdescriptions.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the labels or descriptions of the chart.
*   **How:** An attacker provides data for chart labels or descriptions that includes `<script>` tags or other JavaScript execution vectors. If the application renders these labels in a WebView without proper sanitization, the injected script will execute.
*   **Why High Risk:** This is a classic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge. This is a common vulnerability if developers are not careful with input and output handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Configuration/Customization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_configurationcustomization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Abusing the customization options provided by MPAndroidChart, particularly through custom formatters, to inject and execute malicious code.
*   **How:** An attacker leverages the ability to define custom formatters for chart values to inject malicious code that is then executed by the application when the chart is rendered.
*   **Why Critical:** This allows for arbitrary code execution within the application's context, representing a complete compromise of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Custom Formatters](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_custom_formatters.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code in Custom Value Formatters](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_in_custom_value_formatters.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious custom value formatter that, when used by the application, executes arbitrary code.
*   **How:** If the application allows users or external sources to provide custom value formatters (e.g., through a plugin system or insecure configuration), an attacker can create a formatter containing malicious code. When the chart uses this formatter to display values, the malicious code is executed within the application's process.
*   **Why Critical:** This is a direct path to arbitrary code execution. The attacker gains full control over the application, potentially allowing them to steal data, manipulate application state, or use the application as a launchpad for further attacks. While the likelihood might be lower depending on application design, the impact is catastrophic.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH RISK PATH: Exploit Rendering Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high_risk_path_exploit_rendering_process_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting potential weaknesses in the chart's rendering process to cause resource exhaustion, leading to a Denial of Service.
*   **How:** An attacker provides data or configurations that force the chart library to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during the rendering process.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Denial of Service can disrupt the application's functionality and availability. While it might not directly lead to data theft, it can severely impact the user experience and the application's reliability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Resource Exhaustion During Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_resource_exhaustion_during_rendering.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Data Leading to Excessive Memory Usage](./attack_tree_paths/provide_data_leading_to_excessive_memory_usage.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Supplying the chart with extremely large or complex datasets that require a significant amount of memory to process and render.
*   **How:** An attacker provides data with a very large number of data points, complex structures, or unusual patterns that overwhelm the chart's rendering engine, leading to excessive memory allocation.
*   **Why High Risk:** This is a relatively easy attack to execute (low effort, beginner skill level) and can lead to application crashes due to OutOfMemory errors. While the impact is generally a Denial of Service, it can still significantly disrupt the application's functionality and user experience.
