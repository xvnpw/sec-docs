# Attack Surface Analysis for philjay/mpandroidchart

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection via Chart Data](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_via_chart_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted or malicious data intended to be displayed by the chart.
*   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart directly consumes and renders the data provided to it. If this data is not properly validated and sanitized by the application, the library will process the malicious input.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides extremely long strings for labels, causing excessive memory allocation and potentially crashing the application. Alternatively, they could inject specially crafted numerical data that, when processed by the library's calculations, leads to unexpected behavior or errors.
*   **Impact:** Application crash (Denial of Service), unexpected behavior, potential for exploiting underlying library vulnerabilities (though less likely), resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all data before passing it to MPAndroidChart. Check data types, ranges, and formats.
    *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize string inputs to prevent excessively long strings or special characters that might cause issues.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around the chart rendering process to gracefully handle unexpected data and prevent crashes.
    *   **Consider Data Source Trust:** If the data source is untrusted (e.g., user input, external APIs), treat it with extra caution and implement stricter validation.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Payloads in Custom MarkerViews](./attack_surfaces/malicious_payloads_in_custom_markerviews.md)

**Description:**  Developers use custom `MarkerView`s to display information on user interaction. If these custom views handle user-provided data insecurely, they can be exploited.
*   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart provides the framework for using custom `MarkerView`s, allowing developers to integrate their own layouts and logic. If the developer's custom code within the `MarkerView` is vulnerable, it becomes part of the application's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A custom `MarkerView` displays user-provided labels without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within the label, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the `MarkerView` uses a `WebView` to display content.
*   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), arbitrary code execution within the context of the application (if using `WebView`), information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure `MarkerView` Implementation:**  Treat data displayed in custom `MarkerView`s as potentially untrusted. Sanitize and validate any user-provided data before displaying it.
    *   **Avoid `WebView` for Untrusted Content:** If possible, avoid using `WebView` within `MarkerView`s to display untrusted content. If it's necessary, implement strict security measures for the `WebView`.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If using `WebView`, implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS risks.
