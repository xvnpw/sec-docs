### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving MPAndroidChart

Here's a list of high and critical severity threats that directly involve the MPAndroidChart library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection
    *   **Description:** Maliciously crafted data, when passed to MPAndroidChart's `setData()` methods, can cause unexpected or incorrect chart rendering. This can mislead users or hide critical information. The vulnerability lies in how MPAndroidChart processes and visualizes the provided data.
    *   **Impact:** Users may make incorrect decisions based on flawed visualizations. Critical information could be obscured. In severe cases, malformed data could potentially trigger crashes or unexpected behavior within the charting library itself.
    *   **Affected Component:** `setData()` methods across various Chart classes (e.g., `LineChart`, `BarChart`, `PieChart`), `ChartData` objects.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data *before* passing it to MPAndroidChart.
        *   Consider displaying charts in a read-only mode if the data source is inherently untrusted.
        *   Keep MPAndroidChart updated to the latest version, as updates may contain fixes for data handling vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Chart Elements
    *   **Description:** MPAndroidChart is used to display labels, tooltips, or axis descriptions that inadvertently contain sensitive information. The library itself is the mechanism through which this information is presented to the user.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, potentially leading to privacy violations, compliance issues, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Methods for setting labels, descriptions, and tooltip content within MPAndroidChart (e.g., `setLabel()`, `setDescription()`, `setValueFormatter()`, `setDrawValues()`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Practice data minimization: only display necessary information in chart elements using MPAndroidChart's API.
        *   Carefully review all labels, tooltips, and axis descriptions configured within MPAndroidChart for sensitive data.
        *   Consider using aggregated or anonymized data in charts when displaying sensitive information is not essential.

*   **Threat:** Rendering Errors or Crashes due to Malicious Data
    *   **Description:** Specifically crafted malicious data passed to MPAndroidChart can exploit potential vulnerabilities within the library's rendering engine, leading to unexpected visual errors or application crashes. The vulnerability resides within MPAndroidChart's code responsible for drawing the charts.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, crashes directly caused by MPAndroidChart, and potential for exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities (if any exist within the library).
    *   **Affected Component:** Drawing routines within various Chart renderers in MPAndroidChart (e.g., `LineChartRenderer`, `BarChartRenderer`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep MPAndroidChart updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in the rendering engine.
        *   Perform thorough testing with various data inputs, including edge cases and potentially malformed data, to identify rendering issues caused by MPAndroidChart.
        *   Implement robust error handling around MPAndroidChart calls to gracefully handle unexpected errors originating from the library.
