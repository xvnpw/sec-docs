# Attack Surface Analysis for philjay/mpandroidchart

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Chart Data Input](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_chart_data_input.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide crafted data to MPAndroidChart to cause crashes, resource exhaustion, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the library's parsing or rendering logic. This is the *primary* attack vector directly related to the library's core functionality.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** MPAndroidChart's core function is processing and displaying numerical/categorical data. This data processing is the direct entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides `NaN`, `Infinity`, extremely large/small numbers, or specially crafted strings as data points, aiming to trigger errors or unexpected behavior within MPAndroidChart's internal calculations or rendering routines.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crash or unresponsiveness.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Excessive memory or CPU usage, leading to slowdowns or crashes.
        *   Potentially (very low probability, but high impact) arbitrary code execution *if* a severe parsing flaw exists that allows for injection.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is relatively easy to achieve; code execution is highly unlikely but has a critical impact if possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** The application *must* rigorously validate *all* data *before* passing it to MPAndroidChart. This is the *most critical* mitigation:
            *   **Type Checking:** Ensure data types are correct (numbers are numbers, etc.).
            *   **Range Checking:** Enforce strict minimum and maximum values for numerical data.
            *   **Format Validation:** Validate the format of all data, including strings.
            *   **Sanitization:** Remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing tools specifically targeting MPAndroidChart's data input interfaces to identify vulnerabilities.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement application-level limits on the amount of data the chart can process.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Handle any exceptions thrown by MPAndroidChart gracefully, without exposing internal details to the user.

## Attack Surface: [2. Lack of Library Updates and Maintenance (Indirect, but High Risk)](./attack_surfaces/2__lack_of_library_updates_and_maintenance__indirect__but_high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** If MPAndroidChart is not actively maintained, newly discovered vulnerabilities within the library itself will not be patched. This directly impacts the security of applications using it.
    *   **How MPAndroidChart Contributes:** This is a direct risk related to the state of the MPAndroidChart library itself.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability is discovered in MPAndroidChart's handling of a specific data type, but no patch is released because the project is abandoned.
    *   **Impact:** Applications using the library become increasingly vulnerable over time as new exploits targeting unpatched vulnerabilities are discovered.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (increases over time).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Monitor Project Activity:** Regularly check the MPAndroidChart GitHub repository for updates, issue reports, and recent commits.
        *   **Alternative Libraries:** Actively evaluate alternative charting libraries that are actively maintained and have a good security track record. Be prepared to migrate if necessary.
        *   **Fork and Maintain (Last Resort):** If no suitable alternatives exist and the library is *essential*, consider forking the project and maintaining it internally. This is a *significant* undertaking and requires substantial resources and expertise. This should only be considered if the application's reliance on MPAndroidChart is unavoidable and the risk of using an unmaintained library is unacceptable.
