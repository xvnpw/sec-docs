# Threat Model Analysis for philjay/mpandroidchart

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Malformed Data (Large Datasets)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_malformed_data__large_datasets_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large dataset (e.g., millions of data points) to the chart, exceeding expected limits. This overwhelms the library's processing and rendering capabilities, causing the application to become unresponsive or crash. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating user input fields, intercepting and modifying network requests, or exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow them to control the data fed to the chart.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability; potential for device instability if memory exhaustion occurs.
    *   **Affected MPAndroidChart Component:**
        *   `ChartData` and its subclasses (e.g., `LineData`, `BarData`, `PieData`).
        *   Rendering engines (e.g., `LineChartRenderer`, `BarChartRenderer`).
        *   Data processing functions within `DataSet` subclasses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Data Point Limit):** Enforce a strict maximum number of data points allowed per chart. This limit should be based on performance testing and reasonable usage scenarios.
        *   **Data Aggregation:** For very large datasets, implement server-side or client-side data aggregation (e.g., downsampling, averaging) *before* passing data to MPAndroidChart.  Display a representative subset of the data.
        *   **Progressive Loading:** If large datasets are unavoidable, implement progressive loading or "lazy loading" of data.  Load and render only the visible portion of the chart, fetching additional data as the user scrolls or zooms.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor memory and CPU usage during chart rendering.  Implement timeouts or cancellation mechanisms if resource consumption exceeds predefined thresholds.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Malformed Data (Invalid Values)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_malformed_data__invalid_values_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides invalid data values (e.g., `NaN`, `Infinity`, extremely large/small numbers, incorrect data types) to the chart.  This triggers unexpected behavior or errors within the library's parsing and rendering logic, potentially leading to crashes or hangs. The attacker might exploit input validation flaws or manipulate data in transit.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash or unresponsiveness.
    *   **Affected MPAndroidChart Component:**
        *   `Entry` and its subclasses (e.g., `BarEntry`, `PieEntry`).
        *   Data validation checks (if any) within `DataSet` and `ChartData` classes.
        *   Numerical processing functions within rendering engines.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Data Type Validation:** Ensure that all data values passed to MPAndroidChart conform to the expected data types (e.g., float, int). Reject any values that are `NaN`, `Infinity`, or outside acceptable ranges.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all input data to remove or replace any characters or values that could cause parsing errors.
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Within the application code that interacts with MPAndroidChart, add checks for `null` or invalid data *before* passing it to the library.  Handle potential exceptions gracefully.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Conduct fuzz testing specifically targeting the chart data input pathways with a variety of invalid and unexpected values.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Unpatched Library Vulnerability (Example: Buffer Overflow)](./threats/exploitation_of_unpatched_library_vulnerability__example_buffer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** A publicly disclosed vulnerability exists in a specific version of MPAndroidChart (e.g., a buffer overflow in a particular rendering function). An attacker crafts a malicious input that exploits this vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service. The attacker would need to know the specific vulnerability and the version of the library being used.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Could range from application crashes to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected MPAndroidChart Component:** Depends on the specific vulnerability (could be any component).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a remote code execution vulnerability exists), High (for DoS vulnerabilities).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Library Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly updating MPAndroidChart to the latest stable version.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:**  Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) for reports related to MPAndroidChart.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Gradle) to track and update library versions.
        *   **Rapid Patching:**  Have a plan in place to quickly apply security patches when they become available.
