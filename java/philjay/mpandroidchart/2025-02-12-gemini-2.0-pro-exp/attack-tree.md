## Attack Tree Path: [1. Data Manipulation/Leakage](./attack_tree_paths/1__data_manipulationleakage.md)

*   **!!! 1. Data Manipulation/Leakage !!! (Critical Node):**

    *   **Overall Description:** This is the most critical area of concern, encompassing attacks that aim to steal or manipulate data displayed within the chart, or leverage the chart as a vector for other attacks (like XSS).
    *   **Overall Likelihood:** Medium (The likelihood of *some* form of data manipulation attack is moderate, given the commonality of input fields and the potential for design flaws.)
    *   **Overall Impact:** High to Very High (Data breaches are extremely serious, potentially leading to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.)
    *   **Overall Effort:** Low to Medium (Depending on the specific vulnerability, the effort required can range from trivial to moderately challenging.)
    *   **Overall Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (Many data manipulation attacks can be carried out with basic knowledge of web vulnerabilities.)
    *   **Overall Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Detection can be challenging, requiring careful monitoring of inputs, outputs, and system logs.)

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. Injection via Input Fields](./attack_tree_paths/1a__injection_via_input_fields.md)

*   **Sub-Node:** `*** 1a. Injection via Input Fields ***` (High-Risk Path)

    *   **Description:** If the application allows user input to directly or indirectly populate chart data (labels, values, etc.) without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious payloads. This is primarily a vulnerability in *how the application uses* MPAndroidChart, not the library itself.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **JavaScript Injection (Indirect):** If chart data is passed to a WebView and rendered using a JavaScript charting library *via* MPAndroidChart's data, an attacker could inject `<script>` tags.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Indirect:** Similar to above, if chart data is displayed in a context where XSS is possible.
        *   **SQL Injection (Indirect):** If user input is used to construct SQL queries that *then* fetch data for the chart.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on the application's input handling practices.)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Data breaches, XSS leading to account takeover, SQL injection leading to complete database compromise.)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploiting basic injection vulnerabilities is often straightforward.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (Basic injection techniques are well-documented.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring input, output, and potentially server logs. WAFs can help.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strict Input Validation: Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on *all* user-provided data. Use whitelisting.
        *   Output Encoding: If data is passed to a WebView, ensure proper output encoding.
        *   Parameterized Queries: Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements) for database interactions.
        *   Principle of Least Privilege: Limit database user permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1b. Data Exposure in Tooltips or Legends](./attack_tree_paths/1b__data_exposure_in_tooltips_or_legends.md)

*   **Sub-Node:** `*** 1b. Data Exposure in Tooltips or Legends ***` (High-Risk Path)

    *   **Description:** The application displays sensitive data directly within chart tooltips, legends, or labels without considering the context of display. This is a design flaw in how the application uses MPAndroidChart.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Displaying full credit card numbers or PII in tooltips.
        *   Showing internal system IDs or API keys in chart labels.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the application's design and data sensitivity.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Exposure of PII, sensitive business data, or internal system information.)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Simply viewing the chart.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (No technical skill required.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (The exposed data is directly visible.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Data Masking/Truncation: Display only a portion of sensitive data.
        *   Aggregation: Display aggregated or anonymized data.
        *   Context-Aware Display: Consider the environment where the chart will be displayed.
        *   User Permissions: Implement access controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [2a. Malformed Chart Data](./attack_tree_paths/2a__malformed_chart_data.md)

*   **`*** 2a. Malformed Chart Data ***` (High-Risk Path):**

    *   **Description:** An attacker intentionally provides extremely large datasets or creates overly complex chart configurations to overwhelm the library and cause the application to become unresponsive or crash (Denial of Service).
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Submitting a form that generates a chart with millions of data points.
        *   Creating a chart with an excessive number of series or groups.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (If the application doesn't limit input size or complexity, this is easy to trigger.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Application slowdown or crash, affecting user experience.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Submitting large amounts of data is often straightforward.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice (No specialized knowledge required.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Application slowdown or crash is usually obvious.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Input Limits: Enforce limits on the size and complexity of data.
        *   Data Aggregation: Pre-aggregate data on the server-side.
        *   Progress Indicators: Display a progress indicator during rendering.
        *   Asynchronous Processing: Render large charts in a background thread.
        *   Timeout mechanism: Implement timeout for chart rendering.
