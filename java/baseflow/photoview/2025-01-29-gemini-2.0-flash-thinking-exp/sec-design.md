# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is focused on leveraging the `photoview` Android library to enhance the user experience within a mobile application that displays images. The primary business priority is to provide users with a smooth and intuitive image viewing experience, specifically focusing on zoom and pan functionalities. The goal is to increase user engagement and satisfaction with the application by offering a polished and user-friendly image interaction.

The most important business risks associated with this project are:

- Risk of user dissatisfaction if the `photoview` library introduces bugs or performance issues, negatively impacting the image viewing experience.
- Risk of potential security vulnerabilities within the `photoview` library itself, or in its integration, that could be exploited within the application.
- Risk of dependency on a third-party library that may become unmaintained or incompatible with future application updates, leading to technical debt or rework.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) practices are assumed to be in place for the application that will integrate the `photoview` library. This includes code reviews, static and dynamic analysis, and security testing, although specific details are not provided for the `photoview` library itself.
- security control: Dependency management practices are assumed to be in place for the application, including tracking and updating third-party libraries like `photoview`.
- security control: Application deployment through official app stores (e.g., Google Play Store) provides a level of security through app vetting processes, although this is not specific to the `photoview` library.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on a third-party open-source library introduces a degree of inherent risk, as the security and maintenance of the library are not directly controlled by the application development team.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities within the `photoview` library may exist and could be discovered in the future. Mitigation relies on timely updates and security patching by the library maintainers and the application development team.

Recommended security controls:

- recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to continuously monitor the `photoview` library and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, of the application that integrates the `photoview` library, paying specific attention to image handling and user interactions.
- recommended security control: Establish a process for monitoring security advisories and updates related to the `photoview` library and its dependencies, and promptly apply necessary patches or updates.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Authentication is not directly relevant to the `photoview` library itself, as it is a UI component. Authentication is expected to be handled by the application using the library to control access to images and application features.
- Authorization: Authorization is also not directly relevant to the `photoview` library. The application using the library must implement authorization mechanisms to ensure users only access images they are permitted to view.
- Input validation: Input validation is important in the context of how the application loads and displays images using the `photoview` library. The application must validate image sources (e.g., URLs, file paths) and image data to prevent issues like path traversal or malicious image files. Input validation should be implemented in the application layer before passing image data to the `photoview` library.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a direct requirement for the `photoview` library itself. However, the application using the library may need to employ cryptography for secure storage or transmission of images, depending on the application's requirements. This would be implemented outside of the `photoview` library.
