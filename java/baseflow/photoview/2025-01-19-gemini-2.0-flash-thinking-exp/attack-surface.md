# Attack Surface Analysis for baseflow/photoview

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Source (URI/Path)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_source__uripath_.md)

*   **Description:** The application provides a URI or file path to PhotoView to load an image. If this source is attacker-controlled or influenced, malicious content can be loaded.
    *   **How PhotoView Contributes:** PhotoView directly consumes the provided URI/path to fetch and display the image. It doesn't inherently validate the safety or integrity of the source.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate a URL parameter to point to an extremely large image hosted on their server, or to a local file the application has access to but shouldn't display.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption (memory, bandwidth).
        *   Information Disclosure if a path to a sensitive local file is provided and accessible.
        *   Potential for triggering vulnerabilities in underlying image decoding libraries if a malformed image is loaded.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for image URIs/paths.
            *   Use a whitelist of allowed image sources or domains.
            *   Set limits on the maximum size of images that can be loaded.
            *   Avoid directly using user-provided input as image paths without validation.
        *   **Users:** (Limited direct control, but awareness is key)
            *   Be cautious about clicking on links or opening content from untrusted sources that might load images.
