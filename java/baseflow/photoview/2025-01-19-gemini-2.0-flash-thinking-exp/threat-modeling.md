# Threat Model Analysis for baseflow/photoview

## Threat: [Malicious Image Rendering Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/malicious_image_rendering_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft a specially formatted image (e.g., with excessive metadata, deeply nested layers, or unusual compression techniques) and provide it to the application for display using PhotoView. When PhotoView attempts to render or process this image for zooming or panning, it could trigger a bug within PhotoView's code or its interaction with the browser's rendering engine. This could lead to excessive CPU or memory consumption specifically within the PhotoView component, causing the user's browser tab or the entire browser to become unresponsive or crash.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unusable for the affected user. In severe cases, it could impact the user's entire browsing session or device performance due to resource exhaustion caused by PhotoView.
*   **Affected Component:** Image loading and rendering logic within PhotoView, potentially its core rendering algorithms or interaction with browser APIs like Canvas.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement server-side validation and sanitization of uploaded images *before* they are passed to PhotoView for display. This includes checking file headers and potentially re-encoding images to a safe format.
    *   Set reasonable limits on the size and resolution of images that can be displayed *by* PhotoView.
    *   Monitor client-side resource usage *specifically when PhotoView is rendering images* and implement error handling to gracefully handle rendering failures within the PhotoView component.
    *   Keep the PhotoView library updated to the latest version, as updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements that can mitigate such rendering issues within the library itself.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Potential Vulnerabilities in PhotoView](./threats/exploitation_of_potential_vulnerabilities_in_photoview.md)

*   **Description:** The PhotoView library itself might contain undiscovered or publicly known security vulnerabilities in its code. An attacker could craft specific inputs or interactions with the PhotoView component to trigger these vulnerabilities. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, including cross-site scripting (XSS) if the library manipulates DOM elements insecurely, or other more severe issues depending on the nature of the flaw within PhotoView's implementation.
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability within PhotoView. It could range from injecting malicious scripts into the page (XSS) to potentially more severe issues if the vulnerability allows for further exploitation.
*   **Affected Component:** Any module or function within the PhotoView library that contains the vulnerability. This could be related to image processing, event handling, or DOM manipulation within PhotoView's code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the PhotoView library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for reports related to the PhotoView library.
    *   Consider performing security code reviews of the PhotoView library's integration within your application to identify potential misuse or areas where vulnerabilities could be introduced.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities within PhotoView or its integration.
