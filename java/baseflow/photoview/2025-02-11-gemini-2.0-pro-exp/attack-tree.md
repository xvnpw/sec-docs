## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Image Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_image_handling__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector, focusing on vulnerabilities related to how `photoview` (or the underlying image processing libraries it uses) processes image data. Image parsing is a complex process, and vulnerabilities are frequently found in image libraries.
*   **Rationale:** This is considered critical due to the high likelihood of vulnerabilities existing in image parsing code and the high impact of successful exploitation (DoS or RCE).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Malformed Image Data](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_malformed_image_data.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a specially crafted image file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the image parsing or rendering process.
*   **Rationale:** This is a high-risk path because it's a common attack method, and image formats can be complex, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Craft Image (e.g., BOM, Corrupt Header) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_craft_image__e_g___bom__corrupt_header___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates an image file with a manipulated Byte Order Mark (BOM), a corrupted header, invalid metadata, or other malformed data. The goal is to trigger unexpected behavior in the image decoding process, potentially leading to buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other exploitable conditions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. While image libraries are designed to handle various formats, edge cases and vulnerabilities in specific codecs or parsing routines can exist.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application, or potentially even remote code execution (RCE) if a memory corruption vulnerability is exploited.
*   **Effort:** Medium. The attacker needs to understand image file formats and potential vulnerabilities to craft a malicious image. Tools and techniques for creating malformed images are available.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High. Requires knowledge of image file formats, memory corruption vulnerabilities, and potentially exploit development techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Security software (antivirus, intrusion detection systems) might detect known exploit signatures. Otherwise, detection relies on observing application crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Crash App [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_crash_app__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's immediate goal is to cause the application to crash by providing a malformed image that triggers an unhandled exception or error during processing.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. A malformed image can easily cause a crash if the application or underlying libraries don't handle errors gracefully.
*   **Impact:** Medium. Results in a Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unusable until restarted.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires finding or creating an image that triggers a crash.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of image formats and potential parsing errors.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low. A crash is easily detectable, although the root cause (the specific malformed image) might require further investigation.
