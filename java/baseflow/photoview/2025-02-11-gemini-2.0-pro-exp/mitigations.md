# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for baseflow/photoview

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Image Source Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_image_source_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Sources:** Create a configuration file or a hardcoded list that explicitly defines the allowed image sources (domains, URL prefixes, or *very* restricted local paths).
    2.  **URL Parsing:** Before passing *any* URL to `photoview`, use a robust URL parsing library to decompose the URL.
    3.  **Scheme Check:** Verify the URL scheme is `https://` (or `file://` only if absolutely necessary and with further, stringent restrictions). Reject other schemes.
    4.  **Host/Domain Check:** Compare the parsed host (domain) against the whitelist. Reject if not in the whitelist.
    5.  **Path Traversal Prevention:** Examine the parsed path. Ensure it does not contain `../` or `..\`. Normalize the path.
    6.  **Query Parameter Validation:** Validate each query parameter's name and value against expected formats.
    7.  **Content-Type Header Check (Post-Fetch):** After fetching the image data (but *before* passing it to `photoview`), check the `Content-Type` header. Ensure it's an expected image MIME type.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Image Source Manipulation (Severity: High):** Prevents `photoview` from displaying images from malicious sources. This is the *core* threat.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** If a vulnerability exists in the underlying image decoding library, this prevents `photoview` from being used to deliver the exploit.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents `photoview` from loading and displaying unintended local files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Image Source Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced (almost eliminated with a well-maintained whitelist).
    *   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced (prevents exploit delivery to `photoview`).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic scheme and domain checks in `ImageLoader.kt`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Full whitelist, path traversal prevention, query parameter validation, Content-Type check, robust URL parsing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Image Size and Resource Limits](./mitigation_strategies/image_size_and_resource_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Maximum Dimensions:** Set maximum width and height limits (e.g., `MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH`, `MAX_IMAGE_HEIGHT`).
    2.  **Define Maximum File Size:** Set a maximum file size limit (e.g., `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE`).
    3.  **Pre-Check Dimensions/Size (If Possible):** If image metadata is available *before* downloading, check against the limits. Reject if exceeded.
    4.  **In-Memory Check (If Pre-Check Not Possible):** Load the image in a way that lets you check dimensions *without* fully decoding (e.g., `BitmapFactory.Options.inJustDecodeBounds = true` in Android). Reject if exceeded.
    5.  **Timeout:** Implement a timeout for image loading. Abort if it takes too long.
    6. **Progressive Loading (If Supported):** If the underlying image loading mechanism (used by `photoview`) supports it, enable progressive loading.

    *Crucially, steps 3, 4, and 6 are about preventing the data from even reaching `photoview`'s full processing if it's already known to be problematic.*

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Images (Severity: Medium):** Prevents `photoview` from attempting to process images that could crash the app.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Protects device resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic timeout in `ImageLoader.kt`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Maximum dimension/file size checks, pre-checks, progressive loading utilization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Input to `photoview`'s API](./mitigation_strategies/secure_input_to__photoview_'s_api.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Understand `photoview`'s API:** Thoroughly review the `photoview` library's API documentation. Identify all methods that accept input (e.g., URLs, file paths, byte arrays, input streams).
    2. **Validate All Input:**  *Before* calling any `photoview` API method, rigorously validate *all* input parameters.  This includes:
        *   **URLs/File Paths:** Apply the "Strict Image Source Validation" strategy described above.
        *   **Byte Arrays/Input Streams:** If you're providing image data directly (not via a URL), ensure the data originates from a trusted source and has been validated (e.g., Content-Type, size limits).  *Never* pass unvalidated user-provided data directly to `photoview`.
        *   **Other Parameters:**  Check any other parameters (e.g., configuration options) for expected types and values.
    3. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for all `photoview` API calls.  Handle potential exceptions gracefully (e.g., `IOException`, `IllegalArgumentException`).  Do *not* allow the application to crash or leak sensitive information due to unexpected errors.  Log errors securely.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Image Source Manipulation (Severity: High):**  Ensures that only validated data is ever passed to `photoview`.
    * **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attacker-controlled data from reaching potentially vulnerable image decoding routines via `photoview`.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):**  Prevents malformed or excessively large data from being processed by `photoview`.
    * **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium):** Prevents `photoview` from accessing or displaying unintended data.

* **Impact:**
    * **All Threats:** Risk significantly reduced by ensuring that `photoview` only receives validated, expected input.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Basic URL validation (scheme and domain) before calling `photoview.setImageURI()`.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Comprehensive input validation for all `photoview` API methods.
    * Robust error handling for all `photoview` interactions.
    * Validation of byte arrays/input streams (if used).
