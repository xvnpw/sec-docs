# Threat Model Analysis for baseflow/photoview

## Threat: [Malicious Library Substitution (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/malicious_library_substitution__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the distribution channel (e.g., CDN, npm registry) and replaces the legitimate `photoview` library with a modified version containing malicious code. The attacker could inject code to steal user data, redirect users to phishing sites, or perform other malicious actions directly within the context of the `photoview` library's execution.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's client-side security where `photoview` is used. The attacker gains control over `photoview`'s functionality, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or further exploitation through actions triggered by the library.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire `photoview` library (all modules and functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Include the `integrity` attribute in the `<script>` tag that loads `photoview`. This ensures the browser verifies the library's hash before executing it.
    *   **Use a Trusted Package Manager:** Use npm or yarn with lockfiles (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to ensure consistent and verifiable dependencies.
    *   **Regularly Audit Dependencies:** Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including `photoview`.
    *   **Consider Self-Hosting:** If the risk is deemed very high, host a verified copy of the `photoview` library on your own server instead of relying on a CDN.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Image](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_image.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely large image (in terms of file size or dimensions) directly to `photoview`. This causes `photoview` to consume excessive memory or CPU resources during image loading and rendering, leading to browser crashes or unresponsiveness. The attacker could repeatedly trigger this to make the application unusable *specifically where `photoview` is used*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service for the user, specifically impacting the functionality provided by `photoview`. The application becomes unresponsive when attempting to display the malicious image using `photoview`, preventing legitimate users from interacting with the image viewer.
*   **Affected Component:** `PhotoView` constructor, `update` method, and internal image loading and rendering logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Image Validation:** Implement strict limits on image file size and dimensions *before* sending the image to the client and `photoview`. Reject images that exceed these limits.  This is the primary defense.
    *   **Server-Side Image Resizing:** Resize and optimize images on the server-side to reduce their size before sending them to the client and `photoview`.
    *   **Client-Side Size Checks (Less Reliable):** As a secondary defense, implement JavaScript checks *before* passing data to `photoview` to limit the size of images. However, rely primarily on server-side validation.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on image uploads or requests to prevent attackers from flooding the server with malicious images intended for `photoview`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed Image](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_malformed_image.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed image file that, while appearing valid, exploits a vulnerability in `photoview`'s *own* image parsing or rendering logic. This causes `photoview` to enter an unstable state, leading to excessive resource consumption, crashes, or potentially even arbitrary code execution (though less likely, this would be a critical vulnerability *within* `photoview`).
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, specifically targeting `photoview`. This leads to browser crashes or unresponsiveness when `photoview` attempts to process the malicious image. In a worst-case scenario (and less likely), it could lead to code execution *within the context of `photoview`*.
*   **Affected Component:** Image parsing and rendering logic within `photoview` (potentially related to specific image formats or codecs handled by `photoview`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if code execution is possible)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `photoview` Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of `photoview` to benefit from security patches that address any discovered vulnerabilities in its image handling. This is crucial.
    *   **Server-Side Image Validation:** Use a robust image processing library on the server-side to validate the integrity of images and detect any malformed data *before* sending them to the client and `photoview`. This acts as a filter before `photoview` processes the image.
    *   **Fuzz Testing (for Developers of `photoview`):** Perform fuzz testing on `photoview`'s image parsing and rendering code to identify potential vulnerabilities. This is a proactive measure for the library maintainers.
