# Attack Surface Analysis for baseflow/photoview

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Exploits](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in underlying image decoding libraries (e.g., Android's built-in decoders) through specially crafted image files.
*   **How `photoview` Contributes:** `photoview` acts as the mechanism for displaying the image, and thus, triggering the decoding process. It doesn't *cause* the vulnerability, but it's the pathway.  The library's interaction with the system's image decoders is the direct link.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a JPEG image with a malformed header that exploits a known buffer overflow vulnerability in the Android JPEG decoder. When `photoview` attempts to display this image (and passes it to the system decoder), the vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE), Denial of Service (DoS) through application crashes, potential information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if an ACE vulnerability exists in the underlying decoder) or **High** (for DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use a robust image loading library (e.g., Glide, Picasso) *before* passing the image data (ideally as a `Bitmap` or similar, *not* a raw file path or URI) to `photoview`.  This pre-processing step is crucial.
    *   **Developer:** Implement server-side image sanitization and resizing.  Process images on a trusted server before they reach the mobile app. This moves the most vulnerable decoding off the device.
    *   **Developer:** Validate image dimensions and file sizes before loading, *even before* passing to a helper library like Glide. Reject excessively large or unusually formatted images. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **User/Developer:** Ensure the Android system and any image decoding libraries are up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is the most fundamental mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/memory_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Loading extremely large images or rapidly zooming/panning on high-resolution images can consume excessive memory, leading to application crashes.
*   **How `photoview` Contributes:** `photoview`'s internal image scaling, caching, and rendering mechanisms *directly* determine how much memory is used when displaying and manipulating images.  The library's core functionality is responsible for managing these resources.
*   **Example:** A user attempts to load a 100-megapixel image. If `photoview` doesn't handle this gracefully (e.g., by downscaling internally, using tiling, or efficiently releasing unused bitmaps), the app might run out of memory and crash.  The library's behavior is the direct cause.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Review `photoview`'s code for potential memory leaks or inefficient bitmap handling. Contribute improvements if necessary. This is a direct mitigation targeting the library itself.
    *   **Developer:** Set reasonable limits on image size and resolution within the application. Downscale images *before* passing them to `photoview`.  This pre-processing reduces the load on the library.
    *   **Developer:** Implement robust error handling. If memory limits are approached, display an error message instead of crashing.  This provides a graceful fallback.
    *   **Developer:** Use memory profiling tools to identify and address memory usage bottlenecks *specifically within* `photoview`'s operations.
