# Threat Model Analysis for baseflow/photoview

## Threat: [Malicious Image Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image that exploits vulnerabilities in how `photoview` handles or renders images. This could be due to flaws in any custom image processing within `photoview` or how it interacts with the browser's rendering engine. The attacker might host this image or trick a user into providing it.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application or browser crash), potential for arbitrary code execution within the user's browser if a severe vulnerability is exploited in `photoview`'s image handling logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially custom image handling logic within `photoview`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the application uses the latest version of `photoview` to benefit from any security patches.
        *   Minimize custom image processing within the application or `photoview` integration and rely on well-established browser capabilities.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which images can be loaded.
        *   Consider server-side image validation and sanitization before displaying images with `photoview`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in PhotoView's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_photoview's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `photoview` relies on other JavaScript libraries or browser APIs. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to exploit them indirectly through `photoview` by triggering specific actions or providing inputs that expose the vulnerability within the dependency as used by `photoview`.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to XSS, data breaches, or other security issues that impact the application using `photoview`.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying JavaScript libraries or browser APIs used by `photoview`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the specific dependency vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the `photoview` library and all its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
