* **Threat:** Malicious Image Exploitation (Denial of Service)
    * **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file. When PhotoView attempts to render this image, vulnerabilities *within PhotoView's own image processing logic* or the underlying Android image decoding libraries *as utilized by PhotoView* are triggered. This could lead to the application crashing or becoming unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, temporary unavailability of the application, negative user experience.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `PhotoViewAttacher` (if it handles image decoding or processing directly)
        * Potentially internal image handling mechanisms within PhotoView.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the application and the user's device are running the latest Android versions with up-to-date security patches (to mitigate underlying Android vulnerabilities).
        * Keep the PhotoView library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches within the library itself.
        * Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to gracefully handle image loading failures within the PhotoView context.
        * Limit the maximum size and resolution of images that can be displayed by PhotoView.

* **Threat:** Malicious Image Exploitation (Potential Remote Code Execution)
    * **Description:** A highly crafted malicious image exploits a critical vulnerability *within PhotoView's image processing logic*. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the user's device, data theft, malware installation, unauthorized access to resources.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `PhotoViewAttacher` (if it handles image decoding or processing directly)
        * Potentially internal image handling mechanisms within PhotoView.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Prioritize keeping the application and device Android version updated with the latest security patches (to mitigate underlying Android vulnerabilities).
        * **Critically**, keep the PhotoView library updated to the latest version to patch any known RCE vulnerabilities within the library.
        * Avoid using untrusted image sources without thorough validation *before* passing them to PhotoView.
        * Implement robust security measures at the operating system level.
        * Employ application sandboxing techniques to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
