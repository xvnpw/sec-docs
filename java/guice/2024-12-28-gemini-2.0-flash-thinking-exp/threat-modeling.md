### High and Critical Guice Specific Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical security threats directly involving Google Guice:

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the Guice binding configuration (e.g., through compromised configuration files, environment variables, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems managing bindings) to inject a malicious implementation of an interface. This malicious object, once instantiated and injected by Guice, can perform unauthorized actions such as logging sensitive data, modifying application state in unintended ways, or establishing unauthorized network connections.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (leaking sensitive information), integrity compromise (modifying data or application behavior), availability disruption (crashing the application or consuming resources).
    *   **Affected Guice Component:** `"Binder"` (responsible for defining bindings), `"Modules"` (where bindings are configured), `"@Binds"` and `"@Provides"` methods (defining how dependencies are created).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure configuration sources and restrict write access to configuration files and environment variables.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization on any data used to determine Guice bindings.
        *   Utilize compile-time dependency injection with tools like Dagger where possible to reduce runtime configuration flexibility.
        *   Employ a security policy framework to restrict the types of objects that can be injected.
        *   Regularly audit and review Guice module configurations.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data through Bindings
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Guice binding configuration (e.g., through unauthorized file access, memory dumps, or exploiting vulnerabilities that reveal the injector state) and discovers sensitive data directly bound as constants or through easily decipherable provider logic. This could include API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (direct exposure of sensitive credentials or data).
    *   **Affected Guice Component:** `"Binder"` (for constant bindings), `"@Provides"` methods (if they directly embed secrets), `"Injector"` (state might reveal bound values).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid binding sensitive data directly as constants.
        *   Utilize secure secret management systems (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and inject references or accessors to these secrets instead of the secrets themselves.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit, even if accessed through providers.
        *   Implement access controls on configuration files and the application's runtime environment.

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage due to Incorrect Scope Usage
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits the incorrect use of Guice scopes, particularly using an overly broad scope like `"@Singleton"` for objects that should be request-scoped or session-scoped. This can lead to sensitive data intended for a single user or request being inadvertently shared or accessible across multiple users or requests, resulting in information leakage.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (unintended sharing of user-specific data).
    *   **Affected Guice Component:** `"@Singleton"`, `"@RequestScoped"`, `"@SessionScoped"` annotations (defining object lifecycles), custom `"Scope"` implementations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully choose the appropriate scope for each binding based on the object's intended lifecycle and the sensitivity of the data it manages.
        *   Thoroughly review the scoping of objects that handle user-specific or request-specific data.
        *   Utilize custom scopes for more fine-grained control over object lifecycles when necessary.
        *   Implement unit and integration tests to verify the correct scoping behavior of injected objects.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Method Interceptor
    *   **Description:** An attacker manages to inject or modify a method interceptor (e.g., through configuration manipulation or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the interceptor registration mechanism). This malicious interceptor can then intercept method calls, potentially bypassing authorization checks, logging sensitive data without proper safeguards, modifying method arguments or return values, or even throwing exceptions to disrupt application flow.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (logging sensitive data), integrity compromise (modifying data or behavior), authorization bypass, availability disruption (introducing errors).
    *   **Affected Guice Component:** `"MethodInterceptor"` interface, `"MethodInterceptor"` bindings, `"AOP"` (Aspect-Oriented Programming) features of Guice.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all method interceptors for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Restrict the ability to define and register new interceptors at runtime, especially based on external input.
        *   Ensure interceptors follow the principle of least privilege, only accessing necessary data and performing essential actions.
        *   Implement strong access controls on the configuration and deployment of interceptors.

*   **Threat:** Module Injection and Code Execution
    *   **Description:** If the application allows dynamic loading of Guice modules based on external input (e.g., file paths, URLs), an attacker could inject a malicious module. This module, when loaded by Guice, can execute arbitrary code during the injector creation process, potentially gaining full control over the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete application compromise.
    *   **Affected Guice Component:** `"Module"` interface, `"Guice.createInjector()"` method (when loading modules), mechanisms for specifying modules (e.g., command-line arguments, configuration files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamic loading of modules based on untrusted or externally controlled input.
        *   If dynamic loading is absolutely necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of module paths and content.
        *   Digitally sign modules to ensure their integrity and authenticity before loading.
        *   Restrict file system access and network access for the application to prevent loading modules from malicious sources.
