### High and Critical Hadoop Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Apache Hadoop codebase:

*   **Threat:** DataNode Spoofing
    *   **Description:** An attacker could set up a rogue server that pretends to be a legitimate DataNode in the Hadoop cluster. This malicious DataNode could then receive data intended for the real cluster. The attacker might then store this data for later analysis, modify it before acknowledging the write, or simply drop the data, causing data loss. This directly involves the DataNode's implementation of the HDFS protocol.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS DataNode communication protocol implementation within the `hadoop-hdfs-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable strong authentication between NameNode and DataNodes (e.g., using Kerberos, which is part of the `hadoop-common-project` and `hadoop-hdfs-project`).
        *   Implement mutual authentication to verify the identity of both the NameNode and DataNodes (features within `hadoop-hdfs-project`).
        *   Monitor the cluster for unexpected DataNodes joining the network (requires monitoring tools, but the core security mechanism is within Hadoop).

*   **Threat:** NameNode Metadata Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the NameNode (or exploits a vulnerability in its communication or internal logic) could directly manipulate the metadata it stores. This could involve changing file locations, permissions, or even deleting metadata entries, effectively leading to data loss or inaccessibility. This directly targets the NameNode's core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, denial of service (inability to access data).
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS NameNode metadata management logic within the `hadoop-hdfs-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to the NameNode host and its configuration files (OS level security, but also involves securing Hadoop configuration).
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the NameNode (e.g., Kerberos integration within `hadoop-common-project` and `hadoop-hdfs-project`).
        *   Regularly back up NameNode metadata (operational practice, but the backup mechanism is within HDFS).
        *   Monitor NameNode logs for suspicious activity (requires logging configuration within Hadoop).
        *   Restrict access to NameNode administrative interfaces (configuration within `hadoop-hdfs-project`).

*   **Threat:** YARN ResourceManager Spoofing
    *   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to impersonate the YARN ResourceManager. This could allow them to control resource allocation within the cluster, potentially starving legitimate applications of resources or allocating resources to malicious tasks. This directly involves the ResourceManager's implementation of the YARN protocol.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service for legitimate applications, resource hijacking for malicious purposes.
    *   **Affected Component:** YARN ResourceManager communication protocol implementation within the `hadoop-yarn-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable strong authentication between YARN components (e.g., using Kerberos, integrated within `hadoop-common-project` and `hadoop-yarn-project`).
        *   Implement mutual authentication to verify the identity of the ResourceManager and NodeManagers (features within `hadoop-yarn-project`).
        *   Monitor resource allocation patterns for anomalies (requires monitoring tools, but the core resource management is within YARN).
        *   Secure access to the ResourceManager host (OS level security).

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to HDFS Data Blocks
    *   **Description:** If HDFS data blocks are not properly secured (e.g., due to vulnerabilities in encryption implementation or key management within Hadoop), an attacker who gains physical access to a DataNode's storage or intercepts network traffic could potentially read the raw data blocks. While the data is split into blocks, understanding the file structure and potentially reassembling blocks could lead to information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS Data Blocks storage and encryption mechanisms within the `hadoop-hdfs-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement encryption at rest for HDFS data (e.g., using Hadoop's Transparent Data Encryption or HDFS encryption zones, features within `hadoop-hdfs-project`).
        *   Implement encryption in transit for communication between Hadoop components (e.g., using RPC encryption, configurable within Hadoop).
        *   Secure physical access to DataNode hardware (OS level security).

*   **Threat:** Malicious Application Submission to YARN
    *   **Description:** An attacker could submit a malicious application to the YARN ResourceManager by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application submission process or bypassing authentication/authorization checks within YARN. This application could be designed to steal data, disrupt other applications, or perform other malicious actions within the cluster's resources.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, denial of service, resource abuse, potential compromise of other applications.
    *   **Affected Component:** YARN Application submission process logic within the `hadoop-yarn-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for submitting applications to YARN (e.g., using Kerberos and ACLs, features within `hadoop-yarn-project`).
        *   Utilize YARN's security features like ACLs to restrict who can submit applications (configuration within `hadoop-yarn-project`).
        *   Implement application whitelisting or sandboxing to limit the capabilities of submitted applications (requires integration with other security frameworks, but YARN provides some isolation).
        *   Monitor submitted applications for suspicious behavior (requires monitoring tools, but YARN provides some application tracking).

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Hadoop Configuration Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Hadoop relies on various configuration files (e.g., `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, `yarn-site.xml`). If these files are not properly secured or contain insecure configurations (e.g., weak passwords, disabled security features due to default settings or misconfiguration within Hadoop), an attacker gaining access to them could compromise the entire cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, data loss, denial of service, unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hadoop configuration parsing and application logic across various modules like `hadoop-common-project`, `hadoop-hdfs-project`, and `hadoop-yarn-project`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to Hadoop configuration files (restrict read/write permissions at the OS level).
        *   Regularly review and harden Hadoop configurations based on security best practices (requires understanding Hadoop's configuration options).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files (use credential providers or secrets management, which Hadoop supports).
        *   Implement configuration management tools to track and control changes (external tools, but the configurations themselves are within Hadoop).

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service against NameNode
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood the NameNode with a large number of metadata requests or other operations, exploiting inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in the NameNode's request processing logic, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become unresponsive. This would effectively bring down the entire HDFS.
    *   **Impact:** Complete HDFS outage, inability to access data.
    *   **Affected Component:** HDFS NameNode request processing logic within the `hadoop-hdfs-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting for client requests to the NameNode (configurable within Hadoop).
        *   Monitor NameNode resource utilization and performance (requires monitoring tools, but understanding NameNode metrics is key).
        *   Implement a standby NameNode for failover in case of primary NameNode failure (feature within `hadoop-hdfs-project`).
        *   Secure network access to the NameNode (network security).

*   **Threat:** NodeManager Compromise Leading to Container Escape
    *   **Description:** If an attacker compromises a NodeManager (by exploiting vulnerabilities in the NodeManager's code or its dependencies), they might be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the containerization technology used by YARN (e.g., Docker or Linux containers) to escape the container and gain access to the underlying host system. This could allow them to further compromise the cluster. While container escape is a broader issue, the initial NodeManager compromise is within Hadoop's scope.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the underlying host system, potential lateral movement within the cluster.
    *   **Affected Component:** YARN NodeManager execution environment and container management integration within the `hadoop-yarn-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the container runtime environment up-to-date with security patches (OS level).
        *   Harden the container runtime environment based on security best practices (OS level).
        *   Implement strong isolation between containers (container runtime configuration).
        *   Monitor NodeManagers for suspicious activity (requires monitoring tools, but understanding NodeManager behavior is key).

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Hadoop RPC
    *   **Description:** Hadoop components communicate with each other using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Vulnerabilities in the RPC implementation within Hadoop itself could be exploited by attackers to intercept, modify, or inject malicious RPC messages, potentially leading to various attacks like data manipulation or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, unauthorized access, potential for remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hadoop RPC framework implementation within the `hadoop-common-project` module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Hadoop updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Enable RPC authentication and authorization (e.g., using Kerberos, integrated within `hadoop-common-project`).
        *   Enable RPC encryption to protect communication confidentiality and integrity (configurable within Hadoop).
        *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious RPC activity (network monitoring).
