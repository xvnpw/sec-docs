### High and Critical Hadoop-Specific Threats

Here's a list of high and critical security threats that directly involve Apache Hadoop components:

*   **Threat:** NameNode Metadata Corruption
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the NameNode's metadata management or communication protocols to corrupt the filesystem metadata. This might involve sending malformed requests, exploiting buffer overflows, or leveraging authentication bypasses.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete loss of access to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), data unavailability, potential data loss if backups are not available or corrupted.
    *   **Affected Component:** `NameNode` (specifically its metadata management functions and communication handlers).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all NameNode interactions.
        *   Regularly patch and update the Hadoop installation to address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all requests to the NameNode.
        *   Maintain regular backups of the NameNode metadata (fsimage and edit logs) in a secure location.
        *   Implement a secondary NameNode or NameNode HA setup for redundancy.
        *   Monitor NameNode logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** DataNode Compromise and Data Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a DataNode, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in the DataNode software, insecure network configurations, or compromised credentials. Once inside, they could directly modify data blocks stored on that DataNode.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data integrity issues, potential for the attacker to inject malicious data or manipulate analysis results.
    *   **Affected Component:** `DataNode` (specifically its block storage and access control mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure DataNode deployments with proper network segmentation and firewall rules.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for DataNode access.
        *   Enable disk encryption on DataNodes to protect data at rest.
        *   Regularly patch and update the Hadoop installation.
        *   Implement data checksumming and validation mechanisms to detect data corruption.
        *   Monitor DataNode logs for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via HDFS Permissions Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in HDFS permission checks or leverages misconfigurations to gain access to data they are not authorized to view. This could involve manipulating user or group identities, exploiting flaws in ACL implementations, or bypassing authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `NameNode` (specifically its permission checking logic and ACL enforcement), `DataNode` (in terms of serving data based on NameNode's authorization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement and enforce granular HDFS permissions and Access Control Lists (ACLs).
        *   Regularly review and audit HDFS permissions.
        *   Use strong authentication mechanisms like Kerberos.
        *   Avoid relying solely on default permissions; explicitly define access controls.
        *   Monitor access logs for unauthorized attempts.

*   **Threat:** ResourceManager Compromise and Malicious Application Submission
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the ResourceManager, potentially through exploiting vulnerabilities in its API or authentication mechanisms. This allows them to submit malicious applications to the YARN cluster that can execute arbitrary code on NodeManagers.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on cluster nodes, data breaches, resource abuse, denial of service by consuming all resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `ResourceManager` (specifically its application submission and management APIs).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for ResourceManager access.
        *   Regularly patch and update the Hadoop installation.
        *   Implement application whitelisting or blacklisting.
        *   Enforce resource quotas and limits for applications.
        *   Monitor ResourceManager logs for suspicious application submissions.
        *   Consider using containerization technologies (like Docker) to isolate application execution.

*   **Threat:** NodeManager Compromise and Container Escape
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a NodeManager, potentially by exploiting vulnerabilities in the NodeManager software or the underlying operating system. From there, they might attempt a container escape to gain access to the host system and potentially other NodeManagers.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on cluster nodes, lateral movement within the cluster, access to sensitive data on the host system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `NodeManager` (specifically its container management and isolation mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure NodeManager deployments with proper network segmentation and firewall rules.
        *   Regularly patch and update the Hadoop installation and the underlying operating system.
        *   Implement strong security configurations for container runtimes.
        *   Use security profiles (like AppArmor or SELinux) to restrict container capabilities.
        *   Monitor NodeManager logs for suspicious activity and container escapes.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) on NameNode
    *   **Description:** An attacker floods the NameNode with a large number of requests, exhausting its resources and making it unavailable. This could involve sending a high volume of metadata requests, file creation requests, or other operations that strain the NameNode's capacity.
    *   Impact:** Inability to access or manage the HDFS, disruption of applications relying on HDFS.
    *   **Affected Component:** `NameNode` (specifically its request handling and resource management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the NameNode.
        *   Use a firewall to filter out malicious traffic.
        *   Properly size the NameNode hardware to handle expected load.
        *   Monitor NameNode performance metrics and resource utilization.

*   **Threat:** Data Exfiltration via Unauthorized Access to DataNodes
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a DataNode, either through direct compromise or by exploiting authentication or authorization weaknesses, and copies sensitive data stored on that node.
    *   Impact:** Confidentiality breach, loss of sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `DataNode` (specifically its block serving mechanisms).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for DataNode access.
        *   Enable encryption for data at rest on DataNodes.
        *   Implement network segmentation to restrict access to DataNodes.
        *   Monitor network traffic for unusual data transfers.
        *   Implement Data Loss Prevention (DLP) strategies.
