**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application [CRITICAL]:**

* This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. All subsequent paths aim to achieve this goal.

**2. Exploit Jenkins Instance Directly [CRITICAL]:**

* This path involves directly targeting the Jenkins instance itself to gain control.
    * **Gain Access to Jenkins Instance [CRITICAL]:** This is a critical step as it provides the attacker with a foothold within the Jenkins environment.
        * **Exploit Known Jenkins Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Jenkins core or its plugins.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Exploiting Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities to gain shell access.
                * Exploiting arbitrary file read vulnerabilities to access sensitive files.
        * **Brute-force/Guess Credentials:** Attackers attempt to guess or brute-force valid usernames and passwords for Jenkins accounts.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Using lists of common passwords.
                * Employing automated brute-forcing tools.
        * **Exploit Misconfigurations:** Attackers take advantage of insecure configurations in the Jenkins setup.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Accessing Jenkins instances exposed without proper authentication.
                * Exploiting enabled anonymous read access to gather information or perform actions.
    * **Leverage Access to Compromise Application [CRITICAL]:** Once access to Jenkins is gained, attackers use this access to target the application.
        * **Inject Malicious Code into Build Process [CRITICAL]:** Attackers modify the build process to introduce malicious code into the application.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Modifying Jenkins job configurations to execute malicious scripts during builds.
                * Injecting malicious code into source code repositories that Jenkins builds from.
                * Compromising build tools or dependencies used by Jenkins to introduce backdoors.
                * Manipulating pipeline scripts to deploy compromised application artifacts.
        * **Steal Sensitive Information [CRITICAL]:** Attackers access sensitive information stored or managed by Jenkins.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Accessing stored credentials used for application deployments or other systems.
                * Reading sensitive environment variables used in build processes.
                * Accessing build logs that may contain sensitive information.
                * Accessing artifacts produced by builds that contain sensitive data.
        * **Modify Deployment Process [CRITICAL]:** Attackers alter the deployment process to deploy compromised versions of the application.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Altering deployment scripts to deploy malicious code.
                * Changing deployment targets to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
        * **Abuse Jenkins Plugins [CRITICAL]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misuse functionalities of installed Jenkins plugins.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Exploiting known vulnerabilities in plugins to gain further access or execute commands.
                * Using plugin features like script consoles to execute arbitrary code.

**3. Manipulate Build Process Without Direct Jenkins Access [CRITICAL]:**

* This path focuses on compromising the build process indirectly, without initially gaining direct access to the Jenkins instance.
    * **Compromise Source Code Repository [CRITICAL]:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the source code repository used by Jenkins.
        * Attack Vectors:
            * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the source code repository platform.
            * Compromising developer credentials to gain access.
    * **Trigger Malicious Build:** Once the repository is compromised, Jenkins automatically builds the malicious code.
        * Attack Vectors:
            * Committing malicious code or modified build scripts to the repository.

**4. Exploit Jenkins API [CRITICAL]:**

* This path involves exploiting the Jenkins Application Programming Interface (API) to compromise the application.
    * **Gain Access to Jenkins API [CRITICAL]:** Attackers obtain valid credentials or tokens to access the Jenkins API.
        * **Steal API Tokens:** Attackers obtain existing API tokens.
            * Attack Vectors:
                * Stealing tokens from compromised Jenkins instances.
                * Obtaining tokens from developer machines or insecure storage locations.
    * **Leverage API Access to Compromise Application:** Once API access is gained, attackers use it to manipulate Jenkins and the application.
        * Attack Vectors:
            * Triggering malicious builds via the API.
            * Modifying job configurations through API calls.
            * Accessing sensitive information via API endpoints.
            * Deploying malicious artifacts using deployment plugins accessible through the API.
