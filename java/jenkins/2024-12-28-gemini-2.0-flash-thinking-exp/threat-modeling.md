Here are the high and critical threats directly involving the Jenkins core:

* **Threat:** Unauthenticated Access to Jenkins Instance
    * **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Jenkins web interface without providing valid credentials. This could be due to misconfiguration within Jenkins itself, such as disabling security or failing to properly configure authentication. The attacker can then view sensitive information, trigger builds, modify configurations, and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Jenkins instance, including access to source code, build artifacts, credentials, and the ability to disrupt or manipulate the development pipeline.
    * **Which Jenkins Component is Affected:**  Security Realm (authentication and authorization), overall Jenkins core.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable and properly configure the Security Realm (e.g., using Jenkins' own user database, LDAP, or other authentication providers).
        * Enforce authentication for all users.
        * Regularly review and audit access control configurations within Jenkins.

* **Threat:** Malicious Pipeline Execution
    * **Description:** An attacker with permissions to create or modify Jenkins pipelines injects malicious code into the pipeline script. This code is then executed by the Jenkins master or agents during the build process. The attacker can perform actions such as stealing credentials managed by Jenkins, modifying build artifacts within Jenkins' workspace, or leveraging Jenkins' integrations to compromise other systems.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of Jenkins itself, potential injection of malicious code into the application being built through Jenkins, exfiltration of sensitive data managed by Jenkins.
    * **Which Jenkins Component is Affected:** Pipeline DSL (Domain Specific Language), Script Security plugin (if enabled).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access control for pipeline creation and modification within Jenkins.
        * Utilize the Script Security plugin and configure it to restrict the use of potentially dangerous Groovy methods within Jenkins.
        * Review pipeline scripts carefully for any suspicious or unexpected commands within the Jenkins interface.
        * Employ static analysis tools to scan pipeline scripts for security vulnerabilities before execution within Jenkins.

* **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerable Plugins
    * **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in installed Jenkins plugins. This can lead to various outcomes, including remote code execution on the Jenkins master, information disclosure from Jenkins, or denial of service of the Jenkins instance.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure from Jenkins to complete compromise of the Jenkins system.
    * **Which Jenkins Component is Affected:** Plugin Manager, individual plugin components.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Jenkins and all installed plugins to the latest versions through the Jenkins Plugin Manager.
        * Subscribe to security mailing lists and advisories for Jenkins and its plugins.
        * Only install plugins from trusted sources via the official Jenkins plugin repository.
        * Periodically review installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or maintained through the Jenkins Plugin Manager.
        * Consider using the "Remoting Security Filter" within Jenkins to restrict access to sensitive plugin APIs.

* **Threat:** Plaintext Credential Exposure in Jenkins Configuration
    * **Description:** Sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords) are stored in plaintext within Jenkins configuration files, job configurations, or pipeline scripts managed by Jenkins. An attacker gaining access to the Jenkins master's filesystem or configuration can easily retrieve these credentials.
    * **Impact:**  Compromise of external systems or services that rely on the exposed credentials managed by Jenkins, potential data breaches.
    * **Which Jenkins Component is Affected:** Credentials plugin, job configurations, system configuration files.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize the Jenkins Credentials plugin to securely store and manage credentials within Jenkins.
        * Avoid hardcoding credentials in pipeline scripts or configuration files within Jenkins.
        * Use secret management solutions integrated with Jenkins (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
        * Regularly audit Jenkins configurations for exposed credentials.

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Jenkins UI
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into fields or parameters within the Jenkins user interface. When other users view these pages within Jenkins, the malicious script is executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on their behalf within Jenkins, or redirect them to malicious websites.
    * **Impact:** Account compromise within Jenkins, unauthorized actions performed by legitimate Jenkins users, potential spread of malware.
    * **Which Jenkins Component is Affected:**  User interface components, various form fields and display elements within the Jenkins web application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Jenkins updated to benefit from security patches that address XSS vulnerabilities.
        * Implement and enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) headers within the Jenkins web server configuration.
        * Sanitize and validate user inputs within the Jenkins codebase to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.

* **Threat:** Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    * **Description:** Jenkins is configured with overly permissive access controls, allowing users to perform actions beyond their intended scope within the Jenkins environment. This could enable malicious insiders or compromised accounts to escalate privileges or cause damage within Jenkins.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized modification of Jenkins configurations, pipelines, or jobs; potential data breaches or disruption of the development process managed by Jenkins.
    * **Which Jenkins Component is Affected:** Security Realm, Authorization Matrix/Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement granular role-based access control using Jenkins' built-in features or plugins like Role-Based Authorization Strategy.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions within Jenkins.
        * Regularly review and audit user permissions within Jenkins.
        * Consider using project-based authorization to further restrict access within specific projects in Jenkins.
