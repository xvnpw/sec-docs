## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Handling of External Service Changes - NewPipe's Parsing Logic](./mitigation_strategies/robust_handling_of_external_service_changes_-_newpipe's_parsing_logic.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Graceful Degradation and Fallback Mechanisms for Failures in NewPipe's External Service Parsing.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify NewPipe's Critical Extraction Points:** Determine which application features rely on specific data extraction functionalities provided by NewPipe (e.g., `StreamExtractor`, `ChannelExtractor`).
    2.  **Handle NewPipe's Extraction Exceptions:**  Specifically catch exceptions raised by NewPipe during data extraction, such as `ExtractionException` or exceptions indicating network issues within NewPipe's modules.
    3.  **Provide User Feedback Related to NewPipe Functionality:** When a NewPipe extraction error occurs, inform the user that a feature relying on NewPipe's data retrieval might be temporarily unavailable due to changes on external platforms that NewPipe is designed to interact with.
    4.  **Fallback to Cached Data from Previous NewPipe Operations (if applicable):** If the application caches data obtained via NewPipe, utilize this cached data as a fallback if NewPipe fails to retrieve fresh data. Clearly indicate to the user if they are viewing potentially outdated information due to NewPipe issues.
    5.  **Disable or Grey Out Features Dependent on NewPipe's Functionality:** If a feature directly dependent on NewPipe's successful data extraction fails, temporarily disable or visually indicate the unavailability of the corresponding UI elements.
    6.  **Log and Monitor NewPipe Related Errors:** Implement logging to specifically record errors originating from NewPipe's modules. Monitor these logs to proactively identify recurring issues related to NewPipe's parsing capabilities and prioritize updates or adjustments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Application Crashes due to NewPipe Parsing Errors (High Severity):** Unhandled exceptions from NewPipe during parsing due to external platform changes can crash the application.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Outdated NewPipe Parsing (Medium Severity):**  If NewPipe's parsing logic becomes outdated, the application might display incorrect or incomplete data extracted by NewPipe.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Indirect, via NewPipe Failures (Medium Severity):**  Repeated failures in NewPipe's extraction processes can lead to feature unavailability, effectively causing a DoS from a user perspective.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Application Crashes due to NewPipe Parsing Errors:** Significantly reduced by handling NewPipe's exceptions.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior due to Outdated NewPipe Parsing:** Moderately reduced by fallback mechanisms and user feedback.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Indirect, via NewPipe Failures:** Moderately reduced by graceful degradation and maintaining partial functionality.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially within NewPipe library:** NewPipe has internal error handling, but relies on the integrating application to manage exceptions at the application level.
    *   **Basic error handling around NewPipe calls might exist in projects:** Some projects might have basic `try-catch` blocks, but comprehensive handling specific to NewPipe's error types and fallback strategies are often lacking.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Application-level error handling specifically for NewPipe exceptions:** Developers need to implement robust error handling tailored to the exceptions NewPipe can throw.
    *   **Sophisticated fallback mechanisms for NewPipe data retrieval failures:**  Beyond generic error messages, implementing caching and feature disabling when NewPipe fails is often missing.
    *   **Dedicated logging and monitoring of errors originating from NewPipe modules:** Systematic tracking of NewPipe-specific errors for proactive maintenance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Input Validation and Sanitization of Data Extracted by NewPipe](./mitigation_strategies/secure_input_validation_and_sanitization_of_data_extracted_by_newpipe.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strict Input Validation and Sanitization on Data Received from NewPipe's Extraction Functions.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Data Usage Points Post-NewPipe Extraction:** Locate all code sections where data returned by NewPipe's extraction methods (e.g., `StreamInfo.getTitle()`, `ChannelInfo.getDescription()`) is used within the application.
    2.  **Define Expected Data Formats for NewPipe Output:** For each type of data extracted by NewPipe, define the expected data type, format, and allowed character sets *after* it has been processed by NewPipe.
    3.  **Validate Data Received from NewPipe:** Implement validation functions to check if the data obtained from NewPipe conforms to the defined expected formats. This is crucial even after NewPipe's extraction, as the data source itself might be manipulated.
    4.  **Sanitize Data Post-NewPipe Extraction:** Sanitize the data *after* it has been extracted by NewPipe, before using it in the application's UI, storage, or further processing. This includes HTML encoding, URL encoding, and removing potentially harmful characters.
    5.  **Handle Invalid Data from NewPipe:** Determine how to handle data that fails validation after being extracted by NewPipe. Options include rejecting the data, using default values, or displaying with warnings.
    6.  **Regularly Review Validation and Sanitization Logic for NewPipe Output:** Periodically review and update validation and sanitization rules applied to data obtained from NewPipe, considering potential changes in external platforms and data formats.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Data in NewPipe Output (High Severity):** Malicious content injected into platform data could be extracted by NewPipe and lead to XSS if not sanitized by the application.
    *   **Injection Attacks via Unsanitized NewPipe Data (Medium Severity):** If data from NewPipe is used in queries or commands without sanitization, it could be exploited for injection attacks.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues due to Unexpected Data from NewPipe (Medium Severity):** Malformed or unexpected data extracted by NewPipe can cause data corruption or processing errors within the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Data in NewPipe Output:** Significantly reduced by sanitizing data after NewPipe extraction.
    *   **Injection Attacks via Unsanitized NewPipe Data:** Moderately reduced by validation and sanitization.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues due to Unexpected Data from NewPipe:** Moderately reduced by validating NewPipe's output.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Minimal sanitization within NewPipe library itself:** NewPipe focuses on extraction and might perform basic encoding for internal purposes, but not comprehensive sanitization for all application contexts.
    *   **Rarely implemented in projects specifically for NewPipe output:** Input validation and sanitization are often generally considered, but might not be specifically applied to the data *after* it comes from NewPipe.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Application-level input validation and sanitization specifically for NewPipe output:** Developers must implement these measures *after* receiving data from NewPipe within their application.
    *   **Context-aware sanitization of NewPipe data:** Sanitization should be tailored to how the data from NewPipe is used in the application.
    *   **Regular security audits of how NewPipe data is handled:** Periodic reviews of data handling practices for NewPipe output are needed.
