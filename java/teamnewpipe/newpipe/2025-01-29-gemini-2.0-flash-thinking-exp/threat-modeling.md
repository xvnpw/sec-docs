# Threat Model Analysis for teamnewpipe/newpipe

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Scraped Website](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_scraped_website.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a website that NewPipe scrapes (e.g., YouTube, SoundCloud) or performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to inject malicious content (e.g., crafted HTML, JavaScript, media files) into the scraped data. NewPipe processes this data, and the malicious content is executed within the application context. An attacker might execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a WebView (if used), steal user data stored by the application, or redirect the user to phishing sites.
*   **Impact:**  **High**. Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to data theft, session hijacking, malicious actions performed on behalf of the user, and potentially device compromise if vulnerabilities in the WebView are exploited.
*   **Affected NewPipe Component:**  Scraping Modules (e.g., YouTubeExtractor, SoundCloudExtractor), Data Processing Logic, WebView (if used for rendering content).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict input sanitization and validation for all scraped data.
        *   Use secure parsing libraries that are resistant to injection attacks.
        *   Avoid directly executing or rendering untrusted content without proper security measures.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in WebViews to restrict the execution of inline scripts and loading of external resources.
        *   Regularly update scraping logic to adapt to website changes and potential injection attempts.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep the NewPipe application updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Use a reputable and secure network connection to minimize MitM attacks.

## Threat: [Code Execution Vulnerabilities in NewPipe Core Logic](./threats/code_execution_vulnerabilities_in_newpipe_core_logic.md)

*   **Description:** NewPipe's codebase contains vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or logic flaws. An attacker exploits these vulnerabilities by providing crafted input (e.g., through a malicious media file, a specially crafted URL, or interaction with malicious content from scraped websites) that triggers the vulnerability. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device with the privileges of the NewPipe application.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full device compromise, data theft, malware installation, denial of service, and other malicious actions.
*   **Affected NewPipe Component:** Core Application Logic (across various modules and functions), Media Handling Modules, Network Communication Modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle.
        *   Conduct regular code reviews and security audits, including penetration testing.
        *   Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement memory safety measures and robust input validation in all critical code paths.
        *   Address and patch identified vulnerabilities promptly.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep the NewPipe application updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Install NewPipe only from trusted sources (e.g., official F-Droid repository, GitHub releases).

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** NewPipe relies on third-party libraries and dependencies. These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities. If NewPipe uses vulnerable versions of these libraries, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities through NewPipe. An attacker might leverage a vulnerability in a dependency to achieve code execution, data theft, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, impacts can range from data theft and denial of service to code execution and device compromise.
*   **Affected NewPipe Component:** Dependency Management, potentially any module that uses vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Maintain a comprehensive list of dependencies and their versions.
        *   Regularly update all dependencies to their latest stable and secure versions.
        *   Use dependency vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Implement a process for promptly addressing and patching dependency vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Keep the NewPipe application updated to the latest version, which will include updated dependencies.
