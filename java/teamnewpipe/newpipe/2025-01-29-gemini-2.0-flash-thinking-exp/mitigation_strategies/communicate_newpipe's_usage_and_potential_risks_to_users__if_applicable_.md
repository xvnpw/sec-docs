Informing users about potential risks, even if low severity, demonstrates transparency and allows users to make informed decisions about using the application. This directly addresses **Lack of User Awareness** and mitigates **Reputational Risk** by showing responsibility. It also indirectly addresses **Privacy Concerns** by acknowledging potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implementation:**  This is the most sensitive step and requires careful consideration of wording and placement. Risks could include:
        *   **API Instability:**  As mentioned in Step 2, reverse-engineered APIs can break, leading to service disruptions.
        *   **Potential for Data Collection Changes:**  While NewPipe itself is privacy-focused, changes in the upstream services it accesses could potentially impact data handling.
        *   **Security Vulnerabilities (Theoretical):**  While NewPipe is open-source and actively maintained, any software can have vulnerabilities.  Acknowledging this general risk is prudent.
    *   **Challenges:**  Communicating risks without unduly alarming users or creating a negative perception of the application.  Finding the right level of detail and avoiding overly technical or legalistic language.  Balancing transparency with user experience.
    *   **Effectiveness:** Medium in mitigating **Reputational Risk** and **Lack of User Awareness**. Low to medium impact on **Privacy Concerns** depending on the specific risks highlighted and user interpretation.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Include a concise "Risk Disclosure" section in the privacy policy or "About" section.
