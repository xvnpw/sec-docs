# Attack Surface Analysis for teamnewpipe/newpipe

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Service Responses (Data Parsing)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_service_responses__data_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in NewPipe's parsing logic through crafted responses from supported services (YouTube, etc.) or via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
    *   **NewPipe's Contribution:** NewPipe's core functionality *is* parsing data from external services. This is its primary purpose and, therefore, its largest attack surface.  The `Extractor` classes and related network handling code are directly responsible.
    *   **Example:** A MitM attacker intercepts the connection between NewPipe and YouTube. They modify the JSON response for a video search to include an extremely long video title. NewPipe's JSON parser doesn't properly handle this, leading to a buffer overflow and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete device compromise, data theft, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)** Rigorous input validation and sanitization in all parsing code (`Extractor` classes and related components). Handle all data from external services as untrusted.
        *   **(Developer)** Use robust parsing libraries (e.g., well-vetted JSON parsers) and ensure they are configured securely (e.g., disabling external entity processing for XML if used).
        *   **(Developer)** Fuzz testing of all parsing components with a wide variety of malformed and unexpected inputs.
        *   **(Developer)** Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and unexpected behavior when parsing fails.
        *   **(Developer)** Use memory-safe languages or techniques (e.g., bounds checking) to prevent buffer overflows and other memory corruption vulnerabilities.
        *   **(Developer)** Regularly review and update parsing logic to address new attack vectors and vulnerabilities.
        *   **(Developer)** Consider using a WebAssembly (Wasm) sandbox for parsing untrusted data, isolating it from the rest of the application.

## Attack Surface: [ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)](./attack_surfaces/redos__regular_expression_denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of inefficient regular expressions used by NewPipe to cause excessive CPU consumption and application unresponsiveness.
    *   **NewPipe's Contribution:** NewPipe likely uses regular expressions to extract data from service responses (e.g., video IDs, channel names).  The code that implements these regular expressions is directly responsible.
    *   **Example:** A malicious video description contains a specially crafted string designed to trigger a catastrophic backtracking scenario in a poorly written regular expression used by NewPipe. This causes the app to freeze or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unresponsiveness.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)** Carefully review all regular expressions used in the codebase, especially those that process data from external services.
        *   **(Developer)** Use regular expression analysis tools to identify potentially vulnerable patterns.
        *   **(Developer)** Avoid using complex, nested, or overly permissive regular expressions.
        *   **(Developer)** Set timeouts for regular expression matching to prevent indefinite execution.
        *   **(Developer)** Consider using alternative parsing techniques (e.g., dedicated parsing libraries) instead of regular expressions where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Update Server](./attack_surfaces/compromised_update_server.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the server hosting NewPipe updates (or extractor updates) and distributes a malicious update.
    *   **NewPipe's Contribution:** NewPipe uses its own update mechanism, bypassing the Google Play Store.  The code that handles downloading and installing updates is directly responsible.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the NewPipe update server and replaces the legitimate update package with a modified version containing malicious code. Users who update their app unknowingly install the malware.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete device compromise, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **(Developer)** Use HTTPS for all update downloads.
        *   **(Developer)** Implement code signing and verify the digital signature of downloaded updates before installation. This ensures that the update hasn't been tampered with.
        *   **(Developer)** Use a strong, unique signing key and protect it carefully.
        *   **(Developer)** Implement certificate pinning to prevent MitM attacks on the update process.
        *   **(Developer)** Regularly audit the security of the update server.
        *   **(Developer)** Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute updates, improving reliability and potentially reducing the risk of server compromise.
