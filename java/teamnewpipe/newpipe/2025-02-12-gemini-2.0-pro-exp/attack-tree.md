## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) on Integrating App](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos__on_integrating_app.md)

*   **[!] 1.2 Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   **Description:**  This is a critical vulnerability because it represents a fundamental weakness in the application's architecture.  If the application doesn't manage resources (CPU, memory, network connections) effectively, *any* component, including but not limited to NewPipeExtractor, can be abused to cause a denial-of-service.
    *   **High-Risk Path:** ***1.2.1 Send large/many requests to NewPipeExtractor:***
        *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests, or requests that consume significant resources, to the endpoints of the integrating application that utilize NewPipeExtractor. This overwhelms the application's ability to process requests, leading to slowdowns or a complete crash.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Service degradation or complete outage)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Can be automated with simple scripts)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (High traffic and resource usage are easily observable)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Implement rate limiting on endpoints that use NewPipeExtractor.
            *   Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network) of the application and NewPipeExtractor.
            *   Use asynchronous processing or a queue to handle requests to NewPipeExtractor, preventing blocking operations.
            *   Implement timeouts on network requests made by NewPipeExtractor.
            *   Consider using a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application.

*   **1.1 Malformed Service Data & 1.3 Logic Errors in Extractor (Not High-Risk, but still important):**
    *   These are less likely and have lower impact compared to resource exhaustion, but still need to be addressed with input validation, fuzz testing, and robust error handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Leakage/Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_leakagemanipulation.md)

*   **[!] 2.1 Insecure Data Storage:**
    *   **Description:** This is a critical vulnerability because secure data storage is a fundamental security requirement. If the integrating application stores any data related to NewPipeExtractor (or any other data) insecurely, it's vulnerable regardless of NewPipeExtractor's own security.
    *   **High-Risk Path:** ***2.1.1 Access unencrypted cache/DB used by integrating app:***
        *   **Description:** If NewPipeExtractor or the integrating application stores data (e.g., user preferences, temporary files, API responses) in an unencrypted cache or database, an attacker who gains access to the server or application's storage can read this data.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on the integrating application's security practices)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Exposure of sensitive user data)
        *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires access to the server or application's storage)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Unless there's a data breach or obvious signs of compromise)
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   Encrypt all sensitive data stored by the application, including data related to NewPipeExtractor.
            *   Follow secure coding practices for data storage (e.g., using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection).
            *   Regularly audit the application's data storage mechanisms.
            *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored.
            *   Implement strong access controls to the storage location.

*   **2.2 Parsing Vulnerabilities & 2.3 Data Exposure (Not High-Risk, but still important):**
    *   These are less likely and require more specific conditions, but should be addressed with input/output validation, secure logging practices, and careful API design.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Code Execution in Integrating App](./attack_tree_paths/3__code_execution_in_integrating_app.md)

*   **[!] 3.1 Input Validation:**
    *   **Description:** This is a critical node because proper input validation is the cornerstone of preventing many types of attacks, including code execution.  Without robust input validation, the application is vulnerable to a wide array of exploits. While a direct code execution vulnerability in NewPipeExtractor is unlikely, inadequate input validation in the *integrating application* could allow an attacker to leverage *any* vulnerability in NewPipeExtractor (or other components) more easily.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize *all* input passed to NewPipeExtractor, including URLs, parameters, and any other data.
        *   Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good input) rather than a blacklist approach (block known-bad input).
        *   Use appropriate data types and enforce length restrictions.
        *   Consider using a well-vetted input validation library.
        *   Perform input validation as early as possible in the request processing pipeline.
