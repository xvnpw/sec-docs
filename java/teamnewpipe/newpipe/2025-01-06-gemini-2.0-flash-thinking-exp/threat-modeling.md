# Threat Model Analysis for teamnewpipe/newpipe

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Extracted Metadata](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_extracted_metadata.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate video metadata (title, description, author, etc.) on a supported platform to include malicious content, such as JavaScript code or harmful links. When NewPipe extracts this data, *vulnerabilities in NewPipe's internal handling or processing of this metadata could potentially lead to issues before the integrating application even receives it*. For example, a flaw in NewPipe's metadata parsing could cause a crash or unexpected behavior within the library itself.

**Impact:**
*   **Crashes or unexpected behavior within the NewPipe library:** Potentially disrupting the application's functionality.
*   **Exposure of vulnerabilities that could be further exploited by the integrating application:** If NewPipe doesn't properly sanitize or handle malicious metadata.

**Affected Component:** Extractor module (specifically the parsing logic for video metadata).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **NewPipe Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within NewPipe's metadata parsing logic to handle potentially malicious content from platform responses.
*   **NewPipe Developers:** Employ secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious metadata.

## Threat: [Malicious Content Delivery via Media Streams](./threats/malicious_content_delivery_via_media_streams.md)

**Description:** An attacker could upload or inject malicious content within a video or audio stream on a supported platform. If NewPipe downloads this stream, *vulnerabilities in NewPipe's stream handling or processing could potentially be exploited*. For instance, a buffer overflow in how NewPipe handles the stream data could lead to code execution within the NewPipe process.

**Impact:**
*   **Crashes or unexpected behavior within the NewPipe library:** Potentially disrupting the application's functionality.
*   **Potential for code execution within the NewPipe process:** If vulnerabilities exist in stream processing.

**Affected Component:** DownloadManager module, Stream resolving logic within Extractor.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **NewPipe Developers:** Implement secure stream handling practices, including proper buffer management and validation of stream data.
*   **NewPipe Developers:** Utilize memory-safe programming languages or techniques where appropriate for stream processing.

## Threat: [Path Traversal during Download](./threats/path_traversal_during_download.md)

**Description:** If NewPipe doesn't properly sanitize filenames or download paths extracted from platform data, an attacker could potentially manipulate this data to include path traversal characters (e.g., `../`). This could allow NewPipe to write downloaded files to arbitrary locations on the user's file system *if the integrating application directly uses the paths provided by NewPipe without further validation*.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary file write by the integrating application due to NewPipe providing a malicious path:** Leading to data loss, system compromise, or malware installation.

**Affected Component:** DownloadManager module, specifically the logic handling file naming and storage paths *within NewPipe*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **NewPipe Developers:** Strictly sanitize and validate filenames and download paths before providing them to the integrating application. Ensure that NewPipe does not generate or pass on paths that could lead to traversal.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in NewPipe's Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_newpipe's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** NewPipe relies on various third-party libraries. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, these vulnerabilities *directly impact NewPipe*. Attackers could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities through NewPipe's usage of the affected libraries.

**Impact:**
*   **Various security vulnerabilities within NewPipe:** Depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, this could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service *within the context of the NewPipe library*.

**Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency within the NewPipe library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **NewPipe Developers:** Regularly update NewPipe's dependencies to benefit from security patches.
*   **NewPipe Developers:** Monitor security advisories for NewPipe's dependencies. Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
