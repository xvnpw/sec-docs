## 6. Security Considerations (Pre-Threat Modeling)

This section outlines potential security considerations that will be explored further during formal threat modeling:

*   **Reliance on Web Scraping:**
    *   **Threat:** Changes to YouTube's website structure can break the Extractor Layer, leading to denial of service or incorrect data extraction.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust and adaptable parsing logic, monitor YouTube's website for changes, and have mechanisms for quick updates.
*   **Data Privacy and Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Threat:** Potential for accidental leakage of user data or activity patterns if not handled carefully.
    *   **Mitigation:** Adhere to privacy best practices, minimize data collection, and ensure data is stored securely on the device.
*   **Malicious Content from YouTube:**
    *   **Threat:** Exposure to potentially malicious links or misleading information embedded within YouTube content.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement content sanitization where necessary and educate users about potential risks.
*   **Network Security (Man-in-the-Middle Attacks):**
    *   **Threat:**  Interception of network traffic between NewPipe and YouTube, potentially exposing data or allowing for manipulation.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication with YouTube.
*   **Local Data Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to locally stored data (subscriptions, downloads, preferences) if the device is compromised.
    *   **Mitigation:** Consider using Android's security features for local data protection.
*   **Update Mechanism Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Threat:**  Compromised update channels could lead to the installation of malicious NewPipe versions.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Verify the integrity of updates (e.g., through F-Droid's signing process or verifying signatures for direct APK downloads).
*   **Code Injection through Extracted Data:**
    *   **Threat:**  Maliciously crafted content on YouTube could potentially inject code if not properly sanitized before rendering.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust input validation and sanitization techniques.
