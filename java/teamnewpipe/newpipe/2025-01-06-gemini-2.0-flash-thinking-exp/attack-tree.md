## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application Using NewPipe:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_using_newpipe.md)

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker and serves as the root of all potential attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in NewPipe's Handling of External Content:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_newpipe's_handling_of_external_content.md)

This critical node highlights the inherent risks associated with processing data from external, potentially untrusted sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node focuses on weaknesses in how NewPipe interprets and processes data received from external services.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Malicious Metadata Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__malicious_metadata_injection.md)

This high-risk path involves injecting malicious content into metadata fields.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Inject malicious JavaScript/HTML in video titles/descriptions:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascripthtml_in_video_titlesdescriptions.md)

An attacker injects JavaScript or HTML code into video titles or descriptions. If the integrating application renders this data without proper sanitization, it can lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Inject malicious URLs leading to phishing or malware:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_urls_leading_to_phishing_or_malware.md)

An attacker injects malicious URLs into video titles or descriptions. If a user clicks on these links, they can be redirected to phishing websites to steal credentials or to sites hosting malware, potentially infecting the user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Buffer Overflow in Parsers:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__buffer_overflow_in_parsers.md)

This high-risk path targets potential flaws in NewPipe's parsing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Overflow buffers when parsing video/playlist data:](./attack_tree_paths/overflow_buffers_when_parsing_videoplaylist_data.md)

An attacker provides excessively long or malformed data that exceeds the allocated buffer size during parsing. This can lead to a crash of the integrating application and, in some cases, could be exploited for remote code execution if the attacker can control the overflowed data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Insecure Deserialization:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__insecure_deserialization.md)

This high-risk path exploits vulnerabilities in how NewPipe handles the process of converting serialized data back into objects.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit vulnerabilities in how NewPipe deserializes data from external sources:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_how_newpipe_deserializes_data_from_external_sources.md)

An attacker crafts malicious serialized data that, when deserialized by NewPipe, can lead to arbitrary code execution. This occurs when the deserialization process instantiates objects without proper validation, allowing the attacker to create and execute malicious code within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via NewPipe:](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_newpipe.md)

This high-risk path involves manipulating NewPipe to make unintended requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Force NewPipe to make requests to internal resources or unintended external targets:](./attack_tree_paths/force_newpipe_to_make_requests_to_internal_resources_or_unintended_external_targets.md)

An attacker manipulates input provided to NewPipe (e.g., a video URL or channel identifier) to cause NewPipe to make HTTP requests to internal resources within the integrating application's network or to external targets not intended by the application. This can be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or potentially compromise other systems behind a firewall.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Insecure Handling of Downloaded Content:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_insecure_handling_of_downloaded_content.md)

This critical node highlights the risks associated with processing files downloaded by NewPipe.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Malicious File Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__malicious_file_injection.md)

This high-risk path involves injecting malicious code into downloaded media files.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Inject malicious code into downloaded video/audio files:](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_downloaded_videoaudio_files.md)

An attacker embeds malicious code within a video or audio file downloaded by NewPipe. If the integrating application then processes this file without proper sanitization (e.g., attempts to execute it or uses a vulnerable media player), the malicious code can be executed, potentially compromising the user's system or the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

This high-risk path exploits weaknesses in how file paths are handled during downloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Manipulate download paths to overwrite critical files in the integrating application's system:](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_download_paths_to_overwrite_critical_files_in_the_integrating_application's_system.md)

An attacker manipulates the download path provided to NewPipe to include path traversal sequences (e.g., "../"). This can allow the attacker to write downloaded files to arbitrary locations within the integrating application's file system, potentially overwriting critical files and leading to system compromise or data loss.
