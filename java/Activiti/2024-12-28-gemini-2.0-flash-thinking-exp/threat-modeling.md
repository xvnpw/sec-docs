### Activiti Specific High and Critical Threat List

Here's a filtered list of high and critical threats directly involving Activiti:

*   **Threat:** Scripting Injection in Process Definitions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts (e.g., Groovy, JUEL expressions) into process definitions, service task implementations, or execution listeners. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's process definition upload or management functionality, or by compromising an account with process definition deployment privileges. The attacker could then execute arbitrary code on the server when the process instance reaches the injected script.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server hosting the Activiti engine, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Activiti Component:**
        *   `activiti-engine` module, specifically the BPMN execution engine and script evaluation components.
        *   Process definition deployment functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all process definitions before deployment, especially any script expressions. Use a secure expression language if possible, or sandbox script execution environments.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Restrict access to process definition deployment and modification to authorized users only.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review all process definitions for potentially malicious scripts.
        *   **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools to scan process definitions for known scripting vulnerabilities.
        *   **Disable Scripting:** If scripting is not required, disable script execution within the Activiti engine configuration.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Activiti APIs
    *   **Description:** If the Activiti REST API or internal APIs are not properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms, attackers could gain unauthorized access to process data, start/stop processes, modify configurations, or perform other administrative actions. This could be due to default credentials, weak authentication schemes, or missing authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized modification of processes, system compromise, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Activiti Component:**
        *   `activiti-rest` module (if used).
        *   Internal Activiti API endpoints.
        *   Authentication and authorization filters/interceptors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:**  Implement strong authentication mechanisms for accessing Activiti APIs (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Implement RBAC to control access to API endpoints based on user roles.
        *   **Secure API Configuration:**  Disable or restrict access to unnecessary API endpoints.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Audit API configurations and access controls.
        *   **Change Default Credentials:**  Ensure default administrative credentials are changed immediately after installation.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Database Configuration
    *   **Description:** Weak database credentials, open database ports, or lack of encryption for database connections could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to Activiti's underlying data. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breaches, data corruption, and potential compromise of the entire application.
    *   **Affected Activiti Component:**
        *   `activiti-engine` module, specifically the database interaction components.
        *   Database configuration settings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Database Credentials:**  Use strong and unique passwords for database users.
        *   **Restrict Database Access:**  Limit database access to only authorized applications and users.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the database server on a separate network segment.
        *   **Encrypt Database Connections:**  Use encrypted connections (e.g., TLS/SSL) for communication between the Activiti engine and the database.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Audit database configurations and access controls.

*   **Threat:** Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** Failure to change default administrative credentials for the Activiti engine or related components (if any) could provide attackers with immediate and full control over the system.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Activiti engine and potentially the entire application.
    *   **Affected Activiti Component:**
        *   Potentially the `activiti-app` or other administrative interfaces if default accounts exist.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Change Default Credentials:**  Immediately change all default administrative credentials upon installation.
        *   **Enforce Strong Passwords:**  Implement strong password policies for all user accounts.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration Files
    *   **Description:** Accidental exposure of Activiti configuration files (e.g., `activiti.cfg.xml`, `application.properties`) could reveal sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or other internal settings. This could occur due to misconfigured web servers or insecure file permissions.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive credentials and internal system details, potentially leading to further attacks.
    *   **Affected Activiti Component:**
        *   Configuration files used by the Activiti engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure File Permissions:**  Ensure proper file permissions are set on configuration files to restrict access.
        *   **Restrict Web Server Access:**  Configure the web server to prevent direct access to configuration files.
        *   **Externalize Configuration:**  Consider externalizing sensitive configuration parameters using environment variables or secure configuration management tools.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Activiti and its dependencies (libraries used by Activiti) might have known security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are not patched, attackers could exploit them to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Activiti Component:**
        *   `activiti-engine` module and its dependencies.
        *   `activiti-rest` module and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Keep Activiti and all its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to manage and track dependencies.
