```

**Data Flow Description:**

* **User Action:** A user initiates an action, such as starting a process or completing a task, through the UI or API.
* **User Interface/API:** The request is received by the appropriate interface layer.
* **Process Engine (Service Layer):** The request is routed to the relevant service within the Process Engine for processing.
* **Process Definition Loaded?:** The engine checks if the required process definition is currently loaded in memory.
* **Repository Service (Fetch Definition):** If the definition is not loaded, it is retrieved from the database via the Repository Service.
* **Execution Engine:** The Execution Engine interprets the process definition and manages the execution flow.
* **Service Task?:** The engine checks if the current activity is a service task requiring interaction with an external system.
* **External System Interaction:** If it's a service task, the engine interacts with the designated external system.
* **User Task?:** The engine checks if the current activity is a user task requiring human interaction.
* **Task Service (Create/Update Task):** If it's a user task, the Task Service creates or updates the task details in the database.
* **Persistence Layer (Database):** Engine data, including process state, task information, and variables, is stored or updated in the database.
* **Event Dispatcher:** Events related to process execution milestones are dispatched.
* **Event Listeners:** Registered listeners (internal or external) receive and process these events.
* **History Service (Record Events):** The History Service records relevant events for auditing and analysis purposes.
* **External Systems (Notifications, Logging):** External systems might receive notifications or log events based on the configured event listeners.
