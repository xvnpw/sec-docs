    4.  **Impact:**  Disruption of service, unauthorized control of physical devices, potential for physical damage if devices are manipulated maliciously (e.g., overheating, overloading). In a smart home context, this could lead to privacy violations and harassment. In industrial control systems, this could have severe safety and operational consequences.
*   **Scenario 3: Data Exfiltration and Device Information Disclosure:**
    1.  Attacker compromises an API key with broad read access to device data in ThingsBoard.
    2.  Attacker uses the API key to query ThingsBoard's API and retrieve sensitive telemetry data, device attributes, and configuration information.
    3.  Attacker exfiltrates this data for malicious purposes (e.g., selling it, using it for further attacks, competitive intelligence).
    4.  **Impact:**  Data breach, loss of confidentiality, privacy violations, potential financial loss, reputational damage, and exposure of sensitive device information that could be used for further attacks or physical exploitation.
*   **Scenario 4: Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion:**
    1.  Attacker compromises multiple API keys or generates a large number of valid API keys (if a vulnerability allows).
    2.  Attacker uses these API keys to flood ThingsBoard with requests (telemetry data, RPC calls, API queries).
    3.  ThingsBoard resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) are exhausted, leading to performance degradation or system crash.
    4.  **Impact:**  Denial of service, disruption of ThingsBoard platform availability, impacting all connected devices and users relying on the platform.
