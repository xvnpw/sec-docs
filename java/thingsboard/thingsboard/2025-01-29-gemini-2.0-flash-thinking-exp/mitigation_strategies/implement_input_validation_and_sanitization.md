### 5. Impact Assessment

The "Input Validation and Sanitization" mitigation strategy has a significant positive impact on reducing the risk associated with the identified threats:

*   **SQL Injection:** **High Risk Reduction.** Parameterized queries, if consistently implemented, virtually eliminate the risk of SQL injection attacks in custom database interactions.
*   **NoSQL Injection:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Input validation and sanitization, especially within rule chains and custom extensions, can significantly reduce the risk of NoSQL injection attacks by preventing malicious query construction. Specific NoSQL database security best practices should also be followed.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** **High Risk Reduction.**  Proper input sanitization in custom widgets is crucial for preventing XSS vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the risk of attackers injecting malicious scripts into the ThingsBoard UI.
*   **Data Corruption:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** Input validation in rule chains and widgets helps prevent data corruption by ensuring that only valid and expected data is processed and stored. This reduces the likelihood of unexpected data types or formats causing errors or data inconsistencies.

Overall, this mitigation strategy is highly impactful in improving the security posture of the ThingsBoard application by directly addressing critical vulnerabilities related to input handling.

### 6. Currently Implemented vs. Missing Implementation

*   **Currently Implemented:** The assessment indicates that input validation is **partially implemented**. This likely means that basic, potentially implicit, validation might be present in some core ThingsBoard components or default configurations. However, it is unlikely to be comprehensive or consistently applied across all areas, especially in custom extensions and widgets.
*   **Missing Implementation:** The key missing implementations are:
    *   **Systematic Input Validation in Rule Chains:**  Lack of consistent and comprehensive validation logic within rule chains to handle data from various sources.
    *   **Input Sanitization in Custom Widgets:**  Absence of mandatory and robust sanitization practices in custom widget development, leaving them vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Ensuring Parameterized Queries:**  Potential lack of consistent use of parameterized queries in custom database interactions, increasing the risk of SQL injection.

The "Missing Implementation" points highlight critical areas that need immediate attention to strengthen the application's security.
