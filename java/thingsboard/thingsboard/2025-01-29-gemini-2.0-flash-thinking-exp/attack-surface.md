# Attack Surface Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default usernames and passwords for administrative accounts.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard, like many systems, might have default credentials set during initial installation for ease of setup. If these are not changed, they become a readily available entry point.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses "sysadmin@thingsboard.org" and "sysadmin" (or other default credentials) to log in to the ThingsBoard administrator account after a default installation is deployed without changing credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, including access to all data, devices, configurations, and the ability to control the entire ThingsBoard instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately change default administrator credentials** during the initial setup process.
    *   **Enforce strong password policies** for all user accounts, including administrators.

## Attack Surface: [Telemetry Data Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/telemetry_data_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting insufficient input validation on telemetry data sent from devices to inject malicious payloads.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard is designed to ingest and process telemetry data from numerous devices. If input validation is not robust *within ThingsBoard's data processing pipeline*, it becomes vulnerable to injection attacks via this data stream.
*   **Example:** A compromised device sends telemetry data containing a malicious JavaScript payload within a string attribute. This payload is then displayed on a dashboard *by ThingsBoard* without proper sanitization, leading to XSS when a user views the dashboard. Alternatively, a malicious payload could be crafted to exploit NoSQL injection if telemetry data is directly used in database queries *by ThingsBoard* without sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Stealing user sessions, defacing dashboards, redirecting users to malicious sites *within the ThingsBoard application*.
    *   **NoSQL Injection:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, potentially command execution on the database server *used by ThingsBoard*.
    *   **Command Injection:**  Remote code execution on the ThingsBoard server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the specific injection type and impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strict input validation** on all telemetry data received from devices *within ThingsBoard's data ingestion and processing layers*.
    *   **Sanitize and encode data** before displaying it in the UI *within ThingsBoard's frontend components* to prevent XSS.
    *   **Use parameterized queries or ORM features** to prevent NoSQL injection *in ThingsBoard's backend data access logic*.
    *   **Avoid using telemetry data directly in server-side commands within ThingsBoard components.** If necessary, implement robust sanitization and input validation.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Compromise](./attack_surfaces/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access due to compromised API keys used for device and integration authentication.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard relies heavily on API keys for authentication of devices and external integrations. If these keys, *managed and used by ThingsBoard*, are not managed securely, they become a significant vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to an API key *intended for ThingsBoard authentication* through insecure storage on a device, network sniffing, or social engineering. They then use this API key to impersonate the device, send malicious telemetry, or control the device through RPC calls *via ThingsBoard APIs*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized device control:** Sending commands to devices *through ThingsBoard*, potentially causing physical damage or disruption.
    *   **Data manipulation:** Sending false telemetry data *to ThingsBoard*, corrupting data integrity.
    *   **Data breaches:** Accessing device data and potentially other sensitive information *managed by ThingsBoard*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Securely generate API keys** *using ThingsBoard's API key generation mechanisms*.
    *   **Store API keys securely** on devices and in integrations.
    *   **Use short-lived API keys** and implement key rotation mechanisms *if supported by ThingsBoard or implemented externally*.
    *   **Transmit API keys over secure channels** (HTTPS, TLS/SSL) *when interacting with ThingsBoard APIs*.
    *   **Implement access control based on API keys** *within ThingsBoard's authorization framework* to limit the scope of access if a key is compromised.

## Attack Surface: [Rule Engine Scripting Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rule_engine_scripting_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Rule Engine's scripting capabilities to execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** The Rule Engine's flexibility, including custom scripting (often JavaScript), *within ThingsBoard* introduces a potential attack surface if not properly sandboxed and secured *by ThingsBoard*.
*   **Example:** An attacker with access to create or modify rule chains injects malicious JavaScript code into a Rule Engine script node *in ThingsBoard*. This script escapes the sandbox and gains access to the server's file system, allowing them to read sensitive configuration files or execute system commands *on the ThingsBoard server*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Full server compromise *of the ThingsBoard instance*.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing and stealing sensitive data stored within ThingsBoard.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Resource exhaustion by malicious scripts *within the Rule Engine*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement strong sandboxing** for Rule Engine scripts *within ThingsBoard* to restrict access to system resources and APIs.
    *   **Regularly update the scripting engine** *used by ThingsBoard's Rule Engine* to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Limit user access to Rule Engine configuration** to authorized personnel only *within ThingsBoard's user management system*.
    *   **Implement code review and security testing** for custom Rule Engine scripts *developed for ThingsBoard*.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities present in third-party libraries and frameworks used by ThingsBoard.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard, like most complex software, relies on numerous external libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies *included in the ThingsBoard distribution* can directly impact ThingsBoard's security.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of a library *used by ThingsBoard* for web server functionality. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the ThingsBoard server *running ThingsBoard*.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS)**
    *   **Data Breaches**
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** to track all third-party dependencies *of ThingsBoard*.
    *   **Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities** using automated tools *against ThingsBoard's dependencies*.
    *   **Promptly update ThingsBoard** to the latest versions, especially when security patches are released *that address dependency vulnerabilities*.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured MQTT Broker (if embedded)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_mqtt_broker__if_embedded_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from a misconfigured or vulnerable *embedded* MQTT broker used for device communication.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard *can* use an embedded MQTT broker as a core component for device connectivity. The security of this *embedded* broker directly impacts the overall security of the ThingsBoard platform.
*   **Example:** An *embedded* MQTT broker *within ThingsBoard* is configured with default credentials or without authentication enabled. An attacker connects to the broker, subscribes to device topics, and intercepts sensitive telemetry data or publishes malicious commands to devices *communicating with ThingsBoard via the embedded broker*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data breaches:** Interception of sensitive telemetry data.
    *   **Unauthorized device control:** Sending malicious commands to devices.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Overloading the MQTT broker.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Securely configure the *embedded* MQTT broker *if used by ThingsBoard*:**
        *   **Disable default credentials and set strong passwords.**
        *   **Enable authentication and authorization.**
        *   **Use TLS/SSL encryption for communication.**
        *   **Harden the broker's configuration according to security best practices *as applicable to the embedded broker within ThingsBoard*.**
    *   **Regularly update ThingsBoard** to patch known vulnerabilities *in the embedded MQTT broker if applicable*.
