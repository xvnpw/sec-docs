## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via ThingsBoard Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_thingsboard_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal.  Success here signifies a complete breach of the application's security via ThingsBoard. It's critical because it represents the overall objective of the threat model.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses in ThingsBoard [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses_in_thingsboard__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** Authentication and authorization are the foundational pillars of security. Weaknesses in these areas directly allow attackers to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized entry into the system.
    *   **Attack Vectors within this Path:**
        *   **Credential Stuffing/Brute Force Attacks on ThingsBoard User Accounts [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Common and effective, especially if weak passwords are permitted or rate limiting is insufficient. Success grants direct access to user accounts and their associated privileges within ThingsBoard.
        *   **Default Credentials Exploitation (if any exist in ThingsBoard) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  Extremely easy to exploit if default credentials are not changed during deployment. Provides immediate administrative or privileged access.
        *   **Authorization Bypass Vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard APIs or UI [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  Directly circumvents intended access controls. Vulnerabilities in the code or configuration that enforce authorization can allow attackers to perform actions they should not be permitted to, potentially gaining administrative privileges or accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Injection/Manipulation Vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_injectionmanipulation_vulnerabilities_in_thingsboard__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** Data integrity is paramount for applications relying on IoT platforms like ThingsBoard.  Manipulating data can lead to incorrect application behavior, system instability, or even physical consequences in connected devices.
    *   **Attack Vectors within this Path:**
        *   **Malicious Telemetry Data Injection to Impact Application Logic [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** If the application logic relies on telemetry data from ThingsBoard without proper validation, injecting malicious data can directly manipulate the application's behavior, potentially causing malfunctions or enabling further attacks.
        *   **Attribute Manipulation to Gain Unauthorized Access or Control [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Attributes in ThingsBoard often control device behavior or system configurations.  Manipulating these attributes without proper authorization can lead to unauthorized control over devices or system functionalities.
        *   **Exploiting Insecure Data Handling in Custom Integrations (if any) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Custom integrations often introduce new attack surfaces if not developed securely. Insecure data handling in these integrations can allow attackers to inject malicious data or extract sensitive information as data flows between ThingsBoard and external systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard (REST, MQTT, CoAP, etc.) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_vulnerabilities_in_thingsboard__rest__mqtt__coap__etc____critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** APIs are the primary interfaces for interacting with ThingsBoard. Vulnerabilities in these APIs can provide attackers with direct access to system functionalities, data, and control mechanisms.
    *   **Attack Vectors within this Path:**
        *   **REST API Vulnerabilities (e.g., Injection flaws, Broken Authentication, Rate Limiting issues) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** REST APIs are commonly targeted. Injection flaws (like SQL Injection, Command Injection) and broken authentication mechanisms in the REST API can allow attackers to bypass security controls, execute arbitrary code, or access sensitive data. Insufficient rate limiting can lead to Denial of Service.
        *   **MQTT/CoAP Broker Vulnerabilities (e.g., Message Injection, Topic Hijacking, DoS) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** MQTT and CoAP are protocols often used for IoT device communication. Vulnerabilities in the brokers or the way ThingsBoard handles these protocols can allow attackers to inject malicious messages, hijack device communication topics, or launch Denial of Service attacks against device communication channels.
        *   **Insecure API Keys/Credentials Management within ThingsBoard [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** API keys and credentials provide access to ThingsBoard APIs. If these are insecurely managed (e.g., hardcoded, stored in plaintext, easily guessable), attackers can compromise them and gain unauthorized API access, potentially bypassing other security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Software Vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard Components [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_software_vulnerabilities_in_thingsboard_components__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** Software vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard itself or its underlying components (like the database, web server, or libraries) can be severe and widely exploitable. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors within this Path:**
        *   **Known Vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard Core Application (Java code, libraries) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Vulnerabilities in the core ThingsBoard application code are direct weaknesses in the platform itself. Exploiting known vulnerabilities (especially those with public exploits) can be relatively easy for attackers if systems are not promptly patched.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Underlying Infrastructure (e.g., Database - PostgreSQL/Cassandra, Web Server - Tomcat/Netty) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:**  ThingsBoard relies on underlying infrastructure components. Vulnerabilities in these components (like the database or web server) can be exploited to compromise the entire ThingsBoard deployment and potentially the application using it.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard (Libraries, Frameworks) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** ThingsBoard uses various third-party libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect ThingsBoard. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise ThingsBoard if dependency management is not robust and updates are not applied promptly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations in ThingsBoard Deployment [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_in_thingsboard_deployment__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** Misconfigurations are a common source of vulnerabilities in deployed systems. They are often easy to exploit and can have significant security implications.
    *   **Attack Vectors within this Path:**
        *   **Insecure Default Configurations Left Unchanged [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Default configurations are often designed for ease of setup, not security. Leaving them unchanged in production environments is a major security risk. Examples include default passwords, exposed services, or overly permissive access controls.
        *   **Exposed Admin Interfaces or Debug Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Why High-Risk:** Admin interfaces and debug endpoints are intended for management and development, not public access. If these are exposed to the internet or unauthorized networks, attackers can leverage them to gain administrative control or extract sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Logging and Monitoring for Security Events [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_logging_and_monitoring_for_security_events__critical_node_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** While not a direct attack path, insufficient logging and monitoring is a *critical* security weakness. It severely hinders the ability to detect and respond to *any* type of attack. Without proper logging, attacks can go unnoticed, allowing attackers to maintain persistence and cause greater damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Network Segmentation, Exposing ThingsBoard to Unnecessary Risks [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_network_segmentation__exposing_thingsboard_to_unnecessary_risks__critical_node_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** Lack of network segmentation is a *critical* architectural flaw. It increases the attack surface and blast radius of any successful compromise. If ThingsBoard and its components are not properly isolated within the network, a compromise in one area can more easily spread to other critical systems and resources.
