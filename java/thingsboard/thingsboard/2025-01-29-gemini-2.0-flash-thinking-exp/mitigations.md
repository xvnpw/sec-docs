    2.  **Disable or Delete Default Accounts in ThingsBoard UI:**  Disable or delete these default accounts immediately after ThingsBoard installation through the **Users** section in the UI. If deletion is not possible, change their passwords to strong, unique passwords and restrict their roles to the minimum necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Rule Engine Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rule_engine_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Rule Chain Validation in ThingsBoard:** Implement thorough validation and testing for ThingsBoard rule chains before deploying them to production. Ensure rule chains are logically sound, perform as expected, and do not introduce security vulnerabilities or resource exhaustion.
    2.  **Resource Limits in ThingsBoard Rules:** Configure resource limits within ThingsBoard rule chains to prevent resource exhaustion or denial-of-service attacks caused by poorly designed or malicious rules. This might involve setting limits on script execution time, memory usage, or message processing rates within rule chain nodes.
    3.  **Input Validation in ThingsBoard Rules:** Validate inputs within ThingsBoard rule chains to prevent processing of malicious or unexpected data. Use script nodes or filter nodes to validate data at various stages of rule chain processing.
    4.  **Output Sanitization in ThingsBoard Rules:** Sanitize outputs from ThingsBoard rule chains before sending them to external systems or displaying them in the UI. Use script nodes to sanitize data before external API calls or UI updates.
    5.  **Rule Chain Auditing in ThingsBoard:** Implement auditing to track changes to ThingsBoard rule chains and monitor their execution for suspicious activity or errors. ThingsBoard audit logs can be used to track rule chain modifications and execution events.
    6.  **Least Privilege for Rule Execution in ThingsBoard:** Ensure ThingsBoard rule chains execute with the least necessary privileges. Avoid granting excessive permissions to rule chains that are not required for their intended functionality. Review the permissions required by custom rule chain nodes or integrations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Rule Engine-Based DoS Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from creating or modifying ThingsBoard rules that cause denial-of-service by consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Rule Engine-Based Data Breaches (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches caused by vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in ThingsBoard rule chains that might unintentionally expose sensitive data.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions via Rule Engine (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from using the ThingsBoard rule engine to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying device attributes or sending malicious commands.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Rule Engine-Based DoS Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Rule Engine-Based Data Breaches:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Unauthorized Actions via Rule Engine:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic rule chain validation might be performed, but resource limits within ThingsBoard rules, input validation, output sanitization, and rule chain auditing are likely missing. Least privilege for rule execution is often not explicitly considered.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal rule chain validation process for ThingsBoard, configuration of resource limits within ThingsBoard rule chain nodes, systematic input validation and output sanitization within rule chains, rule chain auditing using ThingsBoard logs, and explicit consideration of least privilege when designing and deploying rule chains in ThingsBoard.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update ThingsBoard and Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_thingsboard_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish ThingsBoard Update Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for updating ThingsBoard itself and its dependencies (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
    2.  **Subscribe to ThingsBoard Security Advisories:** Subscribe to the official ThingsBoard security advisories and mailing lists to receive timely notifications about security vulnerabilities and available updates for the platform.
    3.  **Test ThingsBoard Updates in Staging Environment:** Before applying updates to the production ThingsBoard environment, thoroughly test them in a dedicated staging or test environment. This ensures compatibility with existing configurations, widgets, rule chains, and integrations, and verifies stability.
    4.  **Apply ThingsBoard Security Updates Promptly:** Apply security updates and patches for ThingsBoard promptly after testing and verification in the staging environment. Prioritize security updates over feature updates to minimize the window of vulnerability.
    5.  **Dependency Management for ThingsBoard:** Keep track of ThingsBoard's dependencies (Java, database, message queue, etc.) and update them regularly as well. Follow ThingsBoard's recommendations for compatible dependency versions and update them according to the established schedule.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in the ThingsBoard platform or its dependencies that are addressed by updates.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Medium Severity):** While updates cannot directly prevent zero-day exploits, keeping ThingsBoard updated reduces the overall attack surface and ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched, improving the overall security posture against various threats, including potential zero-days.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. ThingsBoard updates might be applied occasionally, but a regular update schedule, dedicated staging environment for testing updates, and proactive dependency management are likely missing. Prompt application of security updates might not be consistently followed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establishment of a regular ThingsBoard update schedule, creation and maintenance of a staging environment for testing ThingsBoard updates, implementation of a dependency management process for ThingsBoard and its components, and consistent and prompt application of security updates for ThingsBoard and its dependencies.
