# Threat Model Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Threat: [Weak Device Credentials or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_device_credentials_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit devices provisioned with weak or default credentials (easily guessable device tokens). They impersonate these devices to send malicious telemetry, control devices, or disrupt operations. This is achieved by brute-forcing or using known default credentials.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized device control and manipulation.
*   Injection of false or malicious data, corrupting data integrity.
*   Denial of service by overwhelming the system with malicious data.
*   Potential compromise of systems relying on device data.

**Affected ThingsBoard Component:** Device Provisioning, Device Authentication

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong, randomly generated device token policies during provisioning.
*   Implement secure device provisioning mechanisms (e.g., certificate-based authentication).
*   Regularly audit and rotate device credentials.
*   Disable or change default device credentials immediately after provisioning.

## Threat: [Data Injection Attacks via Telemetry](./threats/data_injection_attacks_via_telemetry.md)

**Description:** Attackers send crafted malicious telemetry data to ThingsBoard, exploiting vulnerabilities in data parsing, validation, or processing. This can lead to data corruption, system instability, or potentially remote code execution if vulnerabilities exist in data handling components within ThingsBoard.

**Impact:**
*   Data corruption and loss of data integrity within ThingsBoard.
*   System instability, crashes, and denial of service.
*   In severe cases, remote code execution on ThingsBoard servers.

**Affected ThingsBoard Component:** Telemetry Service, Rule Engine, Data Persistence

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all telemetry data.
*   Use data schemas and validation rules to enforce expected data formats.
*   Regularly update ThingsBoard to patch data processing vulnerabilities.
*   Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection for telemetry data.

## Threat: [Rule Engine Logic Exploitation](./threats/rule_engine_logic_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers with access to Rule Engine configuration (e.g., compromised admin accounts) create or modify rules to perform unauthorized actions. This includes data manipulation, triggering malicious workflows, or system disruption. Poorly designed rules can also introduce vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized data manipulation and modification within ThingsBoard.
*   Disruption of system workflows and business logic.
*   Potential for privilege escalation and unauthorized access.
*   Data breaches if rules are used to exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Affected ThingsBoard Component:** Rule Engine

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access control for Rule Engine configuration (RBAC, least privilege).
*   Regularly audit and review Rule Engine rules for security and unintended logic.
*   Use version control and change management for Rule Engine configurations.
*   Employ code review for custom Rule Engine scripts.

## Threat: [Data Storage Vulnerabilities](./threats/data_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Underlying data storage (Cassandra/PostgreSQL) used by ThingsBoard may have vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Exploiting these allows attackers unauthorized access to sensitive data, system configurations, or database compromise.

**Impact:**
*   Data breaches and exposure of sensitive device and system data.
*   Data loss or corruption due to database compromise.
*   Denial of service by disrupting database operations.
*   Potential for complete system compromise.

**Affected ThingsBoard Component:** Data Persistence (Cassandra/PostgreSQL) - ThingsBoard's dependency and configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Harden database systems according to security best practices (strong passwords, access control).
*   Regularly patch and update database systems.
*   Implement proper access control and authentication for database access.
*   Encrypt data at rest and in transit within the database layer.
*   Regular database backups and disaster recovery planning.

## Threat: [MQTT Broker Vulnerabilities](./threats/mqtt_broker_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If using ThingsBoard's built-in MQTT broker or a tightly integrated external one, vulnerabilities in the broker software or configuration can be exploited. Attackers can intercept communications, inject messages, or disrupt MQTT services.

**Impact:**
*   Interception of device telemetry data and control commands.
*   Injection of malicious commands to devices.
*   Denial of service for device communication.
*   Potential for wider system compromise.

**Affected ThingsBoard Component:** MQTT Transport, MQTT Broker (built-in or tightly integrated)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep MQTT broker software updated with security patches.
*   Harden broker configuration (disable unnecessary features, strong authentication).
*   Use TLS/SSL encryption for MQTT communication.
*   Secure and monitor external brokers if used.

## Threat: [API Access Control Bypass](./threats/api_access_control_bypass.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard's REST APIs or other APIs (CoAP, HTTP) could allow attackers to bypass access controls. This enables unauthorized actions like accessing data, modifying configurations, controlling devices, or gaining admin privileges.

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data and system configurations.
*   Data manipulation and modification via APIs.
*   Unauthorized control of devices.
*   Potential for privilege escalation and complete system compromise.

**Affected ThingsBoard Component:** REST API, CoAP Transport, HTTP Transport, Security Subsystem

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit and test ThingsBoard APIs for vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all API endpoints (OAuth 2.0, API keys).
*   Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
*   Use API rate limiting and throttling.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Communication Channels](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks_on_communication_channels.md)

**Description:** Unsecured communication channels between devices and ThingsBoard or between ThingsBoard components (e.g., unencrypted HTTP/MQTT) allow attackers to intercept communication. They can eavesdrop, inject messages, or tamper with data in transit.

**Impact:**
*   Eavesdropping on sensitive data and control commands.
*   Data manipulation and injection of false data or commands.
*   Loss of data integrity and confidentiality.
*   Potential for unauthorized access if credentials are intercepted.

**Affected ThingsBoard Component:** All Transport Protocols (MQTT, HTTP, CoAP), Communication Infrastructure

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
