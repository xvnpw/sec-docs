## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Spoof Device Data (1.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_spoof_device_data__1_1_1_.md)

**Goal:** Inject malicious or misleading data into the application through a compromised or simulated device.

**How:**

*   Exploit weak or missing device authentication/authorization mechanisms in ThingsBoard.
*   Reverse engineer device communication protocols to send fabricated telemetry data.
*   Compromise legitimate device credentials to send malicious data.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Rule Chain Logic (1.2.1)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_rule_chain_logic__1_2_1_.md)

**Goal:** Introduce malicious logic into the ThingsBoard rule engine to manipulate data flow or trigger unintended actions within the application.

**How:**

*   Exploit vulnerabilities in the rule chain management API or UI.
*   Compromise administrator credentials to directly modify rule chains.
*   Inject malicious code into custom rule nodes (if allowed).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit ThingsBoard API Vulnerabilities (1.3.1)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_thingsboard_api_vulnerabilities__1_3_1_.md)

**Goal:** Bypass authentication or authorization checks in the ThingsBoard API to gain unauthorized access to data or functionalities that impact the application.

**How:**

*   Exploit known vulnerabilities in the ThingsBoard REST or MQTT APIs (e.g., authentication bypass, privilege escalation).
*   Abuse insecure API endpoints or parameters.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Default or Weak Credentials (1.3.2)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_default_or_weak_credentials__1_3_2_.md)

**Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to ThingsBoard administrative or user accounts using default or easily guessable credentials.

**How:**

*   Attempt to log in with default credentials (if not changed).
*   Use brute-force or dictionary attacks against weak passwords.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Connected Devices (2.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_connected_devices__2_1_1_.md)

**Goal:** Compromise devices managed by ThingsBoard to manipulate data or gain access to the application indirectly.

**How:**

*   Exploit vulnerabilities in device firmware or software.
*   Leverage weak device security practices (e.g., default passwords).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Spoof Device Data (1.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_spoof_device_data__1_1_1_.md)

- See High-Risk Path description above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Rule Engine Exploitation (1.2)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_rule_engine_exploitation__1_2_.md)

**Successful exploitation of the rule engine can lead to:**

*   Alteration of data before it reaches the application, leading to incorrect processing.
*   Triggering actions within ThingsBoard that have a negative impact on the application (e.g., disabling devices, sending incorrect commands).
*   Potentially gaining unauthorized access to application resources if rule chains are used for authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Authentication & Authorization Bypass (1.3)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_authentication_&_authorization_bypass__1_3_.md)

**Successful bypass of authentication and authorization mechanisms can lead to:**

*   Direct access and manipulation of device data, potentially disrupting application logic.
*   Gaining control over devices managed by ThingsBoard, impacting the application's functionality.
*   Accessing sensitive information about devices or users that the application relies on.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Default or Weak Credentials (1.3.2)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_default_or_weak_credentials__1_3_2_.md)

- See High-Risk Path description above.
