# Threat Model Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Threat: [Weak Default Device Credentials](./threats/weak_default_device_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage default or easily guessable device credentials (e.g., default access tokens) that haven't been changed after device provisioning *within ThingsBoard*. They would use these credentials to authenticate as the device *to ThingsBoard*.

**Impact:** The attacker could read sensor data from the device *within ThingsBoard*, send malicious control commands *through ThingsBoard*, or potentially use the compromised device as a pivot point to attack other parts of the system *managed by ThingsBoard*.

**Affected Component:** Device Provisioning Module, Authentication Service

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong, unique, and randomly generated device credentials *within ThingsBoard* during provisioning.
*   Implement a mechanism *within ThingsBoard* for mandatory credential rotation after initial setup.
*   Provide clear documentation and guidance to users on secure device credential management *within the ThingsBoard context*.

## Threat: [Message Broker Injection/Interception](./threats/message_broker_injectioninterception.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying message broker (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP) or its configuration *within the ThingsBoard deployment* to inject malicious messages or intercept legitimate communication between devices and ThingsBoard. They might eavesdrop on data or send forged messages *intended for ThingsBoard*.

**Impact:** Data integrity could be compromised *within ThingsBoard*, leading to incorrect readings or actions. Malicious control commands could be injected, causing devices to malfunction or perform unintended actions *through ThingsBoard's control mechanisms*. Sensitive data transmitted through the broker *to or from ThingsBoard* could be exposed.

**Affected Component:** Transport Layer (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP), Message Queue

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure the message broker with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms *as configured within ThingsBoard*.
*   Use encrypted communication channels (TLS/SSL) for all message broker connections *used by ThingsBoard*.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization on data received from the message broker *within ThingsBoard's processing logic*.
*   Regularly update the message broker software *used by the ThingsBoard instance* to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Rule Engine Manipulation](./threats/rule_engine_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges *within ThingsBoard* could create or modify rule chains to perform unauthorized actions. They might create rules that exfiltrate data *from ThingsBoard*, suppress alerts *within ThingsBoard*, or send malicious commands to devices based on specific triggers *within the ThingsBoard rule engine*.

**Impact:** Significant operational disruption *within the ThingsBoard managed environment*, data breaches *of data processed by ThingsBoard*, or unauthorized control of devices *through ThingsBoard*. Critical alerts might be missed, leading to delayed responses to critical situations *monitored by ThingsBoard*.

**Affected Component:** Rule Engine Module, Workflow Engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control and authorization *within ThingsBoard* for modifying rule chains.
*   Regularly audit and review existing rule chains *within ThingsBoard* for suspicious or unauthorized logic.
*   Implement a version control system *for ThingsBoard rule chains* to track changes and facilitate rollback.
*   Consider a review process for rule chain modifications by authorized personnel *within the ThingsBoard administration*.

## Threat: [Data Storage Exploitation](./threats/data_storage_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how ThingsBoard stores and manages device data (time-series data, attributes, telemetry). This could involve SQL injection (if custom queries are used insecurely *within ThingsBoard components*), access control bypasses *within ThingsBoard's data access layer*, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying database *used by ThingsBoard*.

**Impact:** Sensitive device data *managed by ThingsBoard* could be exposed, modified, or deleted. Historical data integrity could be compromised, affecting analytics and decision-making *based on ThingsBoard data*.

**Affected Component:** Data Persistence Layer (e.g., Cassandra, PostgreSQL), Time Series Database

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities if custom database interactions are implemented *within ThingsBoard*.
*   Ensure proper access control and authorization *within ThingsBoard* for accessing and manipulating stored data.
*   Regularly back up data *stored by ThingsBoard* and implement disaster recovery plans.
*   Harden the underlying database system *used by ThingsBoard* and keep it up to date with security patches.

## Threat: [API Key/Token Compromise](./threats/api_keytoken_compromise.md)

**Description:** An attacker could obtain API keys or access tokens *issued by ThingsBoard* used to interact with the ThingsBoard platform programmatically. This could happen through insecure storage, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in systems that use these keys *to interact with ThingsBoard*.

**Impact:** The attacker could perform any action allowed by the compromised API key/token *within ThingsBoard*, such as creating/modifying devices, rules, dashboards, or accessing stored data.

**Affected Component:** API Gateway, Authentication Service, Authorization Service

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store API keys and access tokens *generated by ThingsBoard* securely (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management systems).
*   Implement proper access control and restrict the permissions associated with API keys/tokens based on the principle of least privilege *within ThingsBoard*.
*   Regularly rotate API keys and access tokens *managed by ThingsBoard*.
*   Monitor API usage *within ThingsBoard* for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Tenant Isolation Failure](./threats/tenant_isolation_failure.md)

**Description:** In multi-tenant deployments, vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard's tenant isolation mechanisms could allow an attacker within one tenant to access or manipulate data or resources belonging to another tenant *within the same ThingsBoard instance*.

**Impact:** Confidential data of different customers could be exposed, leading to privacy breaches and regulatory violations. Malicious actions in one tenant could impact other tenants *within the ThingsBoard platform*.

**Affected Component:** Tenant Management Module, Authorization Service

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test and validate tenant isolation mechanisms *within ThingsBoard* during development and deployment.
*   Implement strict access control policies *within ThingsBoard* to prevent cross-tenant access.
*   Regularly audit tenant configurations and permissions *within ThingsBoard*.
*   Keep the ThingsBoard platform updated with the latest security patches that address multi-tenancy vulnerabilities.
