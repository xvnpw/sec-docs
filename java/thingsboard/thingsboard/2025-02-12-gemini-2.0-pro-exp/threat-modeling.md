# Threat Model Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Threat: [Rogue Device Registration and Data Injection](./threats/rogue_device_registration_and_data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a rogue device with Thingsboard, either by obtaining valid device credentials through theft or social engineering, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the device provisioning process (e.g., weak authentication, lack of device identity verification). The attacker then uses this rogue device to inject fabricated sensor data or malicious commands into the Thingsboard platform.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Corruption: False data pollutes historical data, dashboards, and any analytics, leading to incorrect decisions and potentially dangerous actions.
        *   System Manipulation: Malicious commands sent through the rogue device could trigger unintended actions in connected systems or devices, potentially causing physical damage or safety hazards.
        *   Reputational Damage: Inaccurate data or system malfunctions erode trust in the IoT solution and the organization providing it.
    *   **Affected Thingsboard Component:**
        *   Device Provisioning Service (specifically, the registration and authentication mechanisms).
        *   Transport Layer (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP) - the entry point for device data.
        *   Rule Engine (if malicious data triggers rules, leading to further actions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Device Authentication:** Implement robust authentication *beyond* simple access tokens.  Mandatory use of X.509 certificates with a properly managed Certificate Authority (CA), or pre-shared keys (PSK) with secure key management and rotation procedures.  Do *not* rely solely on access tokens.
        *   **Secure Device Provisioning:** Utilize Thingsboard's secure provisioning features, but augment them with a multi-step process.  This *must* include out-of-band verification (e.g., manual approval by an administrator, QR code scanning with a trusted mobile app, physical button press on the device).
        *   **Device Identity Validation:** Enforce unique device identifiers and *prevent* duplicate registrations.  Validate device metadata (firmware version, hardware ID, serial number) during registration and periodically thereafter.  Reject devices that fail validation.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement rules within the Thingsboard Rule Engine to detect anomalous data patterns from devices.  This includes values outside expected ranges, sudden spikes or drops, and unusual data frequencies.  Trigger alerts and potentially quarantine devices exhibiting suspicious behavior.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate of device registration and data ingestion to prevent flooding attacks and slow down brute-force attempts to register rogue devices.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Tenant/Customer Data via API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_tenantcustomer_data_via_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Thingsboard tenant or customer account.  This is typically achieved through compromised credentials (obtained via phishing, credential stuffing, or password reuse) or by exploiting a vulnerability in the Thingsboard API itself (e.g., insufficient authorization checks, insecure direct object references).  The attacker then leverages the API to access or modify sensitive data, devices, or configurations.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Breach: Sensitive customer data, device data, and potentially intellectual property are exposed, leading to legal and financial consequences.
        *   System Compromise: The attacker could modify device configurations, rules, or dashboards, disrupting operations, causing damage, or creating safety hazards.
        *   Regulatory Non-compliance: Data breaches violate privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, etc.), leading to significant fines and penalties.
    *   **Affected Thingsboard Component:**
        *   REST API (all endpoints, but particularly those related to user management, device management, data access, and rule management).
        *   Authentication and Authorization Service (specifically, the mechanisms for validating API requests and enforcing access control).
        *   User Management Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for *all* user accounts, without exception.  This is the single most effective control against credential-based attacks.
        *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong, unique password policies and regularly audit user passwords for compliance.  Consider using a password manager.
        *   **API Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting on *all* API requests to prevent brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and denial-of-service attempts.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* API inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).  Use a well-defined schema for API requests and responses.
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the Thingsboard API, specifically focusing on authentication, authorization, and input validation.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege.  Use Thingsboard's RBAC features to grant users and API clients *only* the minimum necessary permissions.  Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Rule Engine Manipulation](./threats/rule_engine_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having gained access to the Thingsboard UI or API (through compromised credentials or an exploit), modifies existing rules or creates new malicious rules within the Rule Engine.  These manipulated rules can then trigger unintended actions, disable security features, exfiltrate data to external systems, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   System Malfunction: Incorrect or malicious rules can cause devices to behave erratically, damage connected systems, or create unsafe conditions.
        *   Data Exfiltration: Rules can be crafted to send sensitive data to unauthorized external endpoints, leading to a data breach.
        *   Denial of Service: Malicious rules can consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to platform instability and unavailability.
        *   Security Feature Bypass: Rules designed for security monitoring or anomaly detection could be disabled or modified to prevent them from functioning correctly.
    *   **Affected Thingsboard Component:**
        *   Rule Engine (specifically, the rule creation, modification, execution, and persistence logic).
        *   UI components related to rule management.
        *   API endpoints related to rule management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control:** Severely restrict access to the Rule Engine configuration.  Only highly trusted administrators should have the ability to create, modify, or delete rules.  Use RBAC to enforce this.
        *   **Rule Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation checks on rule configurations *before* they are saved or executed.  This should include static analysis of rule logic to identify potentially malicious patterns (e.g., sending data to external URLs, executing arbitrary commands).
        *   **Change Management and Auditing:** Implement a formal change management process for all rule modifications.  This *must* include approvals, version control, and comprehensive audit trails that record who made the change, when, and why.
        *   **Rule Engine Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore options for sandboxing the Rule Engine to limit its access to system resources and prevent it from executing arbitrary code.  This is a complex mitigation, but can significantly reduce the impact of a compromised rule.
        *   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor rule execution for anomalies and unexpected behavior.  Implement alerts for suspicious rule activity.

## Threat: [Database Tampering](./threats/database_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Although mitigated by application-level controls, direct database tampering remains a critical risk. An attacker gains direct access to the Thingsboard database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cassandra) and modifies or deletes data, bypassing Thingsboard's application logic. This could occur through a compromised database account, a vulnerability in the database server itself, or (less directly Thingsboard-related, but still critical) a SQL injection vulnerability in a *custom* Thingsboard extension or integration.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data Corruption: Historical data is altered or deleted, leading to incorrect analysis, flawed decision-making, and potential operational failures.
        *   System Instability: Database corruption can cause Thingsboard to malfunction, crash, or become completely unavailable.
        *   Data Loss: Critical data, including device configurations, user accounts, and historical telemetry, may be permanently lost.
    *   **Affected Thingsboard Component:**
        *   Database (PostgreSQL, Cassandra, or TimescaleDB, depending on the deployment).
        *   Data Access Layer (within Thingsboard, the components that interact with the database â€“ although the *vulnerability* is external, the *component* affected is still part of Thingsboard's architecture).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Database Security Hardening:** Secure the database server according to *all* applicable best practices. This includes strong, unique passwords; network segmentation (isolating the database server from the public internet); regular security updates and patching; disabling unnecessary features and services; and enabling robust logging and auditing.
        *   **Least Privilege Database Access:** Grant Thingsboard's database user account *only* the absolute minimum necessary privileges.  Specifically, the Thingsboard application should *not* have schema modification privileges (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
        *   **Database Auditing:** Enable comprehensive database auditing to track *all* data modifications, access attempts, and administrative actions.  Regularly review these audit logs.
        *   **Database Encryption:** Use database encryption at rest (to protect data stored on disk) and in transit (to protect data transmitted between Thingsboard and the database).
        *   **Regular, Secure Backups:** Implement regular, automated, and *secure* backups of the database.  Test the restoration process regularly to ensure backups are valid and can be used to recover from a disaster. Store backups in a separate, secure location.
        * **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries (Application-Level):** While this threat model focuses on Thingsboard-specific risks, it's *critical* that all database interactions within Thingsboard (and any custom extensions) use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. This is a fundamental security best practice.
