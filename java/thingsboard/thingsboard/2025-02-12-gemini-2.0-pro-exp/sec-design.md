## BUILD

The ThingsBoard build process involves several steps, from code compilation to packaging and distribution.  The repository uses Gradle as the build tool.  Here's a breakdown, focusing on security:

1.  Developer:  A developer writes code and commits it to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions (CI/CD):  GitHub Actions workflows are triggered on code commits and pull requests. These workflows automate the build process.
3.  Code Checkout: The workflow checks out the source code from the repository.
4.  Dependency Management: Gradle resolves and downloads project dependencies (Java libraries, etc.).
    *   Security Control: Dependency scanning using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. This should be integrated into the Gradle build.
5.  Compilation:  Gradle compiles the Java code into bytecode.
6.  Static Analysis (SAST):
    *   Security Control:  Integrate a SAST tool (e.g., SonarQube, FindBugs, SpotBugs) into the build process to analyze the source code for potential security vulnerabilities.  This should be a mandatory step in the CI pipeline.
7.  Unit Testing:  Run unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
8.  Integration Testing: Run integration tests to verify the interaction between different components.
9.  Packaging:  Gradle packages the compiled code and resources into JAR files and other artifacts.
10. Docker Image Build:  Dockerfiles are used to create Docker images for the various ThingsBoard components (core, web UI, transport services, rule engine).
    *   Security Control:  Use minimal base images for Docker containers to reduce the attack surface.
    *   Security Control:  Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy, Clair, or Anchore.
11. Artifact Storage:  Build artifacts (JAR files, Docker images) are stored in a repository (e.g., Docker Hub, Artifactory, Nexus).
    *   Security Control:  Implement access control and authentication for the artifact repository.
12. Release:  Tagged commits trigger the creation of releases on GitHub, making the built artifacts available for download.
