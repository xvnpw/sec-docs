# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Default Account Handling (ThingsBoard-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_default_account_handling__thingsboard-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Eliminate Default Accounts and Enforce Strong Credentials within ThingsBoard.

**Description:**
1.  **Initial Login:** Access the ThingsBoard UI using the default `sysadmin@thingsboard.org` credentials.
2.  **New Admin Creation:** Navigate to the "Users" section within ThingsBoard. Create a *new* system administrator user with a strong, unique password (managed via a password manager).
3.  **New Tenant Admin Creation:** Log in as the new system administrator.  Navigate to the "Tenants" section and create a *new* tenant administrator user, again with a strong, unique password.
4.  **Default Account Deletion:** *Delete* the original `sysadmin@thingsboard.org` and `tenant@thingsboard.org` users through the ThingsBoard UI.  This is done within the "Users" and "Tenants" sections, respectively.
5.  **Password Policy (if available):** If ThingsBoard's user management interface allows, configure a password policy to enforce minimum length, complexity, and expiration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Brute-force attacks against default ThingsBoard accounts (Severity: Critical).
*   **Threat:** Credential stuffing attacks against default ThingsBoard accounts (Severity: Critical).
*   **Threat:** Unauthorized access via compromised default ThingsBoard credentials (Severity: Critical).

**Impact:**
*   Eliminates the attack vector of default accounts, significantly reducing risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Check if the default accounts still exist within the ThingsBoard UI.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Default accounts still present in the ThingsBoard user and tenant management sections.
*   Lack of a strong password policy enforced *within* ThingsBoard (if the feature is available).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) for User Roles (ThingsBoard-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__polp__for_user_roles__thingsboard-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Custom Roles with Minimal Permissions using ThingsBoard's RBAC.

**Description:**
1.  **Role Definition:** Within ThingsBoard's "Roles" section, define custom roles based on user responsibilities.
2.  **Permission Analysis:** For each custom role, carefully select *only* the necessary permissions from the available options within ThingsBoard's RBAC interface.  Do *not* use the built-in "Tenant Administrator" role unless absolutely required.
3.  **Role Assignment:** Assign users to these custom roles through the ThingsBoard "Users" section.
4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the roles and permissions within ThingsBoard's interface to ensure they remain appropriate.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** Insider threats within ThingsBoard (Severity: High).
*   **Threat:** Privilege escalation within ThingsBoard (Severity: High).
*   **Threat:** Data breaches via compromised ThingsBoard user accounts (Severity: High).

**Impact:**
*   Limits the damage from compromised accounts and insider threats within the ThingsBoard platform.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Check if custom roles are defined and used appropriately within ThingsBoard's "Roles" section.  Look for overuse of the "Tenant Administrator" role.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Reliance on the default "Tenant Administrator" role for most users.
*   Absence of custom roles with granular permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure JWT Secret Management (ThingsBoard-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_jwt_secret_management__thingsboard-specific_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure a Strong, Unique JWT Secret in `thingsboard.yml`.

**Description:**
1.  **Secret Generation:** Generate a strong, random string (at least 64 characters) using a secure method (e.g., `openssl rand -base64 64`).
2.  **`thingsboard.yml` Configuration:**  Open the `thingsboard.yml` configuration file.  Locate the `jwt.token.secret` property.  Replace the default value with the generated secret.
3.  **Restart:** Restart the ThingsBoard service for the change to take effect.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Threat:** JWT forgery allowing unauthorized access to ThingsBoard (Severity: Critical).
*   **Threat:** Authentication bypass within ThingsBoard (Severity: Critical).

**Impact:**
*   Prevents attackers from forging valid JWTs to bypass ThingsBoard's authentication.

**Currently Implemented:**
