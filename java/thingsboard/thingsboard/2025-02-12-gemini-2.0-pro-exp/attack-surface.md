# Attack Surface Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Attack Surface: [Device Authentication and Authorization Bypass (ThingsBoard Credentials)](./attack_surfaces/device_authentication_and_authorization_bypass__thingsboard_credentials_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers impersonate legitimate devices or gain unauthorized access to the platform due to weak or misconfigured device credentials *managed by ThingsBoard*.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard provides and manages device authentication mechanisms (access tokens, X.509 certificates, basic credentials). Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in *these mechanisms* are the core issue.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a default or easily guessable ThingsBoard-generated access token to connect a malicious device and inject false data.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, unauthorized control of devices, potential platform compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Credentials:** Enforce strong, unique access tokens generated by ThingsBoard. Avoid default credentials. Utilize ThingsBoard's certificate management features properly.
    *   **Credential Rotation:** Implement regular rotation of device credentials *using ThingsBoard's built-in mechanisms*.
    *   **Device Provisioning Security:** Secure the ThingsBoard device provisioning process to prevent unauthorized device registration.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor ThingsBoard logs for unusual device connection patterns and failed authentication attempts.

## Attack Surface: [Rule Engine Exploitation (via Device Data or Direct Manipulation)](./attack_surfaces/rule_engine_exploitation__via_device_data_or_direct_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard's rule engine's logic or scripting capabilities to execute malicious code or cause unintended behavior. This is *specific* to the ThingsBoard rule engine.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard's rule engine is a core component that allows users to define complex logic and execute JavaScript code. This inherent functionality is the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends crafted telemetry data that triggers a flaw in a JavaScript rule within ThingsBoard, leading to a denial-of-service condition or unauthorized data access. An attacker with compromised ThingsBoard user credentials modifies a rule to execute malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, data corruption, unauthorized access to data or system resources, potential platform compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input data within ThingsBoard rule engine scripts. Sanitize data before using it.
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices for JavaScript within the ThingsBoard rule engine. Avoid `eval()` and similar functions.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure ThingsBoard's resource limits (CPU, memory) for rule engine execution.
    *   **Auditing:** Regularly audit ThingsBoard rule chain configurations.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run ThingsBoard rule engine actions with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Transport Layer Attacks (ThingsBoard Protocol Handlers)](./attack_surfaces/transport_layer_attacks__thingsboard_protocol_handlers_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard's *implementations* of the supported transport protocols (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, LwM2M, SNMP).
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard *implements* handlers for these protocols. Vulnerabilities in *these specific implementations* are the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends malformed MQTT packets to trigger a buffer overflow in ThingsBoard's *own* MQTT broker implementation, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential platform compromise, data interception (if TLS is misconfigured within ThingsBoard).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Protocol Fuzzing:** Regularly perform fuzz testing on ThingsBoard's implementations of the supported protocols.
    *   **TLS Configuration:** Enforce strong TLS configurations *within ThingsBoard* for all supported protocols.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting and connection limits *within ThingsBoard's transport layer*.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate device networks from the core platform network.

## Attack Surface: [API Abuse (ThingsBoard REST API)](./attack_surfaces/api_abuse__thingsboard_rest_api_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard's REST API or bypass authentication/authorization to perform unauthorized actions *via the API*.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard's REST API is a core component providing extensive control. Vulnerabilities in *this specific API* are the concern.
*   **Example:** An attacker bypasses authentication and uses the ThingsBoard REST API to delete devices, modify user roles, or access sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, unauthorized access, platform compromise, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization for all ThingsBoard API endpoints.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all input parameters to ThingsBoard API endpoints.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting *within ThingsBoard's API handling*.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all ThingsBoard API requests and monitor for suspicious activity.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant ThingsBoard API users only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Tenant Isolation Breach (ThingsBoard Multi-Tenant Deployments)](./attack_surfaces/tenant_isolation_breach__thingsboard_multi-tenant_deployments_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ThingsBoard's tenant isolation mechanisms to access data or resources belonging to other tenants.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard's multi-tenancy features are *specifically designed* to isolate tenants. Vulnerabilities in *this implementation* are the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker in one ThingsBoard tenant exploits a vulnerability to access device data or rule chains belonging to another tenant.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violation, loss of trust, potential legal consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on ThingsBoard's tenant isolation.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the ThingsBoard code responsible for tenant isolation.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Enforce strict resource quotas for each tenant *within ThingsBoard*.
    *   **Database Isolation:** Ensure proper database isolation between tenants, as configured *within ThingsBoard*.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor ThingsBoard for cross-tenant access attempts and unusual resource usage.

## Attack Surface: [Message Queue Vulnerabilities (Exploiting ThingsBoard's Integration)](./attack_surfaces/message_queue_vulnerabilities__exploiting_thingsboard's_integration_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the message queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) *as it is used by ThingsBoard* to disrupt communication, inject malicious messages, or gain unauthorized access to data flowing through ThingsBoard.
*   **ThingsBoard Contribution:** ThingsBoard's *reliance on and integration with* the message queue creates this attack surface.  The *configuration and usage* of the queue by ThingsBoard are key.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Kafka cluster *used by ThingsBoard* and injects malicious messages that trigger unintended behavior in ThingsBoard's rule engine.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, platform instability, potential compromise of other ThingsBoard components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration:** Securely configure the message queue *as recommended by ThingsBoard documentation*, including strong authentication, authorization, and encryption.
    *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to the message queue to only authorized ThingsBoard components and users.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the message queue *as integrated with ThingsBoard* for suspicious activity and performance issues.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the message queue software up to date, following ThingsBoard's compatibility guidelines.
    *   **Input Validation (within ThingsBoard):** Validate data *received from the queue* within ThingsBoard's components (e.g., rule engine) before processing.
