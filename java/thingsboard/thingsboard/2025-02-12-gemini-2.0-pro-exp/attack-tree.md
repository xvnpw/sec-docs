## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Device Connectivity [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_device_connectivity__hr_.md)

*   **1. Weak Device Credentials [HR] [CN]:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit default or easily guessable credentials on IoT devices connected to the ThingsBoard platform.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Device control, pivot to ThingsBoard)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all devices.
        *   Mandatory credential change upon initial setup.
        *   Consider certificate-based authentication.
        *   Regular credential audits.

*   **2. Unsecured Device Communication [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers intercept unencrypted communication between devices and ThingsBoard (e.g., HTTP, MQTT without TLS) to steal credentials or inject malicious commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Credential theft, command injection)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Mandate encrypted communication (HTTPS, MQTT over TLS/SSL).
        *   Use strong cipher suites and certificate validation.
        *   Network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit ThingsBoard Core Vulnerabilities [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_thingsboard_core_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

*   **4. Unpatched ThingsBoard Instance [HR] [CN]:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in an outdated ThingsBoard installation. Public exploits may be readily available.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Strict patch management policy.
        *   Monitor ThingsBoard security advisories.
        *   Prompt updates (staging environment first).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit ThingsBoard Authentication/Authorization [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_thingsboard_authenticationauthorization__hr_.md)

*   **10. Weak User Passwords (ThingsBoard Users) [HR] [CN]:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers crack weak passwords for ThingsBoard user accounts, gaining access to the platform's interface and functionality.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High (Full access to the ThingsBoard interface)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, expiration).
        *   Account lockout policies.
        *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Attack Tree Path: [Key High-Risk Paths (Recap):](./attack_tree_paths/key_high-risk_paths__recap_.md)

1.  **Device Compromise via Weak Credentials -> Pivot to ThingsBoard:** Attackers first compromise a device using weak credentials (1), then potentially use unsecured communication (2) to gain further access or directly attack the ThingsBoard instance.
2.  **Exploit Unpatched ThingsBoard Instance:** Attackers directly exploit a known vulnerability in an unpatched ThingsBoard installation (4).
3.  **Compromise ThingsBoard User Account via Weak Password:** Attackers gain direct access to the ThingsBoard interface by cracking a user's weak password (10).
4.  **Device compromise via Unsecured Communication -> Intercept Credentials -> Access Thingsboard:** Attackers intercept credentials from unencrypted communication (2) and use them to access Thingsboard (potentially leveraging 10 if user also has weak password).
