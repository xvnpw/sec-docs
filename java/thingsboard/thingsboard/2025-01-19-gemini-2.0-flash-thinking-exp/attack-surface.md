# Attack Surface Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Attack Surface: [Script Node Code Injection in Rule Engine](./attack_surfaces/script_node_code_injection_in_rule_engine.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary code within the JavaScript script nodes of the ThingsBoard Rule Engine.
    *   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:** ThingsBoard's Rule Engine allows users to define custom JavaScript functions within script nodes to process and transform data. If input data to these nodes is not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a telemetry message containing malicious JavaScript code that, when processed by a vulnerable script node, executes commands on the ThingsBoard server or accesses sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service, manipulation of connected devices.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within script nodes.
        *   Avoid using `eval()` or similar functions that execute arbitrary strings as code.
        *   Consider using sandboxed environments for script execution (if available or feasible).
        *   Regularly review and audit rule chains for potentially vulnerable script nodes.
        *   Educate users on secure scripting practices within the Rule Engine.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Integration Nodes](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_integration_nodes.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can leverage Integration Nodes in the Rule Engine to make requests to internal or external resources that the ThingsBoard server has access to.
    *   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:** Integration Nodes are designed to connect ThingsBoard with external systems. If the configuration of these nodes doesn't properly validate or restrict target URLs, attackers can abuse this functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker configures an HTTP Integration Node to send a request to an internal network resource that is not publicly accessible, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or triggering internal actions.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict whitelisting of allowed target URLs for Integration Nodes.
        *   Disable or restrict the use of Integration Nodes if not strictly necessary.
        *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided input used in the configuration of Integration Nodes.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Customizable Dashboards and Widgets](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_customizable_dashboards_and_widgets.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into customizable dashboards or widgets that are then executed in the browsers of other users viewing the dashboard.
    *   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:** ThingsBoard allows users to create dynamic dashboards with various widgets that display data. If user-provided data or widget configurations are not properly sanitized before rendering, XSS vulnerabilities can arise.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a widget's configuration. When another user views the dashboard containing this widget, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of dashboards, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust output encoding and sanitization for all user-provided data displayed in dashboards and widgets.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly review and update widget code to address potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Educate users about the risks of executing untrusted code in their browsers.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in REST API](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_rest_api.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to ThingsBoard's REST API endpoints.
    *   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in the implementation of ThingsBoard's authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) or authorization checks can allow attackers to circumvent access controls.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the JWT verification process to forge a valid authentication token, granting them access to API endpoints they should not be able to access.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized modification of data, control over devices and entities, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper implementation and configuration of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Regularly update ThingsBoard to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication where possible.
        *   Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the API.

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default or weak credentials for administrative or other privileged accounts.
    *   **How ThingsBoard Contributes:** Like many systems, ThingsBoard may have default credentials set during initial installation or for demo purposes. If these are not changed, they present an easy entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default administrator username and password to log into the ThingsBoard platform and gain full control.
    *   **Impact:** Full platform compromise, data breach, control over all devices and entities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change all default credentials upon installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all user accounts.
        *   Regularly review and update user credentials.
        *   Disable or remove any unnecessary default accounts.
