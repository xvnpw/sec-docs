# Threat Model Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Threat: [Default Administrator Credentials Exploitation](./threats/default_administrator_credentials_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses default, unchanged administrator credentials (e.g., `sysadmin@thingsboard.org` and `sysadmin`) to log into the ThingsBoard platform. They can then access all tenants, customers, devices, and configurations, potentially exfiltrating data, modifying settings, or disrupting the entire platform.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the ThingsBoard instance, including all connected devices and data. Potential for data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized control over IoT devices.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, specifically the default user provisioning.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Mandate strong password changes for default administrator accounts during initial setup.
        *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
        *   Consider removing or disabling default administrator accounts after creating secure alternatives.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Vulnerable JWT Handling](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_vulnerable_jwt_handling.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in ThingsBoard's JWT (JSON Web Token) handling (e.g., insecure signature verification, lack of expiration checks) could allow an attacker to forge or manipulate JWTs to gain unauthorized access as any user or administrator.
    *   **Impact:** Complete bypass of authentication, allowing attackers to impersonate any user, including administrators, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, specifically JWT generation and verification logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update ThingsBoard to patch known vulnerabilities in JWT handling libraries.
        *   Ensure proper validation of JWT signatures and expiration times.
        *   Use strong cryptographic algorithms for JWT signing.
        *   Implement secure key management practices for JWT signing keys.

## Threat: [Rule Engine Code Injection](./threats/rule_engine_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input validation or sanitization within the ThingsBoard rule engine's scripting capabilities (e.g., JavaScript functions). They inject malicious code that gets executed by the rule engine, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt the platform.
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and potential control over connected devices through malicious rule execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Rule Engine module, specifically scripting nodes (e.g., Script, Transformation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the capabilities of scripting functions within the rule engine.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used in scripting nodes.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to isolate rule engine execution.
        *   Regularly review and audit custom rule chains for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Data Injection via Unvalidated Device APIs](./threats/data_injection_via_unvalidated_device_apis.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious or malformed data through the ThingsBoard device APIs (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP) without proper validation on the ThingsBoard side. This could lead to database corruption, triggering unintended rule engine actions, or causing denial-of-service by overloading the system.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected system behavior, denial of service, and potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in downstream data processing.
    *   **Affected Component:** Device API modules (MQTT, CoAP, HTTP transport layers), data processing pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all data received through device APIs.
        *   Enforce data type and format constraints.
        *   Implement rate limiting and traffic shaping to prevent API abuse.
        *   Use secure communication protocols (TLS/SSL) to protect data in transit.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/insecure_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability exists in a third-party or custom ThingsBoard plugin. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or access sensitive data within the ThingsBoard platform or the underlying system.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for system compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and unauthorized control over functionalities provided by the vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugins module, specific vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit third-party plugins before deployment.
        *   Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement security monitoring for plugin activity.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom plugins.
        *   Consider using a plugin security scanner if available.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Components](./threats/exposure_of_internal_components.md)

*   **Description:** Internal ThingsBoard components (e.g., message queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ, databases like Cassandra or PostgreSQL) are exposed without proper authentication or authorization. An attacker could potentially gain direct access to these components, bypassing ThingsBoard's security controls, and access sensitive data or disrupt the platform's operation.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, direct manipulation of internal data, service disruption, and potential for further exploitation of the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Internal communication channels, database connections, message queue configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure proper network segmentation and firewall rules to restrict access to internal components.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all internal components.
        *   Avoid exposing internal ports directly to the internet.
        *   Regularly audit network configurations and access controls.
