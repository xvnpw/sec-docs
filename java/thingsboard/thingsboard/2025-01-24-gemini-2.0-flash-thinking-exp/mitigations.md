# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for thingsboard/thingsboard

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication and Authorization Hardening (ThingsBoard Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_and_authorization_hardening__thingsboard_specific_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Access the ThingsBoard server configuration. This is typically done by modifying the `thingsboard.yml` file or using environment variables, depending on your deployment.
*   Step 2: Configure password complexity settings in `thingsboard.yml` or environment variables. Look for parameters like:
    *   `security.password_policy.enabled: "true"` (Enable password policy enforcement)
    *   `security.password_policy.min_length: 12` (Set minimum password length)
    *   `security.password_policy.require_uppercase: "true"` (Require uppercase)
    *   `security.password_policy.require_lowercase: "true"` (Require lowercase)
    *   `security.password_policy.require_numbers: "true"` (Require numbers)
    *   `security.password_policy.require_symbols: "true"` (Require symbols)
*   Step 3: Configure password expiration in `thingsboard.yml` or environment variables:
    *   `security.password_policy.max_age_days: 90` (Set password expiration to 90 days)
*   Step 4: Implement account lockout in `thingsboard.yml` or environment variables:
    *   `security.login.max_failed_attempts: 5` (Set max failed attempts)
    *   `security.login.lockout_duration_minutes: 30` (Set lockout duration)
*   Step 5: Restart the ThingsBoard service for changes to take effect.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Brute-force attacks (High Severity)
*   Credential stuffing attacks (High Severity)
*   Weak password vulnerabilities (Medium Severity)

**Impact:**
*   Brute-force attacks: High Reduction
*   Credential stuffing attacks: Medium Reduction
*   Weak password vulnerabilities: High Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard provides configuration options in `thingsboard.yml` and environment variables to enforce password policies.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Password policy enforcement is not enabled by default. Administrators must explicitly configure and enable these settings. User education on password policies is also often missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) *in ThingsBoard*](./mitigation_strategies/multi-factor_authentication__mfa__in_thingsboard.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Enable MFA in ThingsBoard configuration. This is typically done in `thingsboard.yml` or environment variables.
    *   `security.mfa.enabled: "true"` (Enable MFA globally)
    *   Configure specific MFA providers if needed (e.g., TOTP is usually enabled by default).
*   Step 2: Enforce MFA for specific user roles or all users within ThingsBoard UI (Admin settings -> Security settings, or Tenant/Customer profile settings).
*   Step 3: Guide users to enable MFA for their accounts through their profile settings in the ThingsBoard UI. They will typically need to use a TOTP authenticator app.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Credential compromise (High Severity)
*   Account takeover (High Severity)

**Impact:**
*   Credential compromise: High Reduction
*   Account takeover: High Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard has built-in support for MFA, primarily TOTP-based.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   MFA is not enforced by default. Administrators need to enable it and encourage or mandate user adoption. More advanced MFA options (like hardware tokens, push notifications) might require extensions or custom implementations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Token Management *using ThingsBoard Features*](./mitigation_strategies/api_token_management_using_thingsboard_features.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Utilize ThingsBoard's API token generation features within the UI (e.g., User profile, Device profiles, Integrations).
*   Step 2: Implement short-lived API tokens by setting expiration times when creating tokens in the ThingsBoard UI.
*   Step 3: Rotate API tokens regularly.  Establish a process (manual or automated via scripting using ThingsBoard APIs) to regenerate and update API tokens periodically.
*   Step 4: Leverage ThingsBoard's API token permissions. When creating tokens, carefully select the specific permissions required for the intended use case. Use the "Read-only" or more granular permissions whenever possible instead of "Full Access".
*   Step 5: Monitor API token usage through ThingsBoard's audit logs (if enabled and configured to log API token related events).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   API key compromise (High Severity)
*   Unauthorized API access (High Severity)
*   Lateral movement (Medium Severity)

**Impact:**
*   API key compromise: High Reduction
*   Unauthorized API access: High Reduction
*   Lateral movement: Medium Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard provides API token generation, expiration, and permission management features within its platform.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Automated API token rotation is not a built-in feature and might require custom scripting or external tools leveraging ThingsBoard APIs.  Proactive monitoring and alerting on API token misuse require proper audit logging configuration and external SIEM integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Device Provisioning Security *using ThingsBoard Provisioning*](./mitigation_strategies/device_provisioning_security_using_thingsboard_provisioning.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Choose a secure device provisioning method offered by ThingsBoard. Configure this within Device Profiles in the ThingsBoard UI. Options include:
    *   **Claiming devices:** Utilize device claiming with secure device keys configured in device profiles.
    *   **Pre-provisioned credentials:** Use device profiles to pre-generate and securely distribute device credentials (e.g., access tokens).
    *   **Provisioning via API:** Implement custom provisioning logic using ThingsBoard's provisioning API for more complex workflows.
*   Step 2: Implement device attestation within custom provisioning logic (if using API provisioning). This might involve verifying device certificates or hardware identifiers against a trusted source during the provisioning process.
*   Step 3: Restrict access to device profile management in ThingsBoard UI to authorized administrators to control provisioning configurations.
*   Step 4: Audit device provisioning events by enabling and monitoring ThingsBoard's audit logs for device creation and provisioning activities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized device registration (High Severity)
*   Device impersonation (High Severity)
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks during provisioning (Medium Severity)

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized device registration: High Reduction
*   Device impersonation: High Reduction
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks during provisioning: Medium Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard offers various built-in device provisioning methods and allows for custom provisioning via API.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Device attestation is not a standard built-in feature for all provisioning methods and might require custom implementation, especially when using API-based provisioning.  Secure key management for device claiming needs to be handled externally.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Enforcement *within ThingsBoard*](./mitigation_strategies/role-based_access_control__rbac__enforcement_within_thingsboard.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Define granular roles and permissions using the "Roles" management section in the ThingsBoard UI. Create custom roles tailored to your specific user and device needs.
*   Step 2: Assign roles to users and device profiles through the ThingsBoard UI.  Ensure users and devices are assigned the least privilege roles necessary for their function.
*   Step 3: Regularly review and update roles and permissions using the ThingsBoard UI as your application evolves and user responsibilities change.
*   Step 4: Utilize ThingsBoard's audit logs to track changes to roles and permission assignments for auditing purposes.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized access to data and functionality (High Severity)
*   Privilege escalation (High Severity)
*   Data breaches due to excessive permissions (Medium Severity)

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access to data and functionality: High Reduction
*   Privilege escalation: High Reduction
*   Data breaches due to excessive permissions: Medium Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard has a fully implemented RBAC system managed through its UI.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Effective RBAC enforcement relies on careful role definition and consistent role assignment, which requires administrative effort and ongoing maintenance.  Default roles might be too broad and need customization for optimal security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Audit Logging for Authentication Events *in ThingsBoard*](./mitigation_strategies/audit_logging_for_authentication_events_in_thingsboard.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Enable audit logging in ThingsBoard configuration. This is typically done in `thingsboard.yml` or environment variables.
    *   `logging.level.root: INFO` (Ensure at least INFO level logging is enabled)
    *   Configure specific audit loggers if needed for more granular control (refer to ThingsBoard documentation for audit logging configuration).
*   Step 2: Configure log destinations. ThingsBoard can log to files, console, or external systems (via log appenders). Configure logging to a persistent and secure location.
*   Step 3: Review and analyze ThingsBoard audit logs (either directly from log files or through a centralized log management system if integrated) for authentication-related events like login attempts, password changes, and API token usage.
*   Step 4: Set up alerts based on log analysis (if using a centralized log management system) to notify administrators of suspicious authentication activities detected in ThingsBoard logs.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized access attempts (High Severity)
*   Account compromise detection (High Severity)
*   Insider threats (Medium Severity)
*   Security incident investigation (High Severity)

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized access attempts: High Reduction
*   Account compromise detection: High Reduction
*   Insider threats: Medium Reduction
*   Security incident investigation: High Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard has built-in logging capabilities, including audit logging.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Detailed audit logging for authentication events might require specific configuration beyond default settings.  Centralized log management, active monitoring, and alerting on audit logs are not built-in and require external integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Device Telemetry Data *using ThingsBoard Rule Engine*](./mitigation_strategies/validate_device_telemetry_data_using_thingsboard_rule_engine.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Utilize the ThingsBoard Rule Engine to create rule chains that process incoming device telemetry data.
*   Step 2: Implement "Script" rule nodes (or other suitable nodes like "Filter Script") within your rule chains to validate telemetry data.
    *   Write scripts (e.g., JavaScript) to check data types, ranges, formats, and other validation criteria for each telemetry attribute.
    *   Use `msg` and `metadata` objects within the script to access telemetry data and device information.
*   Step 3: Configure rule chain logic to handle invalid data. Options include:
    *   Dropping invalid messages.
    *   Logging invalid data for monitoring.
    *   Sending alerts for data validation failures.
    *   Sanitizing or transforming invalid data before further processing.
*   Step 4: Deploy and test your rule chains to ensure telemetry data validation is working as expected.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Data injection attacks (Medium Severity) - Malicious devices sending crafted telemetry to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   Data corruption (Medium Severity) - Invalid or malformed data corrupting the integrity of stored telemetry.
*   Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (Low to Medium Severity) - Processing of excessively large or malformed data potentially overloading the system.

**Impact:**
*   Data injection attacks: Medium Reduction
*   Data corruption: Medium Reduction
*   Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: Low to Medium Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard Rule Engine provides powerful capabilities for data processing and validation, including scripting nodes.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Data validation is not enabled by default. Users must actively design and implement rule chains with validation logic.  The complexity of validation depends on the specific data and security requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure MQTT/CoAP Transports *in ThingsBoard*](./mitigation_strategies/secure_mqttcoap_transports_in_thingsboard.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Configure ThingsBoard MQTT and/or CoAP transport protocols to use TLS/SSL encryption. This is typically configured in `thingsboard.yml` or environment variables under the `mqtt` or `coap` sections.
    *   For MQTT: Enable TLS listener and configure SSL certificate paths.
    *   For CoAP: Enable DTLS listener and configure certificate/key settings.
*   Step 2: Enforce client authentication for MQTT and CoAP connections in ThingsBoard transport configurations.
    *   For MQTT: Configure client certificate authentication or username/password authentication.
    *   For CoAP: Configure DTLS client authentication.
*   Step 3: Ensure devices are configured to connect to ThingsBoard using the secured MQTT/CoAP endpoints (e.g., using `mqtts://` or `coaps://` schemes and the correct port).
*   Step 4: Distribute necessary client certificates or credentials to devices securely for authentication.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Data interception (High Severity) - Attackers eavesdropping on unencrypted communication to steal sensitive data.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks (High Severity) - Attackers intercepting and manipulating communication between devices and ThingsBoard.
*   Unauthorized device access (Medium Severity) - Preventing unauthorized devices from connecting to ThingsBoard transports.

**Impact:**
*   Data interception: High Reduction
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks: High Reduction
*   Unauthorized device access: Medium Reduction

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ThingsBoard supports secure MQTT and CoAP transports with TLS/SSL and DTLS encryption and client authentication options.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Secure transports are not enabled by default. Administrators must explicitly configure TLS/SSL and DTLS settings and enforce client authentication.  Device configuration and secure credential distribution are also user responsibilities.
