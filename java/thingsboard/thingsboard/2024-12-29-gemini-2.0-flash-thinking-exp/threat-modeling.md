*   **Threat:** Tenant Data Breach via Isolation Failure
    *   **Description:** In a multi-tenant ThingsBoard instance, a vulnerability could allow an attacker with access to one tenant to gain unauthorized access to data or resources belonging to another tenant. This could be due to flaws in access control enforcement, data segregation logic, or shared resource management *within ThingsBoard*.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential data of multiple tenants could be exposed, leading to privacy violations, regulatory breaches, and reputational damage. Attackers could also manipulate data or disrupt services for other tenants.
    *   **Affected Component:** Tenant Management Module, Access Control Layer, Data Storage Layer.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and audit tenant isolation mechanisms *within ThingsBoard*.
        *   Implement strict role-based access control (RBAC) within and across tenants *in ThingsBoard*.
        *   Ensure data is properly segregated at the storage level *by ThingsBoard*.
        *   Regularly review and update security configurations related to tenant isolation *in ThingsBoard*.
        *   Apply the latest security patches and updates for ThingsBoard.

*   **Threat:** Rule Engine Logic Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., Tenant Administrator *within ThingsBoard*) could modify the rule engine configuration to alter data processing logic, inject malicious code into custom rule nodes (if allowed *by ThingsBoard*), or create rules that trigger unintended actions. This could be done through the ThingsBoard UI or API.
    *   **Impact:** Data could be manipulated or corrupted, leading to incorrect insights and actions. Malicious code execution within the rule engine could compromise the ThingsBoard server or connected systems. Unauthorized actions could be triggered on devices or external systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Rule Engine Module, Rule Chain Editor, Custom Rule Node Execution Environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control for rule engine configuration *within ThingsBoard*.
        *   Review and audit rule chain configurations regularly.
        *   If custom rule nodes are used, enforce secure coding practices and input validation.
        *   Consider sandboxing or containerizing custom rule node execution *within ThingsBoard*.
        *   Monitor rule engine activity for suspicious modifications.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Device Credentials in Transit
    *   **Description:** If device communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP) are not properly secured with encryption (TLS/SSL) *as configured within ThingsBoard's communication handling*, an attacker could intercept network traffic and potentially capture device credentials being transmitted during authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised device credentials could allow an attacker to impersonate devices and send malicious data or commands.
    *   **Affected Component:** Device Communication Transports (MQTT, HTTP, CoAP, etc.) *within ThingsBoard*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of TLS/SSL for all device communication protocols *within ThingsBoard's configuration*.
        *   Configure ThingsBoard to require secure connections.

*   **Threat:** API Key Compromise and Abuse
    *   **Description:** If API keys used for accessing ThingsBoard's REST API are compromised (e.g., through insecure storage or accidental exposure), an attacker could use these keys to perform unauthorized actions, such as reading sensitive data, modifying configurations, or controlling devices *through the ThingsBoard API*.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data, system manipulation, and potential disruption of services.
    *   **Affected Component:** REST API, API Key Management Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely (e.g., using secrets management tools).
        *   Implement proper access control and authorization for API keys *within ThingsBoard*.
        *   Rotate API keys regularly.
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.
        *   Consider using more granular authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0 where appropriate.

*   **Threat:** Default Credentials on Initial Setup
    *   **Description:** If default administrator or tenant credentials *within ThingsBoard* are not changed after the initial installation, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the platform.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the ThingsBoard instance, allowing the attacker to control all devices, data, and configurations.
    *   **Affected Component:** User Management Module, Authentication Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Force password changes upon initial login *in ThingsBoard*.
        *   Clearly document the importance of changing default credentials.
        *   Implement security checks to detect the use of default credentials.
