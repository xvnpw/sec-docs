## 5. Data Flow

The data flow within ThingsBoard can be categorized into several key scenarios:

*   **Telemetry Data Ingestion:**
    1. IoT Device sends telemetry data to the **'Transport Layer'**.
    2. The **'Transport Layer'** authenticates the device and publishes the data to the **'Queue'**.
    3. The **'Core Service'** consumes the data from the **'Queue'**, validates it, and updates the device's latest telemetry.
    4. The **'Rule Engine'** subscribes to telemetry events and processes the data based on configured rule chains.
    5. The **'Rule Engine'** may trigger actions such as storing the data in **'Storage'**, creating alarms, or sending commands back to the device via the **'Transport Layer'**.
    6. The **'Web UI'** can retrieve and display this telemetry data from **'Storage'** or the **'Core Service'**.

*   **Attribute Data Updates:** Similar to telemetry, but often involves less frequent, state-related information. The flow is largely the same as telemetry ingestion.

*   **Device Control (Downlink):**
    1. A user or the **'Rule Engine'** initiates a command via the **'Web UI'** or internal API call to the **'Core Service'**.
    2. The **'Core Service'** validates the command and sends it to the **'Transport Layer'**.
    3. The **'Transport Layer'** formats and sends the command to the specific **'IoT Device'** using the appropriate protocol.

*   **Platform Configuration:**
    1. An **'Administrator'** interacts with the **'Web UI'** to configure tenants, users, devices, rule chains, etc.
    2. The **'Web UI'** sends API requests to the **'Core Service'** to persist these configurations in **'Storage'**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Telemetry Data Ingestion"
        A["'IoT Device'"] -- "Telemetry" --> B("Transport Layer")
        B --> C("Queue")
        C --> D("Core Service")
        D --> E("Rule Engine")
        E --> F("Storage")
        E --> B
        E --> G["'External System'"]
        D --> H("Web UI")
        F --> H
    end
    subgraph "Device Control (Downlink)"
        I("Web UI / Rule Engine") --> J("Core Service")
        J --> B
        B --> A
    end
    subgraph "Platform Configuration"
        K["Administrator"] --> H
        H --> J
        J --> F
    end
```
