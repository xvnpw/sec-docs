## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise application that uses ThingsBoard by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within ThingsBoard itself.

**Root Goal:** Compromise Application Using ThingsBoard **(CRITICAL NODE)**

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using ThingsBoard **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Exploit ThingsBoard Vulnerabilities **(HIGH RISK PATH START)**
        * Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Exploit Default Credentials **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
            * Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (e.g., API flaws) **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
            * Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**
        * Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH START)**
            * Exploit Rule Engine Vulnerabilities (e.g., script injection in rule nodes) **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * Exploit Resource Exhaustion (e.g., sending excessive data, API requests) **(HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * Exploit Configuration Weaknesses in ThingsBoard **(HIGH RISK PATH START)**
        * Insecure Default Configurations **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
    * Exploit Dependencies and Underlying Infrastructure of ThingsBoard **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH START)**
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Operating System **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Database System **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**
        * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using ThingsBoard:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node signifies a complete breach of the application's security through exploiting weaknesses in ThingsBoard.

* **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws:** This critical node represents attacks targeting the mechanisms that control access to ThingsBoard. Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass login procedures or gain unauthorized privileges.
    * **Exploit Default Credentials:** Attackers attempt to log in using commonly known default usernames and passwords that may not have been changed after installation.
    * **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (e.g., API flaws):** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the authentication logic, often in API endpoints, to bypass the normal login process without valid credentials.
    * **Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities:** Attackers with limited access exploit flaws in the authorization system to gain higher-level privileges, potentially reaching administrator status.

* **Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities:** This critical node represents attacks that allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the ThingsBoard server. This is a severe vulnerability that can lead to complete system compromise.
    * **Exploit Rule Engine Vulnerabilities (e.g., script injection in rule nodes):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the rule engine configurations, which are then executed by the ThingsBoard server, granting them control.

* **Insecure Default Configurations:** This critical node highlights the risk of using default settings that are not secure. These configurations often have well-known vulnerabilities or weak security settings that attackers can easily exploit.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Operating System:** Attackers target known vulnerabilities in the operating system hosting ThingsBoard to gain unauthorized access and control over the server.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Database System:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the database system used by ThingsBoard to gain access to sensitive data, modify information, or disrupt database operations.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Attackers target vulnerabilities in the JRE, which is the runtime environment for ThingsBoard, to execute malicious code and compromise the server.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit ThingsBoard Vulnerabilities:** This path encompasses all attacks that directly target vulnerabilities within the ThingsBoard platform itself. It is high-risk due to the potential for direct and significant compromise.

* **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws:** This path is high-risk because successful exploitation directly leads to unauthorized access, which has a critical impact.

* **Exploit Code Execution Vulnerabilities:** This path is high-risk due to the potential for complete system compromise if an attacker can successfully execute arbitrary code on the server.

* **Exploit Resource Exhaustion (e.g., sending excessive data, API requests):** This path is high-risk due to the high likelihood and ease with which an attacker can overwhelm the system with requests or data, leading to a denial of service.

* **Exploit Configuration Weaknesses in ThingsBoard:** This path is high-risk because insecure configurations can provide easy entry points for attackers to exploit various vulnerabilities.

* **Exploit Dependencies and Underlying Infrastructure of ThingsBoard:** This path is high-risk due to the critical impact that vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure (OS, database, JRE) can have on the security of ThingsBoard and the application.
