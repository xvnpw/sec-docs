Okay, here's a deep analysis of the attack tree path 4c, focusing on Retrofit and its interaction with converters like Gson and Jackson:

# Deep Analysis: Supply Malicious Config to Existing Converter (Retrofit)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the attack vector described as "Supply Malicious Config to Existing Converter (e.g., Gson, Jackson)" within the context of a Retrofit-based application.  We aim to:

*   Understand the specific mechanisms by which this attack can be executed against a Retrofit client.
*   Identify the precise configurations and code patterns that introduce vulnerability.
*   Determine effective mitigation strategies, going beyond high-level recommendations to provide concrete implementation guidance.
*   Assess the practical exploitability and impact of this attack in real-world scenarios.
*   Provide actionable recommendations for developers to secure their Retrofit implementations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Retrofit:**  The analysis centers on applications using the Retrofit library for making network requests.  We will examine how Retrofit interacts with converters.
*   **Converters:**  We will primarily focus on Gson and Jackson, the most common converters used with Retrofit.  However, the principles discussed can be extended to other converters.
*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**  The core of the attack is exploiting insecure deserialization configurations.  We will concentrate on vulnerabilities arising from this, particularly those leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Configuration:** We will analyze how converter configurations, both within Retrofit setup and within the converter libraries themselves, contribute to vulnerability.
*   **Input:** We will consider scenarios where attacker-controlled data is supplied as input to the Retrofit client, ultimately reaching the deserialization process.  This includes HTTP response bodies.
* **Java/Kotlin:** The analysis assumes a Java or Kotlin environment, as these are the primary languages used with Retrofit.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   Vulnerabilities in Retrofit itself (assuming a reasonably up-to-date version is used).
*   Attacks targeting the network layer (e.g., MITM attacks) â€“ we assume HTTPS is used correctly.
*   Vulnerabilities unrelated to deserialization (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will examine example Retrofit configurations and code snippets, both vulnerable and secure, to illustrate the attack and its mitigation.
2.  **Documentation Analysis:**  We will thoroughly review the official documentation for Retrofit, Gson, and Jackson, focusing on configuration options related to deserialization and security.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to insecure deserialization in Gson and Jackson, particularly those relevant to Retrofit usage.
4.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development (Conceptual):**  While we won't create a fully functional exploit, we will outline the steps and code structure required to demonstrate the vulnerability conceptually.
5.  **Threat Modeling:** We will consider various attack scenarios and how an attacker might leverage this vulnerability in a real-world application.
6.  **Static Analysis Tool Evaluation (Conceptual):** We will discuss how static analysis tools can be used to detect insecure configurations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 4c

### 4.1. Attack Mechanism

The attack exploits the way Retrofit handles data conversion, specifically during the deserialization of HTTP response bodies.  Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Attacker-Controlled Input:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP response body.  This body contains data that, when deserialized by a misconfigured converter, triggers unintended code execution.
2.  **Retrofit Request:** The application, using Retrofit, makes an HTTP request to a server (potentially compromised or controlled by the attacker).
3.  **Response Handling:** Retrofit receives the malicious response body.
4.  **Converter Invocation:** Retrofit uses the configured converter (Gson or Jackson) to deserialize the response body into a Java/Kotlin object.
5.  **Vulnerable Deserialization:** If the converter is misconfigured (e.g., Jackson's `enableDefaultTyping()` is enabled without proper safeguards), the attacker-supplied data can dictate the class to be instantiated and its properties. This can lead to the instantiation of dangerous classes (gadget chains) that execute arbitrary code during their initialization or deserialization process.
6.  **Code Execution:** The attacker achieves Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server or client.

### 4.2. Vulnerable Configurations and Code Patterns

**4.2.1. Jackson: `enableDefaultTyping()` (The Classic Culprit)**

This is the most well-known and dangerous misconfiguration.

```java
// VULNERABLE Retrofit setup
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.enableDefaultTyping(); // DANGEROUS!

Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://example.com/")
    .addConverterFactory(JacksonConverterFactory.create(mapper))
    .build();
```

*   **Explanation:** `enableDefaultTyping()` allows the JSON data to specify the type of object to be created.  Without restrictions, an attacker can specify *any* class, including those that lead to RCE.

**4.2.2. Jackson: Unsafe `@JsonTypeInfo` Usage**

Even with `@JsonTypeInfo`, improper configuration can be dangerous.

```java
// Potentially VULNERABLE
@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, include = JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property = "@class")
public class MyBaseClass { ... }
```

*   **Explanation:** Using `JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS` without a custom `TypeResolverBuilder` or a very strict `TypeIdResolver` is risky.  It essentially allows the JSON to specify the class name, similar to `enableDefaultTyping()`.

**4.2.3. Gson: Deserializing to Generic Types without Type Adapters**

```java
// Potentially VULNERABLE
Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://example.com/")
    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
    .build();

// ... later ...
Call<List<Object>> call = myApiService.getGenericData(); // Object is too generic
Response<List<Object>> response = call.execute();
List<Object> data = response.body(); // Potential for unsafe deserialization
```

*   **Explanation:**  Deserializing to highly generic types like `Object` or `List<Object>` can be problematic. Gson might create unexpected objects, and if those objects have custom deserialization logic, it could be exploited.  While less directly exploitable than Jackson's default typing, it's a bad practice.

**4.2.4.  Gson:  Custom Type Adapters with Security Flaws**

If you write custom `TypeAdapter` implementations for Gson, you must be *extremely* careful to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.  Any logic that uses attacker-controlled data to determine the type or behavior of deserialization is a potential risk.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

**4.3.1. Jackson:  Disable Default Typing and Use Safe `@JsonTypeInfo`**

*   **Never** use `enableDefaultTyping()` without a strong whitelist.
*   Prefer using `@JsonTypeInfo` with a safe `TypeIdResolver` or a custom `TypeResolverBuilder`.

```java
// SAFER Jackson configuration
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
// Do NOT enableDefaultTyping()

// Option 1:  Whitelist with a TypeIdResolver
mapper.setDefaultTyping(
    new DefaultTyping.DefaultTypeResolverBuilder(DefaultTyping.OBJECT_AND_NON_CONCRETE)
        .init(JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, new MySafeTypeIdResolver()) // Implement MySafeTypeIdResolver
        .inclusion(JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY)
);

// Option 2:  Custom TypeResolverBuilder (more control)
mapper.setDefaultTyping(new MyCustomTypeResolverBuilder()); // Implement MyCustomTypeResolverBuilder

Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://example.com/")
    .addConverterFactory(JacksonConverterFactory.create(mapper))
    .build();
```

*   **`MySafeTypeIdResolver` (Example):**  This class would implement `TypeIdResolver` and *only* allow a predefined set of safe classes.

```java
public class MySafeTypeIdResolver extends TypeIdResolverBase {
    private static final Set<String> ALLOWED_TYPES = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(
        "com.example.MySafeClass1",
        "com.example.MySafeClass2"
    ));

    @Override
    public String idFromValue(Object value) {
        return value.getClass().getName();
    }

    @Override
    public String idFromValueAndType(Object value, Class<?> suggestedType) {
        return idFromValue(value);
    }

    @Override
    public JavaType typeFromId(DatabindContext context, String id) throws IOException {
        if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.contains(id)) {
            throw new IOException("Disallowed type: " + id);
        }
        return context.resolveType(id);
    }

    @Override
    public JsonTypeInfo.Id getMechanism() {
        return JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME;
    }
}
```

**4.3.2. Gson: Use Specific Types and Type Adapters (When Necessary)**

*   **Avoid generic types:**  Define specific data classes that match the expected structure of the JSON response.

```java
// SAFER Gson usage
class MyData {
    public String field1;
    public int field2;
    // ...
}

Call<MyData> call = myApiService.getMyData(); // Use a specific type
Response<MyData> response = call.execute();
MyData data = response.body();
```

*   **Use Type Adapters for complex cases:** If you need to handle complex JSON structures or custom deserialization logic, use `TypeAdapter` implementations, but ensure they are secure.  Validate all input carefully within the adapter.

**4.3.3. Input Validation and Sanitization**

*   Even with secure deserialization, always validate and sanitize data received from external sources.  This adds an extra layer of defense.
*   Use a library like OWASP's Java Encoder Project to sanitize data.

**4.3.4.  Deny-List Approach (Conceptual)**

*   Instead of trying to identify all possible dangerous classes (which is nearly impossible), focus on explicitly allowing only known safe classes.  This is the principle behind the `MySafeTypeIdResolver` example above.

### 4.4. Exploitability and Impact

*   **Exploitability:**  High for misconfigured Jackson (especially with `enableDefaultTyping()`).  Exploits are readily available, and attackers can easily find vulnerable applications.  Lower for Gson, but still a risk if generic types or insecure custom type adapters are used.
*   **Impact:**  Very High.  Successful exploitation typically leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to take complete control of the affected system.  This can result in data breaches, system compromise, and other severe consequences.

### 4.5. Detection

*   **Static Analysis:**  Tools like FindSecBugs, SpotBugs, and SonarQube can detect some insecure configurations, particularly the use of `enableDefaultTyping()` in Jackson.  However, they may not catch all cases, especially those involving custom type adapters or complex `@JsonTypeInfo` configurations.
*   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Penetration testing and fuzzing can help identify vulnerabilities by sending crafted payloads to the application and observing its behavior.
*   **Code Review:**  Manual code review by security experts is crucial to identify subtle vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.  Pay close attention to Retrofit configuration, converter setup, and any custom deserialization logic.
* **Dependency check:** Use tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify if project is using vulnerable versions of libraries.

### 4.6.  Example Attack Scenario

1.  **Vulnerable Application:** An Android application uses Retrofit with a misconfigured Jackson converter (`enableDefaultTyping()`) to fetch data from a remote API.
2.  **Attacker Setup:** The attacker compromises the API server or sets up a malicious server that mimics the API.
3.  **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a JSON response that includes a malicious type specification, designed to exploit a known gadget chain (e.g., a chain of classes that, when deserialized, ultimately execute arbitrary code).  A common example is using a class that invokes `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` during its deserialization.
4.  **Exploitation:** The Android application makes a request to the compromised API.  Retrofit receives the malicious response, and the Jackson converter deserializes it.  The gadget chain is triggered, executing the attacker's code on the user's device.
5.  **Consequences:** The attacker gains control of the Android application, potentially stealing user data, installing malware, or performing other malicious actions.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Supply Malicious Config to Existing Converter" attack vector is a serious threat to applications using Retrofit.  Misconfigured converters, especially Jackson with `enableDefaultTyping()`, can easily lead to Remote Code Execution.

**Key Recommendations:**

1.  **Never use `enableDefaultTyping()` in Jackson without a strict whitelist.**  Use `@JsonTypeInfo` with a safe `TypeIdResolver` or a custom `TypeResolverBuilder`.
2.  **Prefer specific types over generic types when using Gson.**
3.  **If you use custom `TypeAdapter` implementations in Gson, ensure they are thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.**
4.  **Implement strict input validation and sanitization.**
5.  **Use static analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.**
6.  **Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing.**
7.  **Stay up-to-date with the latest security advisories for Retrofit, Gson, Jackson, and other dependencies.**
8. **Use dependency check tools.**

By following these recommendations, developers can significantly reduce the risk of deserialization vulnerabilities in their Retrofit-based applications. This proactive approach is essential for protecting user data and maintaining the security of the application.
