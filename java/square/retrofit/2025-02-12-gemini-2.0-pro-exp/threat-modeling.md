# Threat Model Analysis for square/retrofit

## Threat: [Base URL Manipulation](./threats/base_url_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Base URL Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the application's configuration to change the Retrofit base URL, redirecting all API calls to a malicious server. The attacker can then intercept, modify, or fabricate API requests and responses.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of API communication; data theft, data manipulation, impersonation of the legitimate server, leading to data breaches, account takeovers, and application malfunction.
    *   **Retrofit Component Affected:** `Retrofit.Builder().baseUrl()` - The base URL setting is the direct target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store configuration data (e.g., Android Keystore, encrypted preferences).
        *   Implement code signing and integrity checks.
        *   Consider hardcoding and obfuscating the base URL (trade-off: reduced flexibility).
        *   Use certificate pinning (see below) as a crucial additional defense.

## Threat: [Malicious Interceptor Injection](./threats/malicious_interceptor_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Interceptor Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects a malicious OkHttp Interceptor into the Retrofit client.  The interceptor can modify requests or responses, stealing sensitive data, injecting malicious content, or altering API behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Data tampering, data leakage, potential for code execution (depending on how the application handles responses), leading to severe security breaches.
    *   **Retrofit Component Affected:** `OkHttpClient.Builder().addInterceptor()` and `OkHttpClient.Builder().addNetworkInterceptor()` - The interceptor mechanism is the attack vector.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the interceptor's capabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all dependencies, ensuring libraries providing interceptors are trusted and updated.
        *   Minimize interceptor usage; use only when absolutely necessary.
        *   Thoroughly review and audit all interceptor code.
        *   Implement robust client-side input validation and output encoding.

## Threat: [Compromised Converter Factory](./threats/compromised_converter_factory.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Converter Factory

    *   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate converter factory (e.g., GsonConverterFactory) with a malicious one, manipulating the serialization/deserialization process. This can lead to data corruption, injection of malicious data, or potentially code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, potential for code execution (if the attacker can inject and trigger malicious code), leading to significant security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Retrofit Component Affected:** `Retrofit.Builder().addConverterFactory()` - The converter factory mechanism is the target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the converter's capabilities and how the application handles deserialized data)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use well-vetted and maintained converter factories from trusted sources (e.g., official libraries).
        *   Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
        *   Avoid custom converter factories unless absolutely necessary; if used, rigorously review and test them.

## Threat: [Missing or Incorrect Certificate Pinning](./threats/missing_or_incorrect_certificate_pinning.md)

*   **Threat:** Missing or Incorrect Certificate Pinning

    *   **Description:** The application fails to implement certificate pinning or implements it incorrectly, allowing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack with a fake certificate. The attacker intercepts and decrypts communication.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of API communication confidentiality and integrity; data theft and potential modification.
    *   **Retrofit Component Affected:** `OkHttpClient.Builder().certificatePinner()` (Retrofit relies on OkHttp for TLS/SSL).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement certificate pinning using OkHttp's `CertificatePinner`.
        *   Regularly update pinned certificates and have a robust update process.
        *   Thoroughly test certificate pinning.
