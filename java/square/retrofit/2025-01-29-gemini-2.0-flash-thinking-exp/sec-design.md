# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Simplify HTTP client implementation for Android and Java developers.
 - Provide a type-safe and efficient way to interact with RESTful APIs.
 - Enhance developer productivity by abstracting away low-level HTTP concerns.
 - Promote code readability and maintainability in applications that consume web services.
- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in Retrofit library could compromise applications using it.
 - Performance bottlenecks in Retrofit could impact application responsiveness.
 - Incompatibility issues with evolving backend APIs could break applications.
 - Lack of proper security guidance for developers could lead to insecure usage of Retrofit.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: HTTPS support is implicitly provided by underlying HTTP client (OkHttp). Implemented in OkHttp library.
 - security control: Input validation is expected to be implemented by the application using Retrofit, before sending data to backend services. Implemented in user application code.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on user applications to correctly implement authentication and authorization.
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in underlying OkHttp library.
 - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of Retrofit by developers leading to insecure communication.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency scanning of Retrofit's dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) on Retrofit codebase to identify potential security flaws.
 - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Retrofit, emphasizing secure configuration and usage.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Retrofit itself does not handle authentication, it relies on the application to provide authentication tokens or credentials.
  - Requirement: Applications using Retrofit MUST implement appropriate authentication mechanisms based on the backend API requirements.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Retrofit itself does not handle authorization, it relies on the application to ensure proper authorization logic.
  - Requirement: Applications using Retrofit MUST implement authorization checks to control access to backend resources.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Retrofit should perform basic input validation to prevent common injection attacks, especially in areas where user-provided data might influence HTTP requests.
  - Requirement: Applications using Retrofit MUST perform thorough input validation on data received from backend services and data sent to backend services.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Retrofit MUST support and encourage the use of HTTPS for all communication to ensure data confidentiality and integrity in transit.
  - Requirement: Retrofit should not implement custom cryptography but rely on well-established and vetted cryptographic libraries provided by the underlying platform (Java/Android).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Ensuring secure and reliable communication between applications and backend services for applications using Retrofit.
 - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Retrofit library for developers.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Retrofit library code itself (low sensitivity, publicly available on GitHub, but integrity is important).
 - Build process and signing keys (high sensitivity, compromise could lead to malicious library versions).
 - User data transmitted through applications using Retrofit (sensitivity depends on the application, could be highly sensitive PII, financial data, etc.).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Business Posture Questions:
 - What is the expected risk appetite for applications using Retrofit? (Assumption: Varies depending on the application, Retrofit should aim for high security).
 - Are there specific compliance requirements for applications using Retrofit? (Assumption: Retrofit should be designed to facilitate compliance, e.g., with HTTPS enforcement).
- Security Posture Questions:
 - What security testing is currently performed on Retrofit codebase? (Assumption: Basic testing, recommended to enhance with SAST and dependency scanning).
 - Are there documented security guidelines for developers using Retrofit? (Assumption: Basic usage guidelines, recommended to add specific security best practices).
 - What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported in Retrofit or its dependencies? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability disclosure and patching process).
- Design Questions:
