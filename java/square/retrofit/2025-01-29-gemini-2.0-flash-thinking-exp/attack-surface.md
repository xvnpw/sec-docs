# Attack Surface Analysis for square/retrofit

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of flaws in data deserialization processes to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Retrofit Contribution:** Retrofit relies on converter libraries (like Gson, Jackson, Moshi) to deserialize server responses. Vulnerabilities in these libraries or insecure custom converters directly expose the application.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON response that, when deserialized by a vulnerable Gson library used with Retrofit, triggers remote code execution on the application's device.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Breach, Application Crash.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Secure and Updated Converters: Choose well-maintained and actively updated converter libraries. Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Converter Security Audits: If using custom converters, conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix potential deserialization flaws.
    *   Schema Validation: Employ schema validation techniques to ensure incoming data conforms to expected structures, limiting the attack surface for malicious payloads.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection Vulnerabilities (HTTP Parameter Pollution, Header Injection)](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_vulnerabilities__http_parameter_pollution__header_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Manipulating HTTP requests by injecting malicious parameters or headers through user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized or encoded.
*   **Retrofit Contribution:** Retrofit's annotations like `@Path`, `@Query`, `@QueryMap`, `@Header`, and `@Headers` allow dynamic parameter and header injection. If developers directly use unsanitized user input with these annotations, vulnerabilities arise.
*   **Example:** An application uses `@Query("search") String query` and directly takes user input for `query`. An attacker inputs `vulnerable_param=malicious_value&search=safe_value` leading to HTTP Parameter Pollution, potentially bypassing security checks. Another example is injecting a malicious header like `X-Forwarded-For: <script>alert('XSS')</script>` if user input is used in `@Header`.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if headers are reflected, Data Manipulation, Unauthorized Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it in Retrofit API calls. Use allow-lists and escape/encode input appropriately.
    *   Proper Encoding: Ensure correct URL encoding of parameters, especially when using `@Query` and `@Path`.
    *   Header Sanitization: Sanitize user-controlled input before setting it in headers. Avoid directly using user input to construct header values if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure HTTP Client Configuration (OkHttp)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_http_client_configuration__okhttp_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations or weaknesses in the underlying HTTP client (typically OkHttp) used by Retrofit.
*   **Retrofit Contribution:** Retrofit uses OkHttp by default. Insecure OkHttp configurations directly translate to vulnerabilities in Retrofit-based applications.
*   **Example:** An application disables TLS certificate validation in OkHttp to bypass certificate pinning issues during development. This configuration is accidentally deployed to production, making the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, Data Interception, Data Tampering, Exposure of Sensitive Data, Compromised Communication Security.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure TLS/SSL Configuration: Configure OkHttp to use strong TLS versions (TLS 1.2+) and secure cipher suites. Enforce certificate validation and hostname verification.
    *   Regular OkHttp Updates: Keep the OkHttp dependency up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Review OkHttp Configuration: Regularly review and audit OkHttp configurations to ensure they adhere to security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Interceptors Misuse and Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/interceptors_misuse_and_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security issues introduced by improperly implemented or vulnerable Retrofit interceptors, which modify HTTP requests and responses.
*   **Retrofit Contribution:** Retrofit interceptors provide a powerful mechanism to intercept and modify requests and responses. Misuse or vulnerabilities in interceptor logic directly impact the application's security.
*   **Example:** An interceptor designed for logging inadvertently logs sensitive authentication tokens in plain text. Another example is an interceptor that modifies request headers based on user-controlled input without proper validation, leading to header injection.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of Sensitive Data (logging), Request Smuggling, Response Manipulation, Bypassing Security Controls, Data Integrity Issues.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure Logging Practices: Avoid logging sensitive data in interceptors. If logging is necessary, implement secure logging mechanisms and redact sensitive information before logging.
    *   Interceptor Security Review: Thoroughly review interceptor code for potential security vulnerabilities. Ensure request and response modifications are secure and based on trusted logic.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege for Interceptors: Limit the scope and functionality of interceptors to only what is necessary.
