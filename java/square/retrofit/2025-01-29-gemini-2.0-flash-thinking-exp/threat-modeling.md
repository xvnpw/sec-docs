# Threat Model Analysis for square/retrofit

## Threat: [Threat 1: Insecure Base URL Configuration](./threats/threat_1_insecure_base_url_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Base URL Configuration (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
*   **Description:** An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by intercepting unencrypted HTTP traffic. They could eavesdrop on sensitive data transmitted between the application and the API server, modify requests or responses, or inject malicious content. This is possible if the Retrofit client is configured to use `http://` instead of `https://` for the base URL.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (sensitive data exposure), integrity breach (data modification), potential for account compromise or further attacks.
*   **Retrofit Component Affected:** Retrofit Client Initialization (Base URL configuration)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use `https://` for the base URL when initializing the Retrofit client.
    *   Enforce HTTPS usage on the server-side (e.g., using HSTS headers).
    *   Regularly review Retrofit client configuration to ensure HTTPS is consistently enforced.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Permissive SSL/TLS Configuration](./threats/threat_2_permissive_ssltls_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Permissive SSL/TLS Configuration (Weak or Disabled Certificate Validation)
*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weakened or disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation in the underlying OkHttp client (used by Retrofit) to perform a MITM attack, even when HTTPS is used in the base URL. By presenting a fraudulent certificate, which the application incorrectly trusts due to misconfiguration, they can intercept and manipulate encrypted traffic.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, integrity breach, potential for account compromise or further attacks, bypassing HTTPS security.
*   **Retrofit Component Affected:** OkHttp Client Configuration (SSL/TLS settings, configured indirectly via Retrofit's OkHttpClient builder)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain default SSL/TLS settings in OkHttp, which enforce strong certificate validation. Avoid custom configurations unless absolutely necessary and security implications are fully understood.
    *   Avoid custom `HostnameVerifier` or `SSLSocketFactory` implementations that weaken security.
    *   If custom configurations are required, ensure they are thoroughly reviewed and tested by security experts.
    *   Regularly update OkHttp to benefit from security patches and protocol improvements, as Retrofit relies on OkHttp.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/threat_3_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Deserialization Vulnerabilities (in Converter Libraries like Gson, Jackson used with Retrofit)
*   **Description:** A malicious API server could send crafted JSON or XML responses specifically designed to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities present in the converter libraries used by Retrofit (e.g., GsonConverterFactory, JacksonConverterFactory). Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client device, Denial of Service (DoS), or other severe application compromise.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), application compromise, data corruption, potential for complete device takeover.
*   **Retrofit Component Affected:** Converter Factories (GsonConverterFactory, JacksonConverterFactory, etc.) and the underlying converter libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use up-to-date and actively maintained converter libraries.
    *   Regularly update converter libraries to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement input validation on the client-side *after* deserialization to check for unexpected or malicious data structures, adding a layer of defense in depth.
    *   Consider using safer deserialization configurations or libraries that are less prone to known vulnerabilities if available and suitable for the project.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Vulnerabilities in Retrofit Dependencies](./threats/threat_4_vulnerabilities_in_retrofit_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Retrofit Dependencies (OkHttp, Converter Libraries)
*   **Description:** Retrofit relies on external libraries, primarily OkHttp for network communication and converter libraries for data serialization/deserialization. If these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities, applications using Retrofit become indirectly vulnerable. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities in the dependencies to compromise the application through Retrofit's usage.
*   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, potentially including Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), data breaches, and other security flaws. The severity depends on the exploited vulnerability.
*   **Retrofit Component Affected:** Retrofit Dependencies (OkHttp, Converter Libraries)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Retrofit and *all* its dependencies to the latest versions. This is crucial for receiving security patches.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, GitHub Dependency Check) to automatically identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in Retrofit's dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for Retrofit and its dependencies. Promptly apply updates when vulnerabilities are announced and patches are available.
    *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for continuous monitoring and management of dependencies throughout the software development lifecycle.
