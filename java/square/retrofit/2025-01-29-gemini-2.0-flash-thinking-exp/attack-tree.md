└───[AND] Application is Vulnerable to Exploitation
    └─── This branch represents the condition that the identified vulnerabilities can actually be exploited to achieve the attacker's goal. It's implicitly assumed for each attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Retrofit-Specific Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_retrofit-specific_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses directly related to Retrofit and its ecosystem, including dependencies and configurations. Success here directly compromises the application through vulnerabilities stemming from the use of Retrofit.

    *   **1.1. Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Retrofit relies on converter libraries to handle data serialization and deserialization. Vulnerabilities in these processes can be critical.

            *   **1.1.1. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Converter (e.g., Gson, Jackson) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** If the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of converter libraries like Gson, Jackson, or Moshi, attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
                *   **Impact:** This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or information disclosure depending on the specific vulnerability.
                *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update converter libraries to the latest secure versions. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to detect vulnerable dependencies.

            *   **1.2. Malicious Server Response Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   If the server-side application has injection vulnerabilities, attackers can inject malicious payloads into server responses.

                *   **1.2.1. Server-Side Injection leading to Malicious JSON/XML [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit server-side vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to inject malicious payloads into the JSON or XML responses sent by the server. When the Retrofit client deserializes this response, the malicious payload is executed on the client side.
                    *   **Impact:** This can lead to client-side code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions on the user's device.
                    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration of Retrofit Client [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_of_retrofit_client__high-risk_path_.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in how the Retrofit client is set up and used within the application.

    *   **2.1. Insecure HTTP Connection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Using unencrypted HTTP instead of HTTPS exposes communication to eavesdropping and manipulation.

            *   **2.1.1. Force HTTP instead of HTTPS [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can intercept network traffic and downgrade the connection from HTTPS to HTTP (e.g., via SSL stripping attacks). If the application is configured to allow or default to HTTP, this downgrade is easier.
                *   **Impact:** All communication becomes unencrypted, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data (API keys, user credentials, data in transit) and perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks to modify requests and responses.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Always enforce HTTPS for all network communication.** Configure both client and server to strictly use HTTPS. Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on the server to prevent downgrade attacks.

    *   **2.2. Disabled or Misconfigured SSL/TLS [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Weakening or disabling SSL/TLS security features makes HTTPS ineffective.

            *   **2.2.1. Disable Certificate Validation (Insecure TrustManager) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might mistakenly disable SSL certificate validation (e.g., using an insecure `TrustManager`) during development or due to misconfiguration. This makes the client trust any certificate, including forged ones.
                *   **Impact:** Attackers can easily perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks by presenting a forged certificate. The client will accept it, allowing attackers to intercept and modify all communication without detection.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Never disable certificate validation in production.** Use the default, secure `TrustManager` provided by the platform or OkHttp. For testing, use proper mocking techniques instead of disabling security.

    *   **2.3. Exposed API Keys or Secrets in Client Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Storing sensitive credentials directly in the client application code is a major security flaw.

            *   **2.3.1. Hardcoded API Keys in Application [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might hardcode API keys, secrets, or other sensitive credentials directly into the application code (e.g., in Retrofit service definitions, interceptors, or configuration files).
                *   **Impact:** Attackers can easily reverse engineer the application (especially mobile apps) and extract these hardcoded secrets. This grants them unauthorized access to APIs, backend systems, and potentially user accounts, leading to data breaches, account takeover, and other malicious activities.
                *   **Mitigation:** **Never hardcode API keys or secrets in client-side code.** Use secure methods for managing and storing secrets, such as environment variables (handled securely at deployment), secure key stores provided by the operating system, or backend-for-frontend (BFF) patterns to offload secret management to the server-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logical Flaws in API Definition via Retrofit [MEDIUM-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logical_flaws_in_api_definition_via_retrofit__medium-risk_path_.md)

While categorized as medium-risk overall, certain aspects within this path can be critical, especially when combined with server-side vulnerabilities.

    *   **3.1. Parameter Manipulation via Query/Path/Body [MEDIUM-RISK PATH]:**
        *   Retrofit simplifies parameter handling, but improper server-side validation can lead to vulnerabilities.

            *   **3.1.3. Body Manipulation for Injection Attacks [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious request bodies (JSON/XML) to exploit server-side vulnerabilities like Command Injection, SQL Injection, or XML External Entity (XXE) injection. If the server-side application does not properly validate and sanitize the data received in the request body, these injection attacks can be successful.
                *   **Impact:** Successful injection attacks on the server-side can lead to critical consequences, including server-side code execution, data breaches, data manipulation, and complete server compromise.
                *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the server-side for all request bodies. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize user-provided data before using it in commands or XML processing.
