# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for square/retrofit

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Retrofit Library Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_retrofit_library_updated.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor Retrofit Releases:** Regularly check the official Retrofit GitHub repository ([https://github.com/square/retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)) or release notes for new versions.
2.  **Review Changelogs:** Examine the changelogs for each new Retrofit version to identify bug fixes and security patches specifically within the Retrofit library.
3.  **Update Retrofit Dependency:** Update the Retrofit dependency version in your project's build file (e.g., `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`) to the latest stable release.
4.  **Test Retrofit Integration:** After updating, test the parts of your application that use Retrofit to ensure compatibility and that the update hasn't introduced regressions in your API communication.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated Retrofit library:** (High Severity) - Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that are specific to older versions of the Retrofit library itself to potentially compromise the application.

**Impact:**
*   **Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated Retrofit library:** High Risk Reduction - Updating Retrofit directly addresses and eliminates known vulnerabilities within the library's code, reducing the attack surface.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Yes, using Dependabot to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates in GitHub repository, which includes Retrofit.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   N/A - Currently implemented and actively maintained for Retrofit library updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS in Retrofit Base URL Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_https_in_retrofit_base_url_configuration.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure Base URL with HTTPS:** When creating your Retrofit instance using `Retrofit.Builder`, ensure that the `baseUrl()` method is always configured with an `https://` URL scheme.
2.  **Review Retrofit Client Initialization:** Review all locations in your codebase where Retrofit clients are initialized to verify that the base URL consistently uses HTTPS.
3.  **Avoid Dynamic Base URLs with HTTP:** If you dynamically construct base URLs, ensure that the logic always results in an HTTPS URL and prevents the accidental use of HTTP.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks due to HTTP usage with Retrofit:** (High Severity) - If Retrofit is configured to use HTTP for API communication, attackers can intercept network traffic handled by Retrofit, eavesdrop on sensitive data being sent and received through Retrofit, and potentially manipulate API requests and responses.

**Impact:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks due to HTTP usage with Retrofit:** High Risk Reduction - Configuring Retrofit to use HTTPS ensures that all network communication managed by Retrofit is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and MitM attacks on the Retrofit layer.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Yes, `baseUrl()` in all Retrofit client configurations is set to HTTPS for all API calls.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   N/A - HTTPS base URL configuration is consistently implemented in Retrofit usage.
