# Threat Model Analysis for square/retrofit

## Threat: [Insecure Base URL Configuration](./threats/insecure_base_url_configuration.md)

**Description:**
*   **Threat:** An attacker could manipulate the base URL used by Retrofit to point to a malicious server.
*   **How:** This could happen if the base URL is hardcoded and an attacker gains access to the application's code or configuration, or if the base URL is dynamically constructed based on user input without proper validation *within the Retrofit setup*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** The application would send requests to the attacker's server instead of the legitimate API. This allows the attacker to intercept sensitive data sent by the application, potentially steal credentials, or serve malicious responses that could compromise the application or the user's device.
*   **Affected Retrofit Component:**
    *   **Component:** `Retrofit.Builder().baseUrl()` method.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store the base URL securely, preferably in a configuration file or environment variable that is not easily accessible.
    *   Avoid hardcoding the base URL directly in the code.
    *   If the base URL needs to be dynamic, ensure that any user input involved in its construction is thoroughly validated and sanitized *before being used with Retrofit's `baseUrl()`*.
    *   Enforce HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks even if the base URL is compromised.

## Threat: [Missing or Weak SSL/TLS Configuration](./threats/missing_or_weak_ssltls_configuration.md)

**Description:**
*   **Threat:** The application might not be configured *through Retrofit's underlying client configuration* to enforce secure HTTPS connections, allowing for communication over insecure HTTP.
*   **How:** An attacker on the network could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept communication between the application and the server *if Retrofit is not properly configured to use HTTPS*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive data transmitted between the application and the server (including authentication tokens, personal information, etc.) could be intercepted and read by the attacker.
*   **Affected Retrofit Component:**
    *   **Component:**  Configuration of the `OkHttpClient` provided to `Retrofit.Builder()`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure that the Retrofit client (via OkHttp) is configured to only use HTTPS. This is typically done when building the `OkHttpClient` instance passed to Retrofit.
    *   Implement certificate pinning to further enhance security by validating the server's SSL certificate against a known good certificate *within the OkHttp configuration*.
    *   Avoid allowing fallback to insecure HTTP connections *in the OkHttp client configuration*.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**
*   **Threat:** The JSON or XML converter used by Retrofit (e.g., Gson, Jackson) might have vulnerabilities that can be exploited through maliciously crafted server responses *processed by Retrofit's converters*.
*   **How:** An attacker could compromise the API server or perform a MITM attack to inject a malicious response. When Retrofit attempts to deserialize this response using the configured converter, the vulnerability in the converter could be triggered, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the client device.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device, potentially gaining full control of the device and its data.
*   **Affected Retrofit Component:**
    *   **Component:**  Converters (e.g., `GsonConverterFactory`, `JacksonConverterFactory`) used with `Retrofit.Builder().addConverterFactory()`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the JSON/XML converter libraries updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using converters with known security best practices.
    *   Implement server-side validation to prevent the server from sending malicious responses in the first place.
    *   Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected or invalid responses *during Retrofit's deserialization process*.

## Threat: [Parameter Injection through Dynamic URL Manipulation](./threats/parameter_injection_through_dynamic_url_manipulation.md)

**Description:**
*   **Threat:** If the application dynamically constructs parts of the API endpoint URL based on user input without proper sanitization *before passing it to Retrofit's API definition*.
*   **How:** An attacker could manipulate input fields or other data sources that are used to build the URL, adding extra parameters or modifying the path to access unauthorized resources or trigger unintended actions on the server *when the request is made through Retrofit*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or execution of unintended server-side functions.
*   **Affected Retrofit Component:**
    *   **Component:**  Retrofit interface method definitions using `@GET`, `@POST`, etc., and path parameters (`@Path`, `@Query`) when the input to these is not properly sanitized.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing URLs dynamically based on raw user input *that will be used with Retrofit*.
    *   If dynamic URL construction is necessary, thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into the URL *used in Retrofit's API calls*.
    *   Use parameterized queries or path parameters provided by Retrofit to avoid manual string concatenation *vulnerabilities*.
