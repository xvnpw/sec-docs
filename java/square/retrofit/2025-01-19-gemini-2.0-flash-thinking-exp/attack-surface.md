# Attack Surface Analysis for square/retrofit

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Deserialization via Retrofit Converters](./attack_surfaces/insecure_deserialization_via_retrofit_converters.md)

* **Description:**  The application uses a Retrofit converter (like Gson, Jackson, or Moshi) to deserialize data received from the server. If the converter has vulnerabilities or the server sends malicious data crafted to exploit these vulnerabilities, it can lead to arbitrary code execution or other security breaches on the client.
    * **How Retrofit Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Retrofit is the direct mechanism through which the potentially malicious data is received and processed by the configured converter. It defines the interface and the process of deserializing the server's response into Java objects using the specified converter.
    * **Example:** A malicious server sends a JSON response containing crafted data that exploits a known vulnerability in the Gson library, which is being used as the Retrofit converter. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the user's device when Retrofit attempts to deserialize the response.
    * **Impact:** Critical
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use Secure and Up-to-Date Converters:**  Choose well-maintained and actively developed converter libraries known for their security. Regularly update these libraries to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Input Validation (Server-Side):** While not directly a Retrofit mitigation, ensuring the backend API sanitizes and validates all data before sending it significantly reduces the risk of malicious payloads exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities.
        * **Consider Alternative Deserialization Strategies:** If the risk is deemed very high, explore alternative deserialization approaches or libraries with stronger security records or features to mitigate deserialization attacks.
        * **Monitor Converter Vulnerabilities:** Stay informed about Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and security advisories related to the chosen converter library and promptly update when patches are available.
