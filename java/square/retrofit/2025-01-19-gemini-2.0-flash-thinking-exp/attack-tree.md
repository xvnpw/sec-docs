## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Base URL to Malicious Server](./attack_tree_paths/modify_base_url_to_malicious_server.md)

Description: An attacker exploits insecure configuration management to change the base URL used by Retrofit to point to a server under their control.
Likelihood: Low (requires insecure configuration management).
Impact: High (complete control over communication, ability to intercept sensitive data and serve malicious responses).
Effort: Medium (identifying configuration flaws, setting up a malicious server).
Skill Level: Medium (understanding network requests, basic server setup).
Detection Difficulty: Medium (monitoring network traffic for unexpected destinations).

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable SSL Certificate Verification](./attack_tree_paths/disable_ssl_certificate_verification.md)

Description: The application is configured to disable SSL certificate verification, allowing connections over plain HTTP or accepting invalid certificates, making it vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
Likelihood: Low (usually a development/debugging setting, should not be in production).
Impact: High (MitM attacks, data interception, potential for data manipulation).
Effort: Low (identifying the disabled setting).
Skill Level: Low (basic understanding of network security).
Detection Difficulty: High (difficult to detect from the application's perspective, requires network monitoring).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Configuration)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__configuration_.md)

Description: The application uses a vulnerable version of a converter library (e.g., Gson, Jackson) or configures it insecurely, allowing an attacker to craft malicious data that, when deserialized, leads to arbitrary code execution.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on the converter library and its usage).
Impact: High (arbitrary code execution on the client device).
Effort: Medium to High (requires knowledge of deserialization vulnerabilities and crafting payloads).
Skill Level: Medium to High (understanding of serialization/deserialization, vulnerability exploitation).
Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (can be detected by monitoring for unusual deserialization patterns or errors).

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Tampering](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_tampering.md)

Description: An attacker intercepts and modifies HTTP request parameters before they are sent to the server, potentially gaining unauthorized access or causing errors.
Likelihood: Medium (common web application vulnerability, easier if client-side logic is weak).
Impact: Medium to High (depending on the parameter and server-side validation, can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or application errors).
Effort: Low to Medium (intercepting and modifying requests using browser developer tools or proxy tools).
Skill Level: Low to Medium (basic understanding of HTTP requests and parameters).
Detection Difficulty: Medium (requires server-side logging and monitoring of parameter values).

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Response)](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities__response_.md)

Description: A compromised backend server or a Man-in-the-Middle attacker injects malicious data into the HTTP response. If the application uses an insecure deserialization process, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the client.
Likelihood: Low to Medium (requires a compromised backend or MitM attack).
Impact: High (arbitrary code execution on the client device).
Effort: Medium to High (compromising backend or performing MitM, crafting malicious payloads).
Skill Level: Medium to High (network security, deserialization vulnerabilities).
Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (can be detected by monitoring for unusual deserialization patterns or errors, but requires backend visibility).

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable OkHttp Version](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_okhttp_version.md)

Description: The application uses an outdated version of OkHttp with known security vulnerabilities, which an attacker can exploit.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on how frequently dependencies are updated).
Impact: Medium to High (variety of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including denial of service, data injection, or even remote code execution in some cases).
Effort: Low to High (depending on the specific vulnerability and availability of exploits).
Skill Level: Low to High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (can be detected by vulnerability scanning tools).

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Converter Libraries (e.g., Gson, Jackson)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_converter_libraries__e_g___gson__jackson_.md)

Description: The application uses outdated or vulnerable versions of converter libraries, which can introduce security risks, particularly related to deserialization vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary code execution.
Likelihood: Medium (depends on how frequently dependencies are updated).
Impact: High (often leads to deserialization vulnerabilities and arbitrary code execution).
Effort: Medium to High (understanding and exploiting deserialization vulnerabilities).
Skill Level: Medium to High (understanding of serialization/deserialization, vulnerability exploitation).
Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (can be detected by vulnerability scanning tools and monitoring for unusual deserialization patterns).

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Retrofit Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_retrofit_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: The root goal of the attacker, representing the successful compromise of the application by exploiting weaknesses related to the Retrofit library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_issues.md)

Description: A category of attacks that exploit insecure or incorrect configuration of the Retrofit client or its underlying components. Successful exploitation can lead to various high-impact scenarios.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Base URL Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_base_url_configuration.md)

Description: A specific configuration flaw where the base URL used by Retrofit can be modified by an attacker, allowing them to redirect communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Converters](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_converters.md)

Description: Incorrect or insecure configuration of the converter libraries used by Retrofit, which can lead to deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Retrofit Requests](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_retrofit_requests.md)

Description: A category of attacks where the attacker intercepts and modifies the HTTP requests made by the application using Retrofit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Retrofit Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_retrofit_response_handling.md)

Description: A category of attacks that target the way the application processes HTTP responses received through Retrofit, including deserialization vulnerabilities and insecure data handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Retrofit](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_retrofit.md)

Description: A category of attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in the libraries that Retrofit depends on, such as OkHttp and converter libraries.
