# Attack Surface Analysis for square/retrofit

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Verification](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_verification.md)

**Description:** The application fails to properly validate the SSL/TLS certificate of the server it's communicating with. This can allow Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where an attacker intercepts and potentially modifies communication.

**How Retrofit Contributes:** Retrofit relies on the underlying OkHttp client for network communication. If the OkHttp client is configured with a `TrustManager` that accepts all certificates or doesn't perform proper hostname verification, Retrofit will inherit this insecure behavior. The way Retrofit is initialized and the OkHttp client is provided directly impacts this.

**Example:** An attacker on the same network as the application intercepts the HTTPS connection, presenting a forged certificate. If the application's Retrofit client (via misconfigured OkHttp) doesn't validate the certificate, it will continue communication with the attacker's server.

**Impact:** Critical. Sensitive data transmitted between the application and the server can be intercepted, read, and modified by the attacker. This can lead to credential theft, data breaches, and other serious security compromises.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the `OkHttpClient.Builder` used to create the Retrofit instance is configured with the default, secure `TrustManager` and `HostnameVerifier`.
* Avoid custom `TrustManager` implementations that bypass certificate validation when building the `OkHttpClient` for Retrofit.
* If custom certificate pinning is required, implement it correctly and securely within the `OkHttpClient` configuration used by Retrofit.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** The application deserializes data received from the server without proper validation. If the server is compromised or malicious, it could send crafted data that exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**How Retrofit Contributes:** Retrofit uses converters (like Gson, Jackson, Moshi) specified during its build process to automatically deserialize server responses into Java objects. The choice and configuration of these converters directly expose the application to deserialization vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A compromised API sends a crafted JSON response that, when deserialized by the Gson converter configured in Retrofit, triggers the execution of arbitrary code on the application's device.

**Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the application and the device it's running on. Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, install malware, or control the device remotely.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use the latest versions of Retrofit and its converter libraries (specified during Retrofit build) to benefit from security patches.
* If possible, avoid deserializing complex objects from untrusted sources using Retrofit.
* Implement input validation on the server-side to prevent the transmission of malicious data that Retrofit would then deserialize.
* Consider using safer serialization formats or custom parsing logic for critical data instead of relying solely on Retrofit's automatic conversion.
* Explore using security features offered by the deserialization library (e.g., disabling auto-binding to prevent unexpected object creation) when configuring the converter for Retrofit.

## Attack Surface: [Parameter Injection via Retrofit Annotations](./attack_surfaces/parameter_injection_via_retrofit_annotations.md)

**Description:** Improper use of Retrofit annotations like `@Path`, `@Query`, `@QueryMap`, `@Field`, and `@FieldMap` can lead to injection vulnerabilities if user-supplied data is directly incorporated without proper sanitization or encoding within the Retrofit interface definition.

**How Retrofit Contributes:** Retrofit simplifies the process of constructing HTTP requests based on the defined interface. However, developers must be careful when using annotations to incorporate dynamic data, as Retrofit itself doesn't inherently sanitize this data.

**Example:** Using `@Path` with unsanitized user input in a Retrofit interface method to construct a URL like `/users/{userId}` where `userId` contains characters like `/` or `..`, potentially leading to path traversal vulnerabilities on the server. Similarly, unsanitized input in `@Query` could lead to server-side vulnerabilities if the backend doesn't properly handle it.

**Impact:** High. Depending on the specific vulnerability on the server-side, this can lead to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or even command execution on the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always sanitize and validate user-supplied data *before* passing it as arguments to Retrofit interface methods that use annotations like `@Path`, `@Query`, etc.
* Prefer using `@Query` parameters with proper encoding for passing dynamic data instead of directly manipulating the path with `@Path` for user-controlled values within the Retrofit interface.
* While client-side sanitization helps, rely on server-side validation as the primary defense against injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Base URL Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_base_url_handling.md)

**Description:** If the base URL used by Retrofit is dynamically determined or influenced by user input without proper validation, attackers might be able to redirect requests to malicious servers.

**How Retrofit Contributes:** Retrofit requires a base URL to be configured during its initialization. If this base URL is not securely managed, it becomes a point of vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a configuration setting or an API parameter that is used to construct the base URL passed to the Retrofit builder, causing Retrofit to send requests to a server under the attacker's control.

**Impact:** High. This can lead to data theft, phishing attacks, or the execution of malicious code on the attacker's server under the guise of legitimate communication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Hardcode the base URL when creating the Retrofit instance whenever possible.
* If the base URL needs to be configurable, ensure it's fetched from a trusted source and rigorously validated against a whitelist of allowed URLs before being used to initialize Retrofit.
* Avoid directly using user input to construct the base URL passed to the Retrofit builder.
