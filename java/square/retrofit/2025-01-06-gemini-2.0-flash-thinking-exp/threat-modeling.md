# Threat Model Analysis for square/retrofit

## Threat: [Insecure Default SSL/TLS Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_ssltls_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting network traffic between the application and the API server. This is possible if the application is configured to trust all certificates or uses outdated/insecure TLS versions *within Retrofit's `OkHttpClient` configuration*. The attacker could eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted or even modify requests and responses.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach (sensitive data exposure), integrity compromise (data manipulation), potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.

**Affected Retrofit Component:** `OkHttpClient` (used by Retrofit for network communication), specifically its `SSLSocketFactory` and `HostnameVerifier` configurations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement proper SSL/TLS certificate pinning to trust only specific certificates.
* Use the system's default trusted certificate store instead of custom, insecure implementations.
* Ensure the application uses the latest and most secure TLS versions.
* Avoid using `HostnameVerifier` or `TrustManager` implementations that blindly trust all certificates.

## Threat: [Parameter Injection](./threats/parameter_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate API requests by injecting malicious code or unexpected values into request parameters. This can happen if user-supplied data is directly used to construct request parameters without proper sanitization or encoding *within Retrofit interface method definitions*. The attacker might be able to bypass authentication, access unauthorized data, or trigger unintended server-side actions.

**Impact:** Authorization bypass, data access violation, potential remote code execution (depending on server-side vulnerabilities).

**Affected Retrofit Component:**  Retrofit interface method definitions using `@Query`, `@QueryMap`, or `@Path` annotations where user input is directly incorporated.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Retrofit's built-in parameter encoding mechanisms.
* Validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into API requests.
* Prefer using strongly typed request bodies with `@Body` instead of directly manipulating URL parameters for complex data.
* Implement robust input validation on the server-side as a secondary defense.

## Threat: [Interceptor Misuse Leading to Data Exposure](./threats/interceptor_misuse_leading_to_data_exposure.md)

**Description:** Developers might implement interceptors *added to Retrofit's `OkHttpClient`* that inadvertently log sensitive information (like authentication tokens, API keys, or personal data) in plain text. If these logs are not properly secured, an attacker gaining access to the device or log storage could retrieve this sensitive data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach (exposure of sensitive credentials or personal data).

**Affected Retrofit Component:** `OkHttpClient.Builder().addInterceptor()` or `addNetworkInterceptor()` used to register custom interceptors. The implementation of the custom interceptor.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and audit all custom interceptor implementations.
* Avoid logging sensitive information directly. If logging is necessary, redact or encrypt sensitive data before logging.
* Secure log storage and access controls.

## Threat: [Interceptor Manipulation of Requests/Responses](./threats/interceptor_manipulation_of_requestsresponses.md)

**Description:** A malicious actor, potentially through a compromised library or code injection, could introduce or modify interceptors *within Retrofit's `OkHttpClient` configuration* to alter API requests or responses. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or information leakage.

**Impact:** Integrity compromise (data manipulation), authorization bypass, potential remote code execution (if the manipulated request triggers a server-side vulnerability).

**Affected Retrofit Component:** `OkHttpClient.Builder().addInterceptor()` or `addNetworkInterceptor()`. The mechanism by which malicious interceptors are introduced (e.g., compromised build process, library dependency).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement code integrity checks and secure the build process.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
* Enforce code signing and verification.
* Limit the ability to dynamically add or modify interceptors in production environments.

## Threat: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the API server returns data in a format that Retrofit automatically deserializes (e.g., JSON, XML), vulnerabilities in the underlying deserialization library (like Gson or Jackson) *used by Retrofit's `Converter.Factory`* could be exploited if the server sends maliciously crafted data. This could lead to remote code execution or denial of service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.

**Affected Retrofit Component:** `Converter.Factory` implementations (e.g., `GsonConverterFactory`, `JacksonConverterFactory`). The underlying deserialization library (e.g., Gson, Jackson).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the deserialization libraries used by Retrofit up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Be aware of known deserialization vulnerabilities in the chosen libraries and avoid using vulnerable features if possible.
* Consider implementing input validation on the server-side to prevent the transmission of malicious data.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Retrofit relies on other libraries like OkHttp. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, applications using Retrofit could be directly affected.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.

**Affected Retrofit Component:**  Indirectly affects the entire Retrofit library through its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical or High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Retrofit and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage vulnerable dependencies.
