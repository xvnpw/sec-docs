# Attack Surface Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses libGDX's JSON (`Json`) or XML (`XmlReader`) parsing capabilities to load data from untrusted sources (e.g., user-provided files, network responses without proper verification).
*   **How libGDX Contributes:** libGDX provides the `Json` and `XmlReader` classes, which can be used to deserialize data structures. If this data is malicious, it can exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization process or lead to unexpected object creation and state.
*   **Example:** A game loads level data from a JSON file provided by the user. A malicious user crafts a JSON file that exploits vulnerabilities in the `Json` parser or creates objects that consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution (in severe cases if custom deserialization logic is flawed), denial of service, application crashes, or data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible.
    *   Implement strict schema validation for any deserialized data.
    *   Use safer data formats or parsing libraries if security is a major concern.
    *   Sanitize and validate the structure and content of deserialized data before using it.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses libGDX's `Files` class to access the file system based on user-controlled input without proper validation, leading to potential path traversal or arbitrary file access.
*   **How libGDX Contributes:** The `Files` class in libGDX provides methods for reading, writing, and manipulating files. If file paths are constructed using unsanitized user input, it can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A game allows users to load custom textures by specifying a file path. A malicious user provides a path like "../../sensitive_data.txt", potentially allowing the application to read files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive application data, modification or deletion of critical files, or even execution of arbitrary code if the application attempts to load executable files based on user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using user-provided input directly in file paths.
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided file paths.
    *   Use absolute paths or restrict file access to specific, controlled directories.
    *   Employ file access permissions and sandboxing techniques where available.
