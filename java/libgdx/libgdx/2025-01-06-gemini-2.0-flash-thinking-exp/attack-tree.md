## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Applications often receive user input through various means (keyboard, mouse, touch). If this input is not properly validated and sanitized, attackers can inject malicious data that is then processed by the application. This can lead to unexpected behavior, data manipulation, or even the execution of arbitrary code.

*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Input via Input Processors**
    *   **Attack Vector (Keyboard Input):** An attacker could enter specially crafted text into input fields or use specific key combinations that are not handled correctly by the application. This could involve injecting commands or scripts that the application interprets and executes.
    *   **Attack Vector (Mouse Input):**  By manipulating mouse events, an attacker might be able to trigger unintended actions or bypass security checks. This could involve crafting specific sequences of clicks or movements that exploit flaws in the application's event handling logic.
    *   **Attack Vector (Touch Input):** In touch-based applications, attackers could manipulate touch events, particularly in multi-touch scenarios or gesture recognition, to trigger vulnerabilities or bypass intended controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Applications using LibGDX load various types of assets (images, audio, data files). If the process of loading or handling these assets is flawed, attackers can exploit these weaknesses to compromise the application.

*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Assets**
    *   **Attack Vector (Replace Existing Assets):** If the application loads assets from external or user-provided sources without proper verification, an attacker could replace legitimate assets with malicious ones. For example, a seemingly harmless image file could be crafted to exploit a vulnerability in the image decoding library, leading to code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector (Introduce New Malicious Assets):** If the application allows users to add new assets, an attacker could introduce malicious files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes or renders these new assets.

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Asset Parsers/Loaders**
    *   **Attack Vector (Image File Exploits):** Attackers can craft malicious image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG) that exploit vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries used by LibGDX. These vulnerabilities can include buffer overflows or other flaws that allow for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector (Audio File Exploits):** Similar to image files, malicious audio files (e.g., MP3, OGG) can be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in LibGDX's audio processing libraries, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector (Data File Exploits):** Attackers can create malicious data files (e.g., JSON, XML, custom formats) that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's or LibGDX's data parsing logic. This can lead to data corruption, application crashes, or even code execution if the parsed data is used to construct commands or control flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Extension/Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_extensionthird-party_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Applications often utilize LibGDX extensions or other third-party libraries to extend functionality. If these external components contain security vulnerabilities, they can be exploited to compromise the application.

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in LibGDX Extensions**
    *   **Attack Vector:** LibGDX extensions are often developed by third parties and may contain security flaws. Attackers can identify and exploit these vulnerabilities to gain control of the application or its data. The specific attack vector depends on the nature of the vulnerability within the extension.

*   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Other Third-Party Libraries**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Applications frequently integrate various third-party libraries for different functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited by attackers. This requires identifying vulnerable libraries and then crafting attacks that target those specific vulnerabilities. The impact and method of exploitation will depend on the functionality of the compromised library.
