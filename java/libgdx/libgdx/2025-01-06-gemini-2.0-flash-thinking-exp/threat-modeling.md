# Threat Model Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Threat: [Shader Exploits](./threats/shader_exploits.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides maliciously crafted GLSL shaders (vertex or fragment shaders) that exploit vulnerabilities in how LibGDX loads, compiles, or uses shaders. This could involve shaders that cause infinite loops or access out-of-bounds memory within the OpenGL context managed by LibGDX.

**Impact:** Application crashes, rendering glitches, denial of service by consuming excessive GPU resources managed by LibGDX, potentially leading to system instability.

**Affected Component:** `com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShaderProgram`, `com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL20`, `com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.GL30` (how LibGDX interacts with OpenGL).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Validate shaders before loading and compiling them using LibGDX's API.
* Limit the ability to load shaders from untrusted or external sources within the application.
* Implement robust error handling during shader compilation and linking within the LibGDX rendering pipeline.

## Threat: [Texture Bombing](./threats/texture_bombing.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides excessively large or complex texture files that, when loaded using LibGDX's texture loading mechanisms, consume excessive memory managed by LibGDX, leading to performance degradation or application crashes.

**Impact:** Application slowdowns, out-of-memory errors triggered within LibGDX's resource management, application crashes.

**Affected Component:** `com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Texture`, `com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.Pixmap`, asset loading mechanisms (`com.badlogic.gdx.assets`) provided by LibGDX.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement size and resolution limits for textures loaded through LibGDX's asset management or texture creation methods.
* Validate texture file headers and formats before loading using LibGDX's image loading capabilities.
* Utilize texture compression techniques supported by LibGDX to reduce memory footprint.
* Implement proper resource management within the application, ensuring textures are disposed of correctly when no longer needed using LibGDX's `dispose()` methods.

## Threat: [Malicious Audio Files Exploiting Decoding within LibGDX](./threats/malicious_audio_files_exploiting_decoding_within_libgdx.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted audio files that exploit vulnerabilities in the audio decoding libraries used internally by LibGDX or its platform-specific backends. This could involve files with malformed headers or data that trigger buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues during the decoding process managed by LibGDX.

**Impact:** Application crashes due to errors in LibGDX's audio handling, potential for memory corruption within the application's process.

**Affected Component:** `com.badlogic.gdx.audio.Sound`, `com.badlogic.gdx.audio.Music`, and the underlying audio decoding implementations used by LibGDX on different platforms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Validate audio file headers and formats before loading them using LibGDX's audio loading methods.
* Limit the size and duration of audio files loaded from untrusted sources to prevent excessive resource consumption during decoding by LibGDX.
* Keep LibGDX updated to benefit from any security patches in its audio handling components or underlying libraries.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data via LibGDX's Utilities](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data_via_libgdx's_utilities.md)

**Description:** If the application uses LibGDX's utility classes like `Json` or `XmlReader` to deserialize data from untrusted sources, an attacker could craft malicious data that, when deserialized by LibGDX, leads to code execution or other harmful actions. This directly involves the use of LibGDX's provided tools for data handling.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, application compromise, data corruption.

**Affected Component:** `com.badlogic.gdx.utils.Json`, `com.badlogic.gdx.utils.XmlReader` (LibGDX's data parsing and serialization utilities).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources using LibGDX's `Json` or `XmlReader` classes.
* If deserialization is necessary, implement strict input validation on the data before and after deserialization using LibGDX's utilities.
* Consider using safer data formats or libraries if deserializing untrusted data is a requirement.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in LibGDX's Native Backends](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_libgdx's_native_backends.md)

**Description:** LibGDX relies on native libraries for platform-specific functionalities. Vulnerabilities within the specific versions of these native libraries bundled with or used by LibGDX (e.g., for OpenGL, audio, input) could be exploited, potentially leading to crashes, memory corruption, or even code execution within the application's context. This is a direct consequence of the native code dependencies of LibGDX.

**Impact:** Application crashes, memory corruption, potential for privilege escalation or remote code execution depending on the specific vulnerability in the native backend.

**Affected Component:** Native backend implementations for various LibGDX modules (graphics, audio, input, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep LibGDX updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its native backends.
* Be aware of known vulnerabilities in the specific versions of native libraries used by LibGDX on target platforms.
* Encourage users to keep their system drivers updated, as some LibGDX functionalities rely on system-level libraries.
