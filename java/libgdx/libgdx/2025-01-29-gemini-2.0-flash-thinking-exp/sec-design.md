# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Primary goal: To provide a comprehensive, cross-platform game development framework that enables developers to efficiently create and deploy games across multiple platforms (desktop, mobile, web).
  - Secondary goal: To foster a strong and active community around the framework, providing support, documentation, and extensions.
  - Tertiary goal: To maintain the framework as open-source and freely available, encouraging adoption and contribution.

- Business Risks:
  - Risk 1: Framework instability or bugs could hinder game development productivity and damage the framework's reputation.
  - Risk 2: Lack of community support or insufficient documentation could deter new developers from adopting the framework.
  - Risk 3: Security vulnerabilities in the framework could be exploited in games built with it, leading to negative consequences for developers and players.
  - Risk 4: Platform incompatibility issues or lack of support for new platforms could limit the framework's reach and usefulness.
  - Risk 5: Competition from other game development frameworks could reduce the framework's market share and community engagement.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - The source code is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Community Contributions - The project relies on community contributions for bug fixes and feature development, which can indirectly improve security through broader code review. Implemented: GitHub Contribution Model.
  - security control: Dependency Management - The project uses dependency management tools (like Gradle) to manage external libraries. Implemented: Build scripts (e.g., `build.gradle`).
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Libraries - The framework depends on numerous third-party libraries, inheriting their potential vulnerabilities. Accepted risk: Inherent to software development and dependency management.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated static and dynamic analysis security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
  - security control: Security Code Reviews - Conduct regular security-focused code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external developers.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to allow security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - security control: Security Patch Management - Implement a process for promptly addressing and patching identified security vulnerabilities in the framework and its dependencies.
  - security control: Input Validation Guidance - Provide clear guidance and best practices for game developers on how to implement input validation in their games to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the framework itself, as it's a library. Authentication is relevant for services built using the framework, which is the responsibility of the game developer. Guidance on secure authentication practices should be provided in documentation.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is relevant for games built with libgdx. The framework should not impose any specific authorization mechanisms but should be flexible enough to allow developers to implement their own.
  - Input Validation: Critical for games built with libgdx to prevent vulnerabilities. The framework should provide tools and guidance to developers for validating user inputs and data from external sources.
  - Cryptography: The framework provides cryptographic functionalities. Security requirements include ensuring that these functionalities are implemented correctly and securely, using well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms. Documentation should guide developers on how to use cryptography securely in their games.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Process 1: Development and maintenance of the LibGDX framework. Protecting the integrity and availability of the framework code and build system is crucial.
  - Process 2: Community contributions and engagement. Maintaining a healthy and trustworthy community is important for the framework's growth and adoption.
  - Process 3: Distribution of the framework and related tools. Ensuring secure and reliable distribution channels is necessary for developers to access and use the framework.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Data 1: Source code of the LibGDX framework. Sensitivity: High. Confidentiality is less critical as it's open source, but integrity and availability are paramount. Unauthorized modification or deletion could severely impact the project.
  - Data 2: Build artifacts (JARs, libraries). Sensitivity: Medium. Integrity is crucial to ensure developers are using a safe and unmodified framework.
  - Data 3: Community forum data, documentation, and website content. Sensitivity: Low to Medium. Availability and integrity are important for community support and information dissemination.
  - Data 4: Developer credentials and access keys for build systems and infrastructure. Sensitivity: High. Confidentiality and integrity are critical to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
