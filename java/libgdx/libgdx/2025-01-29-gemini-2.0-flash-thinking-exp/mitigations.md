# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (LibGDX Input)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__libgdx_input_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify LibGDX Input Handlers:** Pinpoint all locations in your code where you are using LibGDX's input handling mechanisms, primarily within classes implementing `InputProcessor` or extending `InputAdapter`.
    2.  **Validate Input Events:** Within your `InputProcessor` methods (e.g., `keyDown`, `touchDown`, `mouseMoved`), implement validation logic *immediately* upon receiving input events. Check if the input data (key codes, mouse coordinates, touch positions) is within expected ranges and formats for your game logic.
    3.  **Sanitize Text Input:** If your game uses text input fields (either custom implementations or through extensions), sanitize any text obtained from LibGDX input events before using it in game logic or displaying it. This involves escaping or removing potentially harmful characters to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Handle Invalid LibGDX Input:** Define how your game should react to invalid input events received through LibGDX. This could involve ignoring the event, displaying an error message within the game UI, or logging the invalid input for debugging.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Command Injection (Indirect): Severity (High) - If unsanitized input from LibGDX is later used to construct system commands (less direct in typical LibGDX games, but possible if integrating with external systems).
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Web Games): Severity (Medium) - If developing a LibGDX HTML5 game and displaying user-provided text from LibGDX input without sanitization in the web context.
    *   Path Traversal (Indirect): Severity (Medium) - If LibGDX input is used to construct file paths (e.g., in a level editor feature using `Gdx.files`) without validation.
    *   Logic Errors/Unexpected Behavior: Severity (Low to Medium) - Invalid input from LibGDX can cause unexpected game behavior or crashes if not properly handled in your game logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Command Injection (Indirect): Risk Significantly Reduced. Validation and sanitization of LibGDX input are crucial if there's any interaction with external systems based on user input.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Web Games): Risk Significantly Reduced. Sanitization of LibGDX input displayed in web contexts is essential for preventing XSS.
    *   Path Traversal (Indirect): Risk Significantly Reduced. Validating LibGDX input used for file path construction is key to prevent path traversal.
    *   Logic Errors/Unexpected Behavior: Risk Moderately Reduced. Improves the robustness of your game by handling unexpected LibGDX input gracefully.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially Implemented. Basic input validation exists in UI text fields within the username creation screen (`com.mygame.ui.screens.UsernameScreen`) to limit character count and type, using LibGDX's `TextField` input handling.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Input validation and sanitization are missing in:
        *   Potential in-game chat functionality (planned for future online features) where text input from LibGDX needs sanitization before display.
        *   Level editor features (if implemented or planned) that might use LibGDX input to define asset paths or game logic, requiring validation.
        *   Comprehensive validation of accelerometer and touch input events received through LibGDX, beyond basic event handling, is lacking in gameplay logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Input Events (LibGDX Game Loop)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_input_events__libgdx_game_loop_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical LibGDX Input Actions:** Determine which input actions processed within your LibGDX game loop or `InputProcessor` are most susceptible to rapid abuse or could be exploited by sending excessive events.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting in Game Loop/Input Handlers:** Within your LibGDX game loop or specific `InputProcessor` methods, implement logic to track the frequency of critical input events. Use timers or counters to measure the rate of events.
    3.  **Enforce Limits on LibGDX Input Processing:** If the rate of a critical input event exceeds a defined threshold within your LibGDX game loop or input handler, implement actions to limit further processing of that input for a short period. This could involve ignoring subsequent events or throttling the game's response to those events.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Input Flooding (Client-Side): Severity (Medium) -  Preventing a malicious user from overwhelming the LibGDX game client with rapid input events, potentially causing performance degradation or client-side crashes.
    *   Rapid-Fire Exploits (Gameplay): Severity (Medium) - Limiting the ability of players to exploit game mechanics by sending input events at an abnormally high rate, gaining unfair advantages within the LibGDX game.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Input Flooding (Client-Side): Risk Moderately Reduced. Rate limiting within the LibGDX client can mitigate simple client-side DoS attempts through input flooding.
    *   Rapid-Fire Exploits (Gameplay): Risk Moderately Reduced. Limits the effectiveness of exploits that rely on extremely fast input execution within the LibGDX game.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No. Rate limiting of input events within the LibGDX game loop or input handlers is not currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting is missing for critical gameplay actions that are processed within the LibGDX game loop and triggered by LibGDX input events. This is relevant for preventing potential client-side DoS or rapid-fire gameplay exploits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Asset Loading with AssetManager (LibGDX)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_asset_loading_with_assetmanager__libgdx_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize LibGDX AssetManager:**  Primarily use LibGDX's `AssetManager` for loading and managing game assets. This provides a structured and centralized way to handle asset loading.
    2.  **Implement Asset Integrity Checks (Custom Loading):** If you are loading assets outside of `AssetManager` (e.g., custom asset loading for specific formats), implement integrity checks. Calculate cryptographic hashes (like SHA-256) of your original assets and store these hashes securely. Before loading an asset, recalculate its hash and compare it to the stored hash to verify integrity.
    3.  **Secure Asset Paths in LibGDX:** When specifying asset paths for `AssetManager` or `Gdx.files`, avoid constructing paths directly from user input without validation. Ensure that asset paths remain within intended asset directories to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities when loading assets using LibGDX file handling.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Asset Injection: Severity (High) - Preventing the game from loading tampered or malicious assets that could replace legitimate game content and potentially introduce vulnerabilities or unwanted behavior.
    *   Asset Corruption/Tampering: Severity (Medium) - Ensuring that game assets loaded by LibGDX are not corrupted or tampered with during storage or delivery, maintaining game integrity.
    *   Path Traversal (Asset Loading): Severity (Medium) - Preventing attackers from manipulating asset paths used by LibGDX to load assets from unintended locations, potentially accessing sensitive files or injecting malicious assets.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Asset Injection: Risk Significantly Reduced. Asset integrity checks and secure loading practices are crucial to prevent loading of malicious assets.
    *   Asset Corruption/Tampering: Risk Moderately Reduced. Integrity checks help detect and prevent the use of corrupted or tampered assets.
    *   Path Traversal (Asset Loading): Risk Moderately Reduced. Validating asset paths used with LibGDX file handling minimizes path traversal risks during asset loading.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially Implemented. LibGDX `AssetManager` is used for loading most game assets, providing a degree of centralized asset management.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Asset integrity verification (hash checks) is not implemented for assets loaded by `AssetManager` or custom loading mechanisms.
    *   Explicit validation of asset paths used with `AssetManager` and `Gdx.files` to prevent path traversal is not systematically implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Networking with LibGDX Net (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_networking_with_libgdx_net__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Secure Protocols with LibGDX Net:** When using LibGDX's `Net` class for network communication, always prioritize secure protocols. Use HTTPS for web requests (`Net.HttpRequest`) and WSS for WebSockets (`Net.WebSocket`). For custom socket connections, ensure TLS/SSL encryption is implemented.
    2.  **Validate Network Data Received via LibGDX Net:**  When handling responses from network requests (`Net.HttpResponseListener`) or messages from WebSockets (`Net.WebSocketListener`) in LibGDX, treat all received data as untrusted. Implement robust input validation and sanitization on network data *immediately* upon reception before using it in your game logic.
    3.  **Secure WebSocket Connections in LibGDX:** When establishing WebSocket connections using LibGDX's `Net.WebSocket`, explicitly specify `WebSocket.Protocol.WSS` to enforce secure, encrypted connections.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Networking): Severity (High) - Using secure protocols (HTTPS, WSS, TLS/SSL) with LibGDX networking prevents eavesdropping and tampering of network communication by attackers.
    *   Data Injection/Manipulation (Networking): Severity (Medium to High) - Validating network data received through LibGDX `Net` prevents injection attacks and ensures that malicious or malformed network payloads do not compromise the game.
    *   Unauthorized Access (Networking): Severity (Medium) - Secure protocols and data validation are foundational for building secure authentication and authorization mechanisms in networked LibGDX games.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Networking): Risk Significantly Reduced. Secure protocols are essential for mitigating MITM attacks.
    *   Data Injection/Manipulation (Networking): Risk Significantly Reduced. Input validation on network data is crucial for preventing data injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Unauthorized Access (Networking): Risk Moderately Reduced. Secure networking is a prerequisite for implementing effective access control.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not Applicable. Networking features using LibGDX `Net` are not currently implemented in the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Secure networking practices using LibGDX `Net` need to be implemented if online features are added to the game, including using HTTPS for web requests and WSS for WebSockets, along with input validation for all network data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update LibGDX Framework](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_libgdx_framework.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor LibGDX Releases:** Regularly check the official LibGDX GitHub repository, website, and community forums for new releases and security updates.
    2.  **Apply LibGDX Updates Promptly:** When new LibGDX versions are released, especially those containing security patches or vulnerability fixes, update your project to the latest version as soon as feasible.
    3.  **Review LibGDX Changelogs:** Carefully review the changelogs and release notes of new LibGDX versions to understand if any security-related issues have been addressed and if any changes are required in your project due to the update.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known LibGDX Vulnerabilities: Severity (High) - Keeping LibGDX updated patches known vulnerabilities within the framework itself, preventing attackers from exploiting these weaknesses.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known LibGDX Vulnerabilities: Risk Significantly Reduced. Regular updates are a fundamental security practice for mitigating known vulnerabilities in LibGDX.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially Implemented. The project's LibGDX version is updated periodically, but a formal process for monitoring LibGDX releases and promptly applying security updates is not yet established.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a formal process for regularly monitoring LibGDX releases and security announcements.
    *   Implement a procedure for promptly updating the project's LibGDX version when security updates are available.
