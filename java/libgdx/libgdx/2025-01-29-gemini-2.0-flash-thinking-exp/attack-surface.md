# Attack Surface Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Attack Surface: [Unsanitized User Input leading to Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unsanitized_user_input_leading_to_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Failure to properly validate and sanitize user input (keyboard, mouse, touch, text fields) before processing it within the application. This can allow attackers to inject malicious commands or data that are then processed by the application.

*   **libGDX Contribution:** libGDX provides input handling mechanisms. If developers directly use raw input values from libGDX's input processing without sanitization in game logic or system calls, it directly contributes to this attack surface.

*   **Example:** A game uses a text input field for player names. If this name is directly used in a logging function that executes shell commands (highly discouraged but illustrative), an attacker could input a malicious name like `; rm -rf /` to potentially execute commands on the system where the game is running. In UI contexts, if using HTML-based UI elements, unsanitized input displayed in a web view could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

*   **Impact:** Code execution, data manipulation, game logic bypass, Denial of Service (DoS), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in UI contexts.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation rules to ensure user input conforms to expected formats and lengths *before* processing it with libGDX or using it in game logic.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input by encoding or escaping special characters that could be interpreted as commands or code *before* using it in any sensitive operations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid using user input directly in system commands or sensitive operations. Design game logic to minimize reliance on raw, unsanitized user input for critical functions.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** When displaying user input in UI, especially in web-based UI elements, use context-aware output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) to prevent script injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Shader Vulnerabilities (GLSL/SPIR-V)](./attack_surfaces/shader_vulnerabilities__glslspir-v_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws or malicious code within custom shaders (written in GLSL or SPIR-V) that can be exploited to cause resource exhaustion, crashes, or undefined behavior on the GPU, impacting the application's rendering and stability.

*   **libGDX Contribution:** libGDX relies heavily on shaders for graphics rendering and allows developers to write and utilize custom shaders to achieve specific visual effects.  Vulnerabilities in these custom shaders directly impact the rendering pipeline managed by libGDX.

*   **Example:** A developer writes a custom shader with an unintentional infinite loop or excessively complex calculations. When libGDX uses this shader to render game objects, it can overload the GPU, leading to application freeze, crash, or system instability (Denial of Service).  Another example could be a shader that attempts to access memory out of bounds on the GPU due to a programming error, causing crashes or unpredictable rendering artifacts managed by libGDX's rendering pipeline.

*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application freeze/crash, system instability), GPU resource exhaustion, rendering glitches, potentially impacting user experience and application availability.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Shader Code Review:** Implement mandatory and thorough code reviews for all custom shader code. Focus on identifying logic errors, infinite loops, and potentially resource-intensive operations *before* integrating shaders into the libGDX application.
    *   **Shader Testing:** Rigorously test shaders on a variety of target hardware and driver configurations to proactively identify performance bottlenecks, rendering errors, and potential crash scenarios *before* deployment.
    *   **Resource Limits in Shaders:** Design shaders with resource limits in mind. Implement mechanisms to limit shader complexity, loop iterations, and texture access within shaders to prevent excessive GPU load.
    *   **Utilize Shader Validation Tools:** Employ shader validation and debugging tools provided by graphics driver vendors or third-party developers to automatically detect potential errors and vulnerabilities in shader code *during development*.
    *   **Consider Pre-compiled Shaders:** Where possible and applicable to the target platform, pre-compile shaders to catch compilation errors early in the development cycle and potentially optimize shader performance, reducing the risk of runtime shader issues.
