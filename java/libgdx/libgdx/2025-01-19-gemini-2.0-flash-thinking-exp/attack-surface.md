# Attack Surface Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** The application loads and processes various asset types (images, audio, fonts, data files). Maliciously crafted assets can exploit vulnerabilities in the loading or processing logic.
    *   **How LibGDX Contributes:** LibGDX provides APIs for loading and managing assets. If the application loads assets from untrusted sources or doesn't properly validate them, it becomes vulnerable. LibGDX's asset loading mechanisms rely on underlying libraries (e.g., image decoders) which might have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A PNG image file with a crafted header could trigger a buffer overflow in the image decoding library used by LibGDX, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, application crash.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Load assets only from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) for assets.
        *   Sanitize and validate asset data before processing.
        *   Keep LibGDX and its dependencies (including native libraries) updated to patch known vulnerabilities in asset processing.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or isolation techniques when processing untrusted assets.

## Attack Surface: [Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application receives and processes user input from various sources (keyboard, mouse, touch). Malicious or unexpected input can cause unintended behavior or exploit vulnerabilities in the input handling logic.
    *   **How LibGDX Contributes:** LibGDX provides event listeners and input processors to handle user input. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate input before using it to control game logic or access system resources, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:**  A long or specially crafted string entered as a player name could cause a buffer overflow if not handled correctly by the application's logic that uses the LibGDX input.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected game behavior, potential for code execution if input is used in unsafe operations (e.g., command injection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs.
        *   Implement input length limits and character restrictions.
        *   Avoid directly using user input in system calls or other sensitive operations without proper escaping.
        *   Implement rate limiting or input throttling to prevent input flooding attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Networking API Misuse](./attack_surfaces/networking_api_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses LibGDX's networking capabilities, improper implementation or lack of security measures can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How LibGDX Contributes:** LibGDX provides basic networking classes. If developers don't implement secure communication protocols or properly handle network data, the application is at risk.
    *   **Example:**  Using LibGDX's `Net.HttpRequest` without HTTPS to communicate with a server, exposing data to man-in-the-middle attacks. Improperly parsing network responses could lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, unauthorized access, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use secure protocols like HTTPS for network communication.
        *   Validate and sanitize data received from network sources.
        *   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Be cautious about deserializing data from untrusted network sources.
        *   Keep LibGDX and any networking-related dependencies updated.
