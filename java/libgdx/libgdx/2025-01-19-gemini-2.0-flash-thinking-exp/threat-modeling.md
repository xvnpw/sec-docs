# Threat Model Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Injection](./threats/malicious_asset_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could replace legitimate game assets (images, audio, models, etc.) stored locally or on a compromised server with malicious ones. This could happen during download, installation, or even runtime if asset loading mechanisms within LibGDX are insecure. The attacker might modify asset files directly or manipulate the asset delivery process.
*   **Impact:** Displaying offensive or inappropriate content, triggering vulnerabilities in asset parsing libraries within LibGDX leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution, or causing resource exhaustion by injecting overly complex assets.
*   **Affected LibGDX Component:** `com.badlogic.gdx.assets.AssetManager`, specific asset loaders (e.g., `TextureLoader`, `SoundLoader`, `ModelLoader`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement integrity checks for loaded assets using checksums or digital signatures.
    *   Load assets from secure and trusted sources using HTTPS.
    *   Sanitize asset paths to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Ensure proper file permissions on asset directories.
    *   Keep LibGDX and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities in asset loaders.

## Threat: [Exploiting Native Library Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_native_library_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** LibGDX relies on native libraries (e.g., for OpenGL bindings, audio playback) that might contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they can influence the application's interaction with these libraries, potentially through crafted input or by replacing the native libraries themselves.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application, memory corruption, crashes, or information disclosure. This could allow the attacker to gain control of the application or the user's system.
*   **Affected LibGDX Component:** Native backend implementations (platform-specific code within LibGDX), JNI bindings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep LibGDX and its native dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Be aware of security advisories for the underlying native libraries used by LibGDX.
    *   Ensure proper loading and verification of native libraries.

## Threat: [Insecure JNI Usage Leading to Exploits](./threats/insecure_jni_usage_leading_to_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** If the application directly uses JNI (Java Native Interface) to interact with custom native code, vulnerabilities in this code (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs) or insecure JNI practices (e.g., incorrect memory management) can be exploited by an attacker who can influence the data passed to or from the native code through LibGDX's JNI mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, crashes, or information disclosure, similar to native library vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected LibGDX Component:** Application-specific JNI code interacting with LibGDX, JNI bindings within LibGDX if misused.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing JNI code, including careful memory management and input validation.
    *   Thoroughly test and audit any custom native code for vulnerabilities.
    *   Minimize the use of JNI if possible, relying on secure Java implementations.
