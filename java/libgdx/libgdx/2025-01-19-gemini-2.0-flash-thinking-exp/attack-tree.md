## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Input via User Interface [CRITICAL]:** Attackers can try to provide unexpectedly long or specially crafted input to text fields or other UI elements. This is a high-risk path because it's a common attack vector and relatively easy to execute.
        *   **Overflow Input Buffers (Text Fields, etc.):** If the application doesn't properly validate input length or content, attackers can cause buffer overflows, leading to application crashes or potential memory corruption. This is a critical node due to the direct potential for exploitation.
    *   **Exploit Asset Loading via Input [CRITICAL]:** If the application allows users to specify asset paths, attackers can inject malicious paths to load unintended files. This is a high-risk path because it can lead to significant consequences like code execution or access to sensitive files.
        *   **Inject Malicious Payloads in Asset Paths:** Attackers can inject malicious paths to load unintended files, potentially leading to code execution if the loaded file is treated as executable code.
        *   **Trigger Path Traversal Vulnerabilities:** By manipulating asset paths, attackers can access files outside the intended asset directory, potentially exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Graphics Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_graphics_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Exploit Graphics Rendering Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Exploit Texture Loading/Handling [CRITICAL]:** Loading and handling textures can be a source of vulnerabilities. This is a critical node due to the potential for buffer overflows.
        *   **Load Malicious Image Files (e.g., causing buffer overflows):** Maliciously crafted image files could trigger buffer overflows in image decoding libraries, leading to application crashes or potential memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Audio Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_audio_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Exploit Audio Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** This is a critical node due to the potential for buffer overflows in audio decoding.
    *   **Load Malicious Audio Files:** Malicious audio files could exploit vulnerabilities in audio decoding libraries, leading to buffer overflows or application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit File I/O Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_file_io_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Exploit File I/O Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** This entire category is considered high-risk and contains critical nodes due to the potential for code execution and data breaches.
    *   **Manipulate Asset Loading Paths:** Vulnerabilities can arise if the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate paths used for loading assets. This is a high-risk path because it directly enables loading of malicious content.
        *   **Load Malicious Assets from Unexpected Locations:** Attackers can load malicious assets from locations outside the intended asset directory, potentially leading to code execution or data manipulation.
        *   **Bypass Security Checks on Asset Paths:** Attackers can bypass security checks on asset paths, allowing them to load arbitrary files, including potentially executable ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Native Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_native_library_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Exploit Native Library Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:** This is a critical node due to the potential for severe impact, including remote code execution.
    *   **Identify and Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Native Libraries:** LibGDX relies on native libraries for tasks like OpenGL rendering and audio processing (OpenAL). Vulnerabilities in these libraries could be exploited to compromise the application.
        *   **OpenGL Drivers [CRITICAL]:** Vulnerabilities in OpenGL drivers can potentially lead to remote code execution, making this a critical node.
        *   **Audio Libraries (e.g., OpenAL) [CRITICAL]:** Vulnerabilities in audio libraries like OpenAL can also lead to potential code execution, making this a critical node.
