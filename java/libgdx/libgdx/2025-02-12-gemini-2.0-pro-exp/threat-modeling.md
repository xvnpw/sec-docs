# Threat Model Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Threat: [Threat 1: Buffer Overflow in Image Parsing](./threats/threat_1_buffer_overflow_in_image_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPG, GIF) with specially designed data that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in libgdx's image parsing code. When the application attempts to load this image, the overflow overwrites memory, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) on the client's machine, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **libgdx Component Affected:** `gdx-graphics` module, specifically the image loading functions within classes like `Pixmap`, `Texture`, and potentially backend-specific implementations (e.g., LWJGL's image loading libraries).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update libgdx:** Ensure the latest version of libgdx is used, as vulnerabilities are often patched in updates.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate image file headers and dimensions *before* passing them to libgdx's loading functions.  Reject excessively large images or those with suspicious header values.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing tools to test libgdx's image loading functions with a wide variety of malformed and valid image inputs.
    *   **Third-Party Library Auditing:** If libgdx relies on external libraries for image decoding (e.g., stb_image), ensure those libraries are also up-to-date and secure.
    *   **Custom Image Loader (Advanced):** Consider implementing a custom image loader using a memory-safe language or a well-vetted, security-focused image processing library.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Malicious Shader Code Execution](./threats/threat_2_malicious_shader_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious shader file (GLSL) that exploits vulnerabilities in the graphics driver or libgdx's shader handling. This could be through a modding system, user-generated content, or a compromised asset server. The malicious shader could cause crashes, read sensitive data from the GPU, or potentially even achieve limited code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential information disclosure, limited code execution (depending on the driver vulnerability).
*   **libgdx Component Affected:** `gdx-graphics` module, specifically the `ShaderProgram` class and related functions for loading and compiling shaders. The underlying graphics driver is also a key component.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Shader Validation:** Implement strict validation of shader code *before* passing it to libgdx.  This could involve:
        *   **Whitelisting:** Only allow a predefined set of known-safe shader operations.
        *   **Syntax Checking:** Use a GLSL parser to check for syntax errors and potentially dangerous constructs.
        *   **Sandboxing (Difficult):** Explore techniques for sandboxing shader execution (very challenging).
    *   **Limit Shader Complexity:** Restrict the complexity of user-provided shaders (e.g., number of instructions, texture lookups).
    *   **Driver Updates:** Encourage users to keep their graphics drivers up-to-date.
    *   **Avoid User-Provided Shaders:** If possible, avoid allowing users to provide custom shader code.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Path Traversal in File Loading](./threats/threat_3_path_traversal_in_file_loading.md)

*   **Description:** The application loads assets or configuration files based on user-provided input (e.g., a mod name, a level name) without properly sanitizing the input. An attacker provides a path like "../../etc/passwd" to attempt to read arbitrary files on the system.  This leverages libgdx's file handling.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (reading sensitive files), potentially Denial of Service (if overwriting critical files).
*   **libgdx Component Affected:** `gdx-files` module, specifically the `FileHandle` class and its methods for reading and writing files. The application's asset loading logic is also involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Strictly sanitize all user-provided file paths.  Remove any occurrences of "..", "/", and other special characters.
    *   **Whitelist Paths:** Only allow loading files from a predefined, whitelisted set of directories.
    *   **Use Absolute Paths:** Construct absolute file paths based on a known-safe base directory, rather than relying on relative paths.
    *   **Chroot (Advanced):** Consider using a chroot jail to restrict the application's file system access (more complex, platform-dependent).

## Threat: [Threat 4: GWT Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (HTML5 Target)](./threats/threat_4_gwt_cross-site_scripting__xss___html5_target_.md)

*   **Description:** When targeting HTML5 with GWT, the application interacts with JavaScript. If data is passed from Java to JavaScript without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to an XSS vulnerability. This is specific to libgdx's GWT backend.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or deface the application.
*   **libgdx Component Affected:**  The GWT compiler and runtime (part of libgdx's HTML5 backend), and the application's code that interacts with JavaScript using JSNI (JavaScript Native Interface) or other GWT mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize Output:** Use GWT's `SafeHtml` and related classes to ensure that all data passed to JavaScript is properly escaped and cannot be interpreted as code.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    *   **Avoid JSNI:** Minimize the use of JSNI.  Use GWT's built-in mechanisms for interacting with the browser whenever possible.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate any data received from JavaScript *before* using it in the Java code.
