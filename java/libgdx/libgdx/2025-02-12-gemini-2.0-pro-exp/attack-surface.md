# Attack Surface Analysis for libgdx/libgdx

## Attack Surface: [Asset Loading and Parsing](./attack_surfaces/asset_loading_and_parsing.md)

### 1. Asset Loading and Parsing:

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in libgdx's *own* asset loading and parsing routines (images, audio, models, texture atlases, particle effects, fonts, skin files, shaders) through maliciously crafted files. This is the most critical area because libgdx handles these formats directly.
*   **How libgdx Contributes:** libgdx provides its own loaders and parsers for various asset formats (including custom formats like g3dj/g3db), increasing the potential for unique, undiscovered vulnerabilities. It also uses and sometimes bundles external libraries (like FreeType, image decoders, MiniAudio) which may have their own vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted g3db (libgdx 3D model) file that exploits a buffer overflow in libgdx's model loader, leading to arbitrary code execution. Another example: a malformed PNG image exploits a vulnerability in a bundled image decoder, leading to RCE. A third example: a malicious GLSL shader file causes a GPU driver crash (DoS) or potentially exploits a driver vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Information Disclosure (less likely, but possible)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE), High (for DoS and Information Disclosure).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all loaded assets *before* parsing within libgdx. Check file sizes, headers, and internal structure consistency where possible, *before* passing data to libgdx's parsing functions. Reject malformed or suspicious files. This is the *first line of defense*.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Extensively fuzz *all* of libgdx's asset loading and parsing code (especially custom formats and bundled libraries) using tools like AFL, libFuzzer, or Honggfuzz. This is *crucial* for uncovering memory corruption bugs within libgdx itself.
    *   **Sandboxing:** If feasible, isolate asset loading and processing (the libgdx calls) in a separate process or sandbox with restricted privileges. This contains the impact of a successful exploit *even if libgdx is compromised*.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep libgdx and all its *bundled* dependencies up-to-date. Pay close attention to security advisories related to libgdx and its components.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running as administrator/root. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (HTML5/GWT):** For web deployments, use a *strict* CSP to limit the origin of loadable resources, mitigating some attack vectors even if libgdx has vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [(Conditional) Network Communication - *Misuse* of libgdx's `Net` API](./attack_surfaces/_conditional__network_communication_-_misuse_of_libgdx's__net__api.md)

### 2. (Conditional) Network Communication - *Misuse* of libgdx's `Net` API:

*   **Description:** While libgdx's `Net` API is relatively simple, *incorrect usage* can lead to high-severity vulnerabilities. This isn't a direct vulnerability *in* libgdx, but rather a vulnerability arising from how the developer *uses* libgdx's networking features.
*   **How libgdx Contributes:** libgdx provides the `Net` API for basic networking (sockets, HTTP). Misusing this API (e.g., not using HTTPS, failing to validate certificates) creates the vulnerability.
*   **Example:** The game uses libgdx's `Net.sendHttpRequest` to make requests to a backend server, but it uses plain HTTP instead of HTTPS. This allows a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. Another example: the game uses HTTPS, but disables certificate validation (a common mistake), also enabling a MitM attack.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks
    *   Data Tampering
    *   Information Disclosure
*   **Risk Severity:** High (for MitM and data tampering).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for *all* network communication initiated via libgdx's `Net` API. Never use plain HTTP.
    *   **Strict Certificate Validation:** Implement *robust* certificate validation when using HTTPS through libgdx. This includes checking the certificate chain, expiration date, and revocation status. *Do not* disable or bypass certificate checks. Use the platform's built-in certificate verification mechanisms.
    * **Input Validation (Server Side):** Even if using libgdx's Net API correctly, always validate data received from the network on the *server-side*.
