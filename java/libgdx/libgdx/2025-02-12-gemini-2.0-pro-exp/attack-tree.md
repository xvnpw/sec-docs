## Attack Tree Path: [1. Input Validation Failures](./attack_tree_paths/1__input_validation_failures.md)

*   **1.a. Audio Input [HR]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3, OGG) to exploit vulnerabilities in the audio decoding libraries used by libgdx. This can lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues, potentially resulting in RCE.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thoroughly fuzz test audio decoding components.
        *   Use a safer, modern audio library.
        *   Implement robust input sanitization.
        *   Limit supported audio formats.

*   **1.b. Graphics Rendering [HR]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers provide malformed textures, shaders, or model files to trigger vulnerabilities in the graphics rendering pipeline (OpenGL/Vulkan via LWJGL). This can lead to crashes, DoS, or potentially RCE, especially through driver vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Validate size and format of textures and models.
        *   Use shader validation tools.
        *   Fuzz test the rendering pipeline.
        *   Consider using a texture atlas.

*   **1.c. File I/O Handling [HR][CN]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit improper file path handling to read or write arbitrary files on the system, or trigger vulnerabilities in file parsing libraries. This often involves directory traversal attacks (e.g., using `../` in file paths). This is a *critical* vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Never* construct file paths directly from user input.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed file extensions and locations.
        *   Sanitize all file names and paths.
        *   Use a secure parser for configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Resource Exhaustion Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/2__resource_exhaustion_attacks.md)

*   **2.a. Memory Leaks [HR]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers trigger code paths that repeatedly allocate memory without releasing it, especially native resources (e.g., OpenGL textures). This leads to application instability, crashes, and DoS.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use memory profiling tools.
        *   Ensure proper disposal of disposable resources.
        *   Implement resource limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3__deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **3.a. Untrusted Data [HR][CN]**
    *   **Description:** The application deserializes data from untrusted sources (e.g., user-provided files, network connections). This is *extremely* dangerous and a *critical* vulnerability.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   *Avoid deserializing untrusted data whenever possible.*
        *   Use a secure serialization library with whitelisting.
        *   Thoroughly validate deserialized data.
        *   Consider safer data formats (e.g., JSON with schema).

*   **3.b. Crafted Payloads [HR]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers create specially crafted serialized objects that trigger unexpected behavior during deserialization, leading to code execution. This is a direct consequence of deserializing untrusted data.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if untrusted data is deserialized)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Keep serialization library up-to-date.
        *   Use security scanners.
        *   Implement a robust content security policy.
