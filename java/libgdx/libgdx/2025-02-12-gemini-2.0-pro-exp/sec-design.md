# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a free, open-source, and cross-platform game development framework.
*   Empower developers to create games for various platforms (desktop, mobile, web) using a single codebase.
*   Maintain a vibrant and active community around the framework.
*   Ensure the framework remains performant, reliable, and easy to use.
*   Attract both hobbyist and professional game developers.

Business Risks:

*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities in the framework that could be exploited in games built with it.
*   Loss of community trust and developer adoption if the framework is perceived as insecure or unreliable.
*   Legal liabilities arising from vulnerabilities in the framework leading to data breaches or other security incidents in deployed games.
*   Difficulty attracting and retaining contributors if the development process is not secure.
*   Inability to keep up with platform updates and security best practices, leading to compatibility issues and vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: The project uses pull requests on GitHub, which implies code reviews are part of the development process. (Described in GitHub repository's contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Community involvement: A large and active community can help identify and report security issues. (Evident from the GitHub repository's activity and issue tracker).
*   security control: Use of OpenGL: The project uses OpenGL for rendering, which is a well-established and generally secure graphics API. (Described in the project documentation).
*   security control: Issue tracking: The project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests, which can include security vulnerabilities. (Evident from the GitHub repository).
*   security control: Static analysis: Based on the presence of SpotBugs and Error Prone configurations, static analysis is used to identify potential bugs and vulnerabilities. (Described in build.gradle files).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries: The framework depends on several third-party libraries (LWJGL, FreeType, MobiVM, etc.), which introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in those libraries.
*   accepted risk: Cross-platform compatibility: Supporting multiple platforms increases the attack surface and complexity of security management.
*   accepted risk: Open-source nature: While beneficial for transparency and community contributions, it also means the code is publicly available for scrutiny by potential attackers.
*   accepted risk: User-provided input: Games built with the framework will likely handle user input, which is a common source of vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. The framework itself must also handle user-provided data (e.g., assets).
*   accepted risk: Limited formal security audits: There's no indication of regular, formal security audits being conducted.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) process, including threat modeling, security training for developers, and regular security testing.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of the framework.
*   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
*   security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other relevant security headers for the web (GWT/HTML) backend.
*   security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using the framework.
*   security control: Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to manage and monitor vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   security control: Consider using fuzzing techniques to test the framework's input handling.
*   security control: Implement robust input validation and sanitization throughout the framework.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Not directly applicable to the framework itself, but guidance should be provided to developers on implementing secure authentication mechanisms in their games.

*   Authorization:
    *   Not directly applicable to the framework itself, but guidance should be provided to developers on implementing secure authorization mechanisms in their games.

*   Input Validation:
    *   The framework must validate all input it receives, including data from files, network connections, and user interfaces.
    *   Validation should be based on a whitelist approach, accepting only known good input.
    *   Specific validation rules should be implemented for different data types (e.g., strings, numbers, file paths).
    *   The framework should handle invalid input gracefully, without crashing or exposing sensitive information.

*   Cryptography:
    *   The framework should provide secure defaults for cryptographic operations if used.
    *   Developers should be advised to use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Key management should be handled securely, following best practices.
    *   If the framework handles sensitive data, it should be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

        Gradle -- Runs --> Checkstyle
        Gradle -- Runs --> Javadoc
        Gradle -- Produces --> Artifacts
    end
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  A build is triggered, either manually or automatically (e.g., on a push to the repository).  libGDX uses Gradle as build system.
3.  The Gradle build system retrieves the source code and dependencies.
4.  Static analysis tools (SpotBugs, Error Prone, Checkstyle) are run to identify potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and style violations.
5.  Javadoc is generated to create API documentation.
6.  The code is compiled, and tests are executed.
7.  If all steps are successful, build artifacts are produced (JAR files, APK files, etc., depending on the target platform).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Use of Git for version control: Allows tracking changes, reverting to previous versions, and identifying who made specific changes.
*   security control: Use of Gradle as a build system: Provides a standardized and reproducible build process.
*   security control: Dependency management: Gradle manages dependencies, but it's crucial to use secure repositories and monitor for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries (using SCA tools).
*   security control: Static analysis (SpotBugs, Error Prone, Checkstyle): Helps identify potential security issues early in the development process.
*   security control: Automated build process: Reduces the risk of manual errors and ensures consistency.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Game development workflow: Ensuring developers can efficiently and securely build games using the framework.
*   Distribution of games: Protecting the integrity and authenticity of games built with libGDX.
*   Community engagement: Maintaining a secure and trustworthy environment for the libGDX community.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   Source code: Medium sensitivity. While open-source, unauthorized modifications could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   Third-party library dependencies: Medium sensitivity. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be exploited.
*   Developer credentials (e.g., signing keys): High sensitivity. Compromise could allow attackers to distribute malicious games.
*   User data (in games built with libGDX): Varies depending on the game. Developers should be guided to handle user data securely. The framework itself should minimize the data it handles directly.
*   Issue tracker data: Low to medium sensitivity. Contains information about bugs and potential vulnerabilities.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
