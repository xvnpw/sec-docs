Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving `ggplot2` and with high or critical risk severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Formula Injection in Aesthetic Mappings

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code or commands into the formulas used to define aesthetic mappings within `ggplot2` (e.g., in `aes()` function).
    *   **How ggplot2 Contributes:** `ggplot2` uses R formulas to specify how data columns map to visual aesthetics. If user input directly influences these formulas without sanitization, it can lead to the execution of unintended R code.
    *   **Example:** If a user can control the formula for the `x` aesthetic, they might inject something like `eval(parse(text = 'system("malicious_command")'))` (though this is a simplified example). More realistically, it could involve accessing or manipulating data in unintended ways within the R environment.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially Arbitrary Code Execution (within the R environment), information disclosure, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if direct execution is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Direct User Input in Formulas:**  Do not allow users to directly input or construct the formulas used in `aes()`.
        *   **Abstraction Layers:**  Create abstraction layers or predefined mappings that users can select from, rather than directly manipulating formulas.
        *   **Secure Formula Construction:** If dynamic formula construction is necessary, use safe and controlled methods to build them, avoiding direct string concatenation of user input.

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsanitized Input in Labels and Titles (leading to XSS in SVG)

    *   **Description:** User-provided input used for plot titles, axis labels, or legend labels is not properly sanitized, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts, especially when rendering to SVG format.
    *   **How ggplot2 Contributes:** `ggplot2` allows setting titles and labels using functions like `ggtitle()`, `xlab()`, `ylab()`, and `labs()`. If the application directly uses unsanitized user input in these functions and renders to SVG, it creates an XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A user provides a plot title like `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`. When the plot is rendered as SVG and viewed in a browser, the script will execute.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if rendering to SVG and displayed in a web context).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all user-provided text used in labels and titles before rendering the plot, especially when using SVG. Use appropriate escaping functions for HTML entities.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Consider Raster Formats:** If SVG is not strictly necessary, consider using raster image formats (like PNG or JPEG) which are less susceptible to XSS.
