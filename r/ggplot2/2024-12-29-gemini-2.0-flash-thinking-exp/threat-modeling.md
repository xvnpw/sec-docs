* **Threat:** Malicious SVG Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious data that, when processed by `ggplot2` and rendered as an SVG image, includes embedded JavaScript or other active content. When a user's browser renders this SVG, the malicious script could execute, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user. This threat directly arises from `ggplot2`'s capability to generate SVG output and the potential for embedding malicious content within that output.
    * **Impact:** If successful, this could lead to account compromise, data theft, or further attacks on the user's system.
    * **ggplot2 Component Affected:** The SVG output functionality of `ggplot2`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Sanitize SVG Output:** Implement server-side sanitization of the generated SVG content before serving it to the client. Remove or neutralize any potentially malicious script tags or event handlers.
        * **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Consider Alternative Output Formats:** If interactivity is not strictly required, consider using safer image formats like PNG or JPEG, which do not inherently support embedded scripts.
