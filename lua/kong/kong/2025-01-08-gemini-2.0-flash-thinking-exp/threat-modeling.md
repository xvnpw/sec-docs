# Threat Model Analysis for kong/kong

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation/Exploitation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installationexploitation.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could install a malicious plugin through the Kong Admin API (if compromised or poorly secured) or exploit a vulnerability in an existing plugin. This could involve injecting malicious code, manipulating request/response data, or gaining unauthorized access to Kong's internal functions and data.
- **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the Kong gateway, potential access to sensitive data being proxied, disruption of service, and the ability to pivot to internal networks.
- **Affected Component:** Plugin System, Individual Plugins, Admin API
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict controls over plugin installation and management.
    - Regularly audit installed plugins and their configurations.
    - Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions.
    - Consider using a plugin vetting process before deployment.
    - Implement resource limits and sandboxing for plugins where possible.
    - Secure the Admin API with strong authentication and authorization.

## Threat: [Unsecured Admin API Access](./threats/unsecured_admin_api_access.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kong Admin API due to weak credentials, lack of authentication, or exposure to the public internet. This allows them to manipulate Kong's configuration, install malicious plugins, and disrupt service.
- **Impact:** Full control over the Kong gateway, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and the ability to compromise backend services.
- **Affected Component:** Admin API
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure the Admin API with strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, mTLS).
    - Restrict access to the Admin API to authorized networks or IP addresses.
    - Disable the Admin API on public interfaces if not necessary.
    - Implement rate limiting on the Admin API to prevent brute-force attacks.
    - Regularly audit Admin API access logs.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection/Manipulation](./threats/configuration_injectionmanipulation.md)

- **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in how Kong handles configuration data or gain unauthorized access to the configuration store. This could allow them to inject malicious configurations, modify routing rules, alter authentication settings, or disable security features.
- **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls, redirecting traffic to malicious endpoints, exposing sensitive data, and disrupting service.
- **Affected Component:** Configuration Management, Data Store (PostgreSQL, Cassandra), Routing Logic, Authentication Modules
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict access controls on Kong's configuration files and data store.
    - Use secure methods for managing and deploying Kong configurations.
    - Regularly audit configuration changes.
    - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; use secrets management solutions.

## Threat: [Data Store Compromise](./threats/data_store_compromise.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the underlying data store used by Kong (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cassandra). This grants access to sensitive configuration data, plugin configurations, and potentially cached credentials.
- **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data, potential for manipulating Kong's behavior, and the possibility of extracting credentials.
- **Affected Component:** Data Store (PostgreSQL, Cassandra)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure the data store with strong authentication and authorization.
    - Encrypt data at rest and in transit for the data store connection.
    - Implement network segmentation to restrict access to the data store.
    - Regularly patch and update the data store software.

## Threat: [Authentication/Authorization Bypass](./threats/authenticationauthorization_bypass.md)

- **Description:** An attacker finds a way to bypass Kong's authentication or authorization mechanisms, gaining access to protected resources without proper credentials. This could be due to vulnerabilities in authentication plugins, misconfigurations, or weaknesses in the authentication flow.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected APIs and backend services.
- **Affected Component:** Authentication Plugins, Authorization Plugins, Proxy Module
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Choose and configure authentication and authorization plugins carefully.
    - Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization configurations.
    - Enforce strong password policies if using basic authentication.
    - Utilize robust authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.

## Threat: [Upstream Service Impersonation (if Kong is compromised)](./threats/upstream_service_impersonation__if_kong_is_compromised_.md)

- **Description:** If the Kong gateway is compromised, an attacker could use it to impersonate legitimate upstream services, potentially tricking clients or other internal systems.
- **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the impersonated service, and loss of trust.
- **Affected Component:** Proxy Module
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Focus on preventing Kong compromise through the mitigations listed above.
    - Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) between Kong and upstream services for strong authentication.
    - Monitor traffic patterns for unusual activity.
