## Attack Tree Path: [1. HIGH RISK: Exploit Kong's Core Functionality -> Bypass Authentication or Authorization (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__high_risk_exploit_kong's_core_functionality_-_bypass_authentication_or_authorization__critical_no_98254de3.md)

This high-risk path focuses on circumventing Kong's intended security measures for controlling access to the backend application. Successful exploitation at this stage is a critical node as it directly leads to unauthorized access.

*   **HIGH RISK: Misconfiguration of Authentication Plugins:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in how authentication plugins are set up. This could involve:
        *   Leveraging default or easily guessable secrets for JWT (JSON Web Token) verification.
        *   Using known weak or compromised API keys.
        *   Bypassing improperly configured OAuth 2.0 flows, such as missing or incorrect redirect URI validation.
    *   **Consequences:** Successful exploitation grants attackers the ability to forge valid authentication credentials, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users and access protected resources.

*   **HIGH RISK: Authorization Bypass via Request Manipulation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious HTTP requests designed to bypass Kong's authorization checks. This might involve:
        *   Manipulating request headers or parameters that Kong uses for authorization decisions.
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in Kong's routing logic or how it maps routes to services.
        *   Sending requests with unexpected or malformed data that confuses Kong's authorization mechanisms.
    *   **Consequences:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized for, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. CRITICAL NODE: Compromise Kong's Management Plane (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__critical_node_compromise_kong's_management_plane__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents gaining control over Kong's administrative interface, which provides extensive control over its configuration and operation. Successful compromise here is a critical node as it grants the attacker significant power.

*   **HIGH RISK: Exploit Kong Admin API Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: Unauthenticated Access to Admin API:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly access the Kong Admin API without providing any authentication credentials. This is possible if the API is exposed without proper security measures.
        *   **Consequences:** Full administrative control over Kong, allowing the attacker to modify configurations, deploy malicious plugins, and potentially disrupt or compromise the entire system.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Gain Access to Kong's Configuration:**
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: Exploiting Insecure Storage of Configuration:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain access to Kong's configuration files or environment variables where sensitive information is stored insecurely. This could involve:
            *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the server or container where Kong is running.
            *   Accessing misconfigured or unprotected storage locations.
            *   Leveraging default or weak credentials for accessing configuration management systems.
        *   **Consequences:** Exposure of sensitive data such as database credentials, API keys for upstream services, and other secrets, which can be used for further attacks on Kong or related systems.

*   **CRITICAL NODE: Abuse of Kong's Plugin Management:**
    *   **CRITICAL NODE: Deploy Malicious Plugins:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage compromised administrative access or vulnerabilities in the plugin management system to deploy malicious plugins. These plugins can be custom-built or modified versions of legitimate plugins.
        *   **Consequences:** Complete control over Kong's traffic flow, allowing attackers to intercept requests, modify responses, inject malicious code into responses, exfiltrate data, or even execute arbitrary code on the Kong server. This represents a severe compromise of the entire gateway.
