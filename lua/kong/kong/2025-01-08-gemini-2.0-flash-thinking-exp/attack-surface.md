# Attack Surface Analysis for kong/kong

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Admin API Access](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_admin_api_access.md)

**Description:** The administrative interface of Kong is accessible without proper authentication or authorization.

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong provides the Admin API for configuration and management. If not secured, it becomes a direct entry point.

**Example:** The Admin API is exposed on a public IP address with default credentials, allowing an attacker to gain full control over the Kong instance.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable public access to the Admin API by binding it to a private network interface.
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Admin API, such as mTLS (mutual TLS) or API keys with proper rotation policies.
* Utilize Kong's built-in RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to restrict access to specific Admin API endpoints based on user roles.
* Employ network segmentation and firewalls to limit access to the Admin API to authorized networks or individuals.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within installed Kong plugins (official or third-party).

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong's architecture relies on plugins for extending functionality. Vulnerabilities in these plugins directly impact Kong's security.

**Example:** An outdated authentication plugin has a known vulnerability allowing attackers to bypass authentication and access protected APIs.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Kong and all installed plugins to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Carefully evaluate the security reputation and trustworthiness of third-party plugins before installation.
* Implement input validation and sanitization within plugin configurations and custom plugins to prevent injection attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Data Plane (Proxy) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/data_plane__proxy__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within Kong's core proxying engine, allowing for exploitation during request processing.

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong acts as the central proxy, and vulnerabilities in its request handling can be exploited to bypass security or impact backend services.

**Example:** A bug in Kong's HTTP header parsing allows an attacker to inject malicious headers that are processed by Kong, leading to unintended consequences.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Kong updated to benefit from security patches in the core proxy.
* Carefully configure Kong's request and response transformations to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Kong Manager/Dashboard Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_kong_managerdashboard_configuration.md)

**Description:** The Kong Manager or any other administrative dashboard is not properly secured, allowing unauthorized access or manipulation of Kong's configuration.

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong Manager provides a UI for managing Kong. If its access controls are weak, it becomes a vulnerability.

**Example:** The Kong Manager interface is accessible without authentication, allowing an attacker to modify Kong configurations and disrupt services.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Kong Manager interface.
* Ensure the Kong Manager is running on HTTPS with a valid certificate.
* Restrict access to the Kong Manager to authorized users and networks.

## Attack Surface: [Database Compromise via Kong](./attack_surfaces/database_compromise_via_kong.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Kong's interaction with its underlying database (PostgreSQL or Cassandra) can lead to database compromise, exposing Kong's configuration.

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong stores its configuration in the database. If this connection is insecure or Kong has database-related vulnerabilities, the database is at risk.

**Example:** SQL injection vulnerabilities through misconfigured Kong entities could allow an attacker to access or modify the Kong database.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the database server itself with strong authentication and network restrictions.
* Use strong, unique credentials for Kong's database connection.
* Limit Kong's database user privileges to the minimum required for its operation.

## Attack Surface: [Service Mesh Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/service_mesh_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security weaknesses in how Kong integrates with a service mesh can be exploited to bypass Kong's security controls.

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong's role as an ingress controller in a service mesh introduces potential vulnerabilities in the integration layer.

**Example:** Misconfigurations in Kong's service mesh integration allow traffic to bypass Kong's authentication and authorization policies.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure Kong's integration with the service mesh, ensuring proper authentication and authorization are in place.
* Regularly review and audit the service mesh configuration and Kong's integration points.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_management.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or TLS certificates are stored insecurely within Kong's configuration.

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong requires managing various secrets. If this is done insecurely, it creates an attack surface.

**Example:** API keys for upstream services are stored in plain text within Kong's route configurations, allowing an attacker with access to the configuration to steal these keys.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Kong's built-in secrets management features or integrate with dedicated secrets management solutions.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/custom_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within custom Kong plugins developed by the team.

**How Kong Contributes:** Kong's extensibility allows for custom plugins, which, if not developed securely, introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom authentication plugin has a coding error that allows for authentication bypass through a specific request parameter processed by Kong.

**Impact:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin's function)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices during custom plugin development.
* Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews for all custom plugins.
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization within custom plugins.
