# Attack Surface Analysis for kong/kong

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Admin API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_admin_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Exposure of the Kong Admin API without proper authentication allows unauthorized users to manage and control the Kong gateway.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong provides the Admin API as the primary management interface. Lack of enforced authentication directly exposes this critical control plane.
*   **Example:** An attacker accesses the Admin API endpoint (`/config`) without credentials and disables security plugins, reconfigures routing to intercept traffic, or deploys malicious plugins to compromise backend services.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Kong gateway, complete control over routing and plugins, potential compromise of all backend services managed by Kong, data breaches, and severe service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Admin API Authentication:**  **Always** enable and enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the Admin API. Utilize RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for granular permission management.
    *   **Network Segmentation and Access Control:** Restrict network access to the Admin API to a dedicated management network or trusted IP ranges using firewalls and network policies. Isolate the Admin API network from public internet access.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant Admin API access only to authorized personnel and roles with the minimum necessary permissions. Regularly review and audit access rights.
    *   **Disable Public Admin API Endpoint:**  Never expose the Admin API directly to the public internet. If remote management is required, use secure channels like VPNs or bastion hosts with strong multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (Third-Party or Custom)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__third-party_or_custom_.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities within Kong plugins, whether from third-party marketplaces or custom-developed, can be exploited to compromise the gateway's security and potentially backend services.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong's core architecture relies heavily on plugins for extending functionality. This plugin ecosystem, while powerful, inherently introduces attack surface if plugins are not secure.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable third-party authentication plugin contains a code injection flaw. An attacker exploits this flaw by crafting a malicious request that executes arbitrary code on the Kong gateway, potentially gaining shell access or exfiltrating sensitive configuration data.
*   **Impact:** Code execution on the Kong gateway, authentication and authorization bypass, data breaches (if plugins handle sensitive data), denial of service, and potential lateral movement to backend services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Plugin Vetting and Security Audits:** Implement a mandatory security review process for all plugins before deployment. This includes static and dynamic code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.
    *   **Prioritize Official and Trusted Plugins:** Favor official Kong plugins or plugins from reputable and well-maintained sources with established security track records.
    *   **Maintain Plugin Updates and Patching:** Establish a process for regularly updating plugins to the latest versions to address known security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories for plugins in use.
    *   **Secure Plugin Development Lifecycle:** For custom plugins, enforce secure coding practices, conduct thorough code reviews, and implement comprehensive security testing throughout the development lifecycle.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing and Isolation:** Leverage Kong's plugin sandboxing capabilities to limit the potential impact of vulnerabilities within individual plugins. Implement resource limits and restrict plugin access to sensitive system resources.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Kong Misconfiguration or Plugins](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_kong_misconfiguration_or_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Kong, due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in plugins, can be exploited to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing attackers to make requests to internal resources or external systems from the Kong server.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong's core proxy functionality and the flexibility of plugins to handle and manipulate requests can be misused to initiate SSRF if input validation and network controls are insufficient.
*   **Example:** A custom logging plugin is poorly designed and allows users to specify the logging endpoint URL via a request header. An attacker crafts a request with a header pointing to an internal service (e.g., internal metadata service, database server) and retrieves sensitive information or triggers actions on that internal service.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal network resources, data exfiltration from internal systems, potential compromise of backend infrastructure, escalation of privileges within the internal network, and denial of service against internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization within Kong plugins and custom Lua logic to prevent manipulation of URLs, hostnames, or IP addresses that could be used for SSRF.
    *   **Restrict Outbound Network Access (Network Segmentation):** Configure firewalls and network policies to strictly limit Kong's outbound network access. Only allow Kong to connect to explicitly required backend services and external dependencies. Deny access to internal networks and sensitive infrastructure unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:** Design plugins with the principle of least privilege in mind. Minimize the network access and permissions required by plugins. Avoid plugins that require unrestricted outbound network access if possible.
    *   **Regular Security Configuration Reviews:** Conduct periodic security configuration reviews of Kong and its plugins to identify and remediate potential SSRF vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations or plugin flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion in Kong](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion_in_kong.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Kong itself to exhaust its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), leading to a denial of service for all services proxied by Kong.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong, as a central proxy, becomes a single point of failure if its resources are exhausted. Vulnerabilities in request processing, plugin execution, or rate limiting bypass can be leveraged for DoS.
*   **Example:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in Kong's request parsing logic that causes excessive CPU consumption when processing specially crafted requests. By sending a flood of these requests, the attacker overloads Kong, making it unresponsive and disrupting all API traffic.
*   **Impact:** Complete service disruption for all APIs managed by Kong, application unavailability, cascading failures to backend services, and potential infrastructure instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Security Patching and Updates:** Keep Kong and its underlying components (Nginx, LuaJIT) updated with the latest security patches to address known DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Capacity Planning:** Implement comprehensive monitoring of Kong's resource utilization (CPU, memory, network). Conduct capacity planning to ensure Kong has sufficient resources to handle expected traffic and potential attack scenarios.
    *   **Robust Rate Limiting and Traffic Control:** Properly configure and enforce rate limiting, connection limits, and request timeouts to prevent malicious traffic from overwhelming Kong. Regularly test rate limiting configurations under stress.
    *   **Input Validation and ReDoS Prevention:** Implement strict input validation to prevent attacks like Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) that can consume excessive CPU resources. Carefully review and optimize regular expressions used in Kong configurations and plugins.
    *   **Load Balancing and High Availability:** Deploy Kong in a highly available and load-balanced configuration to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks on a single instance. Distribute traffic across multiple Kong nodes to improve resilience.
