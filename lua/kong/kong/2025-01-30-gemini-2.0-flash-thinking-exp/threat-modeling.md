## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in installed Kong plugins (official or community). This could be through known vulnerabilities in outdated plugins or zero-day exploits. Exploits can lead to authentication bypass, information disclosure, remote code execution, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to full server compromise and service disruption.
*   **Kong Component Affected:** Plugins (Specific Plugin Modules, Plugin Execution Environment)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and select plugins from trusted sources.
    *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Regularly audit installed plugins and their configurations.
    *   Implement plugin sandboxing or isolation if available and applicable.
    *   Monitor plugin vulnerability databases and security advisories.

## Threat: [Request Smuggling/Bypass](./threats/request_smugglingbypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker crafts malicious HTTP requests that are interpreted differently by Kong and the backend service. This can allow them to bypass Kong's security controls and send requests directly to the backend, potentially bypassing authentication, authorization, or rate limiting.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing Kong's security measures, direct access to backend services, unauthorized actions, data breaches.
*   **Kong Component Affected:** Proxy (Request Parsing, Request Forwarding)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure consistent HTTP parsing behavior between Kong and backend services by using standard compliant configurations.
    *   Harden backend services against direct access and rely on Kong for security enforcement.
    *   Regularly test for request smuggling vulnerabilities using security scanning tools and penetration testing.
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Kong to detect and block malicious requests.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Kong Proxy](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_kong_proxy.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker floods Kong with a large volume of requests or crafted malicious requests designed to consume Kong's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can lead to Kong becoming unresponsive and unable to proxy legitimate traffic, causing service disruption.
*   **Impact:** Unavailability of APIs and backend services protected by Kong, service disruption, reputational damage.
*   **Kong Component Affected:** Proxy (Request Handling, Connection Management)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and request size limits in Kong to control traffic volume.
    *   Configure connection timeouts and resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   Deploy Kong behind a load balancer for scalability and resilience.
    *   Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Kong to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for Kong's resource usage and performance to detect and respond to DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Database Compromise](./threats/database_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to the database used by Kong (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cassandra). This could be through exploiting database vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or network access misconfigurations.
