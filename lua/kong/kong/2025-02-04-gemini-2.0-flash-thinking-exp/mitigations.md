# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kong/kong

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication and RBAC for Admin API](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_and_rbac_for_admin_api.md)

*   Description:
    *   Step 1: Choose a strong authentication mechanism for the Admin API within Kong. Kong supports various plugins like Basic Authentication, Key Authentication, or integration with external identity providers (LDAP, OAuth 2.0, etc. via plugins). For enhanced security, consider using a plugin that supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) if available or integrate with an external MFA provider.
    *   Step 2: Configure the chosen authentication plugin for the Admin API within Kong. This typically involves setting up credentials (usernames/passwords, API keys) directly in Kong or configuring the integration with the identity provider through Kong's plugin settings.
    *   Step 3: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Kong Enterprise's built-in RBAC or a suitable plugin within Kong.
        *   Define roles with specific permissions related to Kong administration directly within Kong's RBAC configuration (e.g., read-only access, plugin management, route configuration).
        *   Assign roles to administrative users within Kong's RBAC system, based on their responsibilities and the principle of least privilege.
    *   Step 4: Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions configured within Kong RBAC to ensure they remain appropriate and secure.
    *   Step 5: Disable default administrative accounts within Kong if they exist and are not needed.
*   List of Threats Mitigated:
    *   Unauthorized Access to Admin API (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized individuals, even from within the allowed network, from accessing and controlling the Admin API *through Kong's authentication mechanisms*.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity): Limits the impact of compromised accounts by ensuring users only have the necessary permissions for their roles *defined and enforced within Kong*, preventing them from performing actions they are not authorized for.
*   Impact:
    *   Unauthorized Access to Admin API: High Risk Reduction - Adds a strong layer of authentication *within Kong*, making it significantly harder for attackers to gain access even if they bypass network-level controls.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the potential damage from compromised accounts by limiting their capabilities *through Kong's RBAC*.
*   Currently Implemented:
    *   Basic Authentication is enabled for the Admin API using username/password credentials configured within Kong.
    *   Kong Enterprise RBAC is partially configured within Kong with basic roles for "admin" and "read-only" users.
*   Missing Implementation:
    *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not yet implemented for Admin API access *within Kong*.
    *   RBAC is not fully granular *within Kong*. More specific roles need to be defined within Kong RBAC to further restrict permissions based on tasks (e.g., plugin management role, routing role).
    *   Regular audits of RBAC configurations *within Kong* are not yet automated or scheduled.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Kong and Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_kong_and_plugins.md)

*   Description:
    *   Step 1: Establish a regular schedule for checking for updates to Kong Gateway and all installed plugins *within Kong*. This could be weekly or monthly, depending on your risk tolerance and the frequency of updates.
    *   Step 2: Subscribe to Kong's security advisories and release notes (available on the Kong website and GitHub). This will provide notifications about security vulnerabilities and new releases *related to Kong and its plugins*.
    *   Step 3: When updates are available, review the release notes and security advisories to understand the changes and any security fixes included *for Kong and its plugins*.
    *   Step 4: Test updates in a non-production (staging or testing) environment before applying them to production *Kong instances*. This includes functional testing and regression testing to ensure the updates do not introduce new issues or break existing functionality *within Kong and its plugin ecosystem*.
    *   Step 5: Implement a process for applying updates to production environments in a controlled and timely manner *for Kong instances*. This might involve rolling updates or blue/green deployments to minimize downtime *of Kong*.
    *   Step 6: After applying updates, verify that Kong and plugins are running correctly and that the security fixes are effectively implemented *within the updated Kong environment*.
*   List of Threats Mitigated:
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity): Outdated Kong and plugins are vulnerable to publicly known exploits. Regularly updating patches these vulnerabilities, preventing attackers from leveraging them *against Kong itself or through Kong plugins*.
*   Impact:
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High Risk Reduction - Directly addresses the risk of exploitation by eliminating known vulnerabilities *in Kong and its plugins*.
*   Currently Implemented:
    *   A manual process is in place to check for Kong updates monthly.
    *   Updates are tested in a staging environment before production deployment *of Kong*.
*   Missing Implementation:
    *   The update process is not fully automated *for Kong and plugins*.
    *   Subscription to Kong security advisories is in place, but notifications are not automatically integrated into the update workflow *for Kong updates*.
    *   Plugin updates are not tracked as systematically as Kong core updates *within the Kong update process*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Connection Limits *in Kong*](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_connection_limits_in_kong.md)

*   Description:
    *   Step 1: Analyze your application's expected traffic patterns and backend service capacity to determine appropriate rate limiting thresholds and connection limits *to be configured in Kong*.
    *   Step 2: Implement rate limiting policies in Kong using plugins like the `rate-limiting` plugin *within Kong*.
        *   Configure rate limits at different levels *within Kong*:
            *   **Global Rate Limiting:** Set a global rate limit for the entire Kong instance to protect against overall system overload *at the Kong level*.
            *   **Route/Service Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limits to specific routes or services *within Kong* to protect critical backend services or high-value endpoints *routed through Kong*.
            *   **Consumer Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limits per consumer (authenticated user or application) *using Kong's consumer management features* to prevent abuse by individual users or applications *accessing services through Kong*.
        *   Choose appropriate rate limiting strategies (e.g., fixed window, sliding window) and configure limits based on requests per second, minute, or hour *within Kong's rate limiting plugin settings*.
    *   Step 3: Configure connection limits in Kong using the `proxy_listen` directive in `kong.conf` or environment variables *for Kong's proxy listener*.
        *   Set `proxy_listen` to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections Kong will accept *at its proxy interface*.
    *   Step 4: Monitor Kong's rate limiting and connection limit metrics *provided by Kong* to ensure they are effective and adjust thresholds as needed based on traffic patterns and performance *observed by Kong*.
*   List of Threats Mitigated:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity): Rate limiting and connection limits *in Kong* prevent attackers from overwhelming Kong and backend services with excessive requests, mitigating both volumetric and resource exhaustion DoS attacks *targeting Kong or backend services via Kong*.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity): Rate limiting *in Kong* can slow down brute-force attacks against authentication endpoints *protected by Kong* by limiting the number of login attempts within a given timeframe.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity): Prevents legitimate traffic spikes or misbehaving clients from consuming excessive resources *of Kong and backend services* and impacting the availability of the application *behind Kong*.
*   Impact:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the impact of DoS attacks by preventing resource exhaustion and maintaining service availability under attack *at the Kong layer and for backend services*.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Medium Risk Reduction - Makes brute-force attacks less efficient and increases the time required for successful attacks, giving more time for detection and response *at the Kong level*.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves system stability and resilience by preventing resource depletion from excessive traffic *handled by Kong*.
*   Currently Implemented:
    *   Basic rate limiting is implemented globally for all routes using the `rate-limiting` plugin *in Kong*, with a moderate request limit per minute.
    *   Connection limits are configured in `kong.conf` with a default value *for Kong*.
*   Missing Implementation:
    *   Rate limiting is not yet configured at the route or service level for specific critical endpoints *within Kong*.
    *   Consumer-based rate limiting is not implemented *in Kong*.
    *   Rate limiting thresholds are based on initial estimates and have not been dynamically adjusted based on traffic analysis and performance monitoring *of Kong metrics*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Logging and Error Handling *in Kong*](./mitigation_strategies/secure_logging_and_error_handling_in_kong.md)

*   Description:
    *   Step 1: Configure Kong logging to minimize the logging of sensitive data *within Kong's logging configuration*.
        *   Review the default log formats *in Kong* and identify any sensitive fields that might be logged (e.g., request bodies, headers containing authentication tokens, PII).
        *   Customize log formats *within Kong* to exclude or redact sensitive information. Use Kong's log formatting options or plugins to achieve this *within Kong's logging system*.
    *   Step 2: Securely store and manage Kong logs *generated by Kong*. This step is less about Kong configuration itself, but crucial for handling Kong's output securely.
    *   Step 3: Implement secure error handling in Kong *using Kong's error handling mechanisms*.
        *   Customize Kong's error responses *within Kong's configuration* to avoid leaking sensitive information to clients (e.g., internal server paths, database connection details, stack traces).
        *   Provide generic error messages to clients *through Kong's error responses* while logging detailed error information securely for debugging and monitoring purposes *via Kong's logging*.
        *   Use Kong's error handling plugins or custom error handlers *within Kong* to control the content of error responses.
*   List of Threats Mitigated:
    *   Data Exposure through Logs (Medium Severity): Sensitive information logged unintentionally *by Kong* can be exposed if logs are compromised or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    *   Information Leakage in Error Responses (Low to Medium Severity): Verbose error responses *from Kong* can reveal internal system details to attackers, aiding in reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation.
*   Impact:
    *   Data Exposure through Logs: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of sensitive data compromise through log files *generated by Kong* by minimizing the logging of sensitive information and securing log storage.
    *   Information Leakage in Error Responses: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Prevents attackers from gaining valuable information about the system's internal workings through error messages *generated by Kong*.
*   Currently Implemented:
    *   Basic logging is enabled in Kong, writing logs to standard output *from Kong*.
    *   Error responses are the default Kong error responses.
*   Missing Implementation:
    *   Log formats are not customized *in Kong* to redact sensitive data.
    *   Logs are not stored in a secure logging backend *for Kong logs*. They are currently only available in container logs, which are less secure and harder to manage long-term *for Kong logs*.
    *   Access control and encryption are not implemented for logs *generated by Kong*.
    *   Error responses are not customized *in Kong* to prevent information leakage.
