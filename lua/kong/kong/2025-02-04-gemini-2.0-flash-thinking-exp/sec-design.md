# BUSINESS POSTURE

Kong API Gateway is a cloud-native, fast, scalable, and extensible API Gateway and service mesh. It is designed to manage and secure APIs and microservices, providing features like request routing, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and observability.

Business priorities and goals for adopting Kong API Gateway typically include:

- Centralized API Management: To provide a single point of entry for all APIs, simplifying management and governance.
- Enhanced Security: To secure APIs with authentication, authorization, and other security policies, protecting backend services from unauthorized access and attacks.
- Improved Performance and Scalability: To handle high traffic volumes and ensure low latency for API requests.
- Increased Observability: To gain insights into API traffic, performance, and errors for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Developer Productivity: To simplify API consumption and integration for developers.
- Modernization of Infrastructure: To adopt a cloud-native architecture and microservices.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

- Availability and Reliability: Downtime of the API Gateway can disrupt all dependent services and business processes.
- Security Breaches: Vulnerabilities in the API Gateway or misconfigurations can lead to unauthorized access to backend services and sensitive data.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Poorly configured or overloaded API Gateway can become a bottleneck, impacting application performance.
- Data Loss or Corruption: Misconfigurations or failures in the API Gateway could potentially lead to data loss or corruption during request processing.
- Compliance Violations: Failure to properly secure and manage APIs can lead to non-compliance with industry regulations and data privacy laws.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Authentication and Authorization Plugins: Kong offers various plugins for authentication (e.g., Key Authentication, JWT, OAuth 2.0) and authorization (e.g., ACL, RBAC) to secure APIs. Implemented as Kong plugins.
- security control: Input Validation: Kong plugins can be used to validate incoming requests and payloads, preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity. Implemented as Kong plugins or custom logic within plugins.
- security control: Rate Limiting and Traffic Control: Kong provides plugins to control traffic flow, prevent abuse, and protect backend services from overload. Implemented as Kong plugins.
- security control: HTTPS/TLS Termination: Kong can terminate TLS connections, ensuring encrypted communication between clients and the gateway. Implemented in Kong core.
- security control: Secret Management: Kong supports integration with secret management solutions for storing and managing sensitive credentials. Described in Kong documentation and implemented via configuration.
- security control: Audit Logging: Kong provides logging capabilities to track API access and events for auditing and security monitoring. Implemented in Kong core and plugins.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Plugin vulnerabilities: Reliance on third-party or community-developed plugins introduces potential vulnerabilities if plugins are not properly maintained or audited. Mitigation: Use only trusted and well-maintained plugins, perform security reviews of plugins, and keep plugins updated.
- accepted risk: Configuration errors: Misconfigurations of Kong or its plugins can lead to security vulnerabilities or operational issues. Mitigation: Implement infrastructure-as-code for configuration management, use configuration validation tools, and follow security best practices for configuration.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Web Application Firewall (WAF): Integrate a WAF in front of Kong to provide an additional layer of protection against common web attacks (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
- security control: API Security Testing: Implement automated API security testing (DAST, SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
- security control: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration: Integrate Kong logs with a SIEM system for centralized security monitoring and incident response.
- security control: Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in Kong and its configurations.
- security control: Supply Chain Security for Plugins: Implement controls to verify the integrity and security of Kong plugins, including dependency scanning and vulnerability checks.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Kong MUST support multiple authentication mechanisms to accommodate different API consumers and security needs (e.g., API keys, JWT, OAuth 2.0).
    - Requirement: Authentication mechanisms MUST be configurable per API route or service.
    - Requirement: Kong MUST securely store and manage authentication credentials and secrets.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Kong MUST provide fine-grained authorization capabilities to control access to specific API endpoints and resources.
    - Requirement: Authorization policies MUST be centrally managed and enforced by Kong.
    - Requirement: Kong MUST support role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) for authorization.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Kong MUST validate all incoming requests to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
    - Requirement: Input validation rules MUST be configurable and customizable based on API specifications.
    - Requirement: Kong MUST sanitize or reject invalid input and provide informative error messages.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Kong MUST use strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols for all security-sensitive operations, including TLS/HTTPS, secret storage, and data encryption.
    - Requirement: Kong MUST properly manage cryptographic keys and certificates.
    - Requirement: Kong MUST support encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit where required.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:

- API Availability: Ensuring continuous availability of APIs for consumers and internal applications is critical for business operations.
- API Security: Protecting APIs from unauthorized access, data breaches, and attacks is essential for maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance.
- API Performance: Maintaining acceptable API performance (latency, throughput) is crucial for user experience and application performance.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- API Request/Response Data: This data can include sensitive information depending on the APIs being managed. Sensitivity varies widely, and can include PII, financial data, or proprietary business information.
- Kong Configuration Data: This includes API routes, plugins configurations, authentication credentials, and other sensitive settings. This data is highly sensitive as it controls the security and functionality of the API gateway.
- Audit Logs: Audit logs contain information about API access and administrative actions, which are important for security monitoring and incident response. These logs can contain sensitive information and need to be protected.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the specific deployment environment for Kong (cloud provider, on-premises, hybrid)? (Assumption: Kubernetes on a cloud provider)
- What are the specific APIs being managed by Kong and their sensitivity levels? (Assumption: APIs handle a mix of public and internal data with varying sensitivity)
- What are the compliance requirements for the APIs and data being managed? (Assumption: General compliance requirements like GDPR, PCI DSS might be relevant depending on the data)
- What is the organization's risk appetite and security maturity level? (Assumption: Medium risk appetite, seeking to improve security posture)
- What existing monitoring and logging infrastructure is in place? (Assumption: Basic monitoring and logging infrastructure exists, needs integration with Kong)

Assumptions:

- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to securely and reliably manage APIs to enable digital transformation and microservices adoption. Security and availability are high priorities.
- SECURITY POSTURE: The organization is aware of basic security controls but needs guidance on implementing more advanced security measures. They are willing to invest in security to mitigate identified risks.
- DESIGN: Kong will be deployed in a Kubernetes environment on a cloud provider for scalability and resilience. PostgreSQL will be used as the database. GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD.
