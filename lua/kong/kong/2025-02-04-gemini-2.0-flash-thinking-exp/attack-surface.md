# Attack Surface Analysis for kong/kong

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Admin API Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_admin_api_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:** The Admin API, used for Kong configuration and management, is exposed without proper authentication and authorization to untrusted networks.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong's core functionality is managed through this API. Default configurations might expose it if not explicitly secured.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the internet accesses Kong's Admin API (port 8001) without authentication and creates a new route that redirects all traffic to a malicious site.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of Kong Gateway, including configuration manipulation, service disruption, data exfiltration, and potential access to backend services.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict Admin API access to trusted networks using firewalls.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Enable strong authentication (API keys, mTLS, RBAC) for the Admin API.
    *   **Disable Public Interface Binding:** Configure Kong to bind the Admin API to a non-public interface (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Misconfigured Admin API Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_misconfigured_admin_api_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Using weak authentication methods or misconfiguring authentication plugins for the Admin API allows unauthorized access to Kong's control plane.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong relies on plugins for Admin API authentication. Misconfiguration directly weakens Kong's security.
*   **Example:**  Administrators use Basic Authentication over HTTP for the Admin API. Attackers intercept credentials or brute-force weak passwords to gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Kong's Admin API, leading to configuration manipulation, service disruption, and potential backend service compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **HTTPS Enforcement:** Always enforce HTTPS for Admin API communication.
    *   **Strong Authentication Plugins:** Use robust plugins like Key Authentication, JWT, or mTLS. Avoid Basic Authentication over HTTP.
    *   **Strong Credentials & Rotation:** Enforce strong password policies and regularly rotate API keys.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to limit Admin API access based on roles and least privilege.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Kong plugins (official or third-party) can be exploited to bypass security measures, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt Kong's operation.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong's plugin architecture extends functionality but introduces the risk of plugin-specific vulnerabilities impacting Kong's security.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a rate-limiting plugin allows attackers to bypass rate limits and launch a denial-of-service attack through Kong.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security policies, data breaches, service disruption, and potentially compromising Kong itself depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability and plugin function)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully vet and select plugins from trusted sources.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Plugins:** Conduct security audits of custom or less common plugins.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Plugins:** Configure plugins with minimal necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Proxy Bypass or Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/proxy_bypass_or_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured routes, services, or plugins can lead to requests bypassing intended security policies and reaching backend services directly or unintended services.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong's routing and plugin chaining complexity can lead to misconfigurations that create security bypasses.
*   **Example:** A route is misconfigured with an overly broad path, allowing attackers to bypass authentication plugins and access a protected backend service directly.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to backend services, data breaches, and potential exposure of internal systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Configuration Review:**  Carefully review and test all route, service, and plugin configurations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Routes:** Define routes with specific and restrictive paths.
    *   **Testing and Validation:** Implement thorough testing of Kong configurations after changes.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Use infrastructure-as-code and version control for Kong configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS) at Proxy Layer](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_and_denial_of_service__dos__at_proxy_layer.md)

*   **Description:** Kong's proxy layer can be overwhelmed with requests, exploiting resource-intensive plugins, or triggering vulnerabilities leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.
*   **Kong Contribution:** As the entry point for traffic, Kong is a target for DoS. Certain plugins or configurations can amplify DoS impact.
*   **Example:** Attackers flood Kong with requests, exceeding its capacity and causing service disruption for all proxied backend services.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of APIs and backend services, potential cascading failures to backend systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling plugins.
    *   **Request Size Limits:** Configure limits on request body and header sizes.
    *   **Connection Limits:** Configure connection limits to prevent connection exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor Kong's resource usage and set up alerts.
    *   **Load Balancing and Scaling:** Deploy Kong in a load-balanced and scalable architecture.

## Attack Surface: [Database Security Compromise (Impacting Kong)](./attack_surfaces/database_security_compromise__impacting_kong_.md)

*   **Description:** Compromising the database used by Kong (PostgreSQL or Cassandra) can lead to full compromise of Kong's configuration and operation.
*   **Kong Contribution:** Kong's configuration and operational data are stored in the database. Database security is critical for Kong's integrity.
*   **Example:** Attackers gain access to the Kong database due to weak database security and modify Kong's configuration to redirect traffic or disable security plugins.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of Kong Gateway, including configuration manipulation, data breaches, and service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Database Network Segmentation:** Restrict database access to only Kong instances.
    *   **Strong Database Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication for database access.
    *   **Database Encryption:** Encrypt database connections and data at rest.
    *   **Regular Database Security Audits & Updates:** Audit database security and keep the database software updated.
