## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Kong API Gateway [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_kong_api_gateway__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overall attacker goal and represents the highest level critical node. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through Kong.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Kong API Gateway Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2___high-risk_path___critical_node__exploit_kong_api_gateway_core_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Known Kong Core Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**
        *   Attackers identify a vulnerable Kong version and leverage publicly available exploits for known CVEs.
        *   This is high-risk because known vulnerabilities are often actively exploited, and patching lags can leave systems vulnerable.
    *   **Discover Zero-Day Vulnerability in Kong Core:**
        *   Sophisticated attackers may invest resources to discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in Kong's core.
        *   While lower likelihood, zero-day exploits are extremely impactful and difficult to defend against proactively.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Bypass Kong's Security Features [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3___high-risk_path__bypass_kong's_security_features__critical_node_.md)

*   This path targets the core security functionalities of Kong, aiming to circumvent intended protections.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Misconfiguration of authentication plugins [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Incorrectly configured authentication plugins (like JWT, OAuth 2.0) can lead to vulnerabilities allowing attackers to bypass authentication checks.
            *   Misconfiguration is a common and easily exploitable weakness.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Misconfiguration of authorization plugins [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Similar to authentication, misconfigured authorization plugins (like ACL, RBAC) can grant unauthorized access to resources.
            *   Incorrectly defined or implemented authorization policies are a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Kong Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4___high-risk_path__exploit_kong_plugin_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   Kong's plugin ecosystem expands functionality but also introduces potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Plugin Misconfiguration leading to vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Incorrect plugin parameters [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Providing incorrect or malicious parameters to plugins during configuration can lead to unexpected behavior and security flaws.
            *   This is high-risk due to the wide variety of plugins and potential for configuration errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Kong Admin API [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5___high-risk_path___critical_node__compromise_kong_admin_api__critical_node_.md)

*   The Admin API is the control plane of Kong. Compromise here grants full administrative control.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Brute-force/Guess Admin API Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak or default admin credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Using weak or default passwords for the Admin API is a critical vulnerability.
            *   Brute-force or password guessing attacks become highly effective with weak credentials.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Credential Stuffing against Admin API [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Attackers use lists of leaked credentials from other services to attempt login to the Kong Admin API.
        *   Password reuse makes credential stuffing a viable and high-risk attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Kong Data Store (Database) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6___high-risk_path___critical_node__compromise_kong_data_store__database___critical_node_.md)

*   The database stores Kong's configuration and potentially sensitive data. Compromise here can lead to full control and data breaches.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Database Credential Compromise [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak or default database credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Similar to the Admin API, weak database passwords are a major vulnerability.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Unsecured storage of database credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:**
            *   Storing database credentials in plain text configuration files or easily accessible environment variables makes them vulnerable to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. [HIGH-RISK PATH] Social Engineering/Phishing targeting Kong Administrators [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/7___high-risk_path__social_engineeringphishing_targeting_kong_administrators__critical_node_.md)

*   Human error is a significant factor. Attackers target administrators to gain access.
    *   Phishing emails and social engineering tactics are used to trick Kong administrators into revealing Admin API credentials or granting access to Kong infrastructure.
    *   Social engineering is a consistently effective attack vector due to human vulnerabilities.
