# Attack Surface Analysis for kong/kong

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Admin API](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Kong Admin API provides full control over the gateway. Exposure without authentication/authorization allows complete takeover.
    *   **How Kong Contributes:** Kong *provides* the Admin API as its core management interface. Its inherent power is the source of the risk if unprotected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses `http://<kong-admin-ip>:8001/` and reconfigures routes, disables security, or adds malicious plugins.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the API gateway, potential backend compromise, data breaches, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Isolation:** Strict network segmentation (VLANs, subnets, ACLs) + VPN/jump host for Admin API access *only*.
        *   **Strong Authentication:** *Enforce* strong authentication (key-based or JWT). Integrate with an IdP for MFA.
        *   **RBAC:** Granular RBAC with *minimum* necessary permissions. Kong Enterprise RBAC or custom solutions.
        *   **TLS:** Always use HTTPS (TLS) with a valid certificate. Enforce HTTPS.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Rate limit the Admin API itself (using Kong plugins) to prevent brute-force and DoS.
        *   **Auditing:** Comprehensive audit logging of *all* Admin API requests (user, IP, details, status). Integrate with SIEM.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (Exploitation)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__exploitation_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Kong plugins (official or community) can be exploited to bypass security, gain access, or execute code.
    *   **How Kong Contributes:** Kong's *plugin architecture* is the enabling factor. Each plugin adds to the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable auth plugin allows bypass via a crafted request; a vulnerable transformation plugin allows command injection.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but can range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depends on plugin function and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Selection:** Prefer well-maintained, official plugins. Avoid obscure/infrequently updated ones.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for known plugin vulnerabilities (CVE databases, scanners).
        *   **Plugin Updates:** Keep *all* plugins updated. Automate updates where possible, with staging testing.
        *   **Code Review (Custom Plugins):** Thorough security code reviews for custom plugins (input validation, output encoding, secure Lua practices).
        *   **Least Privilege (Plugin Config):** Configure plugins with *minimum* necessary permissions.
        *   **Input Validation (Within Plugins):** *All* plugins (especially those handling input) must validate and sanitize to prevent injections.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Communication with Upstream Services](./attack_surfaces/insecure_communication_with_upstream_services.md)

*   **Description:** Kong communicating with backends over unencrypted HTTP exposes data to eavesdropping and MITM attacks.
    *   **How Kong Contributes:** Kong's *proxy configuration* determines the upstream communication protocol. Misconfiguration causes insecure communication.
    *   **Example:** Kong forwards requests to `http://backend.example.com:8080`. An attacker intercepts traffic and steals data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized backend access, potential for MITM to modify requests/responses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **HTTPS for Upstream:** *Always* configure Kong to use HTTPS (`https://`) for upstream services.
        *   **Certificate Verification:** Enable certificate verification in Kong (`verify_ssl`, `ssl_verify_depth`).
        *   **Trusted CAs:** Ensure Kong trusts the CA that issued the upstream service's certificate.
        *   **mTLS:** Consider mutual TLS (mTLS) for two-way authentication between Kong and upstreams.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured Plugins](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect plugin configurations weaken security or introduce vulnerabilities, even if the plugin is secure.
    *   **How Kong Contributes:** Kong's functionality relies heavily on *plugin configuration*.  This is the direct source of the risk.
    *   **Example:** A rate-limiting plugin with excessively high limits, or an OAuth 2.0 plugin with a weak secret.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely. Can range from ineffective security to complete bypass of security.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the plugin and misconfiguration)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Documentation Review:** Thoroughly understand plugin documentation, especially security options.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure with *minimum* necessary permissions and settings. Avoid defaults without review.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test configurations in staging, using security testing tools.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement automated checks to validate plugin configurations.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review plugin configurations for security and best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Declarative Configuration (YAML)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_declarative_configuration__yaml_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access/modification to the declarative configuration (YAML) compromises the gateway.
    *   **How Kong Contributes:** Kong *supports declarative configuration* as a core feature. The file's contents directly control Kong.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the YAML to disable authentication or add a malicious route.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the API gateway, potential backend compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File Permissions:** *Strictly* control file permissions. Only Kong and authorized admins should have read access; controlled write access.
        *   **Secure Storage:** Store the file in a secure location (protected directory, secrets manager).
        *   **Version Control (Git):** Use Git for change tracking, reverts, and audit trails. Use pull requests/reviews.
        *   **Automated Deployment:** Use a pipeline for controlled, consistent configuration changes.
        *   **Secrets Management:** *Never* store secrets directly in the YAML. Use a secrets manager + Kong's environment variable substitution.
