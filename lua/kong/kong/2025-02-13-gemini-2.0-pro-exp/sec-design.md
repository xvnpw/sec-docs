Okay, let's create a design document for the Kong API Gateway, keeping in mind its purpose and potential security considerations.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Kong is an open-source API Gateway and Microservices Management Layer.  It's designed to sit in front of RESTful APIs and extend their functionality with plugins.  The business priorities and goals that Kong addresses are:

*   Scalability:  Allowing organizations to handle increasing API traffic without performance degradation.
*   Centralized Management:  Providing a single point of control for managing multiple APIs and microservices.
*   Extensibility:  Enabling the addition of features like authentication, rate limiting, and transformations without modifying the underlying services.
*   Reliability:  Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance for API traffic.
*   Security: Protecting backend services from unauthorized access and malicious traffic.
*   Observability: Providing insights into API usage and performance through logging, monitoring, and analytics.
*   Faster Time to Market: Reducing the complexity of building and deploying APIs, allowing developers to focus on core business logic.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

*   Unauthorized API Access:  If Kong is misconfigured or compromised, attackers could gain access to sensitive backend services and data.
*   Denial of Service (DoS):  Overwhelming Kong with requests could make APIs unavailable to legitimate users.
*   Data Breaches:  Sensitive data transmitted through Kong could be intercepted or exposed if proper security measures are not in place.
*   Plugin Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in Kong plugins could be exploited to compromise the gateway or backend services.
*   Configuration Errors:  Incorrect configuration of Kong can lead to security loopholes or performance issues.
*   Lack of Auditing:  Without proper logging and auditing, it can be difficult to detect and investigate security incidents.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Kong, being an API gateway, inherently acts as a security control point. Here's a breakdown of its existing security controls, accepted risks, recommendations, and security requirements:

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication Plugins: Kong provides various authentication plugins (Key Auth, JWT, OAuth 2.0, Basic Auth, LDAP) to verify the identity of API consumers. Implemented as plugins.
*   security control: Authorization Plugins:  Plugins like the ACL (Access Control List) plugin can be used to enforce authorization rules, controlling which consumers can access specific APIs. Implemented as plugins.
*   security control: Rate Limiting Plugins:  Protect backend services from overload and abuse by limiting the number of requests from a particular consumer. Implemented as plugins.
*   security control: Request Transformation Plugins:  Modify incoming requests before they reach the backend service, potentially removing sensitive headers or adding required parameters. Implemented as plugins.
*   security control: Response Transformation Plugins: Modify outgoing responses, potentially masking sensitive data or adding security headers. Implemented as plugins.
*   security control: IP Restriction Plugin: Allow or deny access based on the client's IP address. Implemented as plugins.
*   security control: SSL/TLS Termination: Kong can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, ensuring secure communication between clients and the gateway. Implemented in core.
*   security control: Logging Plugins:  Capture details about API requests and responses, which can be used for auditing and security analysis. Implemented as plugins.
*   security control: Admin API Security: The Kong Admin API, used for configuring the gateway, can be secured with authentication and access control. Implemented in core.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Plugin Security:  The security of Kong relies heavily on the security of the plugins used.  Vulnerabilities in third-party plugins can pose a risk.
*   accepted risk: Configuration Complexity:  Kong's extensive configuration options can lead to misconfigurations if not managed carefully.
*   accepted risk: Default Credentials:  If default credentials for the Admin API or database are not changed, attackers could gain control of the gateway.
*   accepted risk: Upstream Service Security: Kong acts as a gateway, but it cannot guarantee the security of the backend services it proxies.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Web Application Firewall (WAF): Integrate a WAF (e.g., ModSecurity) with Kong to protect against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
*   security control: Mutual TLS (mTLS):  Implement mTLS between Kong and backend services to ensure that only authorized services can communicate with each other.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits:  Conduct regular security audits of Kong's configuration and plugins to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic and detect malicious activity targeting Kong.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong authentication mechanisms should be used to verify the identity of API consumers.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for sensitive APIs.
    *   API keys and other credentials should be securely stored and managed.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained authorization rules should be enforced to control access to specific APIs and resources.
    *   The principle of least privilege should be applied, granting only the necessary permissions to each consumer.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input received from clients should be validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Input validation should be performed both at the gateway level and within the backend services.

*   Cryptography:
    *   SSL/TLS should be used to encrypt all communication between clients and Kong, and between Kong and backend services.
    *   Strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths should be used.
    *   Sensitive data should be encrypted at rest and in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   API Access:  Providing secure and reliable access to APIs is the core business process.
    *   API Management:  Managing the lifecycle of APIs, including deployment, versioning, and monitoring.
    *   Service Connectivity:  Facilitating communication between different services and applications.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII):  If APIs handle PII, protecting this data is critical.  Sensitivity: High.
    *   Financial Data:  APIs that handle financial transactions or data require the highest level of security. Sensitivity: High.
    *   Authentication Credentials:  API keys, tokens, and other credentials used for authentication must be protected. Sensitivity: High.
    *   Configuration Data:  Kong's configuration data, including upstream service details and plugin configurations, should be protected. Sensitivity: Medium.
    *   API Request/Response Data:  The actual data transmitted through APIs can vary in sensitivity, depending on the specific API. Sensitivity: Variable (Low to High).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What specific compliance requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) apply to the systems using Kong?
    *   What is the expected traffic volume and growth rate for the APIs?
    *   What are the existing security policies and procedures within the organization?
    *   What is the level of expertise of the team managing Kong?
    *   What are the specific upstream services that Kong will be proxying?
    *   What is organization risk appetite?

*   Assumptions:
    *   BUSINESS POSTURE: The organization prioritizes API security and availability.
    *   SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security controls (firewalls, network segmentation) are in place at the infrastructure level.
    *   DESIGN: Kong will be deployed in a high-availability configuration. The database used by Kong is properly secured and backed up. Developers writing custom plugins follow secure coding practices.
