## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Kong Admin API!](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_kong_admin_api!.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains full control over the Kong API Gateway by compromising the administrative interface. This is a high-risk path because it provides complete control and several common attack vectors exist.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Weak Credentials!](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_weak_credentials!.md)

*   **Description:** The Admin API is protected by a weak, easily guessable password.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, rotation).
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Regularly audit password strength.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Default Credentials!](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_default_credentials!.md)

*   **Description:** The Admin API is still using default credentials that were set during installation.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (but still occurs)
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Mandatory change of default credentials upon installation.
        *   Automated checks for default credentials during deployment.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Misconfigure Kong/Plugins!](./attack_tree_paths/3__misconfigure_kongplugins!.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect configuration of Kong or its plugins creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This is a high-risk path due to the prevalence of human error and the potential for significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Insecure Plugin Configuration (e.g., Rate Limiting Disabled)!](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_insecure_plugin_configuration__e_g___rate_limiting_disabled_!.md)

*   **Description:** A plugin is configured in a way that weakens security.  A common example is disabling rate limiting on authentication-related plugins.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the specific plugin and misconfiguration)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Review and validate all plugin configurations.
        *   Use a "least privilege" approach for plugin permissions.
        *   Document secure configuration guidelines.
        *   Regular configuration audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Exposed Admin API!](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_exposed_admin_api!.md)

*   **Description:** The Kong Admin API is accessible from the public internet without proper protection.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (should be a high priority to prevent)
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks only (VPN, network ACLs).
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization (as with 1.1 and 1.2).
        *   Network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Plugin Misconfiguration (Authorization Bypass)!](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_plugin_misconfiguration__authorization_bypass_!.md)

*   **Description:** A plugin responsible for authorization is misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.  This could be due to incorrect regular expressions, flawed logic, or other configuration errors.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Thorough review and testing of authorization plugin configurations.
        *   Use well-tested libraries for security-critical functions.
        *   Comprehensive testing, including negative test cases.
        *   Regular security audits.
