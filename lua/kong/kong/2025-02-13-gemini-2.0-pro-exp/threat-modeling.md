# Threat Model Analysis for kong/kong

## Threat: [Admin API Exposure](./threats/admin_api_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Kong Admin API, either through network exposure, weak credentials, or a misconfigured authentication plugin. The attacker can then reconfigure Kong, add/remove routes, modify plugins, and access sensitive data.  This is a *direct* threat to Kong because the Admin API *is* Kong's control plane.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the API gateway and potentially all connected upstream services.  Data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
*   **Affected Component:** Kong Admin API (all endpoints), Authentication plugins (if misconfigured or bypassed).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict access to the Admin API to a trusted internal network using firewall rules, network policies (Kubernetes), or security groups.
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication (e.g., key authentication, JWT, mTLS) and disable default, unauthenticated access.
    *   **RBAC (Kong Enterprise):** Utilize Role-Based Access Control to limit the permissions of Admin API users.
    *   **Auditing:** Enable and regularly review Admin API access logs.
    *   **Separate Interface:** Consider using a dedicated network interface for the Admin API.

## Threat: [Plugin Bypass/Misconfiguration (Authentication/Authorization)](./threats/plugin_bypassmisconfiguration__authenticationauthorization_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfiguration in a Kong *authentication or authorization* plugin (e.g., `key-auth`, `jwt`, `oauth2`, `ldap-auth`) to bypass security controls. This is a *direct* threat because these plugins are core components of Kong's security model.  The bypass allows unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected resources, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific authentication/authorization plugins (e.g., `key-auth`, `jwt`, `oauth2`, `ldap-auth`), Plugin execution logic within Kong.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test all plugin configurations, including edge cases and error handling.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Apply plugins only to the necessary routes and services.
    *   **Input Validation:** Ensure plugins properly validate all input and handle errors gracefully.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Kong and all plugins updated to the latest versions to patch vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitoring:** Monitor authentication and authorization logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) on Kong](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__on_kong.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods Kong *itself* with a large number of requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, connections) and making it unavailable. This is a *direct* attack on Kong's core functionality.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption for *all* APIs managed by Kong.
*   **Affected Component:** Kong worker processes, database connection pool (if applicable), network interface â€“ all core Kong components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Use the `rate-limiting` plugin to limit the number of requests from individual clients or IP addresses.
    *   **Request Size Limiting:** Use the `request-size-limiting` plugin to restrict the size of incoming requests.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate resource limits for Kong's worker processes.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Deploy Kong behind a load balancer for additional DoS protection (although this doesn't eliminate the direct threat to Kong).
    *   **IP Restriction:** Use the `ip-restriction` plugin to block requests from known malicious IP addresses.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation (High-Impact)](./threats/plugin_vulnerability_exploitation__high-impact_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Kong plugin (official or third-party) to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code *within Kong's context*, or disrupt service.  This is *direct* because the vulnerability exists *within* a Kong plugin. We're focusing on *high-impact* vulnerabilities here.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but *high-impact* vulnerabilities could lead to complete system compromise, arbitrary code execution within Kong, or significant data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable plugin, and potentially other Kong components if the vulnerability allows for escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Kong and *all* plugins updated to the latest versions. This is the most critical mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan Kong and its plugins for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Plugin Vetting:** Carefully vet any third-party plugins before deploying them. Review their code and security posture.
    *   **Minimal Plugins:** Use a minimal set of plugins to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Storage](./threats/insecure_configuration_storage.md)

*   **Description:**  Kong's configuration (including secrets like API keys if stored improperly) is stored insecurely, allowing an attacker with access to Kong's database or configuration files to compromise the gateway. This is a *direct* threat because it targets Kong's own configuration data.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the API gateway and potentially all connected upstream services.
*   **Affected Component:** Kong's configuration database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Cassandra), configuration files (if used).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Database Encryption:** Encrypt the database at rest and in transit.
    *   **Access Control:** Implement strong access controls for the database and configuration files.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) and integrate it with Kong. *Do not* store secrets directly in Kong's configuration.
    *   **Regular Backups:** Regularly back up Kong's configuration and store backups securely.
