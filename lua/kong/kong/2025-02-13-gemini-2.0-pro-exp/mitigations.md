# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for kong/kong

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Kong Admin API](./mitigation_strategies/secure_kong_admin_api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Authentication:** Enable strong authentication for the Admin API using Kong's built-in plugins:
        *   **Key Authentication:** Use the `key-auth` plugin. Generate unique API keys for each authorized user/system via the Admin API.
        *   **JWT Authentication:** Use the `jwt` plugin. Configure Kong to validate JWTs issued by a trusted identity provider, using Kong's Admin API to configure the plugin.
        *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Configure Kong to require client certificates for Admin API access. This is done through Kong's configuration (`kong.conf`) and potentially involves creating and managing certificates.
    2.  **Authorization (RBAC):** If using Kong Enterprise, enable and configure the RBAC plugin *using the Admin API*. Define roles with granular permissions and assign users to roles, all within Kong.
    3.  **Loopback Binding (if applicable):** If the Admin API is *only* accessed locally, bind it to the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`) in the `kong.conf` file (`admin_listen = 127.0.0.1:8001`). This is a direct Kong configuration change.
    4.  **Disable Unused Endpoints:** (Less common, but possible) If certain Admin API endpoints are not needed, disable them. This might involve custom configurations or, in extreme cases, modifying Kong's source code (generally discouraged).
    5.  **Audit Logging:** Configure Kong (via `kong.conf` or plugins) to log all Admin API access attempts and actions. This is a Kong-specific configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Admin API:** (Severity: **Critical**)
    *   **Data Breach (via Admin API):** (Severity: **Critical**)
    *   **Denial of Service (via Admin API):** (Severity: **High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Admin API:** Risk reduced from *critical* to *low*.
    *   **Data Breach (via Admin API):** Risk reduced from *critical* to *low*.
    *   **Denial of Service (via Admin API):** Risk reduced from *high* to *low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Authentication: Key Authentication (`key-auth` plugin) is enabled.
    *   Authorization (RBAC): *Not Implemented* (Kong Community Edition).
    *   Loopback Binding: *Not Applicable*.
    *   Disable Unused Endpoints: *Not Implemented*.
    *   Audit Logging: Basic logging is enabled, but not comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authorization (RBAC): Investigate custom authorization or upgrade to Enterprise.
    *   Disable Unused Endpoints: Review and potentially disable unused endpoints.
    *   Audit Logging: Configure comprehensive logging to a centralized system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Plugin Configuration and Management (Kong-Centric)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_plugin_configuration_and_management__kong-centric_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** For *each* Kong plugin, configure it via the Admin API with the *minimum* necessary permissions.  This is done entirely within Kong's configuration.
    2.  **Input Validation:** Within the configuration of *each* Kong plugin (via the Admin API), carefully validate all input parameters. Use Kong's configuration options to enforce validation rules.
    3.  **Version Management:** Use Kong's package manager (LuaRocks) or manual updates to keep all Kong plugins up-to-date. This involves interacting with Kong's environment.
    4.  **Rate Limiting (Plugin-Specific):** Use Kong's `rate-limiting` or `rate-limiting-advanced` plugins, configuring them *via the Admin API* to apply rate limits to *other specific plugins*. This is a Kong-to-Kong interaction.
    5.  **Disable Unused Plugins:** Regularly review the list of enabled plugins via the Admin API and disable any that are not in use. This is a direct Kong configuration change.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** (Severity: **Variable**)
    *   **Plugin Misconfiguration:** (Severity: **High**)
    *   **Denial of Service (via Plugin):** (Severity: **High**)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly.
    *   **Plugin Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced from *high* to *low*.
    *   **Denial of Service (via Plugin):** Risk reduced from *high* to *moderate* or *low*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Partially implemented.
    *   Input Validation: Partially implemented.
    *   Version Management: LuaRocks used, but no automated checks.
    *   Rate Limiting (Plugin-Specific): Implemented globally, but not for individual plugins.
    *   Disable Unused Plugins: Periodic manual review.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Version Management: Automate plugin update checks.
    *   Rate Limiting (Plugin-Specific): Implement for specific plugins.
    *   Input Validation: Comprehensive review and consistent implementation.
    *   Principle of Least Privilege: Complete review of all plugin configurations.
