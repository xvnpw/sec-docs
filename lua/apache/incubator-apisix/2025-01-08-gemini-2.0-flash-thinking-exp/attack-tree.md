## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Control Plane Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_control_plane_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

The control plane, primarily the Admin API, is the central point for configuring and managing APISIX. Exploiting vulnerabilities here grants significant control over the gateway's behavior and the traffic it routes. This path is considered high-risk because successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the application by manipulating its core routing and security configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Unauthorized Access to Admin API [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_unauthorized_access_to_admin_api__high_risk_path_.md)

The Admin API is the primary interface for configuring APISIX. Gaining unauthorized access to it is a critical step for attackers as it allows them to manipulate routes, plugins, and security settings. This path is high-risk because it's often the first and most impactful step towards compromising the entire gateway.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

Bypassing the authentication mechanisms protecting the Admin API allows attackers to gain access without providing valid credentials. This is a high-risk path because it directly circumvents a fundamental security control.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Identify and Exploit Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__identify_and_exploit_default_credentials.md)

Many systems, including API gateways, come with default credentials that are often not changed by administrators. Attackers can easily find these default credentials and use them to gain unauthorized access. This path is high-risk due to its simplicity and the high likelihood of success if default credentials are not updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Modify APISIX Configuration Maliciously](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__modify_apisix_configuration_maliciously.md)

Once an attacker gains access to the Admin API, a primary goal is to manipulate the APISIX configuration for malicious purposes. This can involve injecting malicious routes or plugins, downgrading security settings, or other actions that compromise the gateway's integrity and security. This is a high-risk path because it directly leverages control plane access to inflict significant damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Routes](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__inject_malicious_routes.md)

A common and effective attack after gaining Admin API access is to inject malicious routes. These routes can redirect traffic intended for legitimate backend services to attacker-controlled servers, allowing them to intercept sensitive data or manipulate responses. This path is high-risk due to the direct impact on data confidentiality and integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Redirect Traffic to Attacker-Controlled Servers](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__redirect_traffic_to_attacker-controlled_servers.md)

This is the direct consequence of injecting malicious routes. By redirecting traffic, attackers can effectively perform man-in-the-middle attacks, capturing sensitive information like credentials, API keys, or personal data transmitted through the gateway. This path is high-risk due to the immediate and severe impact on data security.
