# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/incubator-apisix

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

**Description:** Exploiting discrepancies in how APISIX and backend servers parse HTTP requests, allowing attackers to inject additional requests or manipulate routing.

**How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** As a reverse proxy, APISIX parses and forwards HTTP requests. Vulnerabilities in its parsing logic, especially when handling Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers, can lead to smuggling.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious request with ambiguous Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length headers. APISIX interprets it as one request, while the backend interprets it as two, allowing the attacker to inject a second, potentially unauthorized request.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access to backend resources, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary commands on backend servers.

**Risk Severity: Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict HTTP Parsing:** Configure APISIX with strict HTTP parsing settings, enforcing adherence to HTTP specifications.
* **Normalize Requests:** Implement request normalization within APISIX to ensure consistent interpretation by both the gateway and backend servers.
* **Disable Conflicting Headers:** If possible, disable or strictly control the use of Transfer-Encoding and rely on Content-Length, or vice-versa.
* **Regularly Update APISIX:** Ensure APISIX is running the latest version with security patches addressing known HTTP parsing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker abuses APISIX's functionality to make requests to internal or external resources that the attacker shouldn't have access to.

**How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX might be configured to fetch data from external sources (e.g., for service discovery, configuration updates) or route requests to internal services based on user input or configuration. If not properly validated, attackers can manipulate these functionalities.

**Example:** An attacker modifies a request parameter that APISIX uses to determine the upstream service, causing APISIX to make a request to an internal administrative interface or a cloud metadata service.

**Impact:** Accessing internal resources, leaking sensitive information, performing actions on internal systems, and potentially compromising other infrastructure.

**Risk Severity: High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict Outbound Requests:** Implement strict whitelisting of allowed destination IPs, hostnames, or URL patterns for APISIX's outbound requests.
* **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences APISIX's routing or external data fetching.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant APISIX only the necessary permissions to access required resources.
* **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any APISIX features that involve making external requests if they are not required.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass in Plugins](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass_in_plugins.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within authentication plugins allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.

**How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX relies on a plugin architecture for authentication. Flaws in the design or implementation of specific authentication plugins can create bypass opportunities.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a custom authentication plugin might allow an attacker to send a crafted request with specific headers or tokens that are incorrectly validated, granting them access without proper credentials.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to protected APIs and backend services, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption.

**Risk Severity: Critical** (if core authentication is bypassed) / **High** (if specific routes are affected)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thorough Plugin Review:**  Carefully review the code and security of all authentication plugins before deployment.
* **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep authentication plugins updated to the latest versions with security patches.
* **Secure Plugin Development Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom authentication plugins.
* **Consider Built-in Authentication:**  Prefer using well-vetted, built-in authentication plugins provided by APISIX where possible.
* **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Where supported by plugins, enforce MFA for added security.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization Bypass in Plugins](./attack_surfaces/authorization_bypass_in_plugins.md)

**Description:** Flaws in authorization plugins allow authenticated users to access resources they are not permitted to access.

**How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX's authorization logic is often handled by plugins. Vulnerabilities in these plugins can lead to incorrect access control decisions.

**Example:** An authorization plugin might have a flaw in its role-based access control (RBAC) implementation, allowing a user with a lower-level role to access resources intended for administrators.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, or data manipulation.

**Risk Severity: High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Rigorous Plugin Testing:** Thoroughly test authorization plugins with various scenarios to ensure correct access control enforcement.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Configure authorization rules to grant only the necessary permissions to each user or role.
* **Centralized Policy Management:**  Use a centralized policy management system if available to manage and enforce authorization rules consistently.
* **Regular Plugin Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of authorization plugins to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Admin API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_admin_api.md)

**Description:** The APISIX Admin API, used for configuration and management, is exposed without proper authentication or with weak credentials.

**How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX provides an Admin API for managing routes, plugins, and other configurations. If this API is not adequately secured, attackers can gain full control over the gateway.

**Example:** The Admin API is exposed on a public interface with default credentials or weak authentication mechanisms, allowing an attacker to add malicious routes, disable security plugins, or exfiltrate sensitive configuration data.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the API gateway, allowing attackers to intercept traffic, modify routing, disable security measures, and potentially gain access to backend systems.

**Risk Severity: Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication for the Admin API, such as API keys, mutual TLS, or OAuth 2.0.
* **Network Restrictions:** Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or IP addresses.
* **Disable Default Credentials:** Ensure default credentials for the Admin API are changed immediately upon installation.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the security configuration of the Admin API.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (General)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__general_.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist in custom or third-party plugins installed in APISIX.

**How Incubator-APISIX Contributes:** APISIX's extensibility through plugins is a core feature. However, the security of the gateway depends on the security of these plugins.

**Example:** A custom logging plugin has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the logging process, leading to remote code execution on the APISIX server.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity: Varies (can be Critical, High, or Medium depending on the vulnerability)**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Careful Plugin Selection:**  Choose plugins from trusted sources and with a proven security track record.
* **Security Reviews:** Conduct thorough security reviews and code audits of all custom or third-party plugins before deployment.
* **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions with security patches.
* **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Explore options for sandboxing or isolating plugins to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
