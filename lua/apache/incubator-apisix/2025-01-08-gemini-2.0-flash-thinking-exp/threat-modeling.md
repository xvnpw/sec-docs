# Threat Model Analysis for apache/incubator-apisix

## Threat: [Configuration Injection](./threats/configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or lack of proper input validation in the APISIX configuration management interface (e.g., Admin API) to inject malicious configurations. This might involve modifying routing rules to redirect traffic to attacker-controlled servers, injecting malicious scripts into response headers, or altering plugin configurations for malicious purposes.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the API gateway, leading to data breaches by intercepting sensitive information, redirection of users to malicious sites, disruption of service by misrouting traffic, or execution of arbitrary code within the APISIX environment.

**Affected Component:** Admin API, Configuration Management Module (interacting with etcd or other configuration stores).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the Admin API.
*   Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for all configuration parameters.
*   Use parameterized queries or similar techniques when interacting with the configuration store.
*   Regularly audit configuration changes.
*   Consider using a separate, hardened network for the configuration management plane.

## Threat: [Exposure of Admin API](./threats/exposure_of_admin_api.md)

**Description:** If the APISIX Admin API is accessible from the public internet or untrusted networks without proper authentication and authorization, an attacker could attempt to brute-force credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities in the Admin API to gain control of the gateway.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the API gateway, allowing attackers to modify routing, deploy malicious plugins, and potentially gain access to backend services.

**Affected Component:** Admin API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or IP addresses using firewall rules.
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Admin API (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
*   Consider running the Admin API on a separate, internal network.
*   Regularly monitor Admin API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

**Description:** APISIX's extensibility relies on plugins. If a third-party plugin has vulnerabilities (e.g., code injection, authentication bypass), an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the gateway or backend services.

**Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the plugin. Could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution on the APISIX instance or potentially on backend services if the plugin interacts with them.

**Affected Component:**  Specific third-party plugins.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully evaluate the security of third-party plugins before installation.
*   Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions.
*   Monitor security advisories for the plugins being used.
*   Consider code reviews or security audits for critical or custom plugins.
*   Implement a mechanism to disable or isolate compromised plugins quickly.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugins](./threats/malicious_plugins.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges could install a malicious plugin designed to exfiltrate data, disrupt service, or gain unauthorized access to backend systems.

**Impact:**  Severe compromise of the API gateway and potentially backend systems, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** Plugin Management Module, individual plugins.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access control for plugin installation and management.
*   Use a trusted repository for plugins.
*   Perform security scans or code reviews on plugin code before deployment.
*   Monitor plugin activity for suspicious behavior.

## Threat: [Bypass of Security Plugins](./threats/bypass_of_security_plugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers might find ways to bypass security plugins (e.g., authentication, authorization, WAF) due to vulnerabilities in APISIX's routing logic, plugin interaction, or implementation flaws in the plugins themselves.

**Impact:** Failure of security controls, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources, exploitation of backend vulnerabilities, and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Routing Module, Plugin Chaining Mechanism, specific security plugins.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the bypassed plugin).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test routing configurations and plugin interactions.
*   Ensure proper ordering of plugins in the processing pipeline.
*   Regularly review and update security plugin configurations.
*   Monitor for unexpected traffic patterns or access attempts.
