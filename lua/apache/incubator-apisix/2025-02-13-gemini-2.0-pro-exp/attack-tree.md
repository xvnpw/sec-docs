## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch represents the most common and often easiest attack vector. Misconfigurations in APISIX can expose sensitive data, allow unauthorized access, or lead to service disruption.

    *   **1.1 Default Credentials [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** APISIX, like many systems, may have default credentials for its components (etcd, Admin API, control plane). If these are not changed, an attacker can gain immediate control.
        *   **1.1.1 Use Default etcd Credentials [CRITICAL]**
            *   Likelihood: High
            *   Impact: Very High
            *   Effort: Very Low
            *   Skill Level: Script Kiddie
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   **1.1.2 Use Default APISIX Admin API Credentials [CRITICAL]**
            *   Likelihood: High
            *   Impact: Very High
            *   Effort: Very Low

            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   **1.1.3 Use Default Control Plane Credentials [CRITICAL]**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Very Low
            *   Skill Level: Script Kiddie
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy

    *   **1.2 Misconfigured Routes/Plugins [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Incorrectly configured routes and plugins can lead to unintended exposure of backend services or vulnerabilities.
        *   **1.2.1 Expose Admin API Unprotected [CRITICAL]**
            *   Description: The `/apisix/admin/*` routes provide administrative access. If exposed without proper authentication, an attacker can reconfigure the entire gateway.
            *   Likelihood: High
            *   Impact: Very High
            *   Effort: Very Low
            *   Skill Level: Script Kiddie
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   **1.2.2 Overly Permissive Route Matching [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   Description: Using overly broad wildcard routes (e.g., `/*`) can unintentionally expose backend services that should be protected.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Beginner
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **1.2.4 Insufficient Rate Limiting [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   Description: Lack of rate limiting on sensitive routes (especially the Admin API) allows for brute-force attacks or denial-of-service.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Beginner
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
        *   **1.2.5 Lack of Input Validation on Plugin Config [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   Description: If plugin configurations are not properly validated, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code or parameters, leading to various attacks.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_software_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This branch involves exploiting bugs in the APISIX core code or its dependencies.

    *   **2.1 Known CVEs (Unpatched) [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. If APISIX is not patched, attackers can use readily available exploits.
        *   **2.1.1 Identify Vulnerable Version [CRITICAL]**
            *   Description: Determine the APISIX version running (e.g., via HTTP headers, error messages).
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Script Kiddie
            *   Detection Difficulty: Easy
        *   **2.1.2 Exploit Known CVE (e.g., RCE, DoS, Auth Bypass) [CRITICAL]**
            *   Description: Use a tool like Metasploit or a custom script to exploit a known vulnerability.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Plugin/Extension Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_pluginextension_vulnerabilities__high-risk_.md)

* **Overall Description:** APISIX's extensibility via plugins is a powerful feature, but also a potential attack vector.

    *   **3.1 Vulnerable Custom Plugin [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **Description:** If the organization develops its own plugins, these might contain vulnerabilities.
        *   **3.1.1 Code Injection in Custom Plugin Logic [HIGH-RISK]**
            *   Description: Flaws in the custom plugin code that allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
