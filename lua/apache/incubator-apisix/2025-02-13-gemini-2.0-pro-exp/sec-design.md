Okay, let's create a design document for the Apache APISIX project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Apache APISIX is an open-source, high-performance, dynamic cloud-native API gateway.  It's designed to handle a large volume of requests and provide features like load balancing, dynamic routing, authentication, observability, and more.  Given its nature as an API gateway, it sits at the forefront of an organization's infrastructure, making it a critical component for both availability and security.

Priorities:

- High Availability and Performance:  APISIX must handle a large number of requests with low latency. Downtime or performance degradation directly impacts all services behind the gateway.
- Extensibility and Flexibility:  The ability to adapt to various API management needs through plugins and custom configurations is crucial.
- Security:  As the entry point for API traffic, APISIX must provide robust security features to protect backend services.
- Observability: Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing capabilities are essential for operational insight and troubleshooting.
- Community and Ecosystem:  A strong open-source community and a rich ecosystem of plugins are vital for long-term sustainability and adoption.

Goals:

- Provide a reliable and performant API gateway solution.
- Enable secure access to backend services.
- Offer a flexible and extensible platform for API management.
- Foster a vibrant open-source community.

Business Risks:

- Service Disruption:  Outages or performance issues in APISIX can disrupt all connected services, leading to significant business impact.
- Security Breaches:  Vulnerabilities in APISIX could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to backend systems and sensitive data.
- Configuration Errors:  Incorrect configurations can lead to security loopholes or service disruptions.
- Plugin Vulnerabilities:  Third-party plugins might introduce security risks.
- Lack of Observability:  Insufficient monitoring can hinder the ability to detect and respond to issues promptly.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Authentication Plugins: APISIX supports various authentication mechanisms through plugins (e.g., key authentication, JWT, OAuth 2.0). Implemented in plugins.
- security control: Authorization Plugins:  Plugins like `authz-keycloak` provide authorization capabilities. Implemented in plugins.
- security control: Traffic Control:  Features like rate limiting, request size limiting, and connection limiting help prevent abuse and DoS attacks. Implemented in core and plugins.
- security control: SSL/TLS Support:  APISIX supports HTTPS for secure communication. Implemented in core.
- security control: Input Validation:  Some level of input validation is performed, but the extent varies depending on the specific plugin and configuration. Implemented in core and plugins.
- security control: Observability: APISIX integrates with monitoring tools like Prometheus and provides logging capabilities. Implemented in core and plugins.
- security control: Regular Security Audits: The Apache Software Foundation likely encourages security audits, although the frequency and scope may vary. Described in project documentation.
- security control: Community Vulnerability Reporting:  A process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities is in place. Described in project documentation.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Plugin Security:  The security of third-party plugins is ultimately the responsibility of the plugin developers and users.
- accepted risk: Configuration Complexity:  The extensive configuration options can lead to misconfigurations if not carefully managed.
- accepted risk: Dependence on etcd:  The reliance on etcd for configuration storage introduces a dependency that must be secured.

Recommended Security Controls:

- Implement a robust input validation framework that applies consistently across all routes and plugins.
- Introduce a centralized policy engine for authorization, rather than relying solely on individual plugins.
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities, either natively or through a dedicated plugin.
- Provide detailed security hardening guidelines for production deployments.
- Establish a regular penetration testing program.
- Implement supply chain security measures for build and dependencies.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Support for multiple authentication methods (e.g., API keys, JWT, OAuth 2.0, mTLS).
    - Secure storage of credentials and secrets.
    - Session management (if applicable).
- Authorization:
    - Fine-grained access control based on roles, attributes, or other criteria.
    - Integration with external identity providers (IdPs).
    - Centralized policy management.
- Input Validation:
    - Strict validation of all incoming requests (headers, query parameters, body).
    - Whitelisting of allowed characters and data types.
    - Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, CSRF).
- Cryptography:
    - Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    - Secure key management.
    - Support for TLS 1.3.
    - Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- Git Push --> GitHub["GitHub Repository (Source Code)"]
    GitHub -- Webhook --> GitHub_Actions["GitHub Actions (CI/CD)"]
    GitHub_Actions -- Build --> Build_Artifacts["Build Artifacts (Docker Images, Tarballs)"]
    Build_Artifacts -- Publish --> Container_Registry["Container Registry (Docker Hub, etc.)"]
    Build_Artifacts -- Publish --> Release_Page["GitHub Release Page"]

    subgraph GitHub_Actions
        Checkout["Checkout Code"] --> Lint["Linting (Code Style)"]
        Lint --> SAST["SAST (Static Analysis)"]
        SAST --> Unit_Tests["Unit Tests"]
        Unit_Tests --> Build_Image["Build Docker Image"]
        Build_Image --> SCA["SCA (Software Composition Analysis)"]
        SCA --> Sign_Image["Sign Docker Image (Optional)"]
    end
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the GitHub repository.
2.  A webhook triggers GitHub Actions, the CI/CD system used by APISIX.
3.  GitHub Actions performs the following steps:
    -   Checks out the code.
    -   Runs linters to enforce code style consistency.
    -   Performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code. Tools like `CodeQL` could be used.
    -   Executes unit tests to verify code correctness.
    -   Builds Docker images for APISIX.
    -   Performs Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. Tools like `Dependency-Check` or `Snyk` could be used.
    -   Optionally signs the Docker images to ensure their integrity.
4.  The build artifacts (Docker images and tarballs) are published to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub) and the GitHub release page.

Security Controls in Build Process:

- security control: Linting: Enforces code style and helps prevent some types of errors.
- security control: SAST: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the source code.
- security control: Unit Tests:  Verifies code correctness and helps prevent regressions.
- security control: SCA:  Identifies vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- security control: Docker Image Signing:  Ensures the integrity of the Docker images.
- security control: CI/CD Automation:  Reduces the risk of manual errors and ensures consistent security checks.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- API Access and Management:  APISIX is directly responsible for managing access to all backend APIs.  Its failure or compromise impacts all connected services.
- Service Availability:  APISIX's performance and availability are critical for the overall availability of the services it manages.

Data Sensitivity:

- Configuration Data (etcd):  Contains sensitive information about API routes, authentication credentials, and other configuration details.  Compromise of etcd could lead to a full system compromise.  Sensitivity: High
- API Traffic:  APISIX handles all API traffic, which may include sensitive data depending on the specific APIs being used.  Sensitivity: Variable (depends on the APIs)
- Logs and Metrics:  Contain information about API usage, which could be sensitive depending on the context.  Sensitivity: Medium
