# Threat Model Analysis for apache/incubator-apisix

## Threat: [Unauthorized etcd Access and Modification (Due to APISIX Misconfiguration)](./threats/unauthorized_etcd_access_and_modification__due_to_apisix_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized etcd Access and Modification (Due to APISIX Misconfiguration)

    *   **Description:** While etcd security is crucial, this *specific* threat focuses on APISIX misconfigurations that *enable* unauthorized access.  This includes APISIX failing to properly authenticate to etcd (e.g., using weak or no credentials), using overly permissive etcd access controls granted to the APISIX user, or APISIX exposing etcd connection details through a vulnerability. The attacker leverages these APISIX-specific weaknesses to interact with etcd.
    *   **Impact:** Complete control over the API gateway's behavior. Traffic redirection, sensitive data exposure, security bypass, and full system compromise. Leads to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** APISIX's etcd client library (responsible for interacting with etcd), APISIX configuration related to etcd connection parameters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict APISIX etcd Configuration:** Ensure APISIX uses strong, unique credentials (mTLS certificates are highly recommended) to authenticate to etcd.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (APISIX to etcd):** Grant APISIX *only* the necessary read/write permissions within etcd.  Avoid granting APISIX full administrative access to the etcd cluster.
        *   **Secure Configuration Handling:** Ensure APISIX does not expose etcd connection details (e.g., endpoints, credentials) through error messages, logs, or the Admin API.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Audit APISIX's configuration related to etcd to ensure secure settings.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Custom Plugin (Code Injection)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_custom_plugin__code_injection_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerable Custom Plugin (Code Injection)

    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies a code injection vulnerability in a custom Lua plugin *running within APISIX*. The attacker crafts a malicious request that triggers the vulnerability, injecting and executing arbitrary Lua code within the APISIX worker process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the APISIX worker. Data theft, API response modification, interaction with backend services, and potential control of the underlying server.
    *   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable custom Lua plugin, APISIX's Lua plugin runner.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices (Lua):** Follow secure coding guidelines for Lua, focusing on input validation, output encoding, and avoiding dangerous functions.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all custom plugin code for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate all input received by the plugin. Use whitelisting.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode all output generated by the plugin.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the plugin updated with security patches.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use static and dynamic analysis tools to scan plugin code.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerability in APISIX Core (e.g., Request Smuggling, RCE)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerability_in_apisix_core__e_g___request_smuggling__rce_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerability in APISIX Core (e.g., Request Smuggling, RCE)

    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability *within the core APISIX codebase itself*. This could be a request smuggling vulnerability, a buffer overflow, a logic error in request handling, or any other flaw that allows the attacker to influence APISIX's behavior in an unintended way.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability. Could range from denial of service (crashing APISIX) to *arbitrary code execution (RCE)*, giving the attacker full control of the API gateway.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable component within APISIX's core (e.g., HTTP parser, routing engine, a specific function).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for DoS or significant information disclosure)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep APISIX Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation. Regularly update to the latest stable version.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to APISIX security advisories and vulnerability databases.
        *   **Rapid Patching:** Implement a process for quickly applying security patches.
        *   **Security Audits:** Consider periodic security audits, including code reviews and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Unprotected APISIX Admin API](./threats/unprotected_apisix_admin_api.md)

*  **Threat:** Unprotected APISIX Admin API

    * **Description:** The APISIX Admin API is exposed without proper authentication, authorization, or network restrictions. An attacker can directly access the Admin API and modify APISIX's configuration. This is a direct vulnerability *of* APISIX's configuration and access control.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the API gateway. The attacker can modify routes, disable security, add malicious plugins, and redirect traffic.
    * **Affected Component:** APISIX Admin API, APISIX control plane.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict Admin API access to a trusted network segment.
        *   **Authentication:** Enable strong authentication for the Admin API (API keys, JWT, mTLS).
        *   **Authorization:** Implement RBAC to limit actions different users can perform via the Admin API.
        *   **TLS/SSL:** Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication with the Admin API.
        *   **Disable Default Credentials:** Change default admin credentials immediately.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Monitor access logs for the Admin API.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Authentication/Authorization Plugin *within APISIX*](./threats/misconfiguration_of_authenticationauthorization_plugin_within_apisix.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration of Authentication/Authorization Plugin *within APISIX*

    *   **Description:** An administrator incorrectly configures an authentication/authorization plugin *that is part of the APISIX deployment*. This could involve weak secrets, misconfigured access rules, or disabling security checks *within the APISIX plugin configuration*. The attacker exploits this *APISIX-specific* misconfiguration.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to APIs and backend services, bypassing intended security controls. Data breaches and unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** The misconfigured authentication/authorization plugin, APISIX's plugin execution framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Follow Documentation:** Carefully follow the official documentation for the plugin.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Strong Secrets:** Use strong, randomly generated secrets.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit plugin configurations.
        *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the configuration to ensure it works as expected.
        *   **Configuration Management:** Use configuration management tools for consistency.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory) on APISIX Worker *due to APISIX Vulnerability or Misconfiguration*](./threats/resource_exhaustion__cpumemory__on_apisix_worker_due_to_apisix_vulnerability_or_misconfiguration.md)

* **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (CPU/Memory) on APISIX Worker *due to APISIX Vulnerability or Misconfiguration*

    * **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within APISIX itself* (e.g., a bug in a core component or a poorly written plugin) that leads to excessive CPU or memory consumption.  Alternatively, a *misconfiguration within APISIX* (e.g., excessively large limits, inefficient routing rules) makes it vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks. This is distinct from simply sending a large volume of legitimate requests.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service. The affected APISIX instance becomes unresponsive.
    * **Affected Component:** APISIX worker processes, potentially specific plugins or core components.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory) for APISIX worker processes.
        *   **Keep APISIX Updated:**  Ensure you are running a recent version of APISIX with any relevant bug fixes or performance improvements.
        *   **Plugin Optimization:** If custom plugins are used, optimize them for performance and resource usage.  Review for potential memory leaks or inefficient algorithms.
        *   **Configuration Review:**  Carefully review APISIX's configuration for any settings that could contribute to resource exhaustion (e.g., excessively large buffers, inefficient routing rules).
        * **Monitoring:** Monitor CPU/Memory of APISIX worker processes.
