### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.4.1.1 HTTP Flood Attacks

#### 4.1 Description of HTTP Flood Attacks

HTTP flood attacks are a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that aims to overwhelm a web server or application with a large volume of seemingly legitimate HTTP requests. The goal is to exhaust the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, connection limits) to the point where it becomes unresponsive to legitimate users, leading to service degradation or complete outage.

Unlike some other DDoS attacks that exploit network layer vulnerabilities, HTTP flood attacks operate at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model). This makes them harder to detect and mitigate because the requests themselves are often valid HTTP requests, making it difficult to distinguish malicious traffic from legitimate user activity based solely on network characteristics.

In the context of APISIX, an HTTP flood attack targets the API gateway itself. If successful, it can prevent APISIX from processing legitimate API requests, effectively taking down all the backend services protected by APISIX.

#### 4.2 Attack Vectors (Detailed)

Several variations of HTTP flood attacks can be employed against APISIX:

*   **4.2.1 GET Flood:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers send a massive number of HTTP GET requests to APISIX. These requests can be for specific resources or random URLs. The server has to process each request, even if it's a simple GET, consuming resources.
    *   **Target:**  Can target any endpoint exposed through APISIX. High-traffic endpoints or endpoints that require backend processing are more effective targets.
    *   **Example:** Sending millions of GET requests to `/api/users` or `/api/products` in a short period.

*   **4.2.2 POST Flood:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Similar to GET flood, but uses HTTP POST requests. These attacks can be more resource-intensive as POST requests often involve data processing, database interactions, or other backend operations.
    *   **Target:** Endpoints that handle POST requests, such as login endpoints, registration forms, or API endpoints that create or update resources.
    *   **Example:** Sending a flood of POST requests to `/api/login` with random or invalid credentials, or to `/api/data` with large payloads.

*   **4.2.3 Slowloris Attack:**
    *   **Mechanism:**  This is a low-bandwidth attack that aims to exhaust server connections. Attackers send partial HTTP requests and keep the connections open for a long time by sending incomplete headers or slow data transmission. APISIX, like most web servers, has a limited number of concurrent connections it can handle. By tying up these connections, Slowloris can prevent legitimate users from connecting.
    *   **Target:**  Exploits the connection handling mechanism of APISIX.
    *   **Example:** Sending HTTP headers slowly, byte by byte, to keep connections alive without completing the request.

*   **4.2.4 Slow Read Attack (R-U-Dead-Yet - RUDY):**
    *   **Mechanism:**  Similar to Slowloris, but focuses on slow reading of the response. The attacker sends a POST request with a large content-length but reads the response very slowly, tying up server resources while waiting to send the complete response.
    *   **Target:** Endpoints that generate responses, especially those that might generate large responses.
    *   **Example:** Sending a POST request that triggers a large data retrieval from the backend and then slowly reading the response data.

*   **4.2.5 Application-Layer Attacks (Sophisticated HTTP Floods):**
    *   **Mechanism:**  These are more sophisticated attacks that mimic legitimate user behavior more closely. They might involve:
        *   **Targeting specific resource-intensive endpoints:**  Focusing on API endpoints known to consume significant backend resources (e.g., complex queries, data aggregation).
        *   **Using realistic user agents and headers:**  Making requests appear more legitimate to bypass simple filtering rules.
        *   **Varying request patterns:**  Changing request parameters, URLs, and timing to evade detection based on static patterns.
    *   **Target:**  Specific API endpoints or functionalities within the applications protected by APISIX.
    *   **Example:**  Flooding requests to a search API endpoint with complex search queries, or targeting an API endpoint that triggers a computationally expensive process in the backend.

#### 4.3 Potential Impact (Detailed)

A successful HTTP flood attack on APISIX can have severe consequences:

*   **Service Degradation:**  APISIX becomes slow and unresponsive, leading to increased latency for all API requests. Legitimate users experience slow loading times and timeouts, significantly impacting user experience.
*   **Service Outage:**  APISIX becomes completely unavailable, unable to process any requests. This results in a complete outage of all APIs and applications protected by APISIX, rendering them inaccessible to users.
*   **Backend System Overload:**  Even if APISIX itself doesn't completely crash, the flood of requests can overwhelm backend services and databases, causing them to slow down or fail. This can cascade the impact beyond APISIX.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  APISIX server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, connection limits) are depleted, potentially affecting other services running on the same infrastructure.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Service outages and performance degradation can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode customer trust.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Downtime can lead to direct financial losses due to lost transactions, service level agreement (SLA) breaches, and recovery costs.
*   **Operational Disruption:**  Incident response and recovery efforts consume valuable time and resources from the development and operations teams.

#### 4.4 Technical Details

*   **Protocols:** HTTP (primarily TCP for reliable delivery). HTTPS if the attack targets secure endpoints.
*   **Request Characteristics:**  Valid HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.), but sent in massive volumes. Can be simple or more complex depending on the attack type.
*   **Network Layer:**  Attacks originate from potentially numerous source IPs (especially in DDoS scenarios), making IP-based blocking challenging without affecting legitimate users.
*   **Application Layer:**  Exploits the application logic and resource consumption of processing HTTP requests.
*   **Tools:** Attackers can use various tools to launch HTTP flood attacks, ranging from simple scripts to sophisticated DDoS botnets. Examples include:
    *   **Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC):** A popular open-source network stress testing tool often used for DoS attacks.
    *   **High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC):**  A more advanced version of LOIC designed to bypass some basic DDoS mitigation techniques.
    *   **Botnets:** Networks of compromised computers controlled by attackers, capable of generating massive amounts of traffic.
    *   **Custom Scripts:**  Attackers can write scripts in languages like Python or Go to generate HTTP flood traffic.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate HTTP flood attacks against APISIX, a multi-layered approach is recommended, combining APISIX's built-in features with external security solutions:

*   **4.5.1 APISIX Built-in Plugins and Features:**
    *   **`limit-req` Plugin (Rate Limiting):**  This plugin is crucial for limiting the rate of requests from a specific source (IP address, consumer, etc.). Configure appropriate rate limits based on expected legitimate traffic patterns.
        *   **Recommendation:** Implement `limit-req` plugin globally and/or on specific routes, setting reasonable rate limits and burst sizes. Experiment with different rate limiting strategies (e.g., sliding window, token bucket).
    *   **`limit-conn` Plugin (Connection Limiting):**  Limits the number of concurrent connections from a specific source. Useful for mitigating Slowloris and similar connection-exhaustion attacks.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Implement `limit-conn` plugin to restrict the number of concurrent connections per IP address.
    *   **`waf` Plugin (Web Application Firewall):**  Integrate a WAF plugin (like `lua-resty-waf` or integrate with external WAF solutions) to detect and block malicious requests based on patterns, signatures, and anomaly detection.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Deploy and configure a WAF plugin to filter out malicious HTTP requests, including those characteristic of flood attacks. Regularly update WAF rules.
    *   **Request Body Size Limits:**  Configure APISIX to limit the maximum allowed request body size to prevent attacks that send excessively large payloads.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Set appropriate `client_max_body_size` in APISIX configuration to prevent large POST request floods.
    *   **Timeout Configurations:**  Configure appropriate timeouts for client connections, request processing, and upstream connections to prevent resources from being held up indefinitely by slow or stalled requests.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Review and adjust `proxy_connect_timeout`, `proxy_send_timeout`, `proxy_read_timeout`, and `send_timeout` in APISIX configuration.

*   **4.5.2 Infrastructure and Network Level Mitigation:**
    *   **Load Balancing and Scalability:**  Ensure APISIX is deployed behind a load balancer and can scale horizontally to handle increased traffic during an attack.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Utilize a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy, Nginx) in front of APISIX instances and implement autoscaling to handle traffic surges.
    *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  Using a CDN can cache static content and absorb some of the attack traffic, reducing the load on APISIX. Many CDNs also offer DDoS protection services.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Consider using a CDN to cache static content and leverage its DDoS mitigation capabilities.
    *   **Cloud-Based DDoS Mitigation Services:**  Employ dedicated DDoS mitigation services offered by cloud providers or specialized security vendors. These services can detect and mitigate large-scale DDoS attacks before they reach APISIX.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Evaluate and consider using cloud-based DDoS mitigation services for comprehensive protection against volumetric attacks.
    *   **Network Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):**  Firewalls and IPS can filter out some malicious traffic at the network level, although they are less effective against application-layer HTTP floods.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Ensure firewalls and IPS are properly configured to filter out known malicious traffic patterns and potentially rate limit traffic at the network level.

#### 4.6 Detection Methods

Early detection of HTTP flood attacks is crucial for timely mitigation. Implement the following detection methods:

*   **4.6.1 Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Request Rate Monitoring:**  Monitor the request rate to APISIX endpoints. A sudden and significant spike in request rate, especially from unusual sources, can indicate an attack.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Set up monitoring dashboards and alerts for request rates per endpoint, per IP address, and overall. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to visualize and alert on these metrics.
    *   **Error Rate Monitoring:**  Monitor HTTP error rates (e.g., 5xx errors). Increased error rates, especially 503 (Service Unavailable) or 504 (Gateway Timeout), can indicate resource exhaustion due to an attack.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Monitor and alert on HTTP error rates, particularly 5xx errors.
    *   **Latency Monitoring:**  Track API response latency. A sudden increase in latency can be a sign of overload.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Monitor API latency and set alerts for significant increases.
    *   **Resource Utilization Monitoring:**  Monitor APISIX server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, connection counts). High resource utilization without a corresponding increase in legitimate traffic can indicate an attack.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Monitor server resource utilization using tools like `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, and monitoring agents. Set alerts for high CPU, memory, and network usage.
    *   **Connection Count Monitoring:**  Monitor the number of active connections to APISIX. A sudden surge in connections, especially if sustained, can indicate a Slowloris or similar attack.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Monitor active connection counts and set alerts for unusual spikes.

*   **4.6.2 Log Analysis:**
    *   **Access Log Analysis:**  Analyze APISIX access logs for suspicious patterns, such as:
        *   High volume of requests from the same IP address or IP range.
        *   Unusual user agents or request headers.
        *   Requests to non-existent or rarely accessed endpoints.
        *   Rapidly increasing number of requests within a short timeframe.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Implement log aggregation and analysis tools (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to analyze APISIX access logs for suspicious patterns.

*   **4.6.3 Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**
    *   Integrate APISIX logs and monitoring data with a SIEM system for centralized security monitoring, correlation of events, and automated threat detection.
        *   **Recommendation:**  Integrate APISIX with a SIEM system for advanced threat detection and incident response capabilities.
