**1.3 Configuration Manipulation [HIGH RISK PATH]**

*   **Description:** Attackers aim to gain unauthorized access to APISIX configuration and modify it for malicious purposes.

This attack path represents a **High Risk** scenario because successful configuration manipulation can grant attackers significant control over the APISIX gateway and the services it protects. This can lead to severe consequences, including service disruption, data breaches, and unauthorized access to backend systems.

**Attack Vectors (Summarized by Sub-Nodes):**

*   **1.3.1 Unauthorized Access to Admin API**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the APISIX Admin API, which is used to manage and configure APISIX.

    *   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
        *   **1.3.1.1 Weak Credentials:**
            *   **Detailed Description:**  Attackers exploit weak, default, or easily guessable credentials (usernames and passwords) used to protect the Admin API. This can be achieved through brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting publicly known default credentials if they were not changed.
            *   **Potential Impact:**  Full control over APISIX configuration, allowing attackers to:
                *   **Modify Routes:** Redirect traffic to malicious servers, intercept sensitive data, or deny service to legitimate users.
                *   **Change Plugins:** Inject malicious plugins to steal credentials, log sensitive information, or perform other malicious actions.
                *   **Disable Security Features:**  Turn off authentication, authorization, or rate limiting, exposing backend services.
                *   **Exfiltrate Configuration Data:**  Gain insights into the application architecture and potential vulnerabilities.
                *   **Disrupt Service Availability:**  Delete routes, plugins, or modify configurations to cause errors and outages.
            *   **Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations:**
