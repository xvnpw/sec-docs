# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/incubator-apisix

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Admin API Access with Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/secure_admin_api_access_with_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication in APISIX:** Configure authentication for the Admin API directly within APISIX configuration files (e.g., `conf/config.yaml`) or using the Admin API itself (if initial access is secured). Choose an authentication method supported by APISIX, such as `key-auth` or `basic-auth`.
    2.  **Set Strong Admin API Credentials:** Generate a robust, unique API key or username/password combination specifically for APISIX Admin API access.  Avoid using default credentials.
    3.  **Implement Authorization (RBAC if needed):** If your team has different roles managing APISIX, leverage APISIX's authorization capabilities or integrate with external authorization services (via plugins if available) to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This restricts access to specific Admin API endpoints based on user roles within APISIX management.
    4.  **Enforce HTTPS for Admin API:** Configure APISIX to serve the Admin API exclusively over HTTPS. This is configured within APISIX's Nginx configuration or through APISIX's configuration files, ensuring encrypted communication for Admin API interactions.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to APISIX Admin API (High Severity): Attackers gaining administrative control over APISIX, leading to full compromise of the API Gateway and potentially backend systems.
    *   APISIX Configuration Tampering (High Severity): Malicious actors modifying APISIX routes, plugins, and upstream configurations, disrupting services or injecting malicious logic.
    *   Exposure of Sensitive APISIX Configuration Data (Medium Severity):  Unprotected Admin API potentially leaking sensitive configuration details, including upstream credentials or API keys managed by APISIX.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to APISIX Admin API: High Risk Reduction - Effectively prevents unauthorized management of APISIX, safeguarding the API Gateway's integrity.
    *   APISIX Configuration Tampering: High Risk Reduction - Protects against malicious alterations to API routing and security policies enforced by APISIX.
    *   Exposure of Sensitive APISIX Configuration Data: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information managed within APISIX configuration.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within APISIX. API key authentication is enabled for Admin API access. HTTPS is enforced for all APISIX traffic, including the Admin API endpoint.
    *   Location: APISIX configuration files (`conf/config.yaml`), Nginx configuration files managed by APISIX.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Changing the default Admin API key to a strong, project-specific key within APISIX configuration.
    *   Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within APISIX to granularly manage Admin API access based on user roles.
    *   Establishing automated auditing of Admin API access logs within APISIX or external logging systems to detect suspicious activities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Admin API Access by IP Address using APISIX `allowlist`/`blocklist`](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_admin_api_access_by_ip_address_using_apisix__allowlist__blocklist_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Trusted IP Ranges for APISIX Admin Access:** Identify the specific IP address ranges or individual IP addresses that are authorized to access the APISIX Admin API (e.g., internal management network IPs, CI/CD server IPs).
    2.  **Configure APISIX `allowlist` or `blocklist`:** Utilize APISIX's built-in `allowlist` or `blocklist` features, configurable within APISIX's configuration (e.g., `conf/config.yaml` or via Admin API itself), to restrict access to the Admin API based on the source IP address of incoming requests. Configure the `allowlist` to explicitly permit access only from the defined trusted IP ranges.
    3.  **Regularly Review and Update APISIX IP Access Rules:** Establish a process to periodically review and update the `allowlist` or `blocklist` configuration within APISIX to ensure it remains accurate and aligned with current network infrastructure and administrative access requirements.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized External Access to APISIX Admin API (High Severity): Prevents attackers from accessing the APISIX Admin API from the public internet or untrusted networks, even if they compromise authentication credentials. This is specific to securing APISIX's management interface.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks Against APISIX Admin API (Medium Severity): Reduces the attack surface for brute-force attempts targeting the APISIX Admin API by limiting the network locations from which such attacks can originate.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized External Access to APISIX Admin API: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of external compromise of APISIX management functions.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks Against APISIX Admin API: Medium Risk Reduction - Makes brute-force attacks against APISIX Admin API more challenging by limiting accessible origins.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented within APISIX configuration. The APISIX Admin API is currently accessible from any IP address that can reach the API Gateway on the designated Admin API port.
    *   Location: Missing configuration within APISIX's `conf/config.yaml` or Admin API configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Configuration of APISIX's `allowlist` or `blocklist` feature to restrict Admin API access to pre-defined trusted IP ranges.
    *   Defining a procedure for routine review and updates of the IP access restriction rules within APISIX.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Validation using APISIX Plugins or Custom Lua Logic](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_validation_using_apisix_plugins_or_custom_lua_logic.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Vectors in APISIX Routes and Plugins:** Analyze APISIX route configurations and plugin usage to pinpoint all locations where user-provided data enters APISIX processing (e.g., request headers, query parameters, request body, parts of upstream URLs constructed within APISIX).
    2.  **Define Validation Rules within APISIX:** For each identified input vector, establish strict validation rules based on expected data types, formats, lengths, and permissible values. Utilize schema definitions (like JSON Schema) where applicable for structured data validation within APISIX.
    3.  **Enforce Validation with APISIX Plugins or Custom Lua:** Leverage APISIX plugins such as `request-validation` or develop custom Lua plugins that execute within APISIX's request processing pipeline to enforce the defined validation rules. Configure these plugins on relevant APISIX routes and services.
    4.  **Configure APISIX Error Handling for Validation Failures:** Define how APISIX should respond to validation failures. Typically, this involves APISIX rejecting the request with an appropriate HTTP error status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and logging the validation failure event within APISIX logs for monitoring and debugging purposes.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Attacks Exploiting APISIX Routes (High Severity): Prevents various injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, header injection, etc.) by sanitizing and validating user inputs *within APISIX* before they are passed to backend systems or used in APISIX's internal logic.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities via APISIX (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of XSS if input validation within APISIX includes proper encoding of output data, although output encoding is the primary defense and should also be considered in backend services.
    *   Data Manipulation via APISIX Routes (Medium Severity): Prevents attackers from manipulating data flow through APISIX by ensuring that inputs conform to expected formats and value ranges as defined in APISIX validation rules.
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via APISIX (Medium to High Severity): Validating upstream URLs constructed or modified within APISIX can mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities if user input is used in constructing these upstream requests within APISIX routing logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Attacks Exploiting APISIX Routes: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the likelihood of successful injection attacks originating from or passing through APISIX.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities via APISIX: Medium Risk Reduction - Contributes to XSS prevention at the API Gateway level, especially when combined with output encoding in backend services.
    *   Data Manipulation via APISIX Routes: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves data integrity and prevents unexpected application behavior due to malformed inputs processed by APISIX.
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via APISIX: Medium to High Risk Reduction - Reduces SSRF risk if upstream URLs are validated within APISIX routing.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within APISIX. Basic input validation might be implicitly performed by certain APISIX plugins (e.g., `jwt-auth` plugin validates JWT format). However, comprehensive and explicit input validation across all routes and plugins is not systematically implemented within APISIX.
    *   Location: Validation logic might be scattered across individual APISIX route and plugin configurations, potentially within custom Lua plugins if any are developed for APISIX.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic definition of input validation rules for all relevant APISIX routes and plugins.
    *   Widespread implementation of input validation using APISIX plugins like `request-validation` or custom Lua plugins across all applicable routes.
    *   Centralized management and enforcement of input validation policies within APISIX configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting and Throttling using APISIX Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_and_throttling_using_apisix_plugins.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical APISIX Routes for Rate Limiting:** Determine which API endpoints managed by APISIX are most critical and susceptible to abuse, denial-of-service attacks, or resource exhaustion.
    2.  **Define Rate Limit Policies within APISIX:** For each critical endpoint, define appropriate rate limit policies based on expected traffic patterns, upstream service capacity, and desired levels of protection. Consider different rate limiting strategies offered by APISIX plugins (e.g., requests per second, requests per minute, concurrent connections, rate limiting based on client identifiers).
    3.  **Apply APISIX Rate Limiting Plugins:** Utilize APISIX's rate limiting plugins, such as `limit-conn`, `limit-count`, or `limit-req`, to enforce the defined rate limit policies on the identified APISIX routes. Configure these plugins directly on the relevant routes and services within APISIX.
    4.  **Customize APISIX Error Responses for Rate Limiting:** Configure informative and user-friendly error responses within APISIX for requests that are rate-limited (e.g., HTTP 429 Too Many Requests). These responses should guide legitimate users and provide context about the rate limiting policy.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks against APIs managed by APISIX (High Severity): Prevents attackers from overwhelming upstream services by sending excessive requests through APISIX, thus protecting backend infrastructure.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks via APISIX (Medium Severity): Slows down brute-force attempts targeting APIs proxied by APISIX by limiting the rate at which an attacker can send requests through the API Gateway.
    *   Resource Exhaustion of Upstream Services due to Excessive Traffic via APISIX (Medium Severity): Protects upstream services from being overloaded by legitimate but unexpectedly high traffic spikes passing through APISIX.
    *   API Abuse via APISIX (Medium Severity): Limits the impact of malicious or unintentional API abuse by restricting request rates at the API Gateway level, preventing excessive load on backend systems.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks: High Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the effectiveness of DoS/DDoS attacks targeting APIs managed by APISIX.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks via APISIX: Medium Risk Reduction - Makes brute-force attacks slower and less likely to succeed when targeting APIs behind APISIX.
    *   Resource Exhaustion of Upstream Services: Medium Risk Reduction - Improves system stability and prevents service disruptions caused by traffic surges passing through APISIX.
    *   API Abuse via APISIX: Medium Risk Reduction - Mitigates the impact of API abuse and protects backend resources from excessive load originating from API requests routed by APISIX.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within APISIX. Basic rate limiting might be configured on a few critical API endpoints managed by APISIX, but systematic application across all relevant APIs is lacking.
    *   Location: Rate limiting configurations might be present in route configurations for specific critical endpoints within APISIX.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic identification of all API endpoints managed by APISIX that require rate limiting.
    *   Comprehensive implementation of rate limiting policies across all relevant APIs managed by APISIX.
    *   Centralized management and monitoring of rate limiting configurations and their effectiveness within APISIX.
    *   Customization of error responses within APISIX for requests that are rate-limited.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable HTTPS for Upstream Communication in APISIX:** Configure APISIX to communicate with upstream services over HTTPS whenever possible. This is configured within APISIX route or service definitions, specifying HTTPS as the upstream protocol.
    2.  **Enable and Configure Upstream Certificate Verification in APISIX:** Enable certificate verification within APISIX's upstream configuration to ensure that APISIX only establishes connections with legitimate upstream services and not with potential man-in-the-middle attackers. Configure trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) within APISIX or utilize the system-wide CA store accessible to APISIX.
    3.  **Configure Strong Cipher Suites for APISIX Upstream Connections:** Configure APISIX and upstream services to negotiate and use strong and modern cipher suites for TLS/SSL encryption during communication. Disable weak or outdated ciphers within APISIX's TLS/SSL settings.
    4.  **Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS) in APISIX for Sensitive Upstreams (Optional but Recommended):** For highly sensitive upstream services, consider implementing mutual TLS (mTLS) within APISIX. This involves configuring APISIX to present a client certificate to the upstream service for authentication, in addition to verifying the upstream service's certificate. This provides stronger mutual authentication and confidentiality for communication between APISIX and critical backends.

    1.  **Enable Authentication and Authorization for etcd:** If APISIX uses an external etcd cluster, enable authentication and authorization features within etcd itself to control access to etcd data. Configure etcd to require authentication for client connections.
    2.  **Enforce TLS for etcd Communication with APISIX:** Encrypt communication between APISIX instances and the etcd cluster using TLS. Configure both APISIX and etcd to use TLS certificates for secure communication.
    3.  **Restrict Network Access to etcd:** Limit network access to the etcd cluster to only authorized APISIX instances and administrative hosts. Use network firewalls to restrict access to the etcd ports to only necessary IP addresses or networks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to APISIX Control Plane Data (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized access to the etcd cluster, which stores critical APISIX configuration data. Compromise of etcd can lead to full control over APISIX.
    *   Data Tampering in APISIX Control Plane (High Severity): Protects against malicious modification of APISIX configuration data stored in etcd, which could disrupt API Gateway functionality or introduce security vulnerabilities.
    *   Data Breach of APISIX Configuration (Medium Severity): Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive APISIX configuration data stored in etcd, such as API keys or upstream credentials, to unauthorized parties.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to APISIX Control Plane Data: High Risk Reduction - Effectively prevents unauthorized access to the core configuration data of APISIX.
    *   Data Tampering in APISIX Control Plane: High Risk Reduction - Protects the integrity of APISIX configuration and prevents malicious manipulation of API Gateway behavior.
    *   Data Breach of APISIX Configuration: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of sensitive configuration data exposure from the APISIX control plane.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Apply Authentication and Authorization to SSE/WebSocket Routes in APISIX:** If using SSE or WebSocket features through APISIX, ensure that proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are applied to the routes handling these connections. Use APISIX authentication plugins or custom Lua logic to verify user identity and permissions before establishing SSE or WebSocket connections.
    2.  **Validate WebSocket Messages Processed by APISIX:** If APISIX processes or proxies WebSocket messages, implement validation of messages exchanged over WebSockets to prevent injection attacks or processing of malicious data. This can be done using custom Lua plugins within APISIX to inspect and validate WebSocket message content.
    3.  **Implement Rate Limiting for SSE/WebSocket Connections in APISIX:** Apply rate limiting or connection limiting policies to SSE and WebSocket endpoints in APISIX to prevent abuse or resource exhaustion attacks targeting these persistent connection types. Use APISIX rate limiting plugins configured for connection-based limits.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to SSE/WebSocket Endpoints via APISIX (High Severity): Prevents unauthorized clients from establishing SSE or WebSocket connections through APISIX and accessing backend services or data streams.

    *   Implementing WebSocket message validation within APISIX if messages are processed or proxied.
    *   Configuring rate limiting or connection limits for SSE/WebSocket endpoints in APISIX.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement GraphQL Security Best Practices when Proxying GraphQL via APISIX](./mitigation_strategies/implement_graphql_security_best_practices_when_proxying_graphql_via_apisix.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement GraphQL Query Complexity and Depth Limits in APISIX:** If APISIX is used to proxy GraphQL APIs, configure query complexity and depth limits within APISIX to prevent excessively complex GraphQL queries that could lead to DoS or performance issues on backend GraphQL services. This can be achieved using custom Lua plugins or potentially future APISIX plugins designed for GraphQL security.
    2.  **Implement Field-Level Authorization in APISIX for GraphQL:** Enforce field-level authorization for GraphQL queries within APISIX to control access to specific data fields based on user roles or permissions. This requires custom Lua plugin development within APISIX to parse GraphQL queries and enforce authorization rules before forwarding requests to backend GraphQL services.
    3.  **Disable GraphQL Introspection in Production APISIX:** Disable GraphQL introspection in production APISIX environments to prevent attackers from easily discovering the GraphQL schema and potential vulnerabilities. This is a general GraphQL security best practice that should be applied in conjunction with APISIX proxying.
