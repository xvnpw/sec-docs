# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Apache APISIX, aims to provide a high-performance, scalable, and feature-rich API Gateway. It addresses the business need for organizations to manage, secure, and observe their APIs and microservices effectively.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a robust and reliable API gateway solution.
  - Offer a wide range of features including routing, load balancing, security, observability, and traffic control.
  - Enable easy integration with existing infrastructure and microservices architectures.
  - Support high performance and scalability to handle demanding API traffic.
  - Foster an open-source community and ecosystem around the API gateway.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the API gateway could expose backend systems and data.
  - Performance bottlenecks in the API gateway could impact application availability and user experience.
  - Lack of adoption or community support could lead to project stagnation.
  - Complexity of configuration and management could increase operational overhead.
  - Incompatibility with certain infrastructure or technologies could limit adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Input validation is implemented in various plugins to sanitize and validate incoming requests. (Implemented in plugins - code inspection needed for specifics)
  - security control: Authentication and Authorization are supported through various plugins like JWT, Key-auth, Basic-auth, and OIDC. (Implemented in plugins - code inspection needed for specifics)
  - security control: HTTPS/TLS encryption is supported for communication between clients and APISIX, and between APISIX and upstream services. (Configuration in Nginx and APISIX)
  - security control: Rate limiting and traffic control policies can be configured to mitigate DDoS attacks and manage traffic spikes. (Implemented in APISIX core and plugins)
  - security control: Access control lists (ACLs) can be configured to restrict access to specific routes or services. (Implemented in plugins)
  - security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning are likely performed by the open-source community and contributors. (Community driven - no specific documentation provided in input)
  - security control: Secure software development lifecycle practices are generally followed in open-source projects, including code reviews and testing. (Open-source community practices)
  - security control: Dependency management is likely in place to track and update third-party libraries and components. (Build process and dependency management files)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the speed of vulnerability patching might depend on community contributions and release cycles.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration of security features by users could lead to vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Zero-day vulnerabilities might exist before being discovered and patched.
  - accepted risk: Security of plugins developed by the community might vary and require careful review.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
  - security control: Establish a formal vulnerability disclosure and response process to handle security issues effectively.
  - security control: Provide comprehensive security documentation and best practices for users to configure and operate APISIX securely.
  - security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring of security-related events for incident detection and response.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential security weaknesses.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Support multiple authentication methods (e.g., API keys, JWT, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect).
    - Requirement: Allow integration with external identity providers.
    - Requirement: Provide mechanisms for secure storage and management of authentication credentials.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement fine-grained authorization policies based on roles, permissions, or attributes.
    - Requirement: Support policy enforcement at the API gateway level.
    - Requirement: Integrate with external authorization services if needed.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all incoming requests to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Sanitize input data to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
    - Requirement: Enforce data type and format validation.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms for data in transit (HTTPS/TLS).
    - Requirement: Support encryption for sensitive data at rest if applicable (e.g., configuration secrets).
    - Requirement: Properly manage and rotate cryptographic keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - API Access and Availability: Ensuring APIs are accessible to authorized users and applications.
  - API Security: Protecting APIs and backend systems from unauthorized access and attacks.
  - Traffic Management: Managing API traffic to ensure performance and prevent overload.
  - Observability: Monitoring API performance and security to detect and respond to issues.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - API Request Data: Potentially sensitive data transmitted in API requests and responses (e.g., user credentials, personal information, transaction details). Sensitivity depends on the specific APIs being managed.
  - Configuration Data: Sensitive configuration data for APISIX and plugins (e.g., API keys, secrets, authentication credentials). High sensitivity.
  - Logs and Metrics: Logs and metrics data may contain sensitive information depending on the configured logging and monitoring levels. Medium to low sensitivity, depending on content.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
