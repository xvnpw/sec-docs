# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/incubator-apisix

## Attack Surface: [Admin API Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/admin_api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication mechanisms protecting the APISIX Admin API, gaining unauthorized administrative control over the gateway.
*   **APISIX Contribution:** APISIX *provides* the Admin API and its authentication mechanisms. Weak default settings or misconfigurations *within APISIX* directly expose this attack surface.
*   **Example:**  Default APISIX Admin API key is used and publicly exposed. An attacker uses this key to access the Admin API and reconfigure routes to redirect traffic to a malicious server, leveraging APISIX's routing capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the APISIX API gateway, allowing attackers to control routing, plugins, and potentially backend services *via APISIX*. Data exfiltration, service disruption, and further attacks on backend systems are possible *through APISIX*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Change Default Admin API Key:** Immediately change the default `admin_key` in APISIX configuration to a strong, randomly generated secret.
    *   **Implement Strong Authentication:** Utilize robust authentication methods *supported by APISIX* for the Admin API, such as mutual TLS (mTLS) or OAuth 2.0, if configured and applicable within APISIX.
    *   **Restrict Admin API Access:** Limit network access to the Admin API *at the network level*, allowing only authorized networks or IP ranges to reach the APISIX Admin API port.
    *   **Regularly Rotate API Keys:** Implement a policy for periodic rotation of Admin API keys *used by APISIX*.

## Attack Surface: [Admin API Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/admin_api_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code or commands into the APISIX Admin API through input fields, exploiting vulnerabilities in input validation and sanitization *within APISIX's Admin API handling*.
*   **APISIX Contribution:** The APISIX Admin API *design* accepts user input for configuration. Insufficient input validation and sanitization *in APISIX's Admin API code* can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload within a route configuration (e.g., in a header value or upstream URL) that, when processed by the APISIX Admin API, results in command execution on the APISIX server *due to a flaw in APISIX's input processing*.
*   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the APISIX server, leading to full system compromise, data breach, and service disruption *originating from a vulnerability in APISIX*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization *within APISIX Admin API code* for all data received. Use whitelisting and parameterized queries where possible *in APISIX's Admin API logic*.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run APISIX processes with minimal necessary privileges *at the OS level* to limit the impact of successful code execution *exploiting an APISIX vulnerability*.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the APISIX Admin API *specifically focusing on input handling and injection points*.
    *   **Keep APISIX Up-to-Date:** Apply security patches and updates for APISIX and its dependencies promptly *to address known vulnerabilities in APISIX code*.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (Core and Custom)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__core_and_custom_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist within APISIX plugins, either core plugins *shipped with APISIX* or custom-developed plugins *intended to extend APISIX functionality*, allowing attackers to bypass security controls or cause other security issues *within the APISIX gateway*.
*   **APISIX Contribution:** APISIX's plugin architecture is *a core feature*. Bugs in plugins, whether *developed by the APISIX project* or by users, directly translate to vulnerabilities in the API gateway *itself*.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a core authentication plugin *provided by APISIX* allows attackers to bypass authentication checks and access protected backend services *routed through APISIX*. Or, a custom plugin developed in Lua *for APISIX* contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited *within the APISIX process*.
*   **Impact:**  Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, data leakage, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution depending on the plugin vulnerability *within the APISIX context*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability and plugin function)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Security Reviews for Custom Plugins:**  Thoroughly review and security test all custom plugins *developed for APISIX* before deployment. Follow secure coding practices for Lua development *in the context of APISIX plugins*.
    *   **Use Official and Well-Maintained Plugins:** Prefer using official, well-maintained core plugins *provided by the APISIX project* or plugins from trusted sources *designed for APISIX*.
    *   **Regularly Update Plugins:** Keep all plugins, both core and custom *used in APISIX*, updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities *in plugin code*.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing and Isolation:** Explore and utilize any available plugin sandboxing or isolation mechanisms *offered by APISIX* to limit the impact of plugin vulnerabilities.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Plugins:** Disable any plugins *within APISIX configuration* that are not actively used to reduce the attack surface *of the APISIX gateway*.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate HTTP requests in a way that causes APISIX and backend server to interpret request boundaries differently, leading to request smuggling and potential bypass of security controls *implemented by APISIX or backend services*.
*   **APISIX Contribution:** As an HTTP proxy, APISIX *parses and forwards* HTTP requests. Vulnerabilities in its HTTP parsing and handling logic *within APISIX* can lead to request smuggling issues, especially when interacting with diverse backend servers *through APISIX*.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP/1.1 request with ambiguous Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. APISIX *due to a parsing flaw* might forward the request, but the backend server interprets it differently, leading to a smuggled request being processed as a separate request, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization checks *intended to be enforced by APISIX or the backend*.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, access to unintended resources, cache poisoning, and potentially remote code execution on backend servers in certain scenarios *due to request smuggling facilitated by APISIX*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use HTTP/2 End-to-End:**  Where possible, use HTTP/2 for communication between clients, APISIX, and backend servers, as HTTP/2 is less susceptible to request smuggling vulnerabilities *compared to HTTP/1.1 handled by APISIX*.
    *   **Strict HTTP Parsing:** Ensure APISIX and backend servers are configured with strict HTTP parsing and reject ambiguous or malformed requests *at both APISIX and backend levels*.
    *   **Normalize Requests:** Implement request normalization *within APISIX* to ensure consistent interpretation of requests by both APISIX and backend servers *when APISIX forwards requests*.
    *   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct security testing specifically for HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities *targeting APISIX and its interaction with backends*.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (OpenResty/Nginx, Lua Libraries)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__openrestynginx__lua_libraries_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in underlying dependencies *used by APISIX*, such as OpenResty/Nginx or Lua libraries, are exploited to compromise APISIX *itself*.
*   **APISIX Contribution:** APISIX *relies on* OpenResty and Lua libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies *directly used by APISIX* impact APISIX's security.
*   **Example:** A known vulnerability is discovered in Nginx's HTTP/2 implementation *which is part of OpenResty used by APISIX*. If the deployed APISIX version uses a vulnerable Nginx version, attackers can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or potentially gain code execution *on the APISIX server*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution, information disclosure, and other security breaches depending on the specific dependency vulnerability *affecting APISIX*.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the vulnerability severity)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update APISIX:** Keep APISIX updated to the latest stable version, which typically includes updated versions of dependencies with security patches *provided by the APISIX project*.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in APISIX's dependencies *as part of APISIX security management*.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases related to OpenResty, Nginx, and Lua to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities *affecting APISIX dependencies*.
    *   **Patch Management:** Establish a robust patch management process to quickly apply security updates for APISIX and its dependencies *released by the APISIX project or upstream projects*.
