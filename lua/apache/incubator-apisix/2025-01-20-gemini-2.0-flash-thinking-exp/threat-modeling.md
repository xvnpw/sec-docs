## Threat: [Route Misconfiguration Leading to Unauthorized Access](./threats/route_misconfiguration_leading_to_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Route Misconfiguration Leading to Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a misconfigured route *within APISIX* to access internal services or data that should be protected. This might involve crafting requests that bypass intended access controls due to incorrect path matching or upstream definitions *in APISIX configuration*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, internal APIs, or administrative interfaces *through APISIX*. Potential data breaches, service disruption, or privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Route` configuration, `Upstream` configuration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement thorough testing of route configurations *in APISIX* before deployment.
        *   Use specific path matching instead of broad wildcards where possible *in APISIX routes*.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege when defining upstream targets *in APISIX*.
        *   Utilize APISIX's built-in authentication and authorization plugins.
        *   Regularly audit route configurations *in APISIX* for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in a Third-Party Plugin](./threats/vulnerability_in_a_third-party_plugin.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerability in a Third-Party Plugin

    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the APISIX instance, potentially leading to control over the gateway and access to backend services *through APISIX*. Data exfiltration, service disruption, or injection of malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Specific third-party `Plugin`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully evaluate the security of third-party plugins before installation *in APISIX*.
        *   Keep third-party plugins updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Monitor plugin repositories and security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and auditing third-party plugin code.
        *   Consider using only officially maintained or well-vetted plugins.

## Threat: [Exploiting a Vulnerability in a Built-in Plugin](./threats/exploiting_a_vulnerability_in_a_built-in_plugin.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting a Vulnerability in a Built-in Plugin
    *   **Description:** An attacker could leverage a security vulnerability present in one of APISIX's built-in plugins. This could allow them to bypass security controls *implemented by the plugin*, gain unauthorized access, or cause denial of service *to APISIX functionality*.
    *   **Impact:**  Circumvention of intended security measures, unauthorized access to resources *managed by APISIX*, or disruption of API gateway functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific built-in `Plugin`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay informed about security advisories and updates for APISIX.
        *   Regularly update APISIX to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully configure built-in plugins, following security best practices.
        *   Disable or remove any built-in plugins that are not actively used.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Storage of Sensitive Configuration Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains access to the APISIX configuration store (etcd) could retrieve sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets used by plugins or upstreams *configured within APISIX*.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to backend systems *proxied by APISIX*, data breaches, or the ability to impersonate legitimate services *through APISIX*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `etcd` (configuration store), `apisix.conf`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the etcd cluster with strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the etcd store if possible.
        *   Limit access to the etcd cluster to only authorized personnel and processes.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive secrets directly in the APISIX configuration files; consider using secret management solutions.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to the APISIX Admin API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_the_apisix_admin_api.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to the APISIX Admin API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the APISIX Admin API, allowing them to modify routes, plugins, upstreams, and other critical configurations *of APISIX*. This could lead to a complete compromise of the API gateway.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the API gateway, enabling attackers to redirect traffic, disable security measures, inject malicious code *into APISIX configurations or plugins*, or exfiltrate data *handled by APISIX*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Admin API`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the Admin API with strong authentication (e.g., API keys, mutual TLS).
        *   Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   Regularly rotate Admin API keys.
        *   Implement robust authorization controls for Admin API endpoints.
        *   Monitor Admin API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion Attacks on APISIX](./threats/resource_exhaustion_attacks_on_apisix.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion Attacks on APISIX
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send a large volume of requests *to APISIX*, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing it to become unavailable, impacting all applications relying on it.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing APIs and applications *through APISIX*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Core` APISIX process, `Worker` processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting at the APISIX level.
        *   Configure connection limits and timeouts *in APISIX*.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Plugin Misconfiguration](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_plugin_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Plugin Misconfiguration
    *   **Description:** If a plugin *within APISIX* is configured to make outbound requests based on user input or internal data without proper validation, an attacker could manipulate these requests to target internal services or external resources that should not be accessible *from the APISIX instance*.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal services, potential data breaches, or the ability to leverage APISIX as a proxy for malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific `Plugin` making outbound requests.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully validate and sanitize any input used to construct outbound requests within plugins.
        *   Restrict the destination of outbound requests to a predefined whitelist of allowed hosts and ports.
        *   Avoid using user-supplied data directly in outbound request URLs.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Update Process](./threats/insecure_plugin_update_process.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Plugin Update Process
