## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit APISIX Core Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_apisix_core_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path involves identifying and exploiting security flaws within the core APISIX codebase.
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the critical step where a known vulnerability is leveraged.
        *   **RCE (Remote Code Execution) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the APISIX server, gaining significant control.
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit flaws to bypass security checks and access protected resources without proper credentials.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit resource exhaustion vulnerabilities to make the APISIX gateway unavailable, disrupting the application.
        *   **Data Injection/Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities to inject malicious data into requests or responses processed by APISIX, potentially impacting backend services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit APISIX Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_apisix_plugin_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting security flaws within the loaded plugins of APISIX.
    *   **Exploit Plugin Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the critical step where a plugin vulnerability is leveraged.
        *   **RCE via Plugin [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in plugins to execute arbitrary code on the APISIX server.
        *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass via Plugin [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit flaws in a plugin's security logic to bypass intended access controls.
        *   **Data Leakage via Plugin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in plugins to expose sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit APISIX Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_apisix_misconfiguration__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path involves leveraging errors in the configuration of APISIX.
    *   **Leverage Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the critical step where an identified misconfiguration is exploited.
        *   **Insecure Default Settings [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit APISIX deployments using weak or default credentials and configurations.
        *   **Improper Route Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit incorrectly configured routes to gain unauthorized access to backend services.
        *   **Exposed Admin API [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit situations where the APISIX Admin API is accessible without proper authentication, granting full control.
        *   **Insecure Plugin Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit plugins configured in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Control Plane Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_control_plane_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying control plane of APISIX (e.g., etcd).
    *   **Exploit Control Plane Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the critical step where a control plane vulnerability is leveraged.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Control Plane [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the control plane components, allowing direct manipulation of APISIX configuration.
        *   **Data Manipulation in Control Plane [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers modify configuration data within the control plane to inject malicious settings.
